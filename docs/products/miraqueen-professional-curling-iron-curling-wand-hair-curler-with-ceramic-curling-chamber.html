            <li>Good thing was that it did not burn her hair.</li>
            <li>With a display to see the temperature, she takes good care of her</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked this good.</li>
            <li>Even though, she kept telling me she loved it and</li>
            <li>it is good to use.</li>
            <li>according to my lady, it does what it needs to do really good too.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, great temperature settings, and a nice design.  </li>

            <li>I took mine to the office to show the gals - they all loved it.....</li>

            <li>This curling iron makes me look good</li>
            <li>fairly well.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m the girl who can&#x27;t keep good looking curls in her hair at all.</li>
            <li>loved it immediately</li>

            <li>Hair looks good when your done though.</li>
            <li>I purchased this one and totally loved it.</li>
            <li>I have always loved Shirley Temple Curls.</li>
            <li>And you&#x27;ll get a good arm workout holding it....</li>
            <li>I have now lent the curler to my friend because she loved my results.</li>
            <li>You get a comfy hold and good positioning but it is kinda bulky</li>
            <li>So I was really excited to try a product that promised to give me perfect curls with zero skills or effort.</li>
            <li>She has been using this curling iron for about 2 weeks and its working perfect on her hair ( she looks HOT lol ).&lt;br</li>
            <li>this worked beautifully and i love it.  </li>
            <li>beautiful but TOP quality.  </li>
            <li>We used it for a photo shoot and the make-up gal was very pleased with its results as well as ease of use and timely results--the models loved it as well.  </li>
            <li>It gives me the most beautiful beach waves and its holds for 2 days.</li>
            <li>Oh and lets not talk about how quick it takes to make the perfect curl.</li>
            <li>Magnificent device, it heats up rather quick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, works well, and best of all, it has a timer!</li>
            <li>Quick curling and great results!  </li>
            <li>The timer/heat settings are awesome, and the rotation option for the direction of curl is super rad.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I found that using it on thinner strands gives you the best results for tighter curl and bigger sections is best for a more uniform wave.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t know if it was my luck or what, but the Miraqueen was the first curling iron I&#x27;ve purchased, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I even slept in my curls and woke up with them still mostly in tact!</li>
            <li>I glad I did!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than a curling wand!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>her hair looks really cute!</li>
            <li>Omg I love this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, it&#x27;s safe!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>

            <li>I wanted to look nice for the family outing</li>
            <li>This really is the best Curling Iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on so many good reviews</li>
            <li>I be loving the curls that comes out of this baby.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to know I can fiddle with the temperature and get the job done</li>
            <li>This is a really nice</li>
            <li>Nice Product</li>
            <li>and I am so thrilled with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And for those who already pride themselves as nice looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of at a loss as to snag.  </li>
            <li>I curled my hair so fast and curls were so perfect and identical!!)</li>
            <li>Loving this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>The automatic timers comes in handy.</li>
            <li>Is is such a great product and a wonderful brand that every woman needs to get at home</li>
            <li>I like the many good things that were being said about this product.</li>
            <li>I liked the automatic curling and the beep that lets you know when to release your hair.</li>
            <li>She told me that she purchased her own Miraqueen Curling iron</li>
            <li>This is a nice curling iron with a lot of features.  </li>
            <li>but there was still a nice wave there.  </li>
            <li>– I don’t know the details, just took her word on it, because I don’t know how to use this kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>so she doesn&#x27;t want to buy something of her own</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice that she can use this product as well since it has a variety of temperature settings.</li>
            <li>I never seen my wife hair so curly and nice.</li>
            <li>Once you own one you will see what I am talking about.</li>
            <li>A curl chamber gently draws the hair in and heats it from all directions to form a perfect curl</li>
            <li>and it was nice to have something prettier</li>
            <li>Cord wraps up nicely and velcros.</li>
            <li>This product exceeded my expectations so much that I just have to let anyone know how wonderful it is if they are hesitant to spend the money.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it has not happened to me yet.</li>
            <li>Just setting expectations for what kind of hair skill person I am.  </li>
            <li>This curler is one of a kind.</li>
            <li>This product is one of a kind.</li>
            <li>The handle of the curler itself includes an LCD display so you can see what settings you&#x27;re working with, which I think is a really nice feature considering all the bells and whistles that are included.    </li>
            <li>and I was kind of bummed out.</li>
            <li>Plus it has an LCD screen which I’ve never seen before on a hair tool, so that was nice.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even wrap your hair around the wand; the device allows your hair to enter a chamber and it curls on its own, which is another benefit.</li>
            <li>My honest opinion?</li>
            <li>The handy LCD screen displays the timer setting, temperature, and curl</li>
            <li>But honestly, this thing is fool-proof.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty good with a curling iron although I was intrigued by the perfect, easy curls</li>
            <li>and this was perfect for me, i was able to turn up the strength to the right temperature to allow hair to maintain it&#x27;s curls.</li>
            <li>I was super impressed with how easy it was and</li>
            <li>Great purchase, and worth the money!</li>
            <li>worth the $$!!!</li>
            <li>I love this still trying to play with it but first 2 times I have used it worked awesome!!</li>
            <li>I have always been good with makeup, and did my own for my wedding, but hair has never been my strong area.  </li>
            <li>great features packed into one cool tool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on both freshly washed and unwashed hair and it works beautifully either way.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this amazing product!!</li>
            <li>she is always posting new pictures of herself, its really awesome</li>

            <li>handy LCD screen displays the timer setting, temperature, and curl direction is so easy and safe.</li>
            <li>It is fairly easy to use and is by far the best hair investment that I have made this year.</li>
            <li>Quick fast and in a hurry to wonderful curls!</li>
            <li>This is personally my favorite feature, and a very thoughtful one at that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even with zero product, this amazing contraption leaves my hair with perfect curls every single time.</li>
            <li>After letting it heat up completely I decided to be brave and try it on my hair and the results were absolutely stunning!</li>
            <li>With this smart design Miraqueen has applied smart, effective (and beautiful!)</li>
            <li>It was super easy to use and the curl honestly lasted all day!</li>
            <li>also a huge fan of the auto shut-off, as is my family!</li>
            <li>I must say that I do love the sleek design and color</li>
            <li>and I am fairly pleased.</li>
            <li>There are so many possibilities with this tool.</li>
            <li>I will be buying a couple of these for Christmas gifts, for sure.</li>
            <li>To preface I want to say that I have NEVER been able to figure out curling irons or wands.</li>
            <li>My favorite part was that it automatically curls your hair for you</li>
            <li>I use this product several times a week and am amazed at how awesome my hair looks each time!</li>
            <li>best part is the curls last all day!You won&#x27;t have to load up on hair spray which is something</li>
            <li>I find that with Miraqueen curling iron I am able to curl my hair with one hand</li>
            <li>The results have been stunning.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It feels like I am now able to get about 15 more minutes of sleep in the morning since I got this.  </li>
            <li>I even think her dad will be able to curl her hair.  </li>
            <li>The sale price makes it all the more a &#x27;must have&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Overall she seems to be very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Also if you pull and put pressure on it while using it your hair will be more straightened than curled.</li>
            <li>My husband even commented on how I had sexy bed head</li>
            <li>(I watched the videos many time before attempting).  </li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>She looked fabulous!</li>
            <li>The results were as fabulous as my  friend&#x27;s !</li>
            <li>It is exactly, what a fun loving woman like me needs to stay beautiful all through the day and all through the night.</li>
            <li>I love the auto power off</li>
            <li>All i could say was YESSSSS :-)</li>
            <li>Ladies and gents if your looking for your next best friend than this is it!</li>
            <li>A foam layer on the top of the heading chamber helps to prevent any burns to the skin.</li>
            <li>Love this curler.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many curling irons before</li>
            <li>I like being creative with my curls now</li>
            <li>This was not the brand she wanted; she wanted the Conair Brand, Infiniti Pro; however I thought this was a better curling Iron as it will roll in both directions and heats to 450.</li>
            <li>Most of my friends are jealous and some even want to pay me to do their hair.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Just love.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it automatically shuts off, and has a led screen that tells me what way</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>so I absolutely love the automatic one-hour shut off feature</li>
            <li>Thank you Miraqueen! :)</li>
            <li>She was able to get both girls&#x27; hair curled in about 15 min.  </li>
            <li>cuz it happens, but I&#x27;m sure once I learn more about it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking its because she&#x27;s knows how great she&#x27;s looking a whole lot sooner.</li>
            <li>Ladies you&#x27;ll love the ease of use and the speed at which it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>&gt; One of the parts I love about this iron (despite the finished product it gives me) is the LCD screen that displays the temperature, timer and status of the curls.</li>
            <li>I love that this curler took the “work” out of having to do my hair and left me with perfectly sculpted curls!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was even able to get some of my friends to purchase the curling iron as well.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>My favorite this curling iron.</li>
            <li>satisfied in this result.</li>
            <li>I love this curling machine.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to put your hair in correctly or it may get tangled and stuck.</li>
            <li>She said this is the most reliable curler shes ever purchased.    </li>

            <li>I love the setting options.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t create those kinks at the end of the curl.</li>
            <li>It is a more formal look for me</li>
            <li>My favorite part of this curling wand is the chamber.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on my hair and people ask who did it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I could have gone around all day with the curly hairdo if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;.Rubber protector ensures your skin is a safe distance away from the heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so glad I got this.</li>
            <li>grand daughter loves this</li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend can&#x27;t stop telling me how cute I looked and kept playing with my curls.</li>
            <li>I got it, used it, and love it.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I think they worked better for cheer hair ringlets.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>none of which worked.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to tell you that I LOVE this curling iron.</li>
            <li>(so I just love that safety</li>
            <li>In love with this..great price.</li>
            <li>Fabulous hair that she is thrilled about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad this curling iron was recommended to me.</li>
            <li>I can now be confident my curls will hold throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you brush every strand you insert into the curling iron.</li>
            <li>What can I say - I absolutely LOVE this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Its ceramic technology protects your hair from damage, and you’ll love the 3 heat levels and 4 timer settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m</li>
            <li>Glad I went with my instinct and bought it.</li>
            <li>I pride myself for always getting a valuable gift for my wife because she is such a wonderful woman.</li>
            <li>Your curling iron has transformed my wife into a sexy siren.</li>
            <li>You will love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>This Miraqueen I just received and I love it.</li>
            <li>Not only will I be keeping this wand, but I will be telling people how awesome it is!</li>
            <li>The item shipped and I received it two days of ordering from Amazon which is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I love curling my hair and went ahead and purchased this the Miraqueen iron.</li>
            <li>I know they will love it just like I did.</li>
            <li>because I know they will love it.</li>
            <li>The feature that was prominent to me was the diversity in the amount of control</li>
            <li>When styling my hair, I was able to alter the temperature, curl direction, time, and styling blocks.</li>
            <li>This resulted in a much more preferred and satisfied result of my curls.</li>
            <li>Not once have I burnt myself with this iron, and that makes the experience all the better with this added sense of security.</li>
            <li>also thinks that the LED display is quite innovative as it allows you to see the temperature, curling direction, and</li>
            <li>love this product, I can&#x27;t believe the difference a curling iron makes</li>
            <li>so even if I am able to get it to curl, the curls do not stay in.</li>
            <li>Well, I am glad that I took the chance.</li>
            <li>also love the ceramic technology at work in this product.</li>
            <li>It is almost like magic - you have to see it to believe it.</li>
            <li>I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>I love my curls that MiraQueen gives me.</li>
            <li>I love this curling tool.  </li>
            <li>But my favorite feature is the auto turn off,</li>
            <li>love that this has 3 heat settings and 4 timer settings</li>
            <li>make sure you brush out any tangles.</li>
            <li>the section is the tighter and more ringlet like the curl will be.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the LED-screen displays and timers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>but I was able to get it undone, so be ware of that.  </li>
            <li>instead I am enjoying this part of my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li>Despite this, I love to have shiny, bombshell curls in my hair.</li>
            <li>I also travel to see my family in Germany a lot and love that this is dual voltage.</li>
            <li>find that I am able to curl my hair with one hand</li>
            <li>OK..</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The curling iron also has a chamber for the hair, making sure that my hair doesn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron also has 3 heat settings depending on your hair health.</li>
            <li>I love this because I can control use the one that is for dyed hair (370 degrees)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Functionally, I love the swivel cord because it makes it convenient to move.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s makes my hair look quite healthy</li>
            <li>And it gets easier the more</li>
            <li>So the design of this is better from that perspective.</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t on Amazon any more.</li>
            <li>She also mentioned the rubber protector which keeps her skin at a safe distance.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER been able to get my hair to hold any curl for longer than maybe an hour....</li>
            <li>it is simply the best curling iron I have ever owned/used.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Maybe a sure thing for women with thicker hair.</li>
            <li>Love the timing settings and audible beeps on this curler.</li>
            <li>I was impressed that the manufacturer put the actual temperature of the iron on the control panel.</li>
            <li>But I love it.</li>
            <li>I seriously love this product.</li>
            <li>I have dyed it and relaxed it many times.</li>
            <li>I really love how it has a timer on it to tell me when to release the iron.</li>
            <li>My most favorite part of the product is it keeps me from burning my scalp and fingers.</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen is a simple one, with many,many awesome features.  </li>
            <li>If used properly, it does a great job!</li>
            <li>I have used this so many times</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>so that makes me like it even more.</li>
            <li>I wasn’t too sure what to make of it as I have never seen a curling iron that looked quite like this.  </li>
            <li>My hair is in love with this curling iron.</li>
            <li>I know what you will love it too.</li>
            <li>I ordered this  curling iron in August and have been in love with it ever since.</li>
            <li>So a product like this is invaluable to the lovely ladies in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that I do not have to spend two hours in the morning doing my hair.</li>
            <li>Medium length hair also works better.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to section hair and work from the bottom up.  </li>
            <li>Even better is auto shutoff.  </li>
            <li>I love my Miraqueen pro curling iron.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this curler.</li>
            <li>I love the rubberized layer.  </li>
            <li>So impressive and the curls actually stay</li>
            <li>It has many features for safety including the rubber protector and isolated heat to prevent me from burning myself.</li>
            <li>The cord swivels so that it does not get rolled up and tangled like most curling irons.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t user error.  </li>
            <li>(Plus- I wanted to make sure I&#x27;d have a thoroughly written product review.)  </li>
            <li>The end section of hair was the only part that came out looking perfect.  </li>
            <li>But after using this Miraqueen, I&#x27;ll probably curl it more.</li>
            <li>More like a purple/pink but</li>
            <li>my favorite colors so love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I would call it the &#x27;All In One&#x27; hair curler, because it does so much more.</li>
            <li>I found this product by accident, bought it on a whim and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>A timer which is used to make sure you don’t overdo it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I swear, the ceramic chambers and padding makes my hair seem healthier, bouncier and more lustrous.</li>
            <li>Well I bought this as a gift for my grand daughter and she was speechless because she didn&#x27;t think I would buy her something like this for her birthday.</li>
            <li>I love my grand daughter and her mother</li>
            <li>Surely it won&#x27;t work that</li>
            <li>The materials are top notch.</li>
            <li>I seriously love this curler.</li>
            <li>This is the most magical hair styling device ever.</li>
            <li>The curling iron is so safe there is no way of burning your self.  </li>
            <li>You can switch up the direction of the curl for more texture and volume.  </li>
            <li>There are so many features that I have never seen on another curler before</li>
            <li>My favorite feature has to be the curl direction.</li>
            <li>This made the perfect gift for our teenage niece.  </li>
            <li>Im glad I stumbled across this hair curler.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The combination of the timer, the rubber/foam protections and the different array of settings makes this the best curling iron I have ever laid my hands on.</li>
            <li>I was able to spiral curl my hair for Thanksgiving</li>
            <li>what better way to know if I want one?</li>
            <li>But I love to have curls, it give volumes to my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>but I received this as a gift I love love love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that I can pick between types of curls to change things up</li>
            <li>This allows the user to create the perfect curl, and from my personal experience, I could not be happier with the price and performance.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you leave it on for the 12 seconds it is better than doing 10, for me anyways.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This must-have Curling wand works on all hair textures and types to create a stunning curl with a glossy finish.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this item is that it is made of ceramic.</li>
            <li>Okay okay</li>
            <li>okay, so I know you have seen something like this</li>
            <li>Its awesome, I can not tell you enough.</li>
            <li>Try it and love it.</li>
            <li>So here&#x27;s what I love about it and what works for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this curler.</li>
            <li>Love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Curling Iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad he did.  </li>
            <li>Any more than that seems to get caught, which has happened to me, but infrequently.  </li>
            <li>This one is a much better deal for what you pay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid double this price for curlers that were nothing as great as this!</li>
            <li>I love this device.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the better curling irons my friend had used.</li>
            <li>Fantastic tool!</li>
            <li>I really love this thing.</li>
            <li>I was able to use this immediately just by having watched the video posted on it.  </li>
            <li>I also must admit that if it involves much more skill than putting my hair in a pony tail (which is my look 99% of the time) I&#x27;m all thumbs.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>One more thing, I was a bit hesitant on this one just because it was cheaper than the perhaps the more well known brands</li>
            <li>and so glad to have it.</li>
            <li>Most of my life I&#x27;ve been blessed with &amp;#34;wash and</li>
            <li>I was able to get the look I was going for by doing it the night before with no hairspray, medium heat/timing, and combing out in the morning to soften.  </li>
            <li>I did find that I needed to use the medium heat and longer time setting for the bottom section and shorter time setting for the top section/layers to keep it non-poodle-esque.  </li>
            <li>Watch some youtube videos (even if they are for the conair pro or babybliss) for more tips or tricks</li>
            <li>I love this product and I get lots of compliments when I use it</li>
            <li>I waited to make sure it was &amp;#34;completely&amp;#34; warmed up, it beeped to indicate that it was.</li>
            <li>I even made sure I had it plugged in to a power source that had the required amount of voltage needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to add a comment after I&#x27;ve used this so many times.</li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>BUT I did have to make sure my hair was blown out already so I could obtain the silky look that I like.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>the prospect of that made me more determined.</li>
            <li>Okay I am guy</li>
            <li>but I bought this for my wife and we BOTH absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>okay)</li>
            <li>My mother even let my eight-year-old sister use it, because it was so safe.</li>
            <li>Now I never have to worry about how my hair looks, or being able to style it or change it up.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid double this price for curlers that were nothing as great as this!</li>
            <li>Gifted this to my girlfriend</li>
            <li>I am so glad it turned out to be such a great value!</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a great product!</li>
            <li>I love all the features.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the automatic shut off.</li>
            <li>I also love that it protects my hair from damage.</li>
            <li>In all my 65 years, I have never been able to keep a curl in my hair for longer than 10 minutes ....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>The curl held much better without any gel or mousse.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I love the reverse feature</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li>Found this interesting thing and got it for the sake of upgrading.</li>
            <li>find that I am able to curl my hair with one hand</li>
            <li>If you read review, hopefully you understand better.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s when my hair got caught most of the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;What is even better?</li>
            <li>three favorite features of the Miraqueen Curling Iron (besides the fact that it WORKS) would have to be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the holidays just around the corner, this item is the perfect gift for any female any age in your life.</li>
            <li>She had been needing a curling iron for a while, and this one had several great reviews, and for good reason.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s brought my Megan. :)</li>
            <li>I have tried all three timers and love how my hair turns out no matter</li>
            <li>I love love</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair has more body, and I get compliments everywhere</li>
            <li>and I really enjoying it.</li>
            <li>I am able to straighten my hair faster than ever&lt;</li>
            <li>I love that the design ensures you don&#x27;t get dents in your hair, whether you are going for a sleek look, flip or bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get home to use it again. :-)</li>
            <li>If you have an Amazon Prime account, the savings is even better.</li>
            <li>also love the way the Miraqueen works.  </li>
            <li>but I love</li>
            <li>We have already ordered 3 more to give to family members for Christmas.</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen Professional curling iron is a great and amazing gift for any women in your life.</li>
            <li>love the LCD monitor.</li>
            <li>protection integrated with this curler was even better than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I honestly did not see how important the safety features were until I was using it.</li>
            <li>automatic curling, the beep notification to let you know that the curler is ready as well as the three timer settings were also great features.</li>
            <li>She is completely satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li>Well, most things curl it, it just falls out almost immediately.</li>
            <li>but I was able to get out no problem</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really create a great curl.</li>
            <li>anyhow, I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase and will recommend to anyone that is looking for full, shiny and bouncy curls :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The temperature control is done very well and it ensures that the right temperature is achieved for the perfect curling.</li>
            <li>Have a New Year’s resolution for beautiful, bouncy and curly hair?</li>

            <li>And you&#x27;ll beable to curl your hair sooo much faster!!!!</li>
            <li>However, when she tried it she was very excited and said she would keep it and use it.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say that we have been very happy with this purchase; yes I say “we” because I live by Rule #1 – Happy wife, happy life!</li>

            <li>Easy and safe to use for all with a dynamic incorporation of ceramic heating chambers and safety pads to keep you and your hair at your best.</li>
            <li>Just one suggestion, it will be great product, if the roll size could adjustable( the curl make me look older).</li>
            <li>safety features are also great, because I don&#x27;t use an iron all the time I am highly prone to not shutting it off.</li>

            <li>Upon first use, I wasn&#x27;t expecting good results.</li>
            <li>The curls looked good at first</li>

            <li>As for myself, I noticed that it shuts off on its own if not in use, which is great since my wife will often forget she left her iron on.</li>
            <li>that allowing you to adjust your curl from looser and more wavy to tighter, more precise curls)</li>

            <li>My hair looks absolutely stunning and it is full of bounce after I am finished working my magic with the Miraqueen.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature would have to be the LCD which shows the timer and temperature, which is important</li>

            <li>The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is a simply amazing product!</li>
            <li>Amazing curler, works just like the miracurl from Babybliss but so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>I was able to curl my whole head in about 20 minutes on my first try and it looked amazing!  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research and almost bought the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; more popular brand...until I read the reviews and started reading about hair catching on fire, big bald spots because the hair wouldn&#x27;t come out of the curler,</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the amazing controls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The split-end damage that I typically experienced with regular curling irons is greatly reduced because it’s a professional level curling iron made with ceramic, which my stylist told me protects the hair from damage.</li>
            <li>The number of adjustments is amazing - adjust the heat to exactly what works for your hair...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, which I&#x27;d have thought would be easy to curl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She first told me how nice the swivel was to avoid getting tangles and tripped up by cords like units she used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first tried it from the bottom of my hair and it took maybe 5 inches, it curled nice though.</li>
            <li>With the Miraqueen I get beautiful, bouncy, and shiny curls that last.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful curls, and three different sizes!!</li>
            <li>However, the rubber layers and cool plastic assist in keeping your limbs safe.</li>
            <li>of the best features about these, I think, is the fact that they’re ceramic, so it won’t heat damage your hair any more than necessary, and it leaves it really shiny instead of frizzy like the Babyliss one my friend has at her house.</li>
            <li>and it takes me between 30-45 minutes to get beautiful curls that LAST.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, and the color is nice.</li>
            <li>I always have perfect curls and I am able to reproduce those curls for my whole entire head of hair.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks when it&#x27;s curled but with all the time curling my full head of hair takes, it is often too time-consuming to do.</li>
            <li>I always have perfect curls and I am able to reproduce those curls for my whole entire head of hair.</li>
            <li>The curls are not the same as you would see from a barrel curling iron but still beautiful.</li>
            <li>But the curls last all day and look so beautiful.  </li>

            <li>huge dissapointment.</li>
            <li>I have a huge event coming up in October</li>
            <li>That comes in handy because it makes it look more natural.</li>
            <li>and I can see if the hair got caught in one of those, it could be a huge problem.</li>
            <li>I can happily say that as I write this review, not only does my hair look fabulous, but it didn&#x27;t cost me an arm and a leg to make it happen.</li>
            <li>It was a huge pain in the butt</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is made of ceramic, which is a huge benefit for me.  </li>
            <li>I have so many curling irons, from professional to ones I picked up at target, but this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>The auto off feature is a huge plus for me because I always forget to turn my appliances off for some reason.</li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t realize how important that is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy I got it never have to struggle again with traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I know absolutely nothing abut curling irons, but I&#x27;m leaving this review because every time I see my wife curl her her since I&#x27;ve gotten this for her, she has used this.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s the ceramic that really makes the difference, honestly.</li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s great that she is actually using something i brought her</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a great curling iron</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic curler.  </li>
            <li>The Rapid Beeping Sound that tells you when to start and when to stop.</li>
            <li>Fortunately it broke 5 minutes into using it</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and gives me an AMAZING curl...</li>
            <li>This curling iron has so many useful features, I&#x27;ve been in awe of it since I got</li>
            <li>The multiple settings are great too</li>
            <li>Once I explained how the timer settings worked she found it even more useful.</li>
            <li>sleek and useful design is also a favorite.</li>
            <li>After trying it on my own hair though, I’m really hooked.</li>
            <li>, well this curling iron did not make a sound and made my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on the current price and the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Took me about 10 minutes to free it.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the mulch-directional setting that lets me change the direction of my curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was light weight</li>
            <li>so i was free to move around with it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>After much research and debate, I chose to purchase this amazing curling iron.</li>
            <li>this one hadn&#x27;t had such great reviews, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have even tried another curling iron.</li>
            <li>You will welcome those extra admiring glances!</li>
            <li>I got this curling wand to help with my niece&#x27;s hair during pageants and I cannot say enough great things about it.  </li>
            <li>Probably a great product for teenagers and younger adults.  </li>
            <li>And it’s also a fantastic gift idea for both teens and adults.  </li>
            <li>used to struggle with cheap devices that burned my skin and often destroyed the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>You can set the temperature you wish to use in setting, which is great because I found how the different temperatures set my hair</li>
            <li>The ceramic tourmaline helps to keep moisture in my hair and it insures smooth gliding so my hair does not get jagged and damaged.</li>
            <li>a few months ago she was very happy.</li>
            <li>Overall, great curler for teens!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But it also comes at a great price for what it can do and my girlfriend never looked back ever since she started using this one.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the neat design of symmetry that makes you feel powerful just to have it in your hand.</li>
            <li>Miraqueen curling iron not only gives me great curls</li>
            <li>It has an auto-off feature that many will find useful.</li>
            <li>Although this iron looks a bit chunky, the handle is of a comfortable size.</li>
            <li>Keep hair smooth as you put it into the curler.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>comfortable--</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic device.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, I&#x27;m a very low-key kind of girl.</li>
            <li>This is important because I work full-time</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough great things about this.</li>
            <li>This was a fantastic purchase.  </li>
            <li>I prepped the hair with the curl prep spray, dried thoroughly, and just grabbed about a 1 inch section of hair, set the curler to 450 and used the setting for 10 seconds and got a perfect curl!  </li>
            <li>comfortable--</li>
            <li>Then don&#x27;t hesitate to try this fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I bought this on the recommendation of a friend whose hair always looks fantastic, and she insisted it was something I could handle myself.    </li>
            <li>I use it almost every day now, and it&#x27;s so much more fun using the Miraqueen to get those devil-</li>
            <li>I enjoy the mulch-directional setting that lets me change the direction of my curls.</li>
            <li>Made cheaply, mine didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li>I had a drawer filled with curling irons until I bought this product.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It made great looking curls that last all day!  </li>
            <li>There’s also a swivel cord so you can move about freely while you’re curling your hair.</li>
            <li>You get the precise information on the heat as well as time you need to curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a Miraqueen Professional to my mom as a gift, and she loved it.</li>
            <li>and they last a good 3 days or more if I don&#x27;t wash my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much for such an awesome product.</li>
            <li>I habe been looking and reading about it for so long, watching videos too, that if you FOLLOW DIRECTIONS it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>This does not damage my hair, is super easy and convenient and easy to use, and I always achieve the desired curls that I had in mind.</li>
            <li>Yes, the second day was a bit more of a relaxed curl, but it still looked good.</li>
            <li>It is not only effective at giving great curls, but its FAST.</li>
            <li>If you have straight hair and dream of perfect curls - definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li>I love this machine and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, and I believe that it should be used more by many others.</li>
            <li>An incident where my hair was nearly toasted almost put me off curling irons for good.</li>
            <li>A good friend recommended the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li>thus far, I enjoy writing reviews about all products I loved after purchasing.</li>
            <li>The ease at which she is able to create gorgeous curls is 2nd to none.</li>
            <li>curling wand is SUPER EASY to easy.</li>
            <li>If you let it go to the end , you get super tight locks perfect for styling how you want and its really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The way you can easily adjust the tightness of the curls, the lack of additional damage to the hair, the perfect curl every time with very little effort.  </li>
            <li>It lasted longer than what I was used to which is awesome and what was also cool is that the Mariqueen does not damage my hair like my previous irons, which means I can style my hair as often as I want.</li>
            <li>this iron is more capable of making flawless curls than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I got it for her on our anniversary (along with other things lol) and she loved it so much.</li>
            <li>And there is a timer for your curls to make sure you leave your hair in the chamber the right amount of time for the curl</li>
            <li>This is my new best friend and I highly recommend this to anyone serious about getting the best curls they can get.</li>
            <li>(many of others I found don&#x27;t have this feature which is great for unexperienced people like me).&lt;br /&gt;Also, its pink!</li>
            <li>That makes styling my hair so much easier!!!  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely LOVES it!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s consistent!!</li>
            <li>It really does work well!!!  </li>
            <li>However I was surprised and happy to find that this miraqueen produced perfect curls in my freshly washed and blow dried hair!  </li>
            <li>The wand is super safe and comes with a quick release trigger to avoid disaster.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for your girl teens and wives that are into looking cute :-)</li>
            <li>The high 450º temperature that the Miraqueen curling iron achieves allows her hair to stay perfect the entire day and night.</li>
            <li>Everything went very smoothly and this was just my first time use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of you out there who, like me, aren’t exactly the most functional person in the morning, the safety features are a huge advantage of the Miraqueen Curing Iron.</li>
            <li>I had purchased one of these curling iron for my girlfriend birthday, 2 months ago, and I have ever since gotten some pretty good compliments on how much she loves this thing.</li>
            <li>Also super easy to use.</li>
            <li>The first is the technology that they included in both safety and most importantly, hair health.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another compelling featureI really enjoy is the 360-degree swivel cord, which helps to keep from becoming tangled while styling your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use which as a mom of 2 babies</li>
            <li>This curling iron is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone, professionals to amateurs like myself because it&#x27;s so quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to go so far as to say it has changed my life, but its pretty damn great.</li>
            <li>This made it really easy to curl my hair in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready, way better then the cheap one I used to use :D!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it is quick, easy, and literally does all the work for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy to use</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair, and this thing works great!</li>
            <li>It was quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The LCD monitor is wonderful for her to be able to see when it ready to use rather than the guess and check method she had to use with her previous curling iron.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!!! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and has a temperature control panel and a LCD screen that I found very convenient.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a tool that is consistent, easy to use, and gives you an amazing (and lasting) curl - this is my top recommendation!  </li>
            <li>Best of all, you&#x27;re able to create TONS of different hair styles with this, form super super curly so nice loose beach waves!</li>
            <li>She had been reading up on the products, and liked the porcelain chamber and the high heat.  </li>
            <li>Some cool features I enjoyed right away.</li>
            <li>It was great for my daughter because her hair is always hanging, from dry and damaged to smooth and silky, so the 3 temperature settings helps her not burn her hair.</li>
            <li>i blow dry my hair and then use this wonderful curler,and i have used this for months its very durable..great product</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is only one word for this product, AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Her curls last all day and the waves also look amazing!</li>
            <li>I needed an original idea to buy for my wife for her birthday.</li>
            <li>gives you any option you could possibly need in the most functional setup possible for perfect curls.</li>
            <li>must say I am not disappointed with this curling.</li>
            <li>My daughters comments were &amp;#34;it works; I&#x27;m just going to have to get use to using it as I was familiar with the Conair (she has been using a friends Infiniti Pro).</li>
            <li>and my thumb started to hurt, but it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li>This is the first curling iron I have bought in many years as my hair will not hold a curl.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>, I almost cried I was so excited.</li>
            <li>and I have a lot of fun with this!  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>The iron will also reverse directions, which is a great feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is versatility in the curls that you can get, depending on how long your hair is in the iron.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this curling iron.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this in the mail</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>I love this curling wand it makes realy pretty curls.</li>
            <li>This morning, for the first time in my life, I was able to curl my hair (and not just the front of my hair) without assistance.  </li>
            <li>My curls are bouncy, frizz free, and full of volume.</li>
            <li>Worth trying!</li>
            <li>This curling iron is so unique.</li>
            <li>and I tried many different brand names but this curling iron has always produced the best results for me, and I have had my hair at various lengths over the years.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>but I think am still doing pretty fine with my super curls that looks so cute</li>
            <li>I was able to curl my hair and not have to use a whole can of hair spray!  </li>
            <li>However this drastically decreases the time I need to spend because it can fit the full length of my hair in just one go.</li>
            <li>BUT WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>How unique and functional this was.  </li>
            <li>Then I was gifted this for Christmas, and it did exactly what you hoped it would.</li>
            <li>Works best with small stands of hair.</li>
            <li>and I got perfect curls the first time, and even using the smaller chunks of hair as recommended, I was finished in 35 mins which was very satisfactory in time savings!</li>
            <li>curls are frizz free, bouncy and full of volume.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing about the curling iron is that it doesn&#x27;t get insanely hot so it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li>Stronger and more resistant, set it higher.</li>
            <li>Within straightening the first bit of my hair, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited that I tried it immediately.  </li>
            <li>I was way too excited to wait</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair, and have spend hundreds of dollars on hair products that did not work.  </li>
            <li>and I have received a lot of nice remarks on my new hair style.  </li>
            <li>Its honestly like my new toy, my kids are like &amp;#34;c&#x27;mon</li>
            <li>The curls are clean looking and they last!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen professional curling iron is DEFINITELY one of the BEST professional-grade curling irons on the market!</li>
            <li>The screen that tells you everything you need to know and the trigger are what makes it so easy to use and so worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt; Never before have I had such consistent and beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>I love the automatic features I almost always use this one because it gives it more of a natural look, as opposed to the &amp;#34;curling iron&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is far and above the best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>but once again, it came easy to me and these things rarely do.</li>
            <li>Granted, I used a bit of hair spray this time, but the results were still very different from what I&#x27;ve ever been able to get with any tool of this kind.</li>
            <li>she said it was easy and fun to use.</li>
            <li>Well my experience with the miraqueen professional curling iron has been nothing short of incredible!</li>
            <li>Makes doing my hair super quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>So fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>There are so many things to love about the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this iron not for my own lovely locks, but because my girlfriend had been using the same junky one for years now.</li>
            <li>I have been a hairstylist for years and, in my personal and professional opinion,  this iron is wonderful</li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is smooth and that you don&#x27;t load too much hair in the chamber as it will get stuck.  </li>
            <li>She loves how quickly and accurately it works.</li>
            <li>I think if you have straight hair without any fuzz you my enjoy this product more than me.</li>
            <li>I adore while still looking neat and clean.</li>
            <li>All in all, the women in my house agree that the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is the solution for perfect curls that last all day.</li>
            <li>that I haven&#x27;t actually had to curl my own hair with it most of the time.</li>
            <li>However, having read a few reputable reviews, I made the leap and bought this at a great price.</li>
            <li>I love it its super easy and fast.</li>
            <li>I was nervous about this because it honestly seemed a little too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Overall this curler was so easy to use, very comfortable to use, and it performs better than expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not normally review products, but this was so great</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and shiny after using this curling iron and I love it!</li>
            <li>I get burned every time I use a curling iron but with Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, it is Amazingly Safe!</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is absolutely phenomenal!</li>
            <li>I curl the top first while the bottom section is tied out of the way with a hair tie then gently clip the curled top section and curl the bottom.  </li>
            <li>The LCD screen is so easy to read and this curling iron has three heat levels and the timer insures you get the right curl every time.</li>
            <li>I was actually scared she wouldn&#x27;t like since I do not know much about these things, but she loved it!</li>
            <li>From the day I received it my hair change the style from straight to curly completely, it so easy and fun using this iron , love it.</li>
            <li>As such, this is a great tool to have around as it makes curling  hair easy and fast in the mornings.</li>
            <li>The best part is this is really affordable compared to a lot of the other ones on the market today.</li>
            <li>From the day I received it my hair change the style frome straight to curly completely, it so easy and fun using this iron , love it, wish it will never break.</li>
            <li>The second curler setting on its own is the medium setting which I also prefer for very good formal events such as weddings, book dedications and most times when I am getting a new award.</li>
            <li>While it is large and cumbersome to use, which is a drawback, it would get a better review from me if the curls lasted, which they do not.  </li>
            <li>so many great features and at such a great price (seriously, the super cheap irons have NOTHING on this)</li>
            <li>but I wanted to get her something special that also is practical ( and not jewelry).</li>
            <li>For someone who mostly puts her hair into a bun or ponytail, that&#x27;s pure</li>
            <li>YES IT DOES TAKE A WHILE SPECIALLY BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF HAIR</li>
            <li>and I had a special event coming up, so</li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron because of the reviews and I can say all the reviews are right this works wonders!</li>
            <li>(although I wanted to gush about it right away!)  </li>
            <li>it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use, very smart technology in my opinion</li>
            <li>and I have come to find that this Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is great and by far a product of fine design.</li>
            <li>I am SUPER excited about this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hassle-free, Stress-free, GREAT results - I highly recommend the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron</li>
            <li>The time and temperature settings make it easy to set the exact specifications for your unique hair curling needs.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is how quickly it set the curls, much faster than other products I have used.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions and brush out right before you feed it in with a fine tooth brush, and respect the 1/2-1 inch rule.  </li>
            <li>and by far this one is the easiest to use and gives my hair amazing curls.</li>
            <li>The ceramic technology integrated into this device protects her hair from damage, so no matter how much she uses it, her hair looks full and healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it if you want to keep your significant other happy.</li>
            <li>This Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no hair stylist, but I know my wife is the kind of woman who knows exactly what she wants and why.</li>
            <li>, it is totally stylish and modern looking.</li>
            <li>No matter if I want wavy hair or full on curls, this curling iron handles it.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good hair styling device.</li>
            <li>I also love the LCD screen as it makes it much easier to use.</li>
            <li>Actually told me I did good.</li>
            <li>It took me 2 hours to curl one side of my head with my regular curling iron (of a good name brand) and the curls...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try and put too much hair in it, make sure there are no snarles.</li>
            <li>Full stop.</li>
            <li>and I don’t have to wait forever because I want to be able to use it when I’M READY to use it.</li>
            <li>Out of all of the curling irons I found, I chose this one because the price was reasonable and it had a lot of features that most of the others did not have.</li>
            <li>Takes me forever (okay, about an hour) to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>Thanks Miraqueen for giving me more confidence when leaving the house.  </li>
            <li>so far she seems to be loving it.</li>
            <li>My hair is very slippery and tends to not hold a curl for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;.Base - keeps the iron&#x27;s surface cool when you&#x27;re using it</li>
            <li>There’s a really cool LED screen that tells you the temperature, curl direction, and it even has a timer.</li>
            <li>I had so many compliments on my hair and everyone wants to know what I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>Sweet deal</li>
            <li>Since I got this curler, I have been experimenting a whole lot more with my hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried absolutely anything you can think of to curl my hair - curlers, every wand or curling iron out there, heat rollers, and more.</li>
            <li>I was ready to LOVE this based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to curl my whole head in about 20-25 minutes, without any struggling.</li>
            <li>My sister bought this for me as a gift, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d get much use out of it.</li>
            <li>The whole process to curl your hair is a safer and more efficient</li>
            <li>Another really cool feature is the alternating curl.  </li>
            <li>You do have to make sure that you&#x27;re not trying to put too much hair in it at once.  </li>
            <li>I bought mine at full retail price</li>
            <li>:) Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Plus, she thinks the automatic curling feature is cool and the timer settings, let&#x27;s her know when make another curl.</li>
            <li>my absolute favorite feature is the automatic timers.</li>
            <li>It is fast, efficient, and safe.</li>
            <li>Genius!&lt;br /&gt;Another cool feature is the timed curl function.</li>
            <li>Some of my favorite things about this product is that it heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s even given her more time in the mornings when she&#x27;s getting ready.</li>
            <li>If your not a fan of hairspray like me then this is perfect for you because the curls hold without having to put icky hair spray in.</li>
            <li>Even the second day, it still looks good.</li>
            <li>I finally gave up for about a good year.</li>
            <li>The beeps are cool.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I&#x27;m almost considering buying a &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; just in case this one quits and they discontinue it or something.  </li>
            <li>I use organic sweet almond oil as frizz control and heat protectant with this curler, and I have heard that avocado oil works well as heat protectant with it too.</li>
            <li>I like to spray it with holding spray and then curl all over and let the curls cool then comb through.</li>
            <li>~ this is one cool curling wand.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would love it this much, but now I can&#x27;t even travel without it.</li>
            <li>I picked one up for my wife who has thick hair, and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I would recommend this products, it&#x27;s cheap but useful.</li>
            <li>Even when it starts to get caught, I started to get a feel for it, and was able to pull the hair out before it started to really catch and</li>
            <li>I finally gave up for about a good year.</li>
            <li>Good enough curler to upgrade to if you want something automatic.</li>
            <li>They really should use this design on more electronics!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You can tell that a team of professionals really did their homework to make this product perform so many functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>are now able to be out of the house much faster.</li>
            <li>do so love the efficiency of this thing though, and my roommate keeps turning us into curly haired disney princesses, so I can&#x27;t complain really.</li>

            <li>Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is super cool, very easy to understand and smooth to use.</li>
            <li>with any curling iron - it&#x27;s best if you spray your hair first and last with hairspray to elongate the hold time of the curl, and play around with the time you keep the Miraqueen clamped down and the heat setting you have on - but it&#x27;ll definitely produce awesome curls!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this very highly rated flatiron at such a great price.</li>
            <li>The first thing that attracted to me to this product was the overwhelming number of positive reviews, and the product detail!  </li>
            <li>It’s amazing how the iron does all the work automatically, and I actually will curl my hair now for day to day stuff too because it’s just so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, safe, and provides professionally looking curls.</li>
            <li>I guess maybe that’s not a problem for girls that have been curling their hair all their lives, but for me, it’s nice to have it be such an easy</li>
            <li>Awesome, no more &amp;#34;hickey&amp;#34; burns!  </li>
            <li>This curling iron and a little hairspray made my hair look GORGEOUS!  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair look AMAZING for 2 days, easy to use, and compared to other similar curlers this was actually a great price.  </li>
            <li>I have 3 daughters and this will get its full use quickly.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to use one</li>
            <li>I never get the chance to jump on the new hair ‘tech’ fads because my hair is fine and takes ages to curl, so I’m really excited that this is one I can brag about!</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, very straight, fine hair but lots of it.</li>
            <li>Unlike other curling irons I never have to worry about burning myself, which is something I have experienced a lot.</li>
            <li>The dealbreaker was when I finally got the perfect sized section, brushed smoothly and as the Miraqueen started to do its thing, the warning went off that something wasn&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, this is the BEST thing I have bought for curling hair!</li>
            <li>Seriously the best hair curling invention/product ever!</li>
            <li>I quickly used this product this morning.  </li>
            <li>It heats up so quickly</li>
            <li>My daughters have long straight hair and the Miraqueen gives them really beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>Shipping was remarkably quick, so it arrived even sooner than anticipated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super helpful when curling your hair</li>
            <li>I returned it, got a quick refund, then ordered the all-black one.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and the ceramic works tons better than the old metal one she was using.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great purchase that I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks again for producing such a great product.</li>
            <li>This iron pays for itself quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily it did not come out crispy.  </li>
            <li>I get perfect curls each time that last for hours, and it only takes me about 30 minutes to do.</li>
            <li>Now I can switch back and forth for the best possible</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I eventually gave the information in the interest of World peace [LOL] but the request forced me to do more research</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>but she is such a lovely belle that looks so cute</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product and I highly recommend to all!</li>
            <li>It is far more advanced, timing each curling for you and letting you know when to remove from the hair.</li>
            <li>I have hair as short as above my ears, and it curled it wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The iron is effortless to use, quick, automatic, and one-hand doable.</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen comes with a protective case, tangle-free swivel cord, heats up quickly and is light-weight.</li>
            <li>I am glad I chose this particular iron for my step-daughter.</li>
            <li>The setting allow for so much adjustment that you have to experiment with it a few times to figure out what will work best for you.</li>
            <li>All the girls have been dying for these super curly locks this winter</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m never able to consistently reproduce curls that are almost perfect.</li>
            <li>When doing it the traditional way, I always felt that the top section just got intermingled with the bottom while trying to finish the top.  </li>
            <li>but I love to wear my hair in big, sexy curls.</li>
            <li>have had some mild issues with tangles, maybe one or two per curling session.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m never able to consistently reproduce curls that are almost perfect.</li>
            <li>Now I can switch back and forth for the best possible</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly so you don&#x27;t have to wait around.</li>
            <li>I am a person who likes to get things done quick</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and following the advice in the video, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The LED screen is crystal clear and very easy to read.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair bouncy and full, exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li>and if you have super straight hair like me, make sure you use a bit if hairspray right after you do each curl.  </li>
            <li>This makes it easy for me to see how warm the iron is and how long I need to hold that curl in place - there are four timer settings.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ever been able to curl my hair so easily, and it even works on my heat resistant wigs, which is a major plus with Comic Con tomorrow!</li>
            <li>put this on the lowest temperature setting, but it&#x27;s still very hot.</li>
            <li>Superior features over the other available variants.</li>
            <li>My curls have last all day and are very cute.</li>
            <li>The most interesting thing about this Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is that I did not spend too much time to get used to it.</li>
            <li>It does great curls that last, even with my fine hair that typically never holds a curl longer than an hour</li>
            <li>I want very fast!</li>
            <li>I can’t express how many times I’d wind my hair around a normal curling iron just to have the ends of my hair fall out before finishing and having to re-curl and re-curl and re-curl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light weighted, and I&#x27;m used to a lot heavier ones</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, she absolutely loves it!!  </li>
            <li>down, lol and</li>
            <li>I really like how easy it is to use and how quick it works.</li>
            <li>I love that this curler gets hot almost immediately, and the high heat is perfect for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>With this magical device, I did my whole head in 20 minutes; less time than it took for me to do my own makeup!</li>
            <li>My new favorite tool.</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen is my new favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite hair tool.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way a normal curling iron has the capacity to produce such great curls every time.</li>
            <li>It beeps when I should remove it there is no guess work, which is great for those like me that don&#x27;t use an iron every day and know less than nothing about them.</li>
            <li>Besides that my hair is not super dry anymore if you want perfect curls without damaging your hair you will love the Miraqueen.</li>
            <li>The curls last a long time and look great!</li>
            <li>After 23 years of pin straight hair and no curling iron to help me, for the first time in my life I was able to curl my hair and have it HOLD for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and it lets you know if you are using too much hair.</li>
            <li>I appreciated that the wand was easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love that it knows how much hair is inside so that I don’t end up having to recurl hair that didn’t take the first time because of thickness.</li>
            <li>She has tried to get a curling iron that can make perfect curls and last for a long time.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and works fast.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and is easy to you.</li>
            <li>The iron is easy to use and you can achieve the look you want without putting too much effort into it.</li>
            <li>I used to have long hair, and if I grow it out again, I&#x27;ll definitely confiscate this iron from my sister lol!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use, but sometimes if I try to put too much hair in, it gets stuck, but it always comes out if you wait for the warning beeps to stop and for it to release the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>/&gt;The buttons on the iron are also placed very intuitively so you can easily adjust things as you are holding</li>
            <li>You get a much better curl with just a plain old fashioned curling iron and while this is inventive it has a long way to go to be a good product, right now just a really good idea that needs improvement.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for the price and high class functions you&#x27;ll simply love it!</li>
            <li>have tried many similar products, and this is definitely the best in terms of being easy and efficient to use, and creating a style that will stay in place for a long time.  </li>

            <li>I have very fine, straight thinning hair and adding some volume or curl to it makes it look much fuller.  </li>
            <li>I really love the way it works and the handle, it&#x27;s very comfortable and extremely easy to maneuver, some brands are just heavy and ineffective.</li>
            <li>I did my hair after work and slept on it and the next day I still had lovely bouncy curls!</li>
            <li>glad the old one is gone!  </li>
            <li>, I wish I had seen this here first, I would have saved $40.00!  </li>
            <li>May seem a bit bulky at first, but this iron is a must have!</li>
            <li>This is the  best curling Iron  professionally that i have found it is less damaging to  my clients hair.</li>
            <li>To begin, I love how the buttons are a digital fashion and easy to reach while you are using the iron.</li>
            <li>The ready light makes it easy to know when it’s ready to be used.</li>
            <li>I have fine stick straight hair</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn your head or hands, makes perfect curls every time and the curls last a long time!!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but after using this MAGIC iron, my curls literally last for days!!</li>
            <li>It is so easy and very rarely have I figured out how to curl my with a new device on the first try.</li>
            <li>Yea, certain types of products and sprays help but Its hard to get that perfect curl right from the get go.</li>
            <li>It has such amazing features.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is amazing and very simple to use!</li>
            <li>, just keep calm and release button.  </li>
            <li>Its multifunction ability is fantastic and the safety features really make this a standout option.  </li>
            <li>The three different heating levels are also amazing because I can customize what type of curl I want based on which level I</li>
            <li>Quite honestly, I didn&#x27;t believe in the hype, but when me latest iron bit the dust a few weeks ago I decided to bite the bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The device is actually quite amazing with the breadth of what it will do for your hair.</li>
            <li>To say that I love this product is a complete understatement.</li>
            <li>That extra feature is just a nice security.</li>
            <li>Every time she uses it her hair looks flawless and my wife has really thin hair</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good things</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a professional grade iron that has many features.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought that I would be returning it, but NO WAY I am sending this back!!!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money</li>
            <li>Much better looking and no problems so far.</li>
            <li>It gives me a more natural, playful curl than a curling iron.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is because for whatever reason I cannot get it to give a nice curl on the parts in front, to frame my face.</li>
            <li>Better yet, it doesn&#x27;t kill my hair like my old curling iron.</li>
            <li>The price is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>This machine is perfect for women with thin hair.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is, the curls might look looser the following day and if you like that, then leave them</li>
            <li>It is very much worth the money.</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and healthy, I’m</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s thrilled with this, and the operation is simple, trouble-free and reliable.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>She uses it nearly every day and her hair looks absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li>also wasn&#x27;t sure I needed all the extra bells and whistles, as I&#x27;m not the most technical person in the world, but now I&#x27;ve been spoiled by the luxuries of the LCD monitor and being able to choose the curling direction.</li>
            <li>It is so fun to use that it doesn’t feel like a chore every day,</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the design too (pink is definitely my favorite color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have a closet full of curling irons, styling wands, hot rollers, etc.  </li>
            <li>I also find the LED screen to be a pretty cool feature to have on a hair tool.</li>
            <li>and shes glad I broke her old one.  </li>
            <li>it works but even with my thick obedient hair the curls didn&#x27;t come out that great</li>
            <li>That alone makes this product worth its weight in gold to me.  </li>
            <li>I have problems with my natural lovely curly hair because I have never found any curler that could not damage my hair.</li>
            <li>It is so cool to have pretty, curly hair again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another useful feature is the swivel socket</li>
            <li>Its worth the price.</li>
            <li>The purchase was definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>Myself, I wouldn&#x27;t mind her hair being straight or curly, but this device has really made her looks stunning.</li>
            <li>No guessing if the temperature is going to be too hot or too cool to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I want to do my hair in fun waves and go out with the friends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it.  </li>
            <li>The Miraqueen is by far one of my favorite hair styling items  </li>
            <li>I gave up for awhile even trying to curl the hair I love, but my friend told me to try the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, Curling Wand, Hair Curler with Ceramic Curling Chamber, I did, and am so thankful I did.</li>
            <li>so far love</li>
            <li>Many of them have felt like cheap plastic that will break in my hand if move to quickly, reminiscent of something you would but at the .99 cent store.</li>
            <li>It was SO worth it.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>It works so much better than her old one,</li>
            <li>Before I purchased this curling iron, I would rarely spend the time to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>It sits nicely in my hand and is simple to operate.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of professional curling irons on the market, and as a guy, most of us don&#x27;t use curling irons, but for my daughter&#x27;s sake, we do.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product but it doesn&#x27;t work well on my short shoulder</li>
            <li>Not only do you not need to change out a rod to match the thickness of the curl, but you can also select the timer that coordinates with that kind of curl.</li>
            <li>so your curls can point in either direction (relieving the user of the pain of trying to twist their hands backwards to get more natural looking curls).</li>
            <li>I am glad I did not waste my money.</li>
            <li>The led screen and all the settings and heat levels make it worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>The time it saves me is well worth the price of the item.  </li>
            <li>(Handy for people with different types of hair, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only has it tamed my thick, unruly mane but produces the most beautiful curls ever!</li>
            <li>but on the weekends when I go out with my husband or girlfriends I always curl my hair and get fresh.</li>
            <li>I really love my Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, Curling Wand, Hair Curler with Ceramic Curling Chamber.</li>
            <li>but I watched some Youtube videos to figure it and it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>The only time my hair got stuck was my own gosh darn fault....</li>
            <li>product is completely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s had so much fun playing with it</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s had so much fun playing with it</li>
            <li>Can count on some nice curl carryover to the next day</li>
            <li>Now, while that may be true, I decided to take matters into my own hands and buy her the new Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy, easy to use, and a real  steal for the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other curling irons, but they didn&#x27;t really work great for what I&#x27;d need.</li>
            <li>This is awesome because before one side of my head would have tighter curls and the other side would have looser curls and they would be facing all different types of directions.</li>
            <li>told, the Miraqueen works better, quicker and more efficiently than any other curling iron I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Also.. thank you for the super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>It gets super hot and has an auto power off in case you forget to turn it off.</li>
            <li>Even with my super straight hair, this product worked wonders!</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to our niece, the curling iron heats up quickly, maintains a consistent temperature, and makes curling her hair seemingly effortless.  </li>
            <li>I tried it out using the tight setting first and was happy with the result.</li>
            <li>highly suggest the Miraqueen iron to anyone that has had frustrations with their old curling irons and wants to get gorgeous, long-lasting, natural-looking curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m sure most guys wouldn&#x27;t get what to get for their special someone for any occasion, but I can guarantee that any girl who has trouble getting their hair to curl without hassle would just adore this product.</li>
            <li>She talked about the control panel being superior to other models and easier to make changes on the fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think The Miraqueen Brand has created a good product and will be on the look out for other items they may carry.</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s more of a special occasion device, it does take awhile to curl an entire head of hair (I do have quite a lot of hair</li>
            <li>right for your hair type.</li>
            <li>, I can use it one-handed, and I can always just look on the LED screen to see if it’s the right temperature, so there’s no guess work.</li>
            <li>Beach waves or right curls</li>
            <li>Once I got it and gave it to her she started to use it right away.</li>
            <li>The screen helps me ensure that the iron is at the right temperature</li>
            <li>Also play with the seconds and temp to find the right setting for you.  </li>
            <li>My recommendation is that you should find the right time and temperature for yourself.</li>
            <li>The screen helps me ensure that the iron is at the right temperature</li>
            <li>Instead of trying to just pull your hair right out of curler...</li>
            <li>From day 1 I could see that I&#x27;d made the right choice buying this.  </li>
            <li>and this is just the right thing.</li>
            <li>I have fine, very straight shoulder length hair and it makes great curls that last long.</li>
            <li>The heat settings and automatic timing make this hair tool easy to use for the new user or for a person who has been styling their hair for years.</li>
            <li>She has recommended this already to all of her friends, so I figured I would put her positive review on the internet!</li>
            <li>Just follow the directions and be patient at first while you learn how much hair you need to put in and how smooth it should be.  </li>
            <li>, it does an amazing job for women who don&#x27;t usually do this because of lack of skill and time :)</li>
            <li>With the LCD screen she can adjust the settings to fit exactly what she wants.</li>
            <li>From mediocre to beautiful and handsome.  </li>
            <li>You may not believe in love at first sight, but you’ll truly like the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li>It took a little while to figure out the controls, but once I got the hang of it, the results were amazing!</li>
            <li>One tip, I can give for any other &amp;#34;hair challenged&amp;#34; people like me that I found on a video at some point that I found helpful is to section your hair and curl the top first, which is backwards of most tuturiols you see.  </li>
            <li>No other curling iron has made me this satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of quality ceramic and has a pretty high temperature to produce strong curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice not to smell my hair burning every time I try to style it with a flat iron or curling iron!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this over the cheap metal that can burn your hair or give it a burnt smell.  </li>
            <li>The timer is great as it allows her to decide exactly how much curl she wants and takes the guess work out of how long to hold it in place.  </li>
            <li>Best $60 I have spent in a long time!</li>
            <li>It seems to be more gentle to my fine hair than traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li>I feel better, look better and get major compliments from people that seem to barely notice me.</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron has too many good features to list in this little review.</li>
            <li>Her hair looks great and it takes a lot less time for us to get ready to go.  </li>
            <li>She is able to do more in less time.  </li>
            <li>It is not as quick as they say to curl your whole head when you have lots of hair, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I also love the digital controls and how quickly it heats.</li>
            <li>It is quick and more effortless than a regular curling</li>
            <li>This product really is the most simple curler to use, and it delivers a fantastic finished product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get why she has so many products when she barely uses them all.</li>
            <li>Not sure if she would be happy with it.</li>
            <li>There are many advantages of using the Miraqueen compared to regular curling irons: it is cool to not have to worry about a hot barrel burning your fingers, forehead, neck, or ears.</li>
            <li>After a few successful and unsuccessful attempts, I thought I had figured it out</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, and I was so excited when it first came in.</li>
            <li>Curls are nice and stay a long time.</li>
            <li>If you have fine, naturally curly hair, this is the iron you want!</li>
            <li>my wife loves this new curling iron, she was bragging to her friends at church the other day about how great it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great curling iron for most chicks, however, I think long, thin haired women should avoid this product.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine, straight hair, so it takes a good half hour to get my whole head done, though.  </li>
            <li>you you&#x27;re able to get that down, then your knotted/stuck hair days will be over! :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know I can spend less than $300 on a professional iron and get such great results.</li>
            <li>Curling irons, curlers - none of them worked because my hair apparently LIKED being straight, and the sheer weight would make the tightest curl stretch out.</li>
            <li>Long lasting wonderful curls in no time - divide off a strand and feed the hair in the curling chamber and after just a few second--- there they are, beautiful, shiny, glamorous curls!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair held the curls for 3 days, which sounds gross, but it&#x27;s actually  awesome because I don&#x27;t like washing my hair everyday because it keeps it healthier with just 3-4 washes per week.</li>
            <li>wow, it works really fast and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>She LOVES the Miraqueen, and says that this curling iron makes it easy to create long-lasting curls, unlike her old curling irons.</li>
            <li>She plans on buying a few more for Christmas gifts. :)</li>
            <li>I bought this because of all the technologies it possess for such a reasonable price, it was kind of a no brainer to try it.</li>
            <li>You know the sound you hear &#x27;cush&amp;#34; the frying your hair sound of a regular curling iron</li>
            <li>Lastly, this is just an overall GREAT product.</li>
            <li>Creates beautiful long lasting curls.  </li>
            <li>We purchased this a few months ago, and since then she has praised me almost daily for buying her the perfect birthday gift.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, it&#x27;s quick to heat up, so by the time I finish seperating my hair to prepare curling it, the hair curler is ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The blue led screen is nice and legible and has the anti tangle feature for the cord which should be included on every device with a wire.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice display that tells you how hot it is, and how long it&#x27;s set to curl</li>
            <li>/&gt;She says that the iron has a few safety features that prevent you from burning yourself...which is important because she&#x27;s kind of a clutz sometimes.</li>
            <li>The LED screen makes it easy to see the temperature (and how far along the iron is in heating up) and direction of the curl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product, I recommend it to anyone who is tired of the cheap stuff.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t super fast</li>
            <li>and then it beeps quickly to let you know your curl is ready.</li>
            <li>Several hours later, I STILL HAD GREAT CURLS.</li>
            <li>irons use intense heat, but the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron keeps you safe from skin or hair burns with its foam and rubber protectors.</li>
            <li>took me about 30 minutes to get all my curls done, I&#x27;m sure with a few more uses</li>
            <li>The device heats up SUPER quickly, which I love, because I am not very patient.</li>
            <li>She asked me to get her a high end curling iron for her birthday; I researched the “Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron” and saw so many people having success.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast (with Prime) and the price is very good, compared to the other types of devices similar to this out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly easy and safe to use (in comparison  to conventional curling irons).  </li>
            <li>All in all a really great product that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who wants a head full of curls with the least amount of pain and effort.</li>
            <li>The only thing that wasn&#x27;t really true for me was that I would be able to curl my whole head in 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The price is also right and cheaper than many standard curling irons.</li>
            <li>This stops me from having to go back and forth, checking to make sure it is balanced right and won&#x27;t burn anything or pose a fire hazard.</li>
            <li>, her curls are so natural, pretty, and they appear to be so damn tight, I am not yet used to her own kind of curl and the setting so much</li>
            <li>I pressed and released to no avail--in fact, that just resulting in it tightening it&#x27;s lockdown on my hair--hair that was on the top level, right next to my crown.</li>
            <li>This stops me from having to go back and forth, checking to make sure it is balanced right and won&#x27;t burn anything or pose a fire hazard.</li>
            <li>I have super straight hair and curled my whole head in about 20 mins!  </li>
            <li>The digital settings are easy to use and once you find a sweet spot, you always know what you are getting.</li>
            <li>It takes less time to hold a strand in the heating system but too long to set the hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>Not hard to use, and actually fun!</li>
            <li>Wife has had many over the years but finally found one that she is really happy with and says she wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the most expensive one in the market.</li>
            <li>When I used it, it would suck the hair in wonderfully, make a beep sound but the curling action would stop after only a few seconds, no matter what the timer was set on.</li>
            <li>She has very straight hair, that used to never curl</li>
            <li>that I haven&#x27;t actually had to curl my own hair with it most of the time.it fast enough to save your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish I had spent my money on something more user friendly.</li>
            <li>If you have thicker hair it will probably go in much much easier with less practice since fly aways aren&#x27;t much of an issue for you.</li>
            <li>Let me describe my hair: below shoulder length, fine, but naturally curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the product effective, but it is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>With the first try I had salon perfect curls, and with my super thick hair it took me only about 30 minutes to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>It is quick, easy, and the curls last all day!  </li>
            <li>LOL that was always the hard part for me</li>
            <li>I have more than enough volume and decent natural wave, I just wanted something more controlled looking.  </li>
            <li>, there is a &#x27;V&#x27; shaped opening for where your hair goes in, it also makes a huge difference if that &#x27;V&#x27; side is closest to your head (opposed to on the far side of curler/away from your head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a higher temperature for that area, a lower temperature for my layers and bangs</li>
            <li>So, I was ECSTATIC when I found the MiraQueen which has it ALL: 3 heat settings, timer, curl direction control and above all the DUAL Voltage.  </li>
            <li>but this just makes it so much easier on her!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s curls the whole night!</li>
            <li>This Miraqueen professional curling iron fit the bill and exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>favorite thing about this curling iron is that you can actually change the direction of the curl with one push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first model that did not hit the trash can within the first week.</li>
            <li>This product not only made my wife very happy, but it also stopped the financial bleeding for me personally.  </li>
            <li>It is really neat and makes curling your hair fun.</li>
            <li>When I first saw it I was horrified because he knows nothing about curling hair.</li>
            <li>this does the job and is better then a regular curling iron that&#x27;s why i got it for my sis.</li>
            <li>and she first started her straightening routine at the age of 13.</li>
            <li>I could of gotten the same effect with my curling iron in about 10-15 minutes top and it would of lasted.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>short, never had curls that lasted more than an hour without the help of a perm.  </li>
            <li>either then it also being so hot to touch to try.  </li>
            <li>This Miraqueen Professional curling iron is fantastic.</li>
            <li>When my husband  first saw this he said he did not now wether to get it or not, but I wish he would have just gotten it because it truly works miracles with your hair.</li>
            <li>I love that it has different heat levels and timer settings.</li>
            <li>Your hair zips into the heating chambers, and after mere seconds, your perfect curls will come bouncing out.</li>
            <li>Now my wife wants one for Christmas!</li>
            <li>Even hot rollers don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>The timer and temperature settings allow me to achieve the exact desired curl tightness that I am looking for.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting better at selecting the proper amount of hair and have had no issues whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I really do love the way it curls and stays curled until I the next time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Overall she was extremely pleased with this and recommends this to all her friends.</li>
            <li>Longer than a curling iron and hot rollers.</li>
            <li>tried this with the hairspray sprayed on first (like the video review) and without.</li>
            <li>I really wish it did on mine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick to hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Hot rollers are not as fun as a device like this could be, but I find them very efficient as I can put makeup on while my hair is curling.</li>
            <li>she knew it was better than any traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li>and its very time efficient, and makes curling my hair fun.</li>
            <li>I can use it daily and my hair is still healthy.</li>
            <li>Takes longer than a curling iron because you do smaller chunks of hair, but this is what helps my hair hold the curl better.</li>
            <li>Two days after I first used the iron; I had to go to the doctor for the flu...</li>
            <li>The doctor came in and commented on how pretty my hair was...</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a curl wand.</li>
            <li>The curls looked really pretty and they lasted for the whole evening!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use much hairspray and the curl held up for fifteen hours (would have been longer, but I showered when I got home!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned and bought many different irons over the years.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not even sure it was the same product that everyone else has reviewed.  </li>
            <li>This works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>love this product and totally recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend bought this product and she absolutely LOVES IT!</li>
            <li>From prior experience, I cannot fully express to you how many times I have accidently burned my hands.</li>
            <li>I had decided to try the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron and I cannot believe how smooth and silky my hair is.</li>
            <li>There are guided beeps and it’s pretty foolproof to use, but as always, safety first.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There are guided beeps and it’s pretty foolproof to use, but as always, safety first.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product to most anyone.</li>
            <li>Being able to regulate the temperature and set the timer, I get the same curl EVERY TIME!  </li>
            <li>She also can do her hair in so many ways because of the different curling options that this iron has.</li>
            <li>I have tried several times since, and had slightly better results (despite getting my hair stuck as well).  </li>
            <li>Before I found this curler I would have to take two hours with a traditional curling iron, curling and re-curling to make sure the curls stayed.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money and it holds up very well.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t need to manually curl my hair around the barrel, it makes my curling time much faster!</li>
            <li>there is no way I&#x27;d be able to do the back of my head.  </li>
            <li>The only thing you&#x27;d want would be a size control, which I&#x27;m sure these people are working on.</li>
            <li>I was nervous the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>and here I am, I can now see why this got recommended to me in the first place.</li>
            <li>I actually like the curls better</li>
            <li>This is a nifty product and creates consistent, pretty curls.</li>
            <li>alternated the curl direction and my hair looks so natural, smooth and bouncy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works so much better on my hair than the regular curling irons.  </li>
            <li>In short - great for curling long hair.</li>
            <li>And, it doesn’t take much time, either!</li>
            <li>And this curler makes curls exactly how I wanted.</li>
            <li>This device makes my curls lay so much nicer!</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes of wrestling with it, we finally were able to pull/untangle her hair.  </li>
            <li>, that was the first time I became a hair stylist.</li>
            <li>The last curl setting for this curler is my roommate&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li>It even has an automatic shut off if it&#x27;s left in your hair for more than 25 seconds, or if it&#x27;s simply left on for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>It couldn&#x27;t be more simple!</li>
            <li>First, let me tell you</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I noticed it did not leave my hair feeling &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; like smoke coming from it.</li>
            <li>After doing many hours of extensive research I came to the conclusion of purchasing this model.  </li>
            <li>And that is exactly what I got.  </li>
            <li>Smaller sections works much better.  </li>
            <li>I really like how it does my hair, and I thought it was worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>and so far she says it has been fantastic for her.</li>
            <li>I really have no complaints with the product, it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>and I had no difficulty figuring out how to use it the first time.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m throwing my out of date hot rollers out.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I am adding a 5 star review, hoping people will find it here first and save themselves some money.</li>
            <li>This curling iron does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s digital</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I have been straightening my hair for years (what used to be called Japanese straightening), so it&#x27;s straightened all except about the top 6 inches or so, but it does tend to wear off a bit after awhile -</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time, and it worked like a champ.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it probably took me 30 minutes to do my hair, but that was because of the learning curve.  </li>
            <li>Will experiment more with the different directions of curls at some point.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>My hair consistently got tangled in the curling chamber.  </li>
            <li>just glad she stopped getting her fingers and ears occasionally burnt.</li>
            <li>Hot hair wand with LED screen- displays timer, temperature, and curl</li>
            <li>well, I thought at first.</li>
            <li>Overall its a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>There are beep sounds and easy-to-read displays that let you keep track of time and temperature pretty</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;child-proof.&amp;#34; The tourmaline ceramic technology also protects your hair from heat damage, so that&#x27;s pretty fool-proof.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it’s really efficient!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really ambitious at the beginning.</li>
            <li>She even told us that she would recommend it to all of her friends because as she put it, &amp;#34;yeah, it&#x27;s that great&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making such a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>After using this, not only did it hold the curls for my important meeting at work, but they stayed beautiful all that day, through the night, and all the way up until my shower the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li>This iron also gets hot, maxing out at 450 degrees.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through a many similar devices.</li>
            <li>The curls of her hair started looking different than ever which seriously I love.</li>
            <li>Being a short haired person myself, I wasn&#x27;t exaclty to sure where to start.</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>I must admit the first thing that drew me to this curling iron were the looks.</li>
            <li>does so much more than just a simple curl.</li>
            <li>and I needed something with a digital screen and some more flexible options.  </li>
            <li>It has been well over a year since I first started using this</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes and it exceeded my expectations!!</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it has multiple curl directions and timer settings.  </li>
            <li>You adjust the setting on the handle to the type of curl you want and it will tell you exactly when to remove it with a series of beeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also like the safety features because I don’t know how many times I have burned my head or hand on a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li>The three-beep notification helps make sure that all of her curls are equal.</li>
            <li>ended up returning it because its another machine that most likely wont use.</li>
            <li>I, like so many others, have bought wands and straightners and watched countless videos on how to use them to achieve pretty curly hair with no luck.  </li>
            <li>but there isn&#x27;t much of a learning curve, it just works!  </li>
            <li>The first time it was a bit tighter than I was going for, but still pretty.  </li>
            <li>The bottom section fell out after about a day, the top section stayed curly for 3 sleeps after the initial curl - with NO hairspray - probably would have stayed longer</li>
            <li>I get much better curls with my conair regular iron.</li>
            <li>but the device just stopped getting hot.</li>
            <li>so I was willing to give this curling wand a try.</li>
            <li>I get 4 different women with this one curling iron :)  </li>
            <li>and she knows exactly when to release the curl for the looks</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair like most curling irons do, and it leaves curls that last for days.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was probably closer to 25 minutes, and a lot of that was probably just because it was the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just make sure you are not using sections of hair that are too big, and brush out the section before you feed it in, or it might get caught.  </li>
            <li>This really works like a charm!</li>
            <li>I can use my straightener, but I still have to do every curl twice or more for about 45 mins, and when I&#x27;m done my hair smells burned, looks burned, and the curl doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li>I was worried about using this and getting my hair tangled the first time I used it</li>
            <li>It is fast and it works!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it took me just 10 minutes to  curl my hair</li>
            <li>It heats up hot and curls my hair in seconds.</li>
            <li>And since you don&#x27;t have to touch the hot part of the iron I no longer burn my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>At first I was weary because it looked so bulky</li>
            <li>It even shuts off after the timer goes off, so my hair is safe even if I left it in there.</li>
            <li>I have used curling irons, rollers, steam setters, hot curlers</li>
            <li>IT TAKES ME 15 MINUTES TO CURL MY WHOLE HEAD OF HAIR WITH THIS!</li>
            <li>At first it looked like a vibrator when it popped up on the search until I read</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t need to manually curl my hair around the barrel, it makes my curling time much faster!</li>
            <li>first couple of times that i used this, my hair got stuck and i had to yank it out of the curler, however it did not always come out</li>
            <li>/&gt;***And once i realized the curler works a million times better if it is always facing the same way (as in...</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen curler is much more than just a fancy digital display.</li>
            <li>It is safe, there is NO possible way to burn yourself.</li>
            <li>You can set the temperature to whatever you&#x27;d like, so if you have more fragile hair, you can set the iron to a lower temperature.  </li>
            <li>Heats up in a minute or two so fast !</li>
            <li>I love the three different timer settings (</li>
            <li>It beeps and you&#x27;re ready!</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen Curling Iron is so refreshing for several reasons!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the Miraqueen, the heat distribution is pretty even so</li>
            <li>I love that you only need one hand to operate the iron.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product I was pretty fascinated with all of the features.</li>
            <li>I have really thick hair, but it still looked great just messing around.</li>
            <li>Hoping to take my time and really see what this thing can do!</li>
            <li>Its so fast &amp; easy to use, its just crazy &amp; finally I get to have beautiful amazing curls.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li>In addition, the way the hair goes in is easier to get right, and it does not seem to twist the curl quite as much.  </li>
            <li>This is actually great for anyone from younger children to older women.&lt;br /&gt;Not to get emotional, but this hair straightener kinda changed my life...</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a very good little investment in time-savings and money.</li>
            <li>The three timer settings are perfect, I set it for a tight curl when I feel the weather is going to be rough on my hair.</li>
            <li>I definitely think this is more for long hair because it&#x27;s just too big to try to successfully work with shorter hair</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but I was able to get a full head of beautiful, bouncy curls that actually lasted ALL</li>
            <li>With super fine and completely straight hair, I have been through so many curling irons that were never able to produce results.</li>
            <li>She also got ready much quicker than usual which I was happy about.</li>
            <li>I pulled the plug to make sure the heat was off and just tugged a little section of hair out at a time and had it free in about 5 seconds.  </li>
            <li>with most technologically advanced products, it takes a little practice to get used to the design.</li>
            <li>I use a flat iron on the roots of my hair once I&#x27;m done to help it lay better.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for Santa to bring me this that I had to stop myself from trying it out early.  </li>
            <li>It would get warm but not nearly as hot as it needed to be.</li>
            <li>Some other nice perks: it&#x27;ll change the rotation of the curler</li>
            <li>When I saw this flat iron, I decided to give it a try, and I love the curls it gives me.</li>
            <li>While the contraption looks complicated at first, it&#x27;s actually great for people who are not super experienced with using curling irons.</li>
            <li>This curling iron gets hot very fast and maintains temperature the whole time while I&#x27;m doing my hair.</li>
            <li>I love how quick and efficient it is, compared to a lot of other curling irons.</li>
            <li>This brings hi-tech to the standard low tech curling gear and makes it ultra safe and easy.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to use although you need to be patient because the pieces of hair need to be pretty small</li>
            <li>But when I tried it from the middle or top of my hair, it was too much for it.</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen is definitely by far, MY FAVORITE curling iron thus far.</li>
            <li>I love how this one looks heavy but is quite light.</li>
            <li>With this curling iron she is able to wear her hair straight, or with 3 different types of curls.  </li>
            <li>Love the different settings and what a relief to know it has an auto shut off because teenagers can be very absent minded at times.  </li>
            <li>The timers and heat settings make it very easy to see and operate this to get your desired curl, If you are thinking about getting a new iron spend the couple of extra dollars and get the Mirqueen you will not regret it at all.</li>
            <li>This is the fifth month of using this curl now, my little niecejust took my curler so am here to get another one right now, I don&#x27;t have any kind of issues with this curler.</li>
            <li>even my flat irons (nothing like a good first to second degree burn to start your morning!)</li>
            <li>Its service really awesome.i like it very much.</li>
            <li>For slightly more than most of the curling irons I&#x27;ve bought in the past, I have one that does not fight me!  </li>
            <li>The pink is always on top; i attempted to hold it upside down a couple of times because it was more comfortable depending on the area of my head i was curling.</li>
            <li>highly recommend Miraqueen to anyone who wants beautiful, quality, natural looking, long-lasting curls in half the time without the work.</li>
            <li>Also this defiantly has more settings then an average curling iron, also the timer feature is super helpful and makes it</li>
            <li>The curler heats up very quickly and stays hot throughout my entire use.</li>
            <li>The curler heats up very quickly and stays hot throughout my entire use.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try after watching the videos and reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything the positive reviews say about it.</li>
            <li>After using hers a couple of times and noticing positive results, I had to have this iron for myself.  </li>
            <li>But after looking for hours, I decided to go with the Miraqueen because of all the positive things people are saying about it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the curling iron about 4 weeks ago and have had nothing but positive results with it</li>
            <li>The safety features in place on this curling iron are fantastic, and very much appreciated by an easily distracted adult such as myself.</li>
            <li>The only downside I could see is that it is a bit heavy, but I think as I get better at using the process will go more quickly and the weight wont even be an issue.</li>
            <li>With multiple heat settings and a nice LED screen you can&#x27;t go wrong with styling your hair nicely and easily.</li>
            <li>This is the first innovation in curling irons in 20 years that really works.</li>
            <li>The no-tangle cord really makes everything so much easier, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li>I make her tell me exactly what she wants</li>
            <li>However, the curls died off much quicker than what happens with my hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>The shortest pieces on top are about 4-5 inches long.</li>
            <li>The curl holds better and lasts to some degree all day long.</li>
            <li>You need to brush tangles out first and not put too much hair in or it will get stuck.</li>
            <li>I was worried because I have long hair and wasn&#x27;t sure if my hair would get stuck a lot.</li>
            <li>Not having to wrap your hair around the rod also pretty much eliminates the chance of burning yourself, so if you were prone to burning yourself on curling irons before and have the blisters to prove it, do yourself a favor and buy</li>
            <li>I like my long hair but wanted more volume and curls.</li>
            <li>and I did get a beep on the first attempt that I had too much hair in the chamber</li>
            <li>As a fervent addict and a woman with very big obsession for natural curl, you really should have noticed that I have my own day dreams about how I want my hair to look like.</li>
            <li>I have long hair with layers and still work, still getting use to it. :)</li>
            <li>I had pretty much given up on attempting to use a curling iron when this one was recommended to me.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really time myself to the exact minute -</li>
            <li>It curls my hair pretty fast for the length that I have.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on other curling irons, you have found the best.</li>
            <li>It did curl my straight hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>Just buy a good small curling iron.</li>
            <li>All the heating and curling action occurs within the head of the device, leaving the outsides cool to touch.</li>
            <li>With all the good though, I will also mention two small tips to help others get started.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Further testing showed that the curls could hold up for nearly 10 hours before being completely flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered one and loved how fool proof the machine is.</li>
            <li>in the time it takes me to just put rollers in, i&#x27;ve got a full head of soft or springy curls - depending on heat and time.  </li>
            <li>With regular curling irons, I never know how long to leave them in my hair to get a nice, full curl.</li>
            <li>Now it not only curls beautifully, but it holds for days with no special product or hair spray (ewwww) in my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The curls produced are beautiful, and if creates a variety of different curling options from tight, defined curls, to relaxed, beachy curls.</li>

            <li>Each individual strand is pretty fine, but there are a ton of them.  </li>

            <li>It took a little bit time to get her used to, but I have noticed that she’s already been very satisfied with the result she is having, and it’s really noticeable.</li>
            <li>Two of the ladies are from South Korea with this lovely beautiful shinning black hair; I had so much fun to change their thick straight long hair to beautiful curly style without so much trouble using my curler.</li>
            <li>I purchased two of these for my daughters--one a freshman in college and the other a sophomore in high school--and they love it!</li>
            <li>The combination of healthy hair and high temp curls means that curls will last and last.&lt;br /&gt;-LED</li>

            <li>My hair is known to fall over the subsequent hours but these curls stay strong.</li>
            <li>I had attended my cousin&#x27;s wedding a few months back, and her hair looked beautiful.</li>
            <li>For long lasting curls I would say give it a shot if you want to look as good as she does.</li>
            <li>Since different hair types require different settings that’s not a problem  with The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron because it has 3 heat levels to choose from and 4 timer settings and if you forget about your timing, one of the many fascinating features about this curling iron is, it will actually shut off to prevent any damage.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron will curl your entire head of hair in under 10 minutes, and is good for anything from a bob to long, luscious hair.</li>
            <li>I laughed a little inside and wondered how my husband would take it if I showed it to him and said, “this is my new toy.”</li>
            <li>Amazingly Smart.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn, but it certainly hurt because it was trying to pull my hair out of my head.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to put large chunks in, my hair got stuck and burned it.</li>
            <li>This curler made it so easy though and now I can curl my hair every other day really quickly.</li>
            <li>She figured out after one minor knot exactly what to do, and she can do it very quickly and easily by herself, even at the back of her head.  </li>
            <li>so I bought a few more for them for Christmas!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been worth the money so far!</li>
            <li>My days of searching are over, and I&#x27;m definitely getting rid of those other old curling irons for good!</li>
            <li>It also has a protective heat case so you can put it away right away instead of waiting for it to cool back</li>
            <li>I can choose what kind of curls I want because I prefer tight, spiral curls</li>
            <li>but it pulled right out and most of the time it lets you know if something is not right by beeping a whole bunch and unlocking itself.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I can easily see how you&#x27;d end up having to cut your hair out of this thing if you mess it up, but it&#x27;s easy to get the hang of pretty quickly and start to predict when its going to complain and fix it fast enough to save your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This curler is just naturally pretty; I never taught I could find something like this, so my new roommate is a blessing!</li>
            <li>My hair is not long enough for this to be effective.</li>
            <li>I have straight coarse hair, my hair cuticle is also very compact so it doesn&#x27;t take curls every easily.  </li>
            <li>Because of my fine hair, I have only ever used this on the lowest heat and curl time setting (370 degrees/8 seconds)</li>
            <li>automatic curling as the main star, curling could not be any faster!</li>
            <li>Not only does it work perfectly and last a long time, it is also super affordable and is worth every penny spent on it!</li>
            <li>reading all of the directions first, and coming  my hair through very carefully before I got started, I was able to get the hang of this curling iron</li>
            <li>Kind of want to try another one, but I&#x27;m a little hesitant.</li>
            <li>This product got my hair to go in nice little waves.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a curling iron that can curl any hair type fast and efficiently!</li>
            <li>I say this because my hair is super long and super straight.  </li>
            <li>But I will say if I ever did suddenly have a &#x27;jam&#x27; where the hair got caught, you knew pretty quickly and it was easy with the open system to get the hair out and try again.</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen seems much better than her other hair things, and she’s very happy with it (which is really what matters)!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, long story short, THANK YOU for helping this old man with his teenage daughter crisis.</li>
            <li>She also loves the 3 curl settings and the other options provided to easily create many different types of curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to create amazing curls across my whole head -- even those hard to reach places on the back of my head!!  </li>
            <li>Now, I just need a curling iron that will leave waves in my straight hair for the whole day, instead of just going straight again in an hour.  </li>
            <li>Its ready to go fast and the styling time is fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I got the Miraqueen curling iron, I use to have a traditional curling iron but not all my curls looked good because it&#x27;s difficult to do the back of your hair</li>
            <li>My hair is pin straight but using the Miraqueen Curling Iron helps to get the looks I want.</li>
            <li>Once your hair is in, the machine will beep, and once it is ready to release, it will beep faster.</li>
            <li>Thanks for bringing MiraQueen to amazon.  </li>
            <li>you are getting so much out of it</li>
            <li>the amount of hair spray I had to use just to keep the curl was so much that my hair would never&lt;br /&gt;look</li>
            <li>This has really better then what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>My wife has naturally straight hair and likes to curl it often.  </li>
            <li>It makes my mornings so much easier.  </li>
            <li>The curling iron itself is very durable and well made.</li>
            <li>I also really like the auto shut-off feature.  </li>
            <li>She has very wavy hair that tends to frizz</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helpful and convenient</li>
            <li>Took me 15 mins to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>It is really revolutionary</li>
            <li>I can set the timer and it beeps when the curlers are ready for use.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s hair and worked very well.</li>
            <li>The technology and functionality of this iron is really amazing.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Not to mention the curls/waves are absolutely effortless to create.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this curler to anyone.</li>
            <li>I would however recommend you get the detangler and pay attention to how much hair you put in curler.</li>
            <li>The whole issue was my fault</li>
            <li>No need for too much hair spray.</li>
            <li>I guess I can&#x27;t say much for the product, because I never got to use it.  </li>
            <li>The ease of use (once you figure it out) makes curling your hair a much quicker process than &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; curling irons.</li>
            <li>With the MiraQueen, you hear a beep when your hair is done and ready to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went straight to the bathroom and curled my hair.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have much time or patience to fiddle with my hair</li>
            <li>It recognizes when you add too much and will beep to notify you and then uncoil.</li>
            <li>The device beeps @ you if you try putting too much hair in it, so don&#x27;t panic if that happens &amp; just release the lever &amp; try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did get my hair tangled a couple of times trying to curl either too much hair</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I ordered one of these for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Haha.  </li>
            <li>(I put too much hair into it and it beeped and spit my hair out - then never took up hair again).</li>
            <li>It tells you when there is too much hair in chamber.  </li>
            <li>: I have so much hair, B:</li>
            <li>the real difference in any of them.</li>
            <li>My curls have never had so much volume and shine.</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and his mother really adored me with the curls.</li>
            <li>And that I didn&#x27;t used to curl my hair much before.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t very time consuming either.</li>
            <li>So basically I’ve just lived with straight hair forever.</li>
            <li>I really like doing the wavy curls, but I’ve done some tighter spirals too as part of up-dos and this iron works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like that they thought about that stuff when making this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have stick straight hair, and I had given up on trying to add any curl to it because it would never hold.</li>
            <li>, within an hour my hair would just fall straight again.</li>
            <li>but I never went through with it because I didn&#x27;t like the idea of putting that much chemical processing in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of layers in my hair, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>It saves her a lot of time because it curls her hair much faster.  </li>
            <li>So it really means something</li>
            <li>I purchased this curling iron for my wife, as I really like the way her hair looks when it&#x27;s curled, but she never enjoys the process of curling her hair.</li>
            <li>have to agree with the everyone else, the chamber feature is really neat to watch.</li>
            <li>and she really seems to like</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to anyone who need it!.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to even consider purchasing the MIraqueen because nothing ever works to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>The beeps helped me to know when the hair was ready also.</li>
            <li>timer function is very helpful, too.</li>
            <li>really hope you guys try this out.</li>
            <li>really hope you guys try this out.</li>
            <li>This is what my wife needs for her naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li>and she just absolutely adores this product for both its efficiency and simpleness in getting her hair to curl.</li>
            <li>so I can decide how much curl I want.</li>
            <li>2) Don&#x27;t try to do too much at once.</li>
            <li>I can be really picky about the types of irons and wands I use on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Her hair is shorter and much thinner.  </li>
            <li>This is really what it is.</li>
            <li>to be a real celebrity look alike.</li>
            <li>This product really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I admit it, I don&#x27;t like to spend too much time and effort on my hair.</li>
            <li>Whenever I see advertised products, it just seems to take so much time and effort, and I don&#x27;t have that much time during the day.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this curling iron!</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is extremely straight and even when we put curlers in overnight, her hair never seems to retain the curl.  </li>
            <li>Here are some tips, treat the curling iron gently, and do not put too much hair into the roller.</li>
            <li>The styling time is fast but the curls look like it may have taken me hours to create.</li>
            <li>After I remembered how much she cursed at her curling iron every morning</li>
            <li>It Heats up really fast and well.</li>
            <li>It heats fast.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Where has this curling iron been my whole life?  </li>
            <li>it wants to do.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The videos here were really helpful.</li>
            <li>Do not put too much hair at a time in.  </li>
            <li>Well, she&#x27;s very touchy about her hair and was very concerned with using devices like this to do the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never paid that much for a curling iron before</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>I watched a video before trying to use it which really helped get the hang of how it was supposed to work.</li>
            <li>style really holds up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heat up time is fast</li>
            <li>really like the led display because I can keep a eye on the temperature and the automatic curling feature is a life saver..</li>
            <li>No matter how much I used hair spray and a curling iron</li>
            <li>It was gentle on my hair and did not pull or tangle at all.</li>
            <li>gently remove the hair, brush it out, and retry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and efficient, and I can do a variety of things with my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased one of these for my wife (my head is shaved) and she really loves it.  </li>
            <li>With Miraqueen, it sets every time painlessly, and the whole night people ask where I got my hair done.</li>
            <li>After you get the hang of it, it is much faster then curling your hair with an iron.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It won&#x27;t pull out ur hair even if u put too much</li>
            <li>I figured that after I slept on my hair it would be straight when I woke up</li>
            <li>It also beeps whens it ready to use and when to release the handle.</li>
            <li>Let start off saying that I have really straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Using this curling iron has made the processes go so much faster and easier.  </li>
            <li>The curling wand even detects when you have placed to much hair into it.  </li>
            <li>Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is so worth the buy, just wait 4 seconds</li>
            <li>For the money it is quite a value and is made really well.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s always spending way too much time curling her hair.  </li>
            <li>The wife and I purchased this curling iron for her as a gift, and she absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I got one, and I will never go back to my cheap curling iron</li>
            <li>If you have any questions, just look at the reviews with videos---they were very helpful in making a decision for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The “R” for ready will stop blinking when the iron has reached your selected curling temperature.</li>
            <li>I very much enjoy curling my hair, but would do it very occasionally because the metal irons felt (and smelled)</li>
            <li>like they were very damaging.</li>
            <li>And it looked really</li>
            <li>girlfriend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Smooth curls are achieved regularly and with no problem.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s made very well.</li>
            <li>And when you put too much hair in it gives you an error beep.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>The machine itself takes about 1 minute from the time you turn it on until it&#x27;s ready to use at this setting.</li>
            <li>You will know it&#x27;s ready when it stops blinking</li>
            <li>When it does, it&#x27;s always my fault from putting too much hair in at once and the machine promptly stops.  </li>
            <li>My hair is stick straight</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so i had to play with it to the point that i might as well use a real curler.</li>
            <li>I have very baby-fine hair and layered about shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>it was too much hair and stopped.  </li>
            <li>It beeps at you if you put in too much hair (for me about 1 inch width is the max).</li>
            <li>I really like the results and may record a video...</li>
            <li>I really, really did.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for curling irons, I would absolutely suggest this one</li>
            <li>the curl held all day which was a real plus.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s design really targets those who want to save time and have hair like a goddess.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot</li>
            <li>Now with Miraqueen it stays curled all day, and I don&#x27;t have to use as much product in my hair.</li>
            <li>It seemed about a bit much for a hair curler, but the reviews made it seem so tempting, so I bought it anyways to see what the fuss was about.</li>
            <li>so she really can&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot longer than five minutes to curl 10&amp;#34; - 12&amp;#34; straight hair.</li>
            <li>Too much work.</li>
            <li>Plus it felt as if it took so much longer to curl my hair than if i were to use a curling iron!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it even \\&quot;knows\\&quot; somehow if you have too much hair in as it will unwind, and halt the curling pricess.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it because the heat is evenly distributed, thus produces longer lasting results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have as much time as I would hope to use this</li>
            <li>no diagrams telling you where to put your hair, how much, etc.</li>
            <li>and it tells you when it&#x27;s ready to be used.</li>
            <li>High quality product!</li>
            <li>You can really feel the quality when you use it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>How much hair do I curl at once?</li>
            <li>I have always done this but find with the Miraqueen it really holds up and make my locks bouncy.</li>
            <li>tourmaline technology really made a difference.</li>
            <li>I really recommend to have you try it out.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not thin</li>
            <li>especially compared to the mainstream curling iron we have had available for years&lt;br /&gt;--  </li>
            <li>Really seems to be kinder to my hair than the mainstream style curling iron</li>
            <li>and I love the way my curls last all through the evening even when I dance, perspire and am really wild.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how many settings it has for different curls</li>
            <li>However, in each case it was because I didn&#x27;t use the machine properly, either putting in too much hair or putting in hair with tangles (make sure your hair is COMPLETELY combed before using this or you will have issue).</li>
            <li>This is great for a casual, fun look.</li>
            <li>I have super thick, course hair and it gets tangled and ratty very easily</li>
            <li>It may be time for me to put down those hot rollers because this is just so much more convenient and much faster.</li>
            <li>This brand/model beats many others because you can make curls spiral left or right to hug your face or sweep back more&lt;br /&gt;--  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>It works pretty well and simplifies hair curling to a new degree.</li>
            <li>and NOTHING worked, This little appliance is easy and quick.</li>
            <li>It also got much hotter (450 degrees Farenheit) than most of the other models.</li>
            <li>It left my hair really curly and with its unique design</li>
            <li>I have used countless curling irons, curling brushes, hot rollers… all with the same results: after nearly frying my hair, I get nice curls, but within an hour or 2, they are falling out and my hair is straight again.</li>
            <li>so generally curls fall from my hair quite quickly.</li>
            <li>(None of them look as fancy as this, they are just the plain looking ones), but she always uses this one, so that is a good indication that this is a good curling iron, or at the very least, better than all of those average curling irons.</li>
            <li>I really like having this cutie as it&#x27;s also very easy to travel with, and an essential piece for every girl - I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I just straighten my hair first, section it, put my hair in the chamber and set the timer for 10 seconds (which I also love that you can choose how tight of curls you want based on the timers).</li>
            <li>after a couple of tries, she got a pretty good idea on how it works and why it’s definitely an improvement over her old one.</li>
            <li>and I go through a lot of misery to keep it clean and curl, some curlers only end up giving me pain by drying my hair out too much and some just go to the extreme of giving me more frizz than my desired curl.</li>
            <li>The digital control/display is very clear and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: After 6 months of very frequent use (practically daily) it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other curling iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Also make sure you don&#x27;t have any stray hairs from other parts of your head or they will get tangled.</li>
            <li>Unlike most of the other curling irons out there, it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair because it uses ceramic heating technology.</li>
            <li>It is a great little tool however, if you have a lot of hair as I do, this machine takes too long.</li>
            <li>She told that this is so much better than the other she have used before.</li>
            <li>but they just sprung back to it&#x27;s original shape.</li>
            <li>have extra long curly hair and this works great especially in humid weather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she had bought many other curling irons that did not work in her hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they work for other people, just not for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this after having tried so many other products out there.  </li>
            <li>Our friends are always asking her how she gets her curls so perfect, and after the first few days using it she has been thanking me at least once a day for it.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other hair curler because it doesn&#x27;t effect her hair in any way.</li>
            <li>I LOVE PINK! .</li>
            <li>Better than I expected !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless, if you&#x27;re like me and LOVE your hair curled but become very nervous when someone gets too close to your head with a conventional branding--er, curling--iron, you&#x27;ll adore this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless, if you&#x27;re like me and LOVE your hair curled but become very nervous when someone gets too close to your head with a conventional branding--er, curling--iron, you&#x27;ll adore this product.  </li>
            <li>I insisted she get a new one from time to time, but she had none of it, claiming that her old one did a great job and that she was just clumsy when using it.</li>
            <li>This is so simple to use with its 3 heat levels and 4 timber settings, it is suitable for multiple hair types.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend&#x27;s family invited me to go to a famous oyster place to grab some fresh oysters and picnic at the beach this past weekend.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t take a chance if your hair is long and fine.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t try to curl your hair in the shower you will be fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;--  Works very well on my relatively dry and fine hair and holds all day</li>
            <li>It turned out to be unnecessary: I was in the pouring rain, wearing hair-covering veil, but I thought it looked pretty good for the reception even after being drenched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t bother curling my hair or using more than a hair dryer to curl my hair due to time constraints and having very un-curler-friendly hair.</li>
            <li>The technology is VERY cool, but the results are very limited.</li>
            <li>I can last an entire week with a great loose curl after the one time.</li>
            <li>Knowing (and more important being reminded) how long the curler has been applied helps to get a consistent and predictable look every time.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, so it holds curls very very well.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to curl their hair.</li>
            <li>I remember when it was a simple plug up, wait to heat, grip it and continuously burn your scalp, now we have the Miraqueen proffesional curling iron, which is equipped with digital controls, a rotary function allowing you to choose the direction it curls, it heats in an reasonable amount of time and very comfortable when holding.</li>
            <li>One of the things I love about it is that if something is not right, it beeps 3 times to let you know.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had probably 20 or more conventional curling irons in my life.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t say much more about it, but I believe her because she has over 100k instagram followers and is a big influence on social media...</li>
            <li>like that the iron lets you know when it&#x27;s done by beeping and the whole system makes it feel much more safer than the ordinary curling iron (where it is entirely too easy to cause damage to your hair).</li>
            <li>which is a major accomplishment for me who ALWAYS has a pony tail for no reason other than it is a style that is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Evidently her old one did not have these settings.</li>
            <li>The product came out of the box and plastic full of water spots, greasy finger prints and had blonde hairs stuck in it, and hanging over it.</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen curling iron works so well that her curls last a full day and even through the night.</li>
            <li>my hair looks full and bouncy, as if i stepped out of the salon- and last all day!&lt;br /&gt;love it!</li>
            <li>When my mom saw it the first time and saw it in action, she said she has dreamed about someone making something like this as she hand rolled her hair each time.  </li>
            <li>let you know when it&#x27;s ready, so you&#x27;re over-doing it or wasting too much time, And I have to admit the automatic curling is actually kinda fun to</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to be in control of their curling process but still be able to do it with ease and with a lesser risk of damaging their hair.</li>
            <li>I am a mother of two, one of which is a toddler, and fixing my hair is not a top priority though I&#x27;ve always sought out ways to curly my hair which is so popular now</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, is gives you a consistent curls.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That is why I never worry burning my hands while handling the curling iron because it leaves the outside area cool.</li>
            <li>I feel like this was due to the fact that, after sucking up the end section of hair, it kept trying to suck up more and more hair that wasn&#x27;t there, which could have tightly curled some of the hair in the chamber.  </li>
            <li>Its really safe, and as long as you keep the hair in the &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; then you wont have any issues with hair getting caught, and even when if it does a little bit, it lets go easily and doesn&#x27;t cause damage or hurt.</li>
            <li>also really like how it&#x27;s not hard to use</li>
            <li>case you forget, which I love because I don&#x27;t have to worry about the house burning down.</li>
            <li>And I love that it&#x27;s not hot!</li>
            <li>This is great for the mom on the go, the fashionista (like myself) any length of hair(I mean not bald obviously) and any type of hair, curly, straight, processed, not processed etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for: less time, no burnt smell, hair extension friendly, comfortable for small hands, and affordable.</li>
            <li>As a salon owner we are always seeing new products and well this one just blew us away!  </li>
            <li>And the price was great, it was like half the price of other brands I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>The kind of hair that you curl with a curling iron, hair spray until it’s as hard as plastic, and then somehow it’s still straight within 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Automatic is really the new age.</li>
            <li>MiraQueen is also light and easy to grasp, making those accidental drops less likely to happen and reduce fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>This heats up very quickly and works as expected.</li>
            <li>I was able to curl all of my hair in less than 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>To hold the curl perfectly and add a bit of shine I used about an 1/8th of a teaspoon of coconut oil on the bottom half of my hair and the ends, to wet or dry hair before I curled my hair.</li>
            <li>It was more like a half wave.</li>
            <li>- less is better when loading it in.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is  ceramic, which makes it less damaging for your hair than metal curling irons.</li>
            <li>I love that it is ceramic, which makes it less damaging for my hair than metal curling irons.</li>
            <li>Luckily, once was enough!  </li>
            <li>I can report my hair did not tangle once, and after a few curls I was able to figure out how much hair was supposed to go in the barrel.</li>
            <li>After trying so many different curling irons, I have finally found a winner!</li>
            <li>It feels very solidly built to last for many years.</li>
            <li>I will personally always keep it on the alternate setting because I think the curls look better &amp; make your hair look fuller that way.</li>
            <li>It automatically turns off which makes me feel better since I have a two year old and am forgetful sometimes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great for everyone to use, definitely buy this curler if you want to be sure you aren&#x27;t going to have to buy a different again!</li>
            <li>Its way more convenient than a regular curler and the curls last forever.</li>
            <li>When I got this one (because of the digital controls) I could get the same curl pattern by setting it on 8 seconds and 370 deg, so this one is going to be more flexible in what I can do with it.  </li>
            <li>I love that I am choose different curls for different days.</li>
            <li>my hair holds cute corkscrew curls all day long with barely any hairspray.</li>
            <li>Super simple tho.</li>
            <li>this is just so you know my particular challenges as I was looking for something to style my hair in a manner that would stay and not turn</li>
            <li>I have spent my entire life wishing for nice curls.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and has multiple heat settings to choose from.</li>
            <li>I did not think it would, but I compared my older curling iron with this one and</li>
            <li>The only change I would make is to be able to decrease the temperature further than is allowed.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I had to live my life so far without it!!!</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a new curling iron.!</li>
            <li>That being said, I would recommend the Miraqueen to ANY girl who wants to achieve natural, bouncy curls - or if you have very very straight hair, this iron will provide you with natural looking waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first I was hesitant about using it because it has such a different design than regular curling irons, but it is actually very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a fantastic product, I recommend it to all ladies and guys that are looking for a gift to give their significant other.</li>
            <li>It is not nearly as user friendly as it seems in the videos, or by reading instructions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve personally noticed that her hair looks and feels better, and it doesn&#x27;t take her nearly as long to get ready.</li>
            <li>To be such a high tech iron, it is extremely affordable compared to other models, and is very easy and safe to use.</li>
            <li>After getting my first curler from my new roommate, my hair and lifestyle has changed completely.</li>
            <li>you want a tight, classier, more controlled curl, do use a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I have stick straight, very fine hair that will only hold a very loose curl for a minimum length of time of time.  </li>
            <li>With the protective case, you can put the curling iron away right after use instead of waiting for it to cool down.</li>
            <li>It came with a protective case, so I can put my curling iron away right after I use instead it of waiting for it to cool down.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for salon-styled hair at home, I would highly recommend this item as a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the&amp;#34;Miraqueen&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this one because it had everything I was looking for (ceramic - high heat – timer).  </li>
            <li>It appeared bulky and a bit high tech.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I used very thin strands and even with that and the highest, longest heat setting, the best I got was big waves.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I suggest any girls that need a high quality curling iron purchase this because somehow it always manages to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you can get one, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I will admit I was more than a little hesitant to use this product given the price about the quality, but I am on a tight budget and did not have many options.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The curls are also longer lasting than when I&#x27;ve used other irons - It is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It is less time consuming to use a regular curling iron or curlers, but the results are not as near as good.  </li>
            <li>and I could work the product very easily, however you could only take very tiny pieces of hair and even on the highest setting and the longest time the curls were not very tight.</li>
            <li>the powerful little motor in there must have a brain because it knew right away and un-raveled my hair automatically!</li>
            <li>The curls hold up well in dance even when they&#x27;re 12 hours old already!!)</li>
            <li>I also love that this will turn off automatically instead of staying all day causing a safety hazard with little kids running around.</li>
            <li>If you just want the ends you can use a little bit more hair.</li>
            <li>Curling was easy anf quick, even with my thick</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t pull a piece too small or too large or it won&#x27;t suck up the hair correctly.  </li>
            <li>Small hanks of hair work much better than large or medium.  </li>
            <li>NOT FOR FINE HAIR, and the curl on this is actually very loose and does not hold more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li>It definitely has a learning curve, the key is to place smaller strands in the iron, and to make sure your hair is absolutely tangle free and to also make sure the device is horizontal as any vertical movement causes it to jam (which is not a pleasant feeling, trust me).  </li>
            <li>My hair is super flat</li>
            <li>This is the new age and new technology!</li>
            <li>Heats up very fast and seems to handle the multiple tasks very well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to a woman that&#x27;s on-the-go but still wants to look really professional and put-together.</li>
            <li>The product works great and the curl actually not only stays in all day, but the next day it just needs a little touch-up</li>
            <li>THIS BAD BOY IS AWESOME...</li>
            <li>Wow... this really works.</li>
            <li>It is pin straight naturally.</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of it, my whole head of hair took about twelve minutes to get a soft wave.</li>
            <li>This professional curling iron has worked miracles on my normally straight hair.</li>
            <li>It makes her hair look absolutely amazing and it wasn&#x27;t expensive at all, especially with the 20% off :).</li>
            <li>is that it beeps loudly the whole time you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>The beep it makes when it finished curling your hair is great because I was tired of guessing when it was done, now I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning any of my hair!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 11 year old daughter who absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>With normal curling irons,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Found only about one inch of hair could be curled at a time, pretty fast but didn&#x27;t hold a curl well for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I am so tired of my straight long hair, though others always tell me, it&#x27;s beautiful anyway.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t normally curl her hair with curling wands but just ties it up at night and lets it curl with the rubber band as it dries.</li>
            <li>It has quite a few features that I love.</li>
            <li>This works great on my daughters thick long hair.  </li>
            <li>so normally when she uses curling irons</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll re-curl a few spots if I need to look better in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The curl does stay on the entire day and rarely looses it&#x27;s form.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I don’t have to sit there and count out how long I have to hold the curler in place and that I don’t have to physically wrap my hair around a curling iron.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The thing that wowed me the most was how long the curls last.</li>
            <li>It is rare to have such a determining role in how your curls will look, and for this product to offer that is just another reason why I prefer this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>She was able to watch a few YouTube videos to figure everything out</li>
            <li>The everyday use of the Miraqueen curling iron is effortless and safe.</li>
            <li>I lost a few strands and decided that while with practice I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d get over the learning curve, BUT I&#x27;m too nervous to try it again.  </li>
            <li>it almost seemed like it grabbed a few stray hairs that weren&#x27;t in the chamber, but I&#x27;m not even sure how that could happen.  </li>
            <li>and my stepdaughter can use it on her normal hair (410 degrees).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using curling irons for decades and the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is definitely one of my top ten favorites.</li>
            <li>I used to fuss with hot rollers and had to allow for so much extra time in the mornings to get ready.</li>
            <li>Isn’t’ it time to stop the curling iron burns while creating long lasting curls and waves that you can be confident about?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like a normal iron</li>
            <li>The alternating curl directs each curl in the opposite direction of the last curl which looks a lot more natural than the curls all going in one direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen Curling Iron turns limp, lifeless hair into gorgeous curls within seconds, the machine beeping to tell you hold long to hold the hair in for.</li>
            <li>I wear minimal makeup and don&#x27;t like spending too long on my hair, but I DO like to look nice.</li>
            <li>My normal method of obtain these curls is a grueling process that require me sitting under a hooded drier for hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to keep trying with different product then, curling.</li>
            <li>And for the most part it&#x27;s been a waste, until now!&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like me and have struggled finding curlers that work the way they advertise and actually work son hair that is at time resistant to curling, this is worth trying.  </li>
            <li>I wouLd normally spend about and hour curling my hair.  </li>
            <li>The everyday use of the Miraqueen curling iron is effortless and safe.</li>
            <li>It is more like a hybrid cross between a traditional curling iron and actual hot rollers, and in minutes it can replicate the look of a perm--without the stink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even max temperature (450F) and max time heating didn&#x27;t give me anything more than a limp wave.</li>
            <li>My wife bought it a few weeks ago and really love using</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much of a girly-girl, so I&#x27;ve never been able to justify the time, attention and frustration to use most curling irons with such terrible results, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try along with the best rated hair spray and curl prep gel I could find.</li>
            <li>I have never found a curling iron that I met and liked because my hair is thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li>The directions are fair, lots of misspellings and poor grammar.</li>
            <li>This thing gives your hair a desired look; depending on the level of the setting, you can have beautiful loose curls or really tight curls that LAST.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the price is a little higher than the wands you can find at Target and other stores, it&#x27;s a great investment and will be the only curler you need!</li>
            <li>It was not hard to use.  </li>
            <li>After watching some iffy commercials and reviews on YouTube, I spent some time on the Miraqueen website and I was pretty intrigued right off the bat.</li>
            <li>This iron works amazing on wet and dry hair with no worry of over drying or burning your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that this curling iron offers this feature because it is one less thing I have to worry about.</li>
            <li>The digital control features made this really easy to use and get the same result every time.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, coarse hair and although it does hold a curl pretty easily, my hair frizzes rather quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair is really straight and fine and was a little unsure of how this Miraqueen iron would work on it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has the option to have your curls go left, right, or automatic which alternates between the 2.</li>
            <li>You can chose between right, left, or alternating.</li>
            <li>It even has a curl direction control where you can make left and right spiraling curls according to your preference.</li>
            <li>You can curl your hair to the left, right or auto (which alternates between the two).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about it, so just go for it!  </li>
            <li>I also wanted to mention that in the past I have had lots of heat damage because of frequent heat-styling but, because of the ceramic design my hair actually feels much softer after curling and it is very shiny, so amazing.</li>
            <li>It really gives you full control to achieve what can&#x27;t be achieved with other products.</li>
            <li>cause my hair is super long.</li>
            <li>This iron lets me change the direction of each curl - pretty cool - and the curls I get are tight curls.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to store and works a heck of a lot better than the other irons I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, I can sit it down anywhere without burning something, I can watch tv and do my hair.</li>
            <li>But with this handy new device, I can easily curl my hair in about half the time it usually takes!</li>
            <li>Occasionally, I&#x27;ll get in a hurry and try to put too much hair in it, but when I do, it always makes a strange sound, stops and releases my hair.  </li>
            <li>On the second day I can just brush out my hair and I have those soft pretty day curls!  </li>
            <li>Congratulations on buying something you&#x27;ll be excited about, will use twice, will give you super mild results, and then you will put away awkwardly because it&#x27;s huge and think about throwing out for a year before you finally give it to a friend who will do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>My wife has been needing a new curling iron for quite some time</li>
            <li>but it also made my course hair well curled and seems to hold a new bounce to it.</li>
            <li>Don’t let a new style or technology of curler intimidate you.</li>
            <li>Everyone thought I got a new haircut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But with any new product out, it’s a trial and error process.</li>
            <li>so I thought I would surprise her with a new one.  </li>
            <li>This is my new go to curling iron.</li>
            <li>she got her new curling iron and tried it out a couple of times.</li>
            <li>Well, it really is my new toy.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptic at first like any other customer would be, but this Miraqueen Iron is purely amazing.</li>
            <li>I seriously didn&#x27;t I could make my own hair look like this without paying someone.</li>
            <li>Love this and would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants some curls with less effort.</li>
            <li>Then when I first came across this device, first it caught my eyes because of the design &amp; features and then the reviews just made me curious.</li>
            <li>:) I can look like I spent hours on my hair when I only spend a fraction of the time I used to!</li>
            <li>Watch some youtube videos (even if they are for the conair pro or babybliss) for more tips or tricksd you can then grab all of them at the root together and carefully run your thumb and forefinger along them to combine into one big fat curl</li>
            <li>I bet after a tiny bit more practice, I could do my whole head in less than 15 minutes, maybe 10...</li>
            <li>However, this mostly happens if you either try to stuff too much hair into the curler at once or if you fail to adequately detangle/separate the hair before curling it.  </li>
            <li>If you are willing to put in a bit of time learning to use it and play around with it a bit the product gives quick long lasting curls.</li>
            <li>I might get lucky and end up with one curl that looks good and the next one looks all weird and bendy?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Something else that is very useful is that there is an lcd screen that shows the timer and temperature (among other information).  </li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a new curling iron, I highly recommend the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li>and I brought her attention to something very important to me, unlike several other curlers that I have tried out</li>
            <li>You also have to get used to the different grip from curling the right side to left (because you have to hold it differently since the same side of the device always has to be the side touching your head)</li>
            <li>Not only does it do an amazing job of curling your hair the curls last a really long time!!  </li>
            <li>, I just couldn&#x27;t get the technique right, so I stuck with just flat ironing it for years.</li>
            <li>I WOULD DEFINITELY WATCH THE YOU TUBE VIDEO ON HOW TO USE THIS MACHINE PRIOR TO FIRST USE!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Miraqueen to anyone from a pageant queen to a natural beaut - get on it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very busy person and it outlast my day.</li>
            <li>The easy release trigger makes the whole process extremely easy and the curls last up to four days; saving you time and giving you a “high maintenance” look for several days with little to no maintenance necessary with the Miraqueen Curling Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the website clearly says that an R, L or A will show for Right, Left or Alternating curls.</li>
            <li>This amazing curler has three dynamic settings for three different kinds of curls; I am more obsessed with the lowest one because it gives me a very loose curl that I do enjoy during summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very often that as a Dad I find something that they both really like, but a friend recommended it to me and they were totally right.</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to in the beginning but after a few times you&#x27;ll get more comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>It is hard to use on yourself but great for doing other people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It did not get hot enough to burn my hand or head - though I still might not put it completely up to my scalp on the high setting.  </li>
            <li>The heat and timer settings allow you to easily adjust how tight you want your curls</li>
            <li>She said it heats up quickly, is easy to use, and the curls last much longer than any other curling iron she has used before.  </li>
            <li>It is very fine, but has just enough of a wave pattern to stick out at odd angles.  </li>
            <li>It worked for about five seconds longer than the cheaper models and then ended up in exactly the same place…the trash.  </li>
            <li>definitely a nono when trying to wield a hot iron!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>beeping timer helps you to make each curl exactly the same each time as well as protects against burning your hair if you happen to lose track of time.</li>
            <li>After my first fiasco (totally my fault) I have had no problems and my curls stay for hours without any type of spray holding them!</li>
            <li>If you try to give it any more than the very small section, it will give the warning beeps that there is too much hair.</li>
            <li>When I used hairspray first, similar to the video review for this produce, I could hear a sizzling noise.</li>
            <li>The first week I had it I must have created 6 different hair styles.</li>
            <li>Grab this professional Miraqueen curling iron now!</li>
            <li>got home after work and all I can say is Wow!</li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift from my husband and I&#x27;ve used it more in the short time I&#x27;ve had it than any other hair tool I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li>Love it and the curl usually lasts 2 days.</li>
            <li>In fact, heaven forbid I lose this baby, I&#x27;ll be buying the exact same one.</li>
            <li>I love that I can choose from 3 different curl settings, which I have never seen on any other curling iron before.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>There was this award night I attended recently that left me breathless because more than six ladies came back to my home to use my curler</li>
            <li>With the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, Curling Wand, Hair Curler with Ceramic Curling Chamber you’ll have the option of  leaving waves in your straight hair for an entire day or wearing it straight once again in under an hour.</li>
            <li>I was able to neatly curl my hair in no more than 10 min.  </li>
            <li>After years of using a curling iron, my hair is pretty damaged especially at the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, I really think this iron is worth the money and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last week for my birthday</li>
            <li>With the Miraqueen it&#x27;s so simple, you just place a section of hair into the compartment and hold it there for the timer you selected, then it beeps letting you know that your curl is ready to be released!</li>
            <li>and then I do have to re-curl a strand of hair that did not curl the first time, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I spend too much time on my hair and yet my curls barely make it through the day.  </li>
            <li>Trust me, this is no ordinary curling iron off the walmart shelf.  </li>
            <li>It truly is a professional tool of the trade for anyone with hair!</li>
            <li>Well not no more with this iron, it features a &amp;#34;curl chamber&amp;#34; , which allows the hair to glide and heat more evenly, rather than pull and tug at her hair.</li>
            <li>I did get &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; by the end and leaned it against my head because it doesn&#x27;t get too hot on the outside to burn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its features include three different heat levels and four timer settings, so you can get exactly the curls you want.</li>
            <li>I got the pink one and it looks really cool.  </li>
            <li>But the great thing was that when it did get &amp;#34;caught&amp;#34;, I just unplugged the device and slowly pulled out the strands very carefully and had no issue with getting my hair untangled.  </li>
            <li>my hair was fizzled and felt dry whereas the Mira Queen felt lively and fresh.</li>
            <li>My hair smelt burnt  and the little curl that the iron did give, did not last for more than an hour before completely going straight.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is ready to use in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is ready for me to use in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair that has a very hard time holding curl.  </li>
            <li>The machine is so easy to use too and on average, I have timed the entire process at 14 minutes to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li>With the protective case, you can put it away right away instead of waiting for it to cool back down.</li>
            <li>I have tried them all; the old fashioned type, the trendy no clip tapered barrel irons, and those in crazy shapes and in many different sizes.</li>
            <li>I still love it and it has held up under near constant use (just about every other day).  </li>
            <li>I decided it&#x27;s time to chuck out the old curlers and get a new one.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t wait around for too long, guessing if it is the right temperature</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t wait around for too long, guessing if it is the right temperature</li>
            <li>(this is a very minor issue but thought it was worth noting!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy or bulky either which is great for small hands.</li>
            <li>Just fabulous ringlets, and perhaps a bit of hair spray after she&#x27;s done to extend how long it will last for her.</li>
            <li>My hair got stuck a few times but it was easy to ease it out and did not get split or cut up.  </li>
            <li>Given that she was used to her old one, the first time she tried it out she couldn&#x27;t quite work it properly</li>
            <li>It would be great for long thin hair.  </li>
            <li>(I always mess up my right side with the old iron &amp;#62;&amp;#60; )</li>
            <li>I saw that it&#x27;s advertised as only taking 5 minutes, which is NOT true (unless you barely have any hair), but you&#x27;ll be satisfied if you have reasonable expectations.</li>
            <li>The use of the curl chamber and rubber protector keeps any hot surfaces away from her face and head and since there isn&#x27;t any hot metal exposed, we never have to worry about where we set it down.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure what it does exactly that is different than a normal curling iron on my super straight hair</li>
            <li>So far I have seen it work well on fine, dry and coarse hair!  </li>
            <li>It is a professional product without the professional price!</li>
            <li>I have tried curling my hair with curling irons, flat irons, hot rollers and even heatless curls</li>
            <li>The curls that comes out are real slick and nice.</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen is a smart curling iron--If you try to curl too much at once, the iron will beep at you to tell you it&#x27;s too much and to try again with less.</li>
            <li>her curls won&#x27;t last for more than half a day.</li>
            <li>because it has more of a perm effect and style, she is half British</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this unit for a few months and it heats up super fast.  </li>
            <li>I was super hesitant because it was more expensive than I prefer to spend on a curling device</li>
            <li>Once you get it down though, you will be able to do your whole head is five to ten minutes unlike spending 45 minutes with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>It has several different settings for all different types of hair, so you can easily find a settings (or settings)</li>
            <li>It will only take so much hair to curl and beeps when it is ready, making it so easy to use for someone with such little experience like myself.</li>
            <li>The iron beeps when your hair is curled or waved to your specific desire (loose, medium, or tight), so hair is never in for a dangerously long amount of time (good for people like me, who sometimes get distracted whilst putting hot things on their hair).&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>This is the one product that we&#x27;ve found so far that easily achieves those results, no other iron has worked even half as well.</li>
            <li>Not only that, my curls are very pronounced and can last up to three days, with just a quick 20 mins the following morning to freshen up my curls.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and I finish curling my hair in almost no time, which is excellent because I hate getting up earlier than necessary just to fuss with my hair.</li>
            <li>This is great for loose, natural waves, or hard curls and is made simple!</li>
            <li>If you want a few extra tight curls to mix in with softer curls or you want the Shirlet Temple look, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical as I&#x27;m not the best on doing my hair</li>
            <li>so while it takes awhile for me to straighten my hair, which is my typical style, I was excited to have found another way of styling it.</li>
            <li>I like spending a little more on a purchase knowing that I&#x27;m going to have this product for the long-term, and it&#x27;s going to last, and get the results</li>
            <li>is different than any other curler that I have used before, but I found it really easy to use</li>
            <li>I love how this has reduced the amount of hair products I have, aside from my straightener which I spent hundreds on and am not ready to let go yet</li>
            <li>As someone with thick, coarse, hair, it&#x27;s amazing to find products that work so well and which is so efficient.</li>
            <li>The LCD screen makes it clear what I am using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried over brands before, but the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is the only one that really has worked for me.  </li>
            <li>and my wife absolutely loves to use it (especially the automatic shut-off because she is the type to not always remember to turn the curler off).</li>
            <li>My girlfriend has used it a couple of times so far when going out on the weekend.</li>
            <li>My curls last a whole week</li>
            <li>and I was quite surprised myself as far as the build quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the closest I&#x27;ve ever gotten to professional curls.</li>
            <li>I appreciate having as much information as possible before making any purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On this iron, they are really well-designed and placed properly.  </li>
            <li>She really likes the different heat settings.</li>
            <li>I saw, what the Miraqueen Professional Hair Curler with the Ceramic Curling Chamber can do at a friend&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li>have not used my old, cumbersome curling iron since I got the Miraqueen Hair Curler.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a curling iron, I would suggest this one and avoid some old metal rod that will burn you up.</li>
            <li>But the description hooked me and I had to see it in action for myself.</li>
            <li>Much faster than with a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Age 12 and uses it frequently.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works on some hair types far better---as it seemed to for the video review.</li>
            <li>I really like that it has different settings so you can customize the intensity of the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 11 year old daughter</li>
            <li>(that I&#x27;ve tried by far)</li>
            <li>The result is soft and classy without looking overdone.  </li>
            <li>I get compliments frequently.</li>
            <li>At the bottom it curls just enough to keep it from looking like curled hair over straight hair.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 13 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I have tried it out 4x so far</li>
            <li>I feel like if I use it daily my hair won&#x27;t be enduring so much damage compared to when I use my flatiron.</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen curling iron gives my hair the volume it really needs to last all day.</li>
            <li>It curls up my entire head of hair fast</li>
            <li>So I decided to splurge after using my old school curler for ages.</li>
            <li>as opposed to how I always burned myself with my old curler.</li>
            <li>This was by far the fastest and painless curling iron I’ve used.</li>
            <li>Her curls seems to last a lot longer, I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something that is not harsh on my non chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>It used to take me thirty minutes to curl my hair the old way.</li>
            <li>I bought the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron with bated breath.</li>
            <li>I cant curl my hair the old fashioned way this a life saver.</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron does not look like any curling iron you have seen before because it is NOT like any curling iron you have seen before.</li>
            <li>How much easier can it get than simply selecting a time setting to determine</li>
            <li>As a city girl and college student it&#x27;s embarrassing how far I have gotten in life without learning how to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>and I ran out and bought the same iron in another size, because I have so much confidence in it.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend has been using this product for nearly a month</li>
            <li>Furthermore, there&#x27;s also the protection and assurity this product offers to yourself and your hair.</li>
            <li>directions were fairly straight forward as were the controls on the actual curling iron.</li>
            <li>She received it nearly a week ago and has used it twice since.</li>
            <li>, I can always count on the same curl pattern and it cuts about 10 minutes off of my time to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get it while this deal is available, then you&#x27;re just missing out.</li>
            <li>I was completely inefficient - without the gloves I was burning myself and it took forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loves it because she doesn´t have to wake up early to make her hair before work.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair, which I thought might have been the problem, but my sister used it after I did.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see with this</li>
            <li>I used to forget to do this with manual curling irons, so my curls wouldn&#x27;t turn out quite as natural.</li>
            <li>, I think I&#x27;ll stick with my old school curling iron.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 12 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless, I have a few important notes about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron has changed all that for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quicker to use a curling iron in my opinion, but this product makes the curl last much longer.  </li>
            <li>No problems so far with this one.</li>
            <li>how ruined her old one...</li>
            <li>This curling iron has FAR EXCEEDED my expectations.</li>
            <li>Now I can curl my entire head, fast and with ease and the curls come out uniform</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and it tends to do whatever the heck</li>
            <li>Unlike several curlers I have been using, it takes me so much time before I get used to them.</li>
            <li>Then it beeps to know that the 12 seconds is complete.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I bought the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron as a gift for my sister who just finished cosmetology school.  </li>
            <li>and I came across the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.  </li>
            <li>Get a professional look for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>This professional curling iron does the job it says and</li>
            <li>I received the Miraqueen Professional Curing Iron as a gift from my mom.</li>
            <li>That is a complete fabrication.  </li>
            <li>I think I have been a guinea pig for nearly every hair care product ever made.</li>
            <li>I use Wen for cleaning my hair - don&#x27;t really think that makes a difference overall, but it does hold the color in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believed they would be simple, fast and give me the look i wanted.</li>
            <li>Professional curling iron, ceramic technology, protects hair from damage.</li>
            <li>(i always toasted the ends with my old fashioned iron)</li>
            <li>, that is straight everywhere except for the waves in the back.</li>
            <li>She is in her early teens</li>
            <li>heard Miraqueen Professional curling iron from a friend, who squares by it.  </li>
            <li>The setting let you control how hot for your hair type and even how long to heat the hair.</li>
            <li>It will beep when its ready and the curls are so curly and stay all day into the next day.</li>
            <li>My curls stayed completely in for the 4 hours I had my hair done.</li>
            <li>Curling iron aesthetics haven’t changed much in the last million years or so</li>
            <li>AND IT IS PRETTY LONG</li>
            <li>This is a professional product and that&#x27;s what you get.</li>
            <li>A well made professional product.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I leave the bathroom in the middle of getting ready and forget to unplug my curling iron.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty long</li>
            <li>Read some reviews - decided to go with the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron -</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice so far</li>
            <li>Use the auto rotate feature except for the 1-2 curls directly by your face which you curl outward.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I received the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron as a gift</li>
            <li>I had completely given up on curling irons-</li>
            <li>At a friend&#x27;s request, I tried the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li>Throw away your old curling iron.</li>
            <li>Professional Curling Iron is what i use to curl my hair after taking a shower..</li>
            <li>Ready to have a different style week after week?</li>
            <li>the curls look totally professional.</li>
            <li>My curls last much longer</li>
            <li>I must say I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>They go from curly, curly to soft waves, but they are still there .....</li>
            <li>I thought I could only wear straight hair styles</li>
            <li>I used to forget to do this with manual curling irons, so my curls wouldn&#x27;t turn out quite as natural.</li>
            <li>It is a safe, efficient alternative to several cheap curling irons that don&#x27;t work or expensive chemical perm treatments that can eventually ruin your hair.</li>
            <li>It has a guided set of beeps sounds so that you know exactly how long to leave it in your hair to get the desired look shape and tightness of the curl.</li>
            <li>I recommend this curling tool over standard curling wands, much easier.</li>
            <li>This is a product I would expect to see at a professional and chic salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks and works like a professional curling wand.</li>
            <li>The LED display is clear and concise with built in timer, temperature and heat notice when the iron reached 370º.</li>
            <li>its natural frizzy wavy to it</li>
            <li>got it for my 11 year old daughter-</li>
            <li>So, I cannot comment on what it is going to do to your hair if used frequently.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m sure it will last me quite a few years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to go a couple days with only having to put a few curls in after sleeping on.</li>
            <li>so maybe that&#x27;s just me), and I wouldn&#x27;t go to the trouble of doing this just for work, but this works so much better than traditional curling irons, and</li>
            <li>This curling iron is one of the few I have used where the curl actually stays in for more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>My hair is really thick and most curls fall out within the hour</li>
            <li>It has beeped to tell me that I have too much hair it in many times and hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li>Needless to say she loved it and could not stop talking about it every time she called me.</li>
            <li>This curling curling iron was able to handle my thick hair with ease.</li>
            <li>It took a bit of practice and time to figure out how to get nice curls for me, but I have extremely thin and flyaway hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always skeptical to make purchases online because you never know what you&#x27;re going to get, but this was a really good buy</li>
            <li>This device is great if you want very small tight curls.</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve to it, however I found that by the time I was done with my head (it took me about 20 minutes the first time I used it), I really had a method down that worked for me.  </li>
            <li>and it sucked in her hair like a vacuum and was ready to curl</li>
            <li>Also you can select left, right, or alternate, which is the direction your curls will fall.  </li>
            <li>Considering that it&#x27;s actually on sale right now, I&#x27;m actually thinking of getting my mother one of these for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Up until now, I’ve used a professional Marcel Iron, even on my own hair, but I’m seriously considering switching just to this!</li>
            <li>Yeah, I’m a guy writing this review, but I’m also a single father who loves his daughter very much.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it turns itself off using a timer, so no more leaving the house worrying if I did or not!</li>
            <li>Other irons I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t get hot enough to keep my curl, or get too hot</li>
            <li>Oh, and one more thing, in my research, I did see where possibly some of the other brands don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;alternating&amp;#34; option for the curl direction or maybe only curled in one direction.  </li>
            <li>but I would say it took 35-40 minutes the first time (mostly because of trial and error) and less than 30 min the second time - definitely comparable to a flat iron timing for me.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to change so no more frying part of your hair</li>
            <li>easy release (no more hair getting tangled and scorched as you</li>
            <li>So, after less than about 15mins I had a full set of curls.</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair, that used to never curl and have always wanted loose wavy curls.</li>
            <li>It was very hard to get the back of my hair into it successfully because it&#x27;s so huge that very little would actually be in the machine.</li>
            <li>So much easier than trying to use a flat iron to curl your hair.</li>
            <li>I left early for work and  left it on the kitchen table boxed in with a pretty purple ribbon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At first i was really confused about it because i have used many similar product</li>
            <li>Many a professional have struggled to get my hair to hold a curl for more than half an hour, and every one has failed.</li>
            <li>I use the lower setting for loose curls and the higher settings for when I want a lot of volume.</li>
            <li>This will probably be the last curling iron you buy... until you wear it out and need a new one!</li>
            <li>The most my hair would curl was slightly at the ends &amp; even with product, it would only last about an hour.</li>
            <li>I am particularly fond of the LED display and the different temperature settings.</li>
            <li>and it hangs pretty limp if I don’t use a lot of product and make the effort to really style it.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is worth it just because it is motorized and pulls the hair into the chamber, rather than clumsily having to wrap it around a hot barrel yourself.  </li>
            <li>Would not recommend,don&#x27;t get hot enough &amp; the basis is to big!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only a hot curling iron NEXT to your face</li>
            <li>I found it to be so simple and easy, that someone like me, who is a beginner and has never bothered with curling irons (because of my thick, straight hair) could work it.</li>
            <li>my hair does not curl that easily and C: I am just not very good at curling it.</li>
            <li>You are able to get loose and wavy curls, medium curls, or tight and springy curls.</li>
            <li>Since growing out my hair, I have been searching high and low for something that will allow a curl to stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li>However, I have only been burned after keeping the curler on high for an extended period of time (while my sister, mom, and I were taking turns using it), which gave the protective lining time to heat up.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t curl very much hair at once without it getting jammed up</li>
            <li>short, I highly recommend this to all you ladies out there.</li>
            <li>The heat settings go up fairly high and the highest setting is not needed unless you have really coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried every barrel size, I have tried high end, low end, every price point you could think of and to no avail!</li>
            <li>This is not like any other curling iron, this isn&#x27;t the old fashioned type, the trendy no clip tapered barrel irons, and those in crazy shapes and in many different sizes.</li>
            <li>It only took 20min (with a bit of goofing around) to complete it!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to finally have a product that worked so well, especially since curling you hair can take so long and this just took minutes!</li>
            <li>This will earn you major brownie points fellas!</li>
            <li>so far.outside of the curler becomes hot enough to cause discomfort, simply allow the curler to cool down a bit or simply don&#x27;t allow it to directly contact your head during curling (not</li>
            <li>and I have a hard time getting it to hold a curl using traditional curling irons or wands, but this made nice curls, which I brushed into &amp;</li>
            <li>I have long, medium thickness, layered, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have long hair (mostly straight) with thinner strands (but a LOT of them).</li>
            <li>The curling iron&#x27;s ceramic chamber really helps curl all of my extremely long strands of hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well, and it goes for waves unless I practically fry it by keeping it in the iron too long.</li>
            <li>I am not good at curling hair, this curling iron seems like the most fool proof curlers that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>It heats up ridiculously fast, is super easy to use, and makes it almost impossible to accidentally burn yourself.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend has a fairly long straight hair, and she loves to curl her hair sometimes.</li>
            <li>have fairly long straight hair, but I like to wear it curly.  </li>
            <li>I think this would work very well with long hair?</li>
            <li>My hair is dead straight, I’ve always looked for that extra boost to achieve those sexy long curls, and I finally found the tool to do it!</li>
            <li>Soon it will SAVE you time, but for the first use or two, give yourself a few extra minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-Detangle first.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions first; I was careful.  </li>
            <li>sponge rollers, hot rollers, crimping irons, waving irons, flat irons, wands, deep wavers, etc.  </li>
            <li>My fine hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl super well, it usually looks limp after a while, but I curled my hair with this Miraqueen, and it lasted all day.</li>
            <li>First of all is pink</li>
            <li>and I normally use a traditional curling iron</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, I WAS NEVER ABLE TO USE MY FLAT IRON TO MAKE CURLS, I WOULD ALWAYS END UP BURNING MY FINGERS</li>
            <li>Last but not least, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>This gives me gorgeous loose curls and isn&#x27;t damaging to my thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to the Miraqueen, it’s now easier than ever before to create loose, natural curls</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited when receiving the product and it definitely didnt let me down what so ever.</li>
            <li>recently purchased two different sets of hot hair curlers, two flat irons, and a new curling iron -</li>
            <li>Lots of options, including left, right, or alternating curls and several different temperatures.</li>
            <li>This seriously leaves my entire head with full, voluminous, bouncy curls!!  </li>
            <li>I have VERY fine and thin hair,</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair that doesn&#x27;t curl well, but with this the curls hold all day.</li>
            <li>The LED display is also super cool and leaves all of the second guessing behind.</li>
            <li>don´t make the curls last for a long time since she has a very straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Why go through all the bother, when this new device makes curling my hair so simple?</li>
            <li>Not only is my new Miraqueen</li>
            <li>When the outside of the curler becomes hot enough to cause discomfort, simply allow the curler to cool down a bit or simply don&#x27;t allow it to directly contact your head during curling (not</li>
            <li>I personally feel that the swivel cord makes maneuvering so much easier and the digital LCD screen conveniently helps me keep track of my settings.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight, limp, and does nothing despite how much I beg it.</li>
            <li>Curls last so long that they are still pretty day 2, even after sleeping on.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;ve tried bunch of different curler styles (straight wand, brush, clamp etc)</li>
            <li>I would recommend Mariqueen to anyone, all you need to do is read the instructions, after a few tries its easy to maneuver and you&#x27;ll be your own perfessional stylist, heaven knows I was style depraved until I found this secret weapon.</li>
            <li>I have such thick hair that I have never been able to curl my hair before.</li>
            <li>I’ll be honest, when I heard about the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, unprocessed, medium length hair (about 2-3 inches past my shoulders) that has never held a curl a day in my life until now.  </li>
            <li>If you are going for the more long loose curls look, start halfway down your hair instead of near the scalp.  </li>
            <li>The handle is also small hand friendly.</li>
            <li>First of all, it heats up faster than any other curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used, and the foam protection cover protects your hair while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>Is pretty heavy plus your curls are to skinny and don&#x27;t last as much</li>
            <li>more than once, because her hair is past the middle of her back.</li>
            <li>swivel cord might just be my favorite thing about it, which may sound silly, but trust me, it&#x27;s no fun having to untwist and untangle the cord because it wouldn&#x27;t move the way you wanted it to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This thing is a major miracle.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to imagine how hot those other irons</li>
            <li>I will never go back to using my old curling iron after this!</li>
            <li>I use a product for heat protection on my hair, but no other styling products.  </li>
            <li>Get it, you can&#x27;t go wrong and you&#x27;ll love the results!</li>
            <li>But I only gave it four stars because it is very easy to get your hair tangled in it and very hard to get it out when you do.  </li>
            <li>Love how I can create loose, medium or tight curls with the same curling iron.</li>
            <li>I am an mechanical engineer by trade and a technology enthusiast, so once I started researching curling irons (which was a little weird at first), I began looking for an Iron that had many features but also is dependable and we won&#x27;t be replacing it after a week like so many things we buy trying to save a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have fine, not colored, and very straight hair that is a little past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>It has never tugged my fine hair (I always got my fine hair stuck in normal irons :( )</li>
            <li>Using this was easy and it took the stress out, especially once I watched the videos and tried it a few different ways.</li>
            <li>However, I did not lose any hair and just had to practice at making sure I only used very small sections of hair.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not cheap like many of the other curling wands I used before.</li>
            <li>Super high heat for a long, long, long lasting curl.</li>
            <li>The curls were so pretty and natural not those tight wedding look curls</li>
            <li>I also have fine hair, so usually whatever curling iron I use to control my uncontrollable curls, it doesn&#x27;t set or last all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, highly recommended for women and also men with long hair.</li>
            <li>Whether you are a woman who needs a high quality iron or a man with long hair, or even to use for your children&#x27;s hair, this is the curling iron I would recommend.  </li>
            <li>The section of hair right below that came out tightly curled (curls the size of your thumb).  </li>
            <li>Despite how fine and not big my hair is, the rate at which this goes, it would take me more than an HOUR to go around the full head - leaving me with shocking looking wavy</li>
            <li>It heats very fast and never burn my fingers( as always was with other curling irons)!</li>
            <li>Generally, curling irons just don&#x27;t work on my hair</li>
            <li>The wand is a huge struggle and my hair is so thick that it takes forever.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for THE ultimate curling iron for my long, straight hair.</li>
            <li>Also, the fact that this iron uses ceramic shows that it will protect my hair in the long run because it is not being constantly burned by stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Save the trip to the salon for later and invest in the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li>I was actually a bit surprised when we out to dinner</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is a must have product if you’re one of those girls who loves adding some playful curls to your daily hairstyle.</li>
            <li>the girls are only 3 and 4 years old.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s the only curler that worked for me and my daughters.</li>
            <li>And it is so simply it really requires no real effort or concentration.</li>
            <li>and I got to see it in action on several occasions.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets..</li>
            <li>Money very well spent.</li>
            <li>The curls are natural looking and stay until the next wash.  </li>
            <li>well-designed curling iron can take the place of those old fashioned curling irons and newer curling wands that constantly lead to burnt fingers.</li>
            <li>So far, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I really like the pink colour.</li>
            <li>Which completely defeats the purpose for me since I was hoping for something to work faster than a traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Only happened once so far.  </li>
            <li>I am embarrassed to admit how much money I have spent on styling tools.  </li>
            <li>I had been busy with final exams and then Christmas break</li>
            <li>She had an old one that finally gave out on her.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend got scorched constantly while using her old curling iron.</li>
            <li>So yeah – I’d definitely recommend the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron for that reason alone.</li>
            <li>And how the heat stays on the inside of the iron and not on the outside where my busy fingers are.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty long, its middle of my back length</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve used it once &amp; it took me roughly 30-35 minutes to curl my entire head the first time using it.</li>
            <li>I have thick long hair and my problem is i could never find a curling iron that would hold my curls for more than 15 mins.</li>
            <li>I sadly don&#x27;t truly have my own curler</li>
            <li>I have been curling my hair for most of my life and my arms would always get so tired from holding the hair and curling iron in position for varying time length.</li>
            <li>I love that my arms don’t get tired anymore while doing my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to being unable to do my own hair in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length, pretty straight, not course at all, but it&#x27;s still really thick, so I knew it would take me longer.  </li>
            <li>However, my hair is as straight as uncooked spaghetti, and I needed something that would give me a little more help than the typical iron you buy at the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The curling iron makes a sound when your hair is curled and you have the option between loose, medium and tight.</li>
            <li>Hot rollers, steam rollers, plain old ceramic irons....</li>
            <li>I think she&#x27;s taking far less time getting ready to go out</li>
            <li>This specific curling iron really does the trick and never leaves my hair dry or burnt ever.</li>
            <li>It curled my shorter hair just fine but tangled up my long extensions and pretty much ripped a whole chunk of hair out :(</li>
            <li>This curler gets hot enough to make loose curls that last for the duration of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, I have such fine hair that I usually use a fairly low temperature.</li>
            <li>I thought the shape was odd at first, but once I read the reviews and looked up the &#x27;how-to&#x27; instructions for it, I figured I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The curls last all day, and I am not going back to my old curling irons ever!</li>
            <li>There are 3different settings that I like which most other automatic curlers don&#x27;t (usually just has 2).</li>
            <li>I love that it isn’t expensive and it is such a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I chose it because she is very young and has difficulty sitting still for long periods of time to have her hair done before each pageant.  </li>
            <li>and yes, there were a few curls that were more limp than preferred but the overall look of my hair was large, loose, curls that looked effortless.</li>
            <li>The curls are also a lot more tight and last longer than my previous irons.</li>
            <li>Since she has a back injury regular curling irons take too long, causing too much pain.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write the reviews, but read them, and in this case I think it is not fare to do not say anything , so after burning myself few times with traditional curling iron I decided to purchase this one because I liked the reviews and</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through too many curling irons in the past year, they all HATE my hair and NEVER do a good job...</li>
            <li>I am half African American, so as you can imagine, I have pretty thick hair that gets frizzy and tangled easily.</li>
            <li>No, they&#x27;re not as tight as when I first use it, but that&#x27;s also because I run my fingers through them to soften them up.  </li>
            <li>The automatic power off feature is extremely important because I have forgotten about my hair tools being on and left them sitting there for at least an hour before I noticed them.</li>
            <li>Normally it takes a ton of product and a long time to get curls that last maybe 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It worked only once but completely died on second time.</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron actually gives me curls that last all day!</li>
            <li>The only thing you have to be careful of is not trying to put too much hair in there.</li>
            <li>The curls last by far longer then the curls i get with a traditional iron</li>
            <li>For someone like me with a laid back style, this was THE extra accessory I needed to complete my look.</li>
            <li>I am an African American with naturally kinky hair.</li>
            <li>I have to say that looking at a product is far different then actually using</li>
            <li>When I finally found this product, I was thrilled but skeptical.  </li>
            <li>Two failed irons later, I had given up hope of effectively curling my hair for my gatherings/events.</li>
            <li>Was it worth it for a few digital controls?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous curling irons that have repetitively fallen short of my expectations, however, my opinion was swayed when I purchased this unique iron.</li>
            <li>She was a little apprehensive about all the features and controls at first, but got the hang of it in no time.</li>
            <li>first it seemed  little bulky</li>
            <li>Because of a mild disability, I find it nearly impossible (and quite dangerous/time consuming) to curl my own hair with a conventional curling iron.  </li>
            <li>the end of the barrel where the plastic attaches never gets hot and it is big enough to hold stable so you can control the end and curl long long pieces.</li>
            <li>Depending on your hair type and thickness, you won&#x27;t need anything else but a hair dryer and perhaps a flat iron to smooth your hair down first if it&#x27;s really thick or coarse.  </li>
            <li>on.u won&#x27;t need anything else but a hair dryer and perhaps a flat iron to smooth your hair down first if it&#x27;s really thick or coarse.  </li>
            <li>On the first try, I managed to do my entire head within an hour and half</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always found straighteners and curlers not very easy on the hands, but this is the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always found straighteners and curlers not very easy on the hands, but this is the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>I was super skeptical at first, and was hesitant in buying.</li>
            <li>Admittedly it&#x27;s a little intimidating at first if you&#x27;ve only ever used a standard iron like me, but it only took me one or two uses to adjust to the Professional level.</li>
            <li>My hair does have a little bit of natural curl, but it&#x27;s not the &#x27;pretty&#x27; natural curl, and more of the crazy, unattractive curl.</li>
            <li>swivel cord gives it a nice easy and free rotating base so you don&#x27;t have to hassle with a cord getting twisted or interrupting what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>It heats up quick And has a long heavy duty cord that you won&#x27;t get with most other brands, at least the ones I&#x27;ve seem.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair that is hard to curl and keep curled!</li>
            <li>but I feel bad for my husband early mornings when I&#x27;m getting ready and all he can hear is my beeping :)</li>
            <li>With other curling irons I have tried I had to leave the iron there for a minute until my hair actually stayed curled and ended up smelling really</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because your hair can get caught if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>With my old curling iron, I was always worried if I was keeping it on too long and burning my hair.</li>
            <li>I actually finally set it to the hottest temperature, had product in my hair to hold the curl, set the timer for 12 seconds and it barely curled by hair.  </li>
            <li>She naturally has long and wavy hair, and wouldn&#x27;t stop talking about having curly hair.</li>
            <li>I always been struck by my long hair problems until I purchased this Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li>my hair would only hold it&#x27;s natural, bad-looking curls, so I usually just straightened it (which is pretty damaging).</li>
            <li>it is pretty heavy</li>
            <li>I curled a few sections of my hair and was amazed that the iron seemed to know if I had placed too much hair to be curled!</li>
            <li>I rarely curl my hair, because I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair with fine texture.  </li>
            <li>The Miraqueen cut her time down dramatically for getting ready each day, but doesn’t trade off quality.</li>
            <li>I taught that their hair was gonna break loose and fall after some hours because I did not have so much experience working on peoples hair until we were all amazed how long their hair lasted before they left my place.    </li>
            <li>The price is competitive with other high end ceramic curling irons and wands.</li>
            <li>Dry naturally or with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>If you have slightly too much hair in a section, it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Now, I can get ready in half the time.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it takes a lot less time to get ready every</li>
            <li>The curls are long lasting and done perfectly, as if a professional was doing it themselves.</li>
            <li>This product not only saved my social life, but also the way I see myself.</li>
            <li>As someone with persistently straight hair that won&#x27;t even hold a perm for more than a couple of weeks, I was very skeptical when my sister wanted to try this curling iron on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The automatic count down is idiot proof making a flawless curl.</li>
            <li>Other  curling irons I had used in the past just fried my hair which is baby fine.</li>
            <li>little skeptical at first only because I&#x27;ve tried so many which have never worked for</li>
            <li>This curling iron out performs other brands because it is not only cost-effective but also ensures high quality.  </li>
            <li>I would try holding the curler in place way after the curling action stopped to see if a curl would form because the heating element would still be working, but the curl would just come out loose, frizzy and somewhat kinky.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my fifteen year old daughter who has long, straight, thin hair, and wants curls, waves and body.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re tired of being frustrated with curlers, this will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re tired of being frustrated with curlers, this will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li>I purchased this curling iron for my wife who had really long thick hair and let me tell you, she was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was worried that the iron was going to be too strong because my hair is very very fragile (thin, blonde), but the technology just protects the hair so well.</li>
            <li>For her it comes all down to time-saving, ease of use and having it done effectively without the head-ache that usually follows use of a typical curling</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my wife a few days ago as she had mentioned wanting a new one and let me tell you, the reviews checked out, she LOVES IT!5 stars!!</li>
            <li>go&amp;#34; hair and haven&#x27;t messed with it - still can&#x27;t master a round brush and blow dryer except for on my bangs, and I wasn&#x27;t introduced to a flat iron until college when I decided to go short for the first time in my life....</li>
            <li>and I was able to curl my entire head of thick, mid back length hair in less than 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>I usually have to do very tight curls to get them to last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>Automatic curling, super easy to use, and no more tired hands and arms because it does all the work for you!</li>
            <li>It has this little beep settings that will give you a proper idea about its preheating and will even give you an idea of the time you should hold down the curler to get the special type of curl you want.</li>
            <li>it was less expensive than the Conair Pro and had more features - mainly the curl direction</li>
            <li>She has used a straight on/off curling iron for the past 20 years and I can barely tell that she had curled her hair after a couple of hours.</li>

            <li> After reading all of the great reviews, I purchased my own Miraqueen and couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love curling my hair with this, don&#x27;t get burned, gives you real nice body or curls.</li>
            <li> No body makes curlers this good anymore.</li>
            <li> My straightener uses this as well, and I loved how it provided an even distribution of heat on my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother and she loved it</li>
            <li> but it is a good iron.</li>
            <li> I don’t have to crank the heat to max to get a good curl, it doesn’t smell when I put it in my hair</li>
            <li> My curls were absolutely gorgeous after using this product AND they lasted me through the night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it worked well, and I loved that I did not burn myself at all, as I often do when curling my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good iron in its price range</li>
            <li> Good thing was that it did not burn her hair.</li>
            <li> With a display to see the temperature, she takes good care of her</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked this good.</li>
            <li> Even though, she kept telling me she loved it and</li>
            <li> it is good to use.</li>
            <li> according to my lady, it does what it needs to do really good too.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight, great temperature settings, and a nice design.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely delighted to have bought this.</li>
            <li> I took mine to the office to show the gals - they all loved it.....</li>
            <li> A friend of hers said her daughter loved this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> think the weight is good and the girls say the design, placement of the buttons, and heating time are excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you for making two important people in my life so happy!</li>
            <li> It is good for all types of hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still working with it.. and look forward to hearing from my beloved what else she likes about.</li>
            <li> Has a lot of settings - heat and time, which give you good control over your results.</li>
            <li> This brand is cheaper than some others but performs as good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron makes me look good</li>
            <li> fairly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are good with hair you probably already knew this -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the girl who can&#x27;t keep good looking curls in her hair at all.</li>
            <li> loved it immediately</li>
            <li> She really liked it, worked great.</li>
            <li> Hair looks good when your done though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one and totally loved it.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Shirley Temple Curls.</li>
            <li> And you&#x27;ll get a good arm workout holding it....</li>
            <li> I have now lent the curler to my friend because she loved my results.</li>
            <li> You get a comfy hold and good positioning but it is kinda bulky</li>
            <li> So I was really excited to try a product that promised to give me perfect curls with zero skills or effort.</li>
            <li> She has been using this curling iron for about 2 weeks and its working perfect on her hair ( she looks HOT lol ).&lt;br</li>
            <li> this worked beautifully and i love it.  </li>
            <li> beautiful but TOP quality.  </li>
            <li> We used it for a photo shoot and the make-up gal was very pleased with its results as well as ease of use and timely results--the models loved it as well.  </li>
            <li> It gives me the most beautiful beach waves and its holds for 2 days.</li>
            <li> Oh and lets not talk about how quick it takes to make the perfect curl.</li>
            <li> Magnificent device, it heats up rather quick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, works well, and best of all, it has a timer!</li>
            <li> Quick curling and great results!  </li>
            <li> The timer/heat settings are awesome, and the rotation option for the direction of curl is super rad.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this curling iron!!!!!</li>
            <li> SO SO MUCH for the great service and great product!</li>
            <li> I loved that it was so safe to use!</li>

            <li> She&#x27;s looking more beautiful than ever and to be completely honest</li>
            <li> you can fly through the process and it&#x27;ll look better each and every time you do it.  </li>
            <li> Being able to adjust the tightness of the curls is great for changing my style without even doing damage to my hair or burning my hand.</li>

            <li> I got this great curling iron as a gift from my friend and I absolutely love it.</li>

            <li> It is so easy to get beautiful curls.  </li>
            <li> I think if I had used some kind of product in my hair the curl would have lasted even better, but I was still happy with how it looked after sleeping on it.  </li>

            <li> and I love the look!</li>
            <li> Love this miraqueen!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I found that using it on thinner strands gives you the best results for tighter curl and bigger sections is best for a more uniform wave.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know if it was my luck or what, but the Miraqueen was the first curling iron I&#x27;ve purchased, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I even slept in my curls and woke up with them still mostly in tact!</li>
            <li> I glad I did!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than a curling wand!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> her hair looks really cute!</li>
            <li> Omg I love this!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, it&#x27;s safe!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my friends and it produces stunning, bouncy curls every time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this thing!  </li>

            <li> Does make a nice curl.</li>
            <li> it really works wonderfully!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am thrilled with the Miraqueen curling iron.</li>
            <li> I wanted to look nice for the family outing</li>
            <li> This really is the best Curling Iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on so many good reviews</li>
            <li> I be loving the curls that comes out of this baby.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to know I can fiddle with the temperature and get the job done</li>
            <li> This is a really nice</li>
            <li> Nice Product</li>
            <li> and I am so thrilled with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And for those who already pride themselves as nice looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of at a loss as to snag.  </li>
            <li> I curled my hair so fast and curls were so perfect and identical!!)</li>
            <li> Loving this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The automatic timers comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Is is such a great product and a wonderful brand that every woman needs to get at home</li>
            <li> I like the many good things that were being said about this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the automatic curling and the beep that lets you know when to release your hair.</li>
            <li> She told me that she purchased her own Miraqueen Curling iron</li>
            <li> This is a nice curling iron with a lot of features.  </li>
            <li> but there was still a nice wave there.  </li>
            <li> – I don’t know the details, just took her word on it, because I don’t know how to use this kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> so she doesn&#x27;t want to buy something of her own</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice that she can use this product as well since it has a variety of temperature settings.</li>
            <li> I never seen my wife hair so curly and nice.</li>
            <li> Once you own one you will see what I am talking about.</li>
            <li> A curl chamber gently draws the hair in and heats it from all directions to form a perfect curl</li>
            <li> and it was nice to have something prettier</li>
            <li> Cord wraps up nicely and velcros.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations so much that I just have to let anyone know how wonderful it is if they are hesitant to spend the money.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it has not happened to me yet.</li>
            <li> Just setting expectations for what kind of hair skill person I am.  </li>
            <li> This curler is one of a kind.</li>
            <li> This product is one of a kind.</li>
            <li> The handle of the curler itself includes an LCD display so you can see what settings you&#x27;re working with, which I think is a really nice feature considering all the bells and whistles that are included.    </li>
            <li> and I was kind of bummed out.</li>
            <li> Plus it has an LCD screen which I’ve never seen before on a hair tool, so that was nice.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even wrap your hair around the wand; the device allows your hair to enter a chamber and it curls on its own, which is another benefit.</li>
            <li> My honest opinion?</li>
            <li> The handy LCD screen displays the timer setting, temperature, and curl</li>
            <li> But honestly, this thing is fool-proof.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty good with a curling iron although I was intrigued by the perfect, easy curls</li>
            <li> and this was perfect for me, i was able to turn up the strength to the right temperature to allow hair to maintain it&#x27;s curls.</li>
            <li> I was super impressed with how easy it was and</li>
            <li> Great purchase, and worth the money!</li>

            <li> I will be buying a couple of these for Christmas gifts, for sure.</li>
            <li> To preface I want to say that I have NEVER been able to figure out curling irons or wands.</li>
            <li> My favorite part was that it automatically curls your hair for you</li>
            <li> I use this product several times a week and am amazed at how awesome my hair looks each time!</li>
            <li> best part is the curls last all day!You won&#x27;t have to load up on hair spray which is something</li>

            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It feels like I am now able to get about 15 more minutes of sleep in the morning since I got this.  </li>

            <li> Overall she seems to be very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Also if you pull and put pressure on it while using it your hair will be more straightened than curled.</li>
            <li> My husband even commented on how I had sexy bed head</li>
            <li> (I watched the videos many time before attempting).  </li>

            <li> Ladies and gents if your looking for your next best friend than this is it!</li>
            <li> A foam layer on the top of the heading chamber helps to prevent any burns to the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this curler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many curling irons before</li>
            <li> I like being creative with my curls now</li>
            <li> This was not the brand she wanted; she wanted the Conair Brand, Infiniti Pro; however I thought this was a better curling Iron as it will roll in both directions and heats to 450.</li>
            <li> Most of my friends are jealous and some even want to pay me to do their hair.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> Just love.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it automatically shuts off, and has a led screen that tells me what way</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> so I absolutely love the automatic one-hour shut off feature</li>
            <li> Thank you Miraqueen! :)</li>
            <li> She was able to get both girls&#x27; hair curled in about 15 min.  </li>
            <li> cuz it happens, but I&#x27;m sure once I learn more about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking its because she&#x27;s knows how great she&#x27;s looking a whole lot sooner.</li>
            <li> Ladies you&#x27;ll love the ease of use and the speed at which it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> &gt; One of the parts I love about this iron (despite the finished product it gives me) is the LCD screen that displays the temperature, timer and status of the curls.</li>
            <li> I love that this curler took the “work” out of having to do my hair and left me with perfectly sculpted curls!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was even able to get some of my friends to purchase the curling iron as well.</li>

            <li> grand daughter loves this</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend can&#x27;t stop telling me how cute I looked and kept playing with my curls.</li>
            <li> I got it, used it, and love it.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I think they worked better for cheer hair ringlets.</li>

            <li> none of which worked.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to tell you that I LOVE this curling iron.</li>
            <li> (so I just love that safety</li>
            <li> In love with this..great price.</li>

            <li> I can now be confident my curls will hold throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you brush every strand you insert into the curling iron.</li>
            <li> What can I say - I absolutely LOVE this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Its ceramic technology protects your hair from damage, and you’ll love the 3 heat levels and 4 timer settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m</li>
            <li> Glad I went with my instinct and bought it.</li>
            <li> I pride myself for always getting a valuable gift for my wife because she is such a wonderful woman.</li>
            <li> Your curling iron has transformed my wife into a sexy siren.</li>
            <li> You will love this curling iron.</li>

            <li> Not only will I be keeping this wand, but I will be telling people how awesome it is!</li>
            <li> The item shipped and I received it two days of ordering from Amazon which is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I love curling my hair and went ahead and purchased this the Miraqueen iron.</li>
            <li> I know they will love it just like I did.</li>
            <li> because I know they will love it.</li>
            <li> The feature that was prominent to me was the diversity in the amount of control</li>
            <li> When styling my hair, I was able to alter the temperature, curl direction, time, and styling blocks.</li>
            <li> This resulted in a much more preferred and satisfied result of my curls.</li>
            <li> Not once have I burnt myself with this iron, and that makes the experience all the better with this added sense of security.</li>
            <li> also thinks that the LED display is quite innovative as it allows you to see the temperature, curling direction, and</li>
            <li> love this product, I can&#x27;t believe the difference a curling iron makes</li>
            <li> so even if I am able to get it to curl, the curls do not stay in.</li>
            <li> Well, I am glad that I took the chance.</li>
            <li> also love the ceramic technology at work in this product.</li>
            <li> It is almost like magic - you have to see it to believe it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> I love my curls that MiraQueen gives me.</li>
            <li> I love this curling tool.  </li>
            <li> But my favorite feature is the auto turn off,</li>
            <li> love that this has 3 heat settings and 4 timer settings</li>
            <li> make sure you brush out any tangles.</li>
            <li> the section is the tighter and more ringlet like the curl will be.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the LED-screen displays and timers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> but I was able to get it undone, so be ware of that.  </li>
            <li> instead I am enjoying this part of my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li> Despite this, I love to have shiny, bombshell curls in my hair.</li>
            <li> I also travel to see my family in Germany a lot and love that this is dual voltage.</li>
            <li> find that I am able to curl my hair with one hand</li>
            <li> OK..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The curling iron also has a chamber for the hair, making sure that my hair doesn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron also has 3 heat settings depending on your hair health.</li>
            <li> I love this because I can control use the one that is for dyed hair (370 degrees)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Functionally, I love the swivel cord because it makes it convenient to move.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s makes my hair look quite healthy</li>
            <li> And it gets easier the more</li>
            <li> So the design of this is better from that perspective.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love that.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t on Amazon any more.</li>
            <li> She also mentioned the rubber protector which keeps her skin at a safe distance.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER been able to get my hair to hold any curl for longer than maybe an hour....</li>
            <li> it is simply the best curling iron I have ever owned/used.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Maybe a sure thing for women with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Love the timing settings and audible beeps on this curler.</li>
            <li> I was impressed that the manufacturer put the actual temperature of the iron on the control panel.</li>
            <li> But I love it.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this product.</li>
            <li> I have dyed it and relaxed it many times.</li>
            <li> I really love how it has a timer on it to tell me when to release the iron.</li>
            <li> My most favorite part of the product is it keeps me from burning my scalp and fingers.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen is a simple one, with many,many awesome features.  </li>
            <li> If used properly, it does a great job!</li>
            <li> I have used this so many times</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> so that makes me like it even more.</li>
            <li> I wasn’t too sure what to make of it as I have never seen a curling iron that looked quite like this.  </li>
            <li> My hair is in love with this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I know what you will love it too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this  curling iron in August and have been in love with it ever since.</li>
            <li> So a product like this is invaluable to the lovely ladies in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that I do not have to spend two hours in the morning doing my hair.</li>
            <li> Medium length hair also works better.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to section hair and work from the bottom up.  </li>
            <li> Even better is auto shutoff.  </li>
            <li> I love my Miraqueen pro curling iron.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curler.</li>
            <li> I love the rubberized layer.  </li>
            <li> So impressive and the curls actually stay</li>
            <li> It has many features for safety including the rubber protector and isolated heat to prevent me from burning myself.</li>
            <li> The cord swivels so that it does not get rolled up and tangled like most curling irons.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t user error.  </li>
            <li> (Plus- I wanted to make sure I&#x27;d have a thoroughly written product review.)  </li>
            <li> The end section of hair was the only part that came out looking perfect.  </li>
            <li> But after using this Miraqueen, I&#x27;ll probably curl it more.</li>
            <li> More like a purple/pink but</li>
            <li> my favorite colors so love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I would call it the &#x27;All In One&#x27; hair curler, because it does so much more.</li>
            <li> I found this product by accident, bought it on a whim and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> A timer which is used to make sure you don’t overdo it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I swear, the ceramic chambers and padding makes my hair seem healthier, bouncier and more lustrous.</li>
            <li> Well I bought this as a gift for my grand daughter and she was speechless because she didn&#x27;t think I would buy her something like this for her birthday.</li>
            <li> I love my grand daughter and her mother</li>
            <li> Surely it won&#x27;t work that</li>
            <li> The materials are top notch.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this curler.</li>
            <li> This is the most magical hair styling device ever.</li>
            <li> The curling iron is so safe there is no way of burning your self.  </li>
            <li> You can switch up the direction of the curl for more texture and volume.  </li>
            <li> There are so many features that I have never seen on another curler before</li>
            <li> My favorite feature has to be the curl direction.</li>
            <li> This made the perfect gift for our teenage niece.  </li>
            <li> Im glad I stumbled across this hair curler.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> The combination of the timer, the rubber/foam protections and the different array of settings makes this the best curling iron I have ever laid my hands on.</li>
            <li> I was able to spiral curl my hair for Thanksgiving</li>
            <li> what better way to know if I want one?</li>
            <li> But I love to have curls, it give volumes to my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> but I received this as a gift I love love love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that I can pick between types of curls to change things up</li>
            <li> This allows the user to create the perfect curl, and from my personal experience, I could not be happier with the price and performance.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you leave it on for the 12 seconds it is better than doing 10, for me anyways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This must-have Curling wand works on all hair textures and types to create a stunning curl with a glossy finish.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this item is that it is made of ceramic.</li>
            <li> Okay okay</li>
            <li> okay, so I know you have seen something like this</li>
            <li> Its awesome, I can not tell you enough.</li>
            <li> Try it and love it.</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s what I love about it and what works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this curler.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Curling Iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad he did.  </li>
            <li> Any more than that seems to get caught, which has happened to me, but infrequently.  </li>
            <li> This one is a much better deal for what you pay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid double this price for curlers that were nothing as great as this!</li>
            <li> I love this device.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the better curling irons my friend had used.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tool!</li>
            <li> I really love this thing.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this immediately just by having watched the video posted on it.  </li>
            <li> I also must admit that if it involves much more skill than putting my hair in a pony tail (which is my look 99% of the time) I&#x27;m all thumbs.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments.  </li>
            <li> One more thing, I was a bit hesitant on this one just because it was cheaper than the perhaps the more well known brands</li>
            <li> and so glad to have it.</li>
            <li> Most of my life I&#x27;ve been blessed with &amp;#34;wash and</li>
            <li> I was able to get the look I was going for by doing it the night before with no hairspray, medium heat/timing, and combing out in the morning to soften.  </li>
            <li> I did find that I needed to use the medium heat and longer time setting for the bottom section and shorter time setting for the top section/layers to keep it non-poodle-esque.  </li>
            <li> Watch some youtube videos (even if they are for the conair pro or babybliss) for more tips or tricks</li>
            <li> I love this product and I get lots of compliments when I use it</li>
            <li> I waited to make sure it was &amp;#34;completely&amp;#34; warmed up, it beeped to indicate that it was.</li>
            <li> I even made sure I had it plugged in to a power source that had the required amount of voltage needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to add a comment after I&#x27;ve used this so many times.</li>
            <li> I still love it.</li>
            <li> BUT I did have to make sure my hair was blown out already so I could obtain the silky look that I like.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> the prospect of that made me more determined.</li>
            <li> Okay I am guy</li>
            <li> but I bought this for my wife and we BOTH absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> okay)</li>
            <li> My mother even let my eight-year-old sister use it, because it was so safe.</li>
            <li> Now I never have to worry about how my hair looks, or being able to style it or change it up.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid double this price for curlers that were nothing as great as this!</li>
            <li> Gifted this to my girlfriend</li>
            <li> I am so glad it turned out to be such a great value!</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a great product!</li>
            <li> I love all the features.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the automatic shut off.</li>
            <li> I also love that it protects my hair from damage.</li>
            <li> In all my 65 years, I have never been able to keep a curl in my hair for longer than 10 minutes ....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> The curl held much better without any gel or mousse.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I love the reverse feature</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li> Found this interesting thing and got it for the sake of upgrading.</li>
            <li> find that I am able to curl my hair with one hand</li>
            <li> If you read review, hopefully you understand better.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s when my hair got caught most of the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;What is even better?</li>
            <li> three favorite features of the Miraqueen Curling Iron (besides the fact that it WORKS) would have to be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the holidays just around the corner, this item is the perfect gift for any female any age in your life.</li>
            <li> She had been needing a curling iron for a while, and this one had several great reviews, and for good reason.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s brought my Megan. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried all three timers and love how my hair turns out no matter</li>
            <li> I love love</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair has more body, and I get compliments everywhere</li>
            <li> and I really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I am able to straighten my hair faster than ever&lt;</li>
            <li> I love that the design ensures you don&#x27;t get dents in your hair, whether you are going for a sleek look, flip or bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get home to use it again. :-)</li>
            <li> If you have an Amazon Prime account, the savings is even better.</li>
            <li> also love the way the Miraqueen works.  </li>
            <li> but I love</li>
            <li> We have already ordered 3 more to give to family members for Christmas.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional curling iron is a great and amazing gift for any women in your life.</li>
            <li> love the LCD monitor.</li>
            <li> protection integrated with this curler was even better than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I honestly did not see how important the safety features were until I was using it.</li>
            <li> automatic curling, the beep notification to let you know that the curler is ready as well as the three timer settings were also great features.</li>
            <li> She is completely satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> Well, most things curl it, it just falls out almost immediately.</li>
            <li> but I was able to get out no problem</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really create a great curl.</li>
            <li> anyhow, I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase and will recommend to anyone that is looking for full, shiny and bouncy curls :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The temperature control is done very well and it ensures that the right temperature is achieved for the perfect curling.</li>
            <li> Have a New Year’s resolution for beautiful, bouncy and curly hair?</li>
            <li> I put it right up to my head and get a really good curl out of it.</li>
            <li> And you&#x27;ll beable to curl your hair sooo much faster!!!!</li>
            <li> However, when she tried it she was very excited and said she would keep it and use it.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say that we have been very happy with this purchase; yes I say “we” because I live by Rule #1 – Happy wife, happy life!</li>

            <li> Easy and safe to use for all with a dynamic incorporation of ceramic heating chambers and safety pads to keep you and your hair at your best.</li>
            <li> Just one suggestion, it will be great product, if the roll size could adjustable( the curl make me look older).</li>
            <li> safety features are also great, because I don&#x27;t use an iron all the time I am highly prone to not shutting it off.</li>
            <li> It quickly became one of my favorite beauty products!</li>
            <li> I can curl all of my hair in about 5 minutes and it looks super cute!</li>

            <li> It looks awesome when it is curled, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold too long in my hair when I do it</li>
            <li> Upon first use, I wasn&#x27;t expecting good results.</li>
            <li> The curls looked good at first</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchase I have made in a long time.</li>

            <li> Her hair was able to go through easily, and</li>
            <li> As for myself, I noticed that it shuts off on its own if not in use, which is great since my wife will often forget she left her iron on.</li>
            <li> that allowing you to adjust your curl from looser and more wavy to tighter, more precise curls)</li>
            <li> I believe this has more bells and whistles and great written verified buyer reviews ; lets hope it does not fail or I&#x27;m in hot water!  </li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is a sleek, efficient curling iron that fits easily in the hand and has all the features you need to do a beautiful job of curling any type of hair.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and half the price of the most popular one!!</li>
            <li> I can finally clean out my closet!</li>
            <li> The qualities that this iron possesses makes your hair styling experience significantly easier and much more enjoyable.  </li>

            <li> what&#x27;s even better, the LED screen and controls make it easy to adapt the heat and timer, allowing you to get just the right curls with ANY kind of hair.</li>
            <li> This Miraqueen Iron does an amazing job, not to mention it is very easy to use and very safe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it has an LED screen which makes it easy for you to see the temperature and any other information you need to know to give you the best curl in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair looks absolutely stunning and it is full of bounce after I am finished working my magic with the Miraqueen.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature would have to be the LCD which shows the timer and temperature, which is important</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron with the Ceramic Curling Chamber is such a great investment and a brilliant addition to anyone’s beauty regime.</li>
            <li> She likes that the surface stays cool to handle also, and overall is very happy with this product design and its operating quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the screen, you can know exactly what temperature it&#x27;s at, which is actually important for what kind of curls you want (longer and bouncier or tighter and more</li>
            <li> After about 20 minutes we were able to free my hair</li>
            <li> So far, my wife loves it and she looks great.</li>
            <li> I think this is the most important feature, the Automatic Shut Off.</li>
            <li> My profile picture is what my hair looked like after using this fabulous product. :)</li>
            <li> Here are the most important features to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your hair will remain healthy and smooth after you curl it, so there&#x27;s no fear of a reduced hair quality with the use of this iron.</li>
            <li> What she loves most is the accessibility it is available for use with in 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> The heat is evenly produced ,  I have client who use to complain about their hair becoming frizzy after a blow out and curl,but using the  Miraqueen  </li>
            <li> Before you send any hair through just take a brush or comb through the section and make sure that you are tangle free.</li>
            <li> Another great feature of The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is that is has a swivel cord connection that would prevent you from getting tangled.  </li>
            <li> She loves the heat setting on it and the with the timer she dont forget how long she has been at it.(thats another story on its own lol)</li>
            <li> and I can be more precise with what heat setting I prefer.</li>
            <li> Gets nice and hot and makes beautiful curls that are bouncy and soft.</li>
            <li> Great for a young girl to use.&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with the beautiful and long lasting curls it gives me!</li>
            <li> It works on all hair types and makes your hair look incredibly smooth, shiny, and healthy.</li>
            <li> I cannot write about them all, but the ones I did mention were the most important to me.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, there is a bit of a learning curve to using this, and the videos really help you get a good idea of what you should do.</li>
            <li> This is really fun to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> curls held all day, and even though I am not used to being able to curl my own hair, it was actually pretty easy to style.  </li>
            <li> But NONE have ever curled my hair so quickly, and looked so stylish in the process :)  </li>
            <li> love that my curls that are so tight they stay bouncy and perfect all day!</li>

            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is a simply amazing product!</li>
            <li> Amazing curler, works just like the miracurl from Babybliss but so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I was able to curl my whole head in about 20 minutes on my first try and it looked amazing!  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and almost bought the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; more popular brand...until I read the reviews and started reading about hair catching on fire, big bald spots because the hair wouldn&#x27;t come out of the curler,</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the amazing controls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The split-end damage that I typically experienced with regular curling irons is greatly reduced because it’s a professional level curling iron made with ceramic, which my stylist told me protects the hair from damage.</li>
            <li> The number of adjustments is amazing - adjust the heat to exactly what works for your hair...</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, which I&#x27;d have thought would be easy to curl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She first told me how nice the swivel was to avoid getting tangles and tripped up by cords like units she used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first tried it from the bottom of my hair and it took maybe 5 inches, it curled nice though.</li>
            <li> With the Miraqueen I get beautiful, bouncy, and shiny curls that last.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful curls, and three different sizes!!</li>
            <li> However, the rubber layers and cool plastic assist in keeping your limbs safe.</li>
            <li> of the best features about these, I think, is the fact that they’re ceramic, so it won’t heat damage your hair any more than necessary, and it leaves it really shiny instead of frizzy like the Babyliss one my friend has at her house.</li>
            <li> and it takes me between 30-45 minutes to get beautiful curls that LAST.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, and the color is nice.</li>
            <li> I always have perfect curls and I am able to reproduce those curls for my whole entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks when it&#x27;s curled but with all the time curling my full head of hair takes, it is often too time-consuming to do.</li>
            <li> I always have perfect curls and I am able to reproduce those curls for my whole entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> The curls are not the same as you would see from a barrel curling iron but still beautiful.</li>
            <li> But the curls last all day and look so beautiful.  </li>
            <li> It is also very quick, easy and comfortable unlike foam curlers.</li>
            <li> iron has changed my view on curling my hair, I use to dread it, now I love to because it&#x27;s so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use and I love that I don&#x27;t end up burning my fingers.</li>

            <li> One time I used more product than I usually do, and I had awesome relaxed curl</li>
            <li> The product is light weight, easy to hold onto, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Arrived perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I am no professional, but I have been doing my own hair for about 25 years, so I have a fair amount of experience with gadgets.  </li>
            <li> I have fine medium-long hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use rod curling irons before and always end up with burnt fingers and thumbs...and it was a nightmare trying to curl my fine hair around the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Read the instructions and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> This fantastic curling iron makes it easy to do her hair without all the worry.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Shortest time for bleached fine hair...</li>
            <li> And even though it is fine, my hair doesn’t like to take a curl or hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair that I have always had difficulty curling.</li>
            <li> It works so smoothly and straightens it so easily and without snagging my hair.</li>
            <li> I love that it has adjustable heat settings and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light,  but strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, accessible, easy to store, works well with all types of hair.</li>
            <li> It heats up so fast and leaves my hair looking better than ever!  </li>
            <li> This curling iron is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> I really can recommend a product more!  </li>
            <li> , this one does not wear out later in the day, I just keep looking brilliant from morning till the end of the night, my curls are now permanent and neat, this is because the curler products adequate heat that results in the permanent curls.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;The curls came out soooo tight &amp; perfect</li>
            <li> and you have a perfect tight curl.</li>
            <li> Not only was it painless, fast, and easy, my beautiful curls stayed put all day, without product!</li>
            <li> Then I found this perfect little thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have never in my twenty six years of living have EVER experienced doing a hairstyle to myself with such ease, and so quickly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and super easy and fast to use!</li>
            <li> When you know your hair looks good, you are more confident, and I did get a little more attention with fabulous hair too</li>
            <li> All of these phenomenal, unique, and rare qualities make it so easy to recommend this to others looking for a fantastic curling iron that will exceed your expectations.</li>
            <li> huge dissapointment.</li>
            <li> I have a huge event coming up in October</li>
            <li> That comes in handy because it makes it look more natural.</li>
            <li> and I can see if the hair got caught in one of those, it could be a huge problem.</li>
            <li> I can happily say that as I write this review, not only does my hair look fabulous, but it didn&#x27;t cost me an arm and a leg to make it happen.</li>
            <li> It was a huge pain in the butt</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is made of ceramic, which is a huge benefit for me.  </li>
            <li> I have so many curling irons, from professional to ones I picked up at target, but this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> The auto off feature is a huge plus for me because I always forget to turn my appliances off for some reason.</li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t realize how important that is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy I got it never have to struggle again with traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I know absolutely nothing abut curling irons, but I&#x27;m leaving this review because every time I see my wife curl her her since I&#x27;ve gotten this for her, she has used this.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the ceramic that really makes the difference, honestly.</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s great that she is actually using something i brought her</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a great curling iron</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic curler.  </li>
            <li> The Rapid Beeping Sound that tells you when to start and when to stop.</li>
            <li> Fortunately it broke 5 minutes into using it</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and gives me an AMAZING curl...</li>
            <li> This curling iron has so many useful features, I&#x27;ve been in awe of it since I got</li>
            <li> The multiple settings are great too</li>
            <li> Once I explained how the timer settings worked she found it even more useful.</li>
            <li> sleek and useful design is also a favorite.</li>
            <li> After trying it on my own hair though, I’m really hooked.</li>
            <li> , well this curling iron did not make a sound and made my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the current price and the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Took me about 10 minutes to free it.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the mulch-directional setting that lets me change the direction of my curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was light weight</li>
            <li> so i was free to move around with it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> After much research and debate, I chose to purchase this amazing curling iron.</li>
            <li> this one hadn&#x27;t had such great reviews, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have even tried another curling iron.</li>
            <li> You will welcome those extra admiring glances!</li>
            <li> I got this curling wand to help with my niece&#x27;s hair during pageants and I cannot say enough great things about it.  </li>
            <li> Probably a great product for teenagers and younger adults.  </li>
            <li> And it’s also a fantastic gift idea for both teens and adults.  </li>
            <li> used to struggle with cheap devices that burned my skin and often destroyed the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> You can set the temperature you wish to use in setting, which is great because I found how the different temperatures set my hair</li>
            <li> The ceramic tourmaline helps to keep moisture in my hair and it insures smooth gliding so my hair does not get jagged and damaged.</li>
            <li> a few months ago she was very happy.</li>
            <li> Overall, great curler for teens!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But it also comes at a great price for what it can do and my girlfriend never looked back ever since she started using this one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the neat design of symmetry that makes you feel powerful just to have it in your hand.</li>
            <li> Miraqueen curling iron not only gives me great curls</li>
            <li> It has an auto-off feature that many will find useful.</li>
            <li> Although this iron looks a bit chunky, the handle is of a comfortable size.</li>
            <li> Keep hair smooth as you put it into the curler.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> comfortable--</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic device.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, I&#x27;m a very low-key kind of girl.</li>
            <li> This is important because I work full-time</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about this.</li>
            <li> This was a fantastic purchase.  </li>
            <li> I prepped the hair with the curl prep spray, dried thoroughly, and just grabbed about a 1 inch section of hair, set the curler to 450 and used the setting for 10 seconds and got a perfect curl!  </li>
            <li> comfortable--</li>
            <li> Then don&#x27;t hesitate to try this fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend whose hair always looks fantastic, and she insisted it was something I could handle myself.    </li>
            <li> I use it almost every day now, and it&#x27;s so much more fun using the Miraqueen to get those devil-</li>
            <li> I enjoy the mulch-directional setting that lets me change the direction of my curls.</li>
            <li> Made cheaply, mine didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> I had a drawer filled with curling irons until I bought this product.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It made great looking curls that last all day!  </li>
            <li> There’s also a swivel cord so you can move about freely while you’re curling your hair.</li>
            <li> You get the precise information on the heat as well as time you need to curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a Miraqueen Professional to my mom as a gift, and she loved it.</li>
            <li> and they last a good 3 days or more if I don&#x27;t wash my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much for such an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I habe been looking and reading about it for so long, watching videos too, that if you FOLLOW DIRECTIONS it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> This does not damage my hair, is super easy and convenient and easy to use, and I always achieve the desired curls that I had in mind.</li>
            <li> Yes, the second day was a bit more of a relaxed curl, but it still looked good.</li>
            <li> It is not only effective at giving great curls, but its FAST.</li>
            <li> If you have straight hair and dream of perfect curls - definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this machine and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> It works really well, and I believe that it should be used more by many others.</li>
            <li> An incident where my hair was nearly toasted almost put me off curling irons for good.</li>
            <li> A good friend recommended the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li> thus far, I enjoy writing reviews about all products I loved after purchasing.</li>
            <li> The ease at which she is able to create gorgeous curls is 2nd to none.</li>
            <li> curling wand is SUPER EASY to easy.</li>
            <li> If you let it go to the end , you get super tight locks perfect for styling how you want and its really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The way you can easily adjust the tightness of the curls, the lack of additional damage to the hair, the perfect curl every time with very little effort.  </li>
            <li> It lasted longer than what I was used to which is awesome and what was also cool is that the Mariqueen does not damage my hair like my previous irons, which means I can style my hair as often as I want.</li>
            <li> this iron is more capable of making flawless curls than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I got it for her on our anniversary (along with other things lol) and she loved it so much.</li>
            <li> And there is a timer for your curls to make sure you leave your hair in the chamber the right amount of time for the curl</li>
            <li> This is my new best friend and I highly recommend this to anyone serious about getting the best curls they can get.</li>
            <li> (many of others I found don&#x27;t have this feature which is great for unexperienced people like me).&lt;br /&gt;Also, its pink!</li>
            <li> That makes styling my hair so much easier!!!  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely LOVES it!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s consistent!!</li>
            <li> It really does work well!!!  </li>
            <li> However I was surprised and happy to find that this miraqueen produced perfect curls in my freshly washed and blow dried hair!  </li>
            <li> The wand is super safe and comes with a quick release trigger to avoid disaster.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for your girl teens and wives that are into looking cute :-)</li>
            <li> The high 450º temperature that the Miraqueen curling iron achieves allows her hair to stay perfect the entire day and night.</li>
            <li> Everything went very smoothly and this was just my first time use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those of you out there who, like me, aren’t exactly the most functional person in the morning, the safety features are a huge advantage of the Miraqueen Curing Iron.</li>
            <li> I had purchased one of these curling iron for my girlfriend birthday, 2 months ago, and I have ever since gotten some pretty good compliments on how much she loves this thing.</li>
            <li> Also super easy to use.</li>
            <li> The first is the technology that they included in both safety and most importantly, hair health.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another compelling featureI really enjoy is the 360-degree swivel cord, which helps to keep from becoming tangled while styling your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to use which as a mom of 2 babies</li>
            <li> This curling iron is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone, professionals to amateurs like myself because it&#x27;s so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to go so far as to say it has changed my life, but its pretty damn great.</li>
            <li> This made it really easy to curl my hair in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready, way better then the cheap one I used to use :D!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it is quick, easy, and literally does all the work for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, easy to use</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair, and this thing works great!</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The LCD monitor is wonderful for her to be able to see when it ready to use rather than the guess and check method she had to use with her previous curling iron.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!!! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and has a temperature control panel and a LCD screen that I found very convenient.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a tool that is consistent, easy to use, and gives you an amazing (and lasting) curl - this is my top recommendation!  </li>
            <li> Best of all, you&#x27;re able to create TONS of different hair styles with this, form super super curly so nice loose beach waves!</li>
            <li> She had been reading up on the products, and liked the porcelain chamber and the high heat.  </li>
            <li> Some cool features I enjoyed right away.</li>
            <li> It was great for my daughter because her hair is always hanging, from dry and damaged to smooth and silky, so the 3 temperature settings helps her not burn her hair.</li>
            <li> i blow dry my hair and then use this wonderful curler,and i have used this for months its very durable..great product</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is only one word for this product, AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Her curls last all day and the waves also look amazing!</li>
            <li> I needed an original idea to buy for my wife for her birthday.</li>
            <li> gives you any option you could possibly need in the most functional setup possible for perfect curls.</li>
            <li> must say I am not disappointed with this curling.</li>
            <li> My daughters comments were &amp;#34;it works; I&#x27;m just going to have to get use to using it as I was familiar with the Conair (she has been using a friends Infiniti Pro).</li>
            <li> and my thumb started to hurt, but it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the first curling iron I have bought in many years as my hair will not hold a curl.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> , I almost cried I was so excited.</li>
            <li> and I have a lot of fun with this!  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> The iron will also reverse directions, which is a great feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is versatility in the curls that you can get, depending on how long your hair is in the iron.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!  </li>
            <li> I love this curling wand it makes realy pretty curls.</li>
            <li> This morning, for the first time in my life, I was able to curl my hair (and not just the front of my hair) without assistance.  </li>
            <li> My curls are bouncy, frizz free, and full of volume.</li>
            <li> Worth trying!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is so unique.</li>
            <li> and I tried many different brand names but this curling iron has always produced the best results for me, and I have had my hair at various lengths over the years.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> but I think am still doing pretty fine with my super curls that looks so cute</li>
            <li> I was able to curl my hair and not have to use a whole can of hair spray!  </li>
            <li> However this drastically decreases the time I need to spend because it can fit the full length of my hair in just one go.</li>
            <li> BUT WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> How unique and functional this was.  </li>
            <li> Then I was gifted this for Christmas, and it did exactly what you hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Works best with small stands of hair.</li>
            <li> and I got perfect curls the first time, and even using the smaller chunks of hair as recommended, I was finished in 35 mins which was very satisfactory in time savings!</li>
            <li> curls are frizz free, bouncy and full of volume.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing about the curling iron is that it doesn&#x27;t get insanely hot so it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li> Stronger and more resistant, set it higher.</li>
            <li> Within straightening the first bit of my hair, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited that I tried it immediately.  </li>
            <li> I was way too excited to wait</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair, and have spend hundreds of dollars on hair products that did not work.  </li>
            <li> and I have received a lot of nice remarks on my new hair style.  </li>
            <li> Its honestly like my new toy, my kids are like &amp;#34;c&#x27;mon</li>
            <li> The curls are clean looking and they last!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen professional curling iron is DEFINITELY one of the BEST professional-grade curling irons on the market!</li>
            <li> The screen that tells you everything you need to know and the trigger are what makes it so easy to use and so worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt; Never before have I had such consistent and beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I love the automatic features I almost always use this one because it gives it more of a natural look, as opposed to the &amp;#34;curling iron&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is far and above the best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> but once again, it came easy to me and these things rarely do.</li>
            <li> Granted, I used a bit of hair spray this time, but the results were still very different from what I&#x27;ve ever been able to get with any tool of this kind.</li>
            <li> she said it was easy and fun to use.</li>
            <li> Well my experience with the miraqueen professional curling iron has been nothing short of incredible!</li>
            <li> Makes doing my hair super quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> So fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> There are so many things to love about the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this iron not for my own lovely locks, but because my girlfriend had been using the same junky one for years now.</li>
            <li> I have been a hairstylist for years and, in my personal and professional opinion,  this iron is wonderful</li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is smooth and that you don&#x27;t load too much hair in the chamber as it will get stuck.  </li>
            <li> She loves how quickly and accurately it works.</li>
            <li> I think if you have straight hair without any fuzz you my enjoy this product more than me.</li>
            <li> I adore while still looking neat and clean.</li>
            <li> All in all, the women in my house agree that the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is the solution for perfect curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> that I haven&#x27;t actually had to curl my own hair with it most of the time.</li>
            <li> However, having read a few reputable reviews, I made the leap and bought this at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love it its super easy and fast.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about this because it honestly seemed a little too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Overall this curler was so easy to use, very comfortable to use, and it performs better than expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not normally review products, but this was so great</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and shiny after using this curling iron and I love it!</li>
            <li> I get burned every time I use a curling iron but with Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, it is Amazingly Safe!</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is absolutely phenomenal!</li>
            <li> I curl the top first while the bottom section is tied out of the way with a hair tie then gently clip the curled top section and curl the bottom.  </li>
            <li> The LCD screen is so easy to read and this curling iron has three heat levels and the timer insures you get the right curl every time.</li>
            <li> I was actually scared she wouldn&#x27;t like since I do not know much about these things, but she loved it!</li>
            <li> From the day I received it my hair change the style from straight to curly completely, it so easy and fun using this iron , love it.</li>
            <li> As such, this is a great tool to have around as it makes curling  hair easy and fast in the mornings.</li>
            <li> The best part is this is really affordable compared to a lot of the other ones on the market today.</li>
            <li> From the day I received it my hair change the style frome straight to curly completely, it so easy and fun using this iron , love it, wish it will never break.</li>
            <li> The second curler setting on its own is the medium setting which I also prefer for very good formal events such as weddings, book dedications and most times when I am getting a new award.</li>
            <li> While it is large and cumbersome to use, which is a drawback, it would get a better review from me if the curls lasted, which they do not.  </li>
            <li> so many great features and at such a great price (seriously, the super cheap irons have NOTHING on this)</li>
            <li> but I wanted to get her something special that also is practical ( and not jewelry).</li>
            <li> For someone who mostly puts her hair into a bun or ponytail, that&#x27;s pure</li>
            <li> YES IT DOES TAKE A WHILE SPECIALLY BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF HAIR</li>
            <li> and I had a special event coming up, so</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because of the reviews and I can say all the reviews are right this works wonders!</li>
            <li> (although I wanted to gush about it right away!)  </li>
            <li> it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use, very smart technology in my opinion</li>
            <li> and I have come to find that this Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is great and by far a product of fine design.</li>
            <li> I am SUPER excited about this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hassle-free, Stress-free, GREAT results - I highly recommend the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron</li>
            <li> The time and temperature settings make it easy to set the exact specifications for your unique hair curling needs.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is how quickly it set the curls, much faster than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and brush out right before you feed it in with a fine tooth brush, and respect the 1/2-1 inch rule.  </li>
            <li> and by far this one is the easiest to use and gives my hair amazing curls.</li>
            <li> The ceramic technology integrated into this device protects her hair from damage, so no matter how much she uses it, her hair looks full and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it if you want to keep your significant other happy.</li>
            <li> This Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no hair stylist, but I know my wife is the kind of woman who knows exactly what she wants and why.</li>
            <li> , it is totally stylish and modern looking.</li>
            <li> No matter if I want wavy hair or full on curls, this curling iron handles it.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good hair styling device.</li>
            <li> I also love the LCD screen as it makes it much easier to use.</li>
            <li> Actually told me I did good.</li>
            <li> It took me 2 hours to curl one side of my head with my regular curling iron (of a good name brand) and the curls...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try and put too much hair in it, make sure there are no snarles.</li>
            <li> Full stop.</li>
            <li> and I don’t have to wait forever because I want to be able to use it when I’M READY to use it.</li>
            <li> Out of all of the curling irons I found, I chose this one because the price was reasonable and it had a lot of features that most of the others did not have.</li>
            <li> Takes me forever (okay, about an hour) to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> Thanks Miraqueen for giving me more confidence when leaving the house.  </li>
            <li> so far she seems to be loving it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very slippery and tends to not hold a curl for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;.Base - keeps the iron&#x27;s surface cool when you&#x27;re using it</li>
            <li> There’s a really cool LED screen that tells you the temperature, curl direction, and it even has a timer.</li>
            <li> I had so many compliments on my hair and everyone wants to know what I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> Sweet deal</li>
            <li> Since I got this curler, I have been experimenting a whole lot more with my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried absolutely anything you can think of to curl my hair - curlers, every wand or curling iron out there, heat rollers, and more.</li>
            <li> I was ready to LOVE this based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to curl my whole head in about 20-25 minutes, without any struggling.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this for me as a gift, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d get much use out of it.</li>
            <li> The whole process to curl your hair is a safer and more efficient</li>
            <li> Another really cool feature is the alternating curl.  </li>
            <li> You do have to make sure that you&#x27;re not trying to put too much hair in it at once.  </li>
            <li> I bought mine at full retail price</li>
            <li> :) Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Plus, she thinks the automatic curling feature is cool and the timer settings, let&#x27;s her know when make another curl.</li>
            <li> my absolute favorite feature is the automatic timers.</li>
            <li> It is fast, efficient, and safe.</li>
            <li> Genius!&lt;br /&gt;Another cool feature is the timed curl function.</li>
            <li> Some of my favorite things about this product is that it heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s even given her more time in the mornings when she&#x27;s getting ready.</li>
            <li> If your not a fan of hairspray like me then this is perfect for you because the curls hold without having to put icky hair spray in.</li>
            <li> Even the second day, it still looks good.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up for about a good year.</li>
            <li> The beeps are cool.</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I&#x27;m almost considering buying a &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; just in case this one quits and they discontinue it or something.  </li>
            <li> I use organic sweet almond oil as frizz control and heat protectant with this curler, and I have heard that avocado oil works well as heat protectant with it too.</li>
            <li> I like to spray it with holding spray and then curl all over and let the curls cool then comb through.</li>
            <li> ~ this is one cool curling wand.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would love it this much, but now I can&#x27;t even travel without it.</li>
            <li> I picked one up for my wife who has thick hair, and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I would recommend this products, it&#x27;s cheap but useful.</li>
            <li> Even when it starts to get caught, I started to get a feel for it, and was able to pull the hair out before it started to really catch and</li>
            <li> I finally gave up for about a good year.</li>
            <li> Good enough curler to upgrade to if you want something automatic.</li>
            <li> They really should use this design on more electronics!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can tell that a team of professionals really did their homework to make this product perform so many functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> are now able to be out of the house much faster.</li>
            <li> do so love the efficiency of this thing though, and my roommate keeps turning us into curly haired disney princesses, so I can&#x27;t complain really.</li>

            <li> Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is super cool, very easy to understand and smooth to use.</li>
            <li> with any curling iron - it&#x27;s best if you spray your hair first and last with hairspray to elongate the hold time of the curl, and play around with the time you keep the Miraqueen clamped down and the heat setting you have on - but it&#x27;ll definitely produce awesome curls!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this very highly rated flatiron at such a great price.</li>
            <li> The first thing that attracted to me to this product was the overwhelming number of positive reviews, and the product detail!  </li>
            <li> It’s amazing how the iron does all the work automatically, and I actually will curl my hair now for day to day stuff too because it’s just so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, safe, and provides professionally looking curls.</li>
            <li> I guess maybe that’s not a problem for girls that have been curling their hair all their lives, but for me, it’s nice to have it be such an easy</li>
            <li> Awesome, no more &amp;#34;hickey&amp;#34; burns!  </li>
            <li> This curling iron and a little hairspray made my hair look GORGEOUS!  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair look AMAZING for 2 days, easy to use, and compared to other similar curlers this was actually a great price.  </li>
            <li> I have 3 daughters and this will get its full use quickly.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to use one</li>
            <li> I never get the chance to jump on the new hair ‘tech’ fads because my hair is fine and takes ages to curl, so I’m really excited that this is one I can brag about!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, very straight, fine hair but lots of it.</li>
            <li> Unlike other curling irons I never have to worry about burning myself, which is something I have experienced a lot.</li>
            <li> The dealbreaker was when I finally got the perfect sized section, brushed smoothly and as the Miraqueen started to do its thing, the warning went off that something wasn&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this is the BEST thing I have bought for curling hair!</li>
            <li> Seriously the best hair curling invention/product ever!</li>
            <li> I quickly used this product this morning.  </li>
            <li> It heats up so quickly</li>
            <li> My daughters have long straight hair and the Miraqueen gives them really beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> Shipping was remarkably quick, so it arrived even sooner than anticipated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super helpful when curling your hair</li>
            <li> I returned it, got a quick refund, then ordered the all-black one.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and the ceramic works tons better than the old metal one she was using.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great purchase that I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks again for producing such a great product.</li>
            <li> This iron pays for itself quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily it did not come out crispy.  </li>
            <li> I get perfect curls each time that last for hours, and it only takes me about 30 minutes to do.</li>
            <li> Now I can switch back and forth for the best possible</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, I eventually gave the information in the interest of World peace [LOL] but the request forced me to do more research</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> but she is such a lovely belle that looks so cute</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product and I highly recommend to all!</li>
            <li> It is far more advanced, timing each curling for you and letting you know when to remove from the hair.</li>
            <li> I have hair as short as above my ears, and it curled it wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The iron is effortless to use, quick, automatic, and one-hand doable.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen comes with a protective case, tangle-free swivel cord, heats up quickly and is light-weight.</li>
            <li> I am glad I chose this particular iron for my step-daughter.</li>
            <li> The setting allow for so much adjustment that you have to experiment with it a few times to figure out what will work best for you.</li>
            <li> All the girls have been dying for these super curly locks this winter</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m never able to consistently reproduce curls that are almost perfect.</li>
            <li> When doing it the traditional way, I always felt that the top section just got intermingled with the bottom while trying to finish the top.  </li>
            <li> but I love to wear my hair in big, sexy curls.</li>
            <li> have had some mild issues with tangles, maybe one or two per curling session.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m never able to consistently reproduce curls that are almost perfect.</li>
            <li> Now I can switch back and forth for the best possible</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly so you don&#x27;t have to wait around.</li>
            <li> I am a person who likes to get things done quick</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and following the advice in the video, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The LED screen is crystal clear and very easy to read.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair bouncy and full, exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li> and if you have super straight hair like me, make sure you use a bit if hairspray right after you do each curl.  </li>
            <li> This makes it easy for me to see how warm the iron is and how long I need to hold that curl in place - there are four timer settings.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever been able to curl my hair so easily, and it even works on my heat resistant wigs, which is a major plus with Comic Con tomorrow!</li>
            <li> put this on the lowest temperature setting, but it&#x27;s still very hot.</li>
            <li> Superior features over the other available variants.</li>
            <li> My curls have last all day and are very cute.</li>
            <li> The most interesting thing about this Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is that I did not spend too much time to get used to it.</li>
            <li> It does great curls that last, even with my fine hair that typically never holds a curl longer than an hour</li>
            <li> I want very fast!</li>
            <li> I can’t express how many times I’d wind my hair around a normal curling iron just to have the ends of my hair fall out before finishing and having to re-curl and re-curl and re-curl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light weighted, and I&#x27;m used to a lot heavier ones</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, she absolutely loves it!!  </li>
            <li> down, lol and</li>
            <li> I really like how easy it is to use and how quick it works.</li>
            <li> I love that this curler gets hot almost immediately, and the high heat is perfect for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> With this magical device, I did my whole head in 20 minutes; less time than it took for me to do my own makeup!</li>
            <li> My new favorite tool.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen is my new favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hair tool.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way a normal curling iron has the capacity to produce such great curls every time.</li>
            <li> It beeps when I should remove it there is no guess work, which is great for those like me that don&#x27;t use an iron every day and know less than nothing about them.</li>
            <li> Besides that my hair is not super dry anymore if you want perfect curls without damaging your hair you will love the Miraqueen.</li>
            <li> The curls last a long time and look great!</li>
            <li> After 23 years of pin straight hair and no curling iron to help me, for the first time in my life I was able to curl my hair and have it HOLD for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and it lets you know if you are using too much hair.</li>
            <li> I appreciated that the wand was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love that it knows how much hair is inside so that I don’t end up having to recurl hair that didn’t take the first time because of thickness.</li>
            <li> She has tried to get a curling iron that can make perfect curls and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and works fast.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and is easy to you.</li>
            <li> The iron is easy to use and you can achieve the look you want without putting too much effort into it.</li>
            <li> I used to have long hair, and if I grow it out again, I&#x27;ll definitely confiscate this iron from my sister lol!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use, but sometimes if I try to put too much hair in, it gets stuck, but it always comes out if you wait for the warning beeps to stop and for it to release the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li> /&gt;The buttons on the iron are also placed very intuitively so you can easily adjust things as you are holding</li>
            <li> You get a much better curl with just a plain old fashioned curling iron and while this is inventive it has a long way to go to be a good product, right now just a really good idea that needs improvement.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for the price and high class functions you&#x27;ll simply love it!</li>
            <li> have tried many similar products, and this is definitely the best in terms of being easy and efficient to use, and creating a style that will stay in place for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many similar products, and this is definitely the best curling iron in terms of being easy and efficient to use, and creating a style that will stay in place for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight thinning hair and adding some volume or curl to it makes it look much fuller.  </li>
            <li> I really love the way it works and the handle, it&#x27;s very comfortable and extremely easy to maneuver, some brands are just heavy and ineffective.</li>
            <li> I did my hair after work and slept on it and the next day I still had lovely bouncy curls!</li>
            <li> glad the old one is gone!  </li>
            <li> , I wish I had seen this here first, I would have saved $40.00!  </li>
            <li> May seem a bit bulky at first, but this iron is a must have!</li>
            <li> This is the  best curling Iron  professionally that i have found it is less damaging to  my clients hair.</li>
            <li> To begin, I love how the buttons are a digital fashion and easy to reach while you are using the iron.</li>
            <li> The ready light makes it easy to know when it’s ready to be used.</li>
            <li> I have fine stick straight hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn your head or hands, makes perfect curls every time and the curls last a long time!!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but after using this MAGIC iron, my curls literally last for days!!</li>
            <li> It is so easy and very rarely have I figured out how to curl my with a new device on the first try.</li>
            <li> Yea, certain types of products and sprays help but Its hard to get that perfect curl right from the get go.</li>
            <li> It has such amazing features.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing and very simple to use!</li>
            <li> , just keep calm and release button.  </li>
            <li> Its multifunction ability is fantastic and the safety features really make this a standout option.  </li>
            <li> The three different heating levels are also amazing because I can customize what type of curl I want based on which level I</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, I didn&#x27;t believe in the hype, but when me latest iron bit the dust a few weeks ago I decided to bite the bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The device is actually quite amazing with the breadth of what it will do for your hair.</li>
            <li> To say that I love this product is a complete understatement.</li>
            <li> That extra feature is just a nice security.</li>
            <li> Every time she uses it her hair looks flawless and my wife has really thin hair</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough good things</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a professional grade iron that has many features.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought that I would be returning it, but NO WAY I am sending this back!!!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money</li>
            <li> Much better looking and no problems so far.</li>
            <li> It gives me a more natural, playful curl than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is because for whatever reason I cannot get it to give a nice curl on the parts in front, to frame my face.</li>
            <li> Better yet, it doesn&#x27;t kill my hair like my old curling iron.</li>
            <li> The price is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> This machine is perfect for women with thin hair.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is, the curls might look looser the following day and if you like that, then leave them</li>
            <li> It is very much worth the money.</li>
            <li> My curls are soft and healthy, I’m</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s thrilled with this, and the operation is simple, trouble-free and reliable.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> She uses it nearly every day and her hair looks absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li> also wasn&#x27;t sure I needed all the extra bells and whistles, as I&#x27;m not the most technical person in the world, but now I&#x27;ve been spoiled by the luxuries of the LCD monitor and being able to choose the curling direction.</li>
            <li> It is so fun to use that it doesn’t feel like a chore every day,</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the design too (pink is definitely my favorite color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a closet full of curling irons, styling wands, hot rollers, etc.  </li>
            <li> I also find the LED screen to be a pretty cool feature to have on a hair tool.</li>
            <li> and shes glad I broke her old one.  </li>
            <li> it works but even with my thick obedient hair the curls didn&#x27;t come out that great</li>
            <li> That alone makes this product worth its weight in gold to me.  </li>
            <li> I have problems with my natural lovely curly hair because I have never found any curler that could not damage my hair.</li>
            <li> It is so cool to have pretty, curly hair again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another useful feature is the swivel socket</li>
            <li> Its worth the price.</li>
            <li> The purchase was definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> Myself, I wouldn&#x27;t mind her hair being straight or curly, but this device has really made her looks stunning.</li>
            <li> No guessing if the temperature is going to be too hot or too cool to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I want to do my hair in fun waves and go out with the friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth it.  </li>
            <li> The Miraqueen is by far one of my favorite hair styling items  </li>
            <li> I gave up for awhile even trying to curl the hair I love, but my friend told me to try the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, Curling Wand, Hair Curler with Ceramic Curling Chamber, I did, and am so thankful I did.</li>
            <li> so far love</li>
            <li> Many of them have felt like cheap plastic that will break in my hand if move to quickly, reminiscent of something you would but at the .99 cent store.</li>
            <li> It was SO worth it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> It works so much better than her old one,</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this curling iron, I would rarely spend the time to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> It sits nicely in my hand and is simple to operate.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of professional curling irons on the market, and as a guy, most of us don&#x27;t use curling irons, but for my daughter&#x27;s sake, we do.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this product but it doesn&#x27;t work well on my short shoulder</li>
            <li> Not only do you not need to change out a rod to match the thickness of the curl, but you can also select the timer that coordinates with that kind of curl.</li>
            <li> so your curls can point in either direction (relieving the user of the pain of trying to twist their hands backwards to get more natural looking curls).</li>
            <li> I am glad I did not waste my money.</li>
            <li> The led screen and all the settings and heat levels make it worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> The time it saves me is well worth the price of the item.  </li>
            <li> (Handy for people with different types of hair, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only has it tamed my thick, unruly mane but produces the most beautiful curls ever!</li>
            <li> but on the weekends when I go out with my husband or girlfriends I always curl my hair and get fresh.</li>
            <li> I really love my Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, Curling Wand, Hair Curler with Ceramic Curling Chamber.</li>
            <li> but I watched some Youtube videos to figure it and it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> The only time my hair got stuck was my own gosh darn fault....</li>
            <li> product is completely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s had so much fun playing with it</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s had so much fun playing with it</li>
            <li> Can count on some nice curl carryover to the next day</li>
            <li> Now, while that may be true, I decided to take matters into my own hands and buy her the new Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy, easy to use, and a real  steal for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other curling irons, but they didn&#x27;t really work great for what I&#x27;d need.</li>
            <li> This is awesome because before one side of my head would have tighter curls and the other side would have looser curls and they would be facing all different types of directions.</li>
            <li> told, the Miraqueen works better, quicker and more efficiently than any other curling iron I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Also.. thank you for the super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> It gets super hot and has an auto power off in case you forget to turn it off.</li>
            <li> Even with my super straight hair, this product worked wonders!</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to our niece, the curling iron heats up quickly, maintains a consistent temperature, and makes curling her hair seemingly effortless.  </li>
            <li> I tried it out using the tight setting first and was happy with the result.</li>
            <li> highly suggest the Miraqueen iron to anyone that has had frustrations with their old curling irons and wants to get gorgeous, long-lasting, natural-looking curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m sure most guys wouldn&#x27;t get what to get for their special someone for any occasion, but I can guarantee that any girl who has trouble getting their hair to curl without hassle would just adore this product.</li>
            <li> She talked about the control panel being superior to other models and easier to make changes on the fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think The Miraqueen Brand has created a good product and will be on the look out for other items they may carry.</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s more of a special occasion device, it does take awhile to curl an entire head of hair (I do have quite a lot of hair</li>
            <li> right for your hair type.</li>
            <li> , I can use it one-handed, and I can always just look on the LED screen to see if it’s the right temperature, so there’s no guess work.</li>
            <li> Beach waves or right curls</li>
            <li> Once I got it and gave it to her she started to use it right away.</li>
            <li> The screen helps me ensure that the iron is at the right temperature</li>
            <li> Also play with the seconds and temp to find the right setting for you.  </li>
            <li> My recommendation is that you should find the right time and temperature for yourself.</li>
            <li> The screen helps me ensure that the iron is at the right temperature</li>
            <li> Instead of trying to just pull your hair right out of curler...</li>
            <li> From day 1 I could see that I&#x27;d made the right choice buying this.  </li>
            <li> and this is just the right thing.</li>
            <li> I have fine, very straight shoulder length hair and it makes great curls that last long.</li>
            <li> The heat settings and automatic timing make this hair tool easy to use for the new user or for a person who has been styling their hair for years.</li>
            <li> She has recommended this already to all of her friends, so I figured I would put her positive review on the internet!</li>
            <li> Just follow the directions and be patient at first while you learn how much hair you need to put in and how smooth it should be.  </li>
            <li> , it does an amazing job for women who don&#x27;t usually do this because of lack of skill and time :)</li>
            <li> With the LCD screen she can adjust the settings to fit exactly what she wants.</li>
            <li> From mediocre to beautiful and handsome.  </li>
            <li> You may not believe in love at first sight, but you’ll truly like the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to figure out the controls, but once I got the hang of it, the results were amazing!</li>
            <li> One tip, I can give for any other &amp;#34;hair challenged&amp;#34; people like me that I found on a video at some point that I found helpful is to section your hair and curl the top first, which is backwards of most tuturiols you see.  </li>
            <li> No other curling iron has made me this satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of quality ceramic and has a pretty high temperature to produce strong curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice not to smell my hair burning every time I try to style it with a flat iron or curling iron!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this over the cheap metal that can burn your hair or give it a burnt smell.  </li>
            <li> The timer is great as it allows her to decide exactly how much curl she wants and takes the guess work out of how long to hold it in place.  </li>
            <li> Best $60 I have spent in a long time!</li>
            <li> It seems to be more gentle to my fine hair than traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> I feel better, look better and get major compliments from people that seem to barely notice me.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron has too many good features to list in this little review.</li>
            <li> Her hair looks great and it takes a lot less time for us to get ready to go.  </li>
            <li> She is able to do more in less time.  </li>
            <li> It is not as quick as they say to curl your whole head when you have lots of hair, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I also love the digital controls and how quickly it heats.</li>
            <li> It is quick and more effortless than a regular curling</li>
            <li> This product really is the most simple curler to use, and it delivers a fantastic finished product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why she has so many products when she barely uses them all.</li>
            <li> Not sure if she would be happy with it.</li>
            <li> There are many advantages of using the Miraqueen compared to regular curling irons: it is cool to not have to worry about a hot barrel burning your fingers, forehead, neck, or ears.</li>
            <li> After a few successful and unsuccessful attempts, I thought I had figured it out</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, and I was so excited when it first came in.</li>
            <li> Curls are nice and stay a long time.</li>
            <li> If you have fine, naturally curly hair, this is the iron you want!</li>
            <li> my wife loves this new curling iron, she was bragging to her friends at church the other day about how great it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great curling iron for most chicks, however, I think long, thin haired women should avoid this product.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine, straight hair, so it takes a good half hour to get my whole head done, though.  </li>
            <li> you you&#x27;re able to get that down, then your knotted/stuck hair days will be over! :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know I can spend less than $300 on a professional iron and get such great results.</li>
            <li> Curling irons, curlers - none of them worked because my hair apparently LIKED being straight, and the sheer weight would make the tightest curl stretch out.</li>
            <li> Long lasting wonderful curls in no time - divide off a strand and feed the hair in the curling chamber and after just a few second--- there they are, beautiful, shiny, glamorous curls!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair held the curls for 3 days, which sounds gross, but it&#x27;s actually  awesome because I don&#x27;t like washing my hair everyday because it keeps it healthier with just 3-4 washes per week.</li>
            <li> wow, it works really fast and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> She LOVES the Miraqueen, and says that this curling iron makes it easy to create long-lasting curls, unlike her old curling irons.</li>
            <li> She plans on buying a few more for Christmas gifts. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the technologies it possess for such a reasonable price, it was kind of a no brainer to try it.</li>
            <li> You know the sound you hear &#x27;cush&amp;#34; the frying your hair sound of a regular curling iron</li>
            <li> Lastly, this is just an overall GREAT product.</li>
            <li> Creates beautiful long lasting curls.  </li>
            <li> We purchased this a few months ago, and since then she has praised me almost daily for buying her the perfect birthday gift.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, it&#x27;s quick to heat up, so by the time I finish seperating my hair to prepare curling it, the hair curler is ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The blue led screen is nice and legible and has the anti tangle feature for the cord which should be included on every device with a wire.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice display that tells you how hot it is, and how long it&#x27;s set to curl</li>
            <li> /&gt;She says that the iron has a few safety features that prevent you from burning yourself...which is important because she&#x27;s kind of a clutz sometimes.</li>
            <li> The LED screen makes it easy to see the temperature (and how far along the iron is in heating up) and direction of the curl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product, I recommend it to anyone who is tired of the cheap stuff.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t super fast</li>
            <li> and then it beeps quickly to let you know your curl is ready.</li>
            <li> Several hours later, I STILL HAD GREAT CURLS.</li>
            <li> irons use intense heat, but the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron keeps you safe from skin or hair burns with its foam and rubber protectors.</li>
            <li> took me about 30 minutes to get all my curls done, I&#x27;m sure with a few more uses</li>
            <li> The device heats up SUPER quickly, which I love, because I am not very patient.</li>
            <li> She asked me to get her a high end curling iron for her birthday; I researched the “Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron” and saw so many people having success.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast (with Prime) and the price is very good, compared to the other types of devices similar to this out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly easy and safe to use (in comparison  to conventional curling irons).  </li>
            <li> All in all a really great product that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who wants a head full of curls with the least amount of pain and effort.</li>
            <li> The only thing that wasn&#x27;t really true for me was that I would be able to curl my whole head in 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The price is also right and cheaper than many standard curling irons.</li>
            <li> This stops me from having to go back and forth, checking to make sure it is balanced right and won&#x27;t burn anything or pose a fire hazard.</li>
            <li> , her curls are so natural, pretty, and they appear to be so damn tight, I am not yet used to her own kind of curl and the setting so much</li>
            <li> I pressed and released to no avail--in fact, that just resulting in it tightening it&#x27;s lockdown on my hair--hair that was on the top level, right next to my crown.</li>
            <li> This stops me from having to go back and forth, checking to make sure it is balanced right and won&#x27;t burn anything or pose a fire hazard.</li>
            <li> I have super straight hair and curled my whole head in about 20 mins!  </li>
            <li> The digital settings are easy to use and once you find a sweet spot, you always know what you are getting.</li>
            <li> It takes less time to hold a strand in the heating system but too long to set the hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> Not hard to use, and actually fun!</li>
            <li> Wife has had many over the years but finally found one that she is really happy with and says she wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the most expensive one in the market.</li>
            <li> When I used it, it would suck the hair in wonderfully, make a beep sound but the curling action would stop after only a few seconds, no matter what the timer was set on.</li>
            <li> She has very straight hair, that used to never curl</li>
            <li> that I haven&#x27;t actually had to curl my own hair with it most of the time.it fast enough to save your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish I had spent my money on something more user friendly.</li>
            <li> If you have thicker hair it will probably go in much much easier with less practice since fly aways aren&#x27;t much of an issue for you.</li>
            <li> Let me describe my hair: below shoulder length, fine, but naturally curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the product effective, but it is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> With the first try I had salon perfect curls, and with my super thick hair it took me only about 30 minutes to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> It is quick, easy, and the curls last all day!  </li>
            <li> LOL that was always the hard part for me</li>
            <li> I have more than enough volume and decent natural wave, I just wanted something more controlled looking.  </li>
            <li> , there is a &#x27;V&#x27; shaped opening for where your hair goes in, it also makes a huge difference if that &#x27;V&#x27; side is closest to your head (opposed to on the far side of curler/away from your head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a higher temperature for that area, a lower temperature for my layers and bangs</li>
            <li> So, I was ECSTATIC when I found the MiraQueen which has it ALL: 3 heat settings, timer, curl direction control and above all the DUAL Voltage.  </li>
            <li> but this just makes it so much easier on her!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s curls the whole night!</li>
            <li> This Miraqueen professional curling iron fit the bill and exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> favorite thing about this curling iron is that you can actually change the direction of the curl with one push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first model that did not hit the trash can within the first week.</li>
            <li> This product not only made my wife very happy, but it also stopped the financial bleeding for me personally.  </li>
            <li> It is really neat and makes curling your hair fun.</li>
            <li> When I first saw it I was horrified because he knows nothing about curling hair.</li>
            <li> this does the job and is better then a regular curling iron that&#x27;s why i got it for my sis.</li>
            <li> and she first started her straightening routine at the age of 13.</li>
            <li> I could of gotten the same effect with my curling iron in about 10-15 minutes top and it would of lasted.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> short, never had curls that lasted more than an hour without the help of a perm.  </li>
            <li> either then it also being so hot to touch to try.  </li>
            <li> This Miraqueen Professional curling iron is fantastic.</li>
            <li> When my husband  first saw this he said he did not now wether to get it or not, but I wish he would have just gotten it because it truly works miracles with your hair.</li>
            <li> I love that it has different heat levels and timer settings.</li>
            <li> Your hair zips into the heating chambers, and after mere seconds, your perfect curls will come bouncing out.</li>
            <li> Now my wife wants one for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Even hot rollers don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> The timer and temperature settings allow me to achieve the exact desired curl tightness that I am looking for.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting better at selecting the proper amount of hair and have had no issues whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I really do love the way it curls and stays curled until I the next time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Overall she was extremely pleased with this and recommends this to all her friends.</li>
            <li> Longer than a curling iron and hot rollers.</li>
            <li> tried this with the hairspray sprayed on first (like the video review) and without.</li>
            <li> I really wish it did on mine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick to hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Hot rollers are not as fun as a device like this could be, but I find them very efficient as I can put makeup on while my hair is curling.</li>
            <li> she knew it was better than any traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> and its very time efficient, and makes curling my hair fun.</li>
            <li> I can use it daily and my hair is still healthy.</li>
            <li> Takes longer than a curling iron because you do smaller chunks of hair, but this is what helps my hair hold the curl better.</li>
            <li> Two days after I first used the iron; I had to go to the doctor for the flu...</li>
            <li> The doctor came in and commented on how pretty my hair was...</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a curl wand.</li>
            <li> The curls looked really pretty and they lasted for the whole evening!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use much hairspray and the curl held up for fifteen hours (would have been longer, but I showered when I got home!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned and bought many different irons over the years.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not even sure it was the same product that everyone else has reviewed.  </li>
            <li> This works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> love this product and totally recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this product and she absolutely LOVES IT!</li>
            <li> From prior experience, I cannot fully express to you how many times I have accidently burned my hands.</li>
            <li> I had decided to try the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron and I cannot believe how smooth and silky my hair is.</li>
            <li> There are guided beeps and it’s pretty foolproof to use, but as always, safety first.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are guided beeps and it’s pretty foolproof to use, but as always, safety first.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product to most anyone.</li>
            <li> Being able to regulate the temperature and set the timer, I get the same curl EVERY TIME!  </li>
            <li> She also can do her hair in so many ways because of the different curling options that this iron has.</li>
            <li> I have tried several times since, and had slightly better results (despite getting my hair stuck as well).  </li>
            <li> Before I found this curler I would have to take two hours with a traditional curling iron, curling and re-curling to make sure the curls stayed.</li>
            <li> It was worth the money and it holds up very well.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t need to manually curl my hair around the barrel, it makes my curling time much faster!</li>
            <li> there is no way I&#x27;d be able to do the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> The only thing you&#x27;d want would be a size control, which I&#x27;m sure these people are working on.</li>
            <li> I was nervous the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> and here I am, I can now see why this got recommended to me in the first place.</li>
            <li> I actually like the curls better</li>
            <li> This is a nifty product and creates consistent, pretty curls.</li>
            <li> alternated the curl direction and my hair looks so natural, smooth and bouncy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works so much better on my hair than the regular curling irons.  </li>
            <li> In short - great for curling long hair.</li>
            <li> And, it doesn’t take much time, either!</li>
            <li> And this curler makes curls exactly how I wanted.</li>
            <li> This device makes my curls lay so much nicer!</li>
            <li> After 20 minutes of wrestling with it, we finally were able to pull/untangle her hair.  </li>
            <li> , that was the first time I became a hair stylist.</li>
            <li> The last curl setting for this curler is my roommate&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li> It even has an automatic shut off if it&#x27;s left in your hair for more than 25 seconds, or if it&#x27;s simply left on for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t be more simple!</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I noticed it did not leave my hair feeling &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; like smoke coming from it.</li>
            <li> After doing many hours of extensive research I came to the conclusion of purchasing this model.  </li>
            <li> And that is exactly what I got.  </li>
            <li> Smaller sections works much better.  </li>
            <li> I really like how it does my hair, and I thought it was worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> and so far she says it has been fantastic for her.</li>
            <li> I really have no complaints with the product, it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> and I had no difficulty figuring out how to use it the first time.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m throwing my out of date hot rollers out.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I am adding a 5 star review, hoping people will find it here first and save themselves some money.</li>
            <li> This curling iron does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s digital</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for years (what used to be called Japanese straightening), so it&#x27;s straightened all except about the top 6 inches or so, but it does tend to wear off a bit after awhile -</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time, and it worked like a champ.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it probably took me 30 minutes to do my hair, but that was because of the learning curve.  </li>
            <li> Will experiment more with the different directions of curls at some point.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> My hair consistently got tangled in the curling chamber.  </li>
            <li> just glad she stopped getting her fingers and ears occasionally burnt.</li>
            <li> Hot hair wand with LED screen- displays timer, temperature, and curl</li>
            <li> well, I thought at first.</li>
            <li> Overall its a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> There are beep sounds and easy-to-read displays that let you keep track of time and temperature pretty</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;child-proof.&amp;#34; The tourmaline ceramic technology also protects your hair from heat damage, so that&#x27;s pretty fool-proof.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it’s really efficient!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really ambitious at the beginning.</li>
            <li> She even told us that she would recommend it to all of her friends because as she put it, &amp;#34;yeah, it&#x27;s that great&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making such a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> After using this, not only did it hold the curls for my important meeting at work, but they stayed beautiful all that day, through the night, and all the way up until my shower the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This iron also gets hot, maxing out at 450 degrees.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through a many similar devices.</li>
            <li> The curls of her hair started looking different than ever which seriously I love.</li>
            <li> Being a short haired person myself, I wasn&#x27;t exaclty to sure where to start.</li>
            <li> First off</li>
            <li> I must admit the first thing that drew me to this curling iron were the looks.</li>
            <li> does so much more than just a simple curl.</li>
            <li> and I needed something with a digital screen and some more flexible options.  </li>
            <li> It has been well over a year since I first started using this</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes and it exceeded my expectations!!</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it has multiple curl directions and timer settings.  </li>
            <li> You adjust the setting on the handle to the type of curl you want and it will tell you exactly when to remove it with a series of beeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like the safety features because I don’t know how many times I have burned my head or hand on a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The three-beep notification helps make sure that all of her curls are equal.</li>
            <li> ended up returning it because its another machine that most likely wont use.</li>
            <li> I, like so many others, have bought wands and straightners and watched countless videos on how to use them to achieve pretty curly hair with no luck.  </li>
            <li> but there isn&#x27;t much of a learning curve, it just works!  </li>
            <li> The first time it was a bit tighter than I was going for, but still pretty.  </li>
            <li> The bottom section fell out after about a day, the top section stayed curly for 3 sleeps after the initial curl - with NO hairspray - probably would have stayed longer</li>
            <li> I get much better curls with my conair regular iron.</li>
            <li> but the device just stopped getting hot.</li>
            <li> so I was willing to give this curling wand a try.</li>
            <li> I get 4 different women with this one curling iron :)  </li>
            <li> and she knows exactly when to release the curl for the looks</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair like most curling irons do, and it leaves curls that last for days.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was probably closer to 25 minutes, and a lot of that was probably just because it was the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just make sure you are not using sections of hair that are too big, and brush out the section before you feed it in, or it might get caught.  </li>
            <li> This really works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I can use my straightener, but I still have to do every curl twice or more for about 45 mins, and when I&#x27;m done my hair smells burned, looks burned, and the curl doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> I was worried about using this and getting my hair tangled the first time I used it</li>
            <li> It is fast and it works!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it took me just 10 minutes to  curl my hair</li>
            <li> It heats up hot and curls my hair in seconds.</li>
            <li> And since you don&#x27;t have to touch the hot part of the iron I no longer burn my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> At first I was weary because it looked so bulky</li>
            <li> It even shuts off after the timer goes off, so my hair is safe even if I left it in there.</li>
            <li> I have used curling irons, rollers, steam setters, hot curlers</li>
            <li> IT TAKES ME 15 MINUTES TO CURL MY WHOLE HEAD OF HAIR WITH THIS!</li>
            <li> At first it looked like a vibrator when it popped up on the search until I read</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t need to manually curl my hair around the barrel, it makes my curling time much faster!</li>
            <li> first couple of times that i used this, my hair got stuck and i had to yank it out of the curler, however it did not always come out</li>
            <li> /&gt;***And once i realized the curler works a million times better if it is always facing the same way (as in...</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen curler is much more than just a fancy digital display.</li>
            <li> It is safe, there is NO possible way to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> You can set the temperature to whatever you&#x27;d like, so if you have more fragile hair, you can set the iron to a lower temperature.  </li>
            <li> Heats up in a minute or two so fast !</li>
            <li> I love the three different timer settings (</li>
            <li> It beeps and you&#x27;re ready!</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Curling Iron is so refreshing for several reasons!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the Miraqueen, the heat distribution is pretty even so</li>
            <li> I love that you only need one hand to operate the iron.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I was pretty fascinated with all of the features.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, but it still looked great just messing around.</li>
            <li> Hoping to take my time and really see what this thing can do!</li>
            <li> Its so fast &amp; easy to use, its just crazy &amp; finally I get to have beautiful amazing curls.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li> In addition, the way the hair goes in is easier to get right, and it does not seem to twist the curl quite as much.  </li>
            <li> This is actually great for anyone from younger children to older women.&lt;br /&gt;Not to get emotional, but this hair straightener kinda changed my life...</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a very good little investment in time-savings and money.</li>
            <li> The three timer settings are perfect, I set it for a tight curl when I feel the weather is going to be rough on my hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely think this is more for long hair because it&#x27;s just too big to try to successfully work with shorter hair</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I was able to get a full head of beautiful, bouncy curls that actually lasted ALL</li>
            <li> With super fine and completely straight hair, I have been through so many curling irons that were never able to produce results.</li>
            <li> She also got ready much quicker than usual which I was happy about.</li>
            <li> I pulled the plug to make sure the heat was off and just tugged a little section of hair out at a time and had it free in about 5 seconds.  </li>
            <li> with most technologically advanced products, it takes a little practice to get used to the design.</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron on the roots of my hair once I&#x27;m done to help it lay better.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for Santa to bring me this that I had to stop myself from trying it out early.  </li>
            <li> It would get warm but not nearly as hot as it needed to be.</li>
            <li> Some other nice perks: it&#x27;ll change the rotation of the curler</li>
            <li> When I saw this flat iron, I decided to give it a try, and I love the curls it gives me.</li>
            <li> While the contraption looks complicated at first, it&#x27;s actually great for people who are not super experienced with using curling irons.</li>
            <li> This curling iron gets hot very fast and maintains temperature the whole time while I&#x27;m doing my hair.</li>
            <li> I love how quick and efficient it is, compared to a lot of other curling irons.</li>
            <li> This brings hi-tech to the standard low tech curling gear and makes it ultra safe and easy.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use although you need to be patient because the pieces of hair need to be pretty small</li>
            <li> But when I tried it from the middle or top of my hair, it was too much for it.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen is definitely by far, MY FAVORITE curling iron thus far.</li>
            <li> I love how this one looks heavy but is quite light.</li>
            <li> With this curling iron she is able to wear her hair straight, or with 3 different types of curls.  </li>
            <li> Love the different settings and what a relief to know it has an auto shut off because teenagers can be very absent minded at times.  </li>
            <li> The timers and heat settings make it very easy to see and operate this to get your desired curl, If you are thinking about getting a new iron spend the couple of extra dollars and get the Mirqueen you will not regret it at all.</li>
            <li> This is the fifth month of using this curl now, my little niecejust took my curler so am here to get another one right now, I don&#x27;t have any kind of issues with this curler.</li>
            <li> even my flat irons (nothing like a good first to second degree burn to start your morning!)</li>
            <li> Its service really awesome.i like it very much.</li>
            <li> For slightly more than most of the curling irons I&#x27;ve bought in the past, I have one that does not fight me!  </li>
            <li> The pink is always on top; i attempted to hold it upside down a couple of times because it was more comfortable depending on the area of my head i was curling.</li>
            <li> highly recommend Miraqueen to anyone who wants beautiful, quality, natural looking, long-lasting curls in half the time without the work.</li>
            <li> Also this defiantly has more settings then an average curling iron, also the timer feature is super helpful and makes it</li>
            <li> The curler heats up very quickly and stays hot throughout my entire use.</li>
            <li> The curler heats up very quickly and stays hot throughout my entire use.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try after watching the videos and reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything the positive reviews say about it.</li>
            <li> After using hers a couple of times and noticing positive results, I had to have this iron for myself.  </li>
            <li> But after looking for hours, I decided to go with the Miraqueen because of all the positive things people are saying about it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the curling iron about 4 weeks ago and have had nothing but positive results with it</li>
            <li> The safety features in place on this curling iron are fantastic, and very much appreciated by an easily distracted adult such as myself.</li>
            <li> The only downside I could see is that it is a bit heavy, but I think as I get better at using the process will go more quickly and the weight wont even be an issue.</li>
            <li> With multiple heat settings and a nice LED screen you can&#x27;t go wrong with styling your hair nicely and easily.</li>
            <li> This is the first innovation in curling irons in 20 years that really works.</li>
            <li> The no-tangle cord really makes everything so much easier, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I make her tell me exactly what she wants</li>
            <li> However, the curls died off much quicker than what happens with my hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> The shortest pieces on top are about 4-5 inches long.</li>
            <li> The curl holds better and lasts to some degree all day long.</li>
            <li> You need to brush tangles out first and not put too much hair in or it will get stuck.</li>
            <li> I was worried because I have long hair and wasn&#x27;t sure if my hair would get stuck a lot.</li>
            <li> Not having to wrap your hair around the rod also pretty much eliminates the chance of burning yourself, so if you were prone to burning yourself on curling irons before and have the blisters to prove it, do yourself a favor and buy</li>
            <li> I like my long hair but wanted more volume and curls.</li>
            <li> and I did get a beep on the first attempt that I had too much hair in the chamber</li>
            <li> As a fervent addict and a woman with very big obsession for natural curl, you really should have noticed that I have my own day dreams about how I want my hair to look like.</li>
            <li> I have long hair with layers and still work, still getting use to it. :)</li>
            <li> I had pretty much given up on attempting to use a curling iron when this one was recommended to me.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really time myself to the exact minute -</li>
            <li> It curls my hair pretty fast for the length that I have.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other curling irons, you have found the best.</li>
            <li> It did curl my straight hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> Just buy a good small curling iron.</li>
            <li> All the heating and curling action occurs within the head of the device, leaving the outsides cool to touch.</li>
            <li> With all the good though, I will also mention two small tips to help others get started.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Further testing showed that the curls could hold up for nearly 10 hours before being completely flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered one and loved how fool proof the machine is.</li>
            <li> in the time it takes me to just put rollers in, i&#x27;ve got a full head of soft or springy curls - depending on heat and time.  </li>
            <li> With regular curling irons, I never know how long to leave them in my hair to get a nice, full curl.</li>
            <li> Now it not only curls beautifully, but it holds for days with no special product or hair spray (ewwww) in my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The curls produced are beautiful, and if creates a variety of different curling options from tight, defined curls, to relaxed, beachy curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The curls produced are beautiful, and if creates a variety of different curling options from tight, defined curls, to relaxed, beachy curls.</li>
            <li> Each individual strand is pretty fine, but there are a ton of them.  </li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, Curling Wand, Hair Curler with Ceramic Curling Chamber is a great little find!  </li>
            <li> i have never been able to curl my hair, and it makes beautiful curls with my thick black hair.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit time to get her used to, but I have noticed that she’s already been very satisfied with the result she is having, and it’s really noticeable.</li>
            <li> Two of the ladies are from South Korea with this lovely beautiful shinning black hair; I had so much fun to change their thick straight long hair to beautiful curly style without so much trouble using my curler.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these for my daughters--one a freshman in college and the other a sophomore in high school--and they love it!</li>
            <li> The combination of healthy hair and high temp curls means that curls will last and last.&lt;br /&gt;-LED</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to slide your hair through the clasp, while some other curling irons will snag on your hair if you try.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to glide your hair through the clasp, while some other curling irons will snag your hair while pulling it through.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to glide your hair through the clasp, while some other curling irons will snag your hair while pulling it through.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use</li>
            <li> It worked ok not much curl at first</li>
            <li> She is very particular about her hair both for her job and the acing she does on the weekend.</li>
            <li> Really easy and simple to use without the fear of burning yourself.</li>
            <li> The iron also heats up very quickly and has multiple heat settings to choose from.</li>
            <li> it’s easy to forget to turn it off between being rushed, or a teen’s forgetfulness.</li>
            <li> Easy enough that my inept hair doing self can do it.</li>
            <li> The curler is absolutely simple to use and easy to play around with.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up very quickly, and i use the 12 second timer.</li>
            <li> Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is a Super Affordable Curling Wand.  </li>
            <li> Pops out curls easy enough.</li>
            <li> My hair is known to fall over the subsequent hours but these curls stay strong.</li>
            <li> I had attended my cousin&#x27;s wedding a few months back, and her hair looked beautiful.</li>
            <li> For long lasting curls I would say give it a shot if you want to look as good as she does.</li>
            <li> Since different hair types require different settings that’s not a problem  with The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron because it has 3 heat levels to choose from and 4 timer settings and if you forget about your timing, one of the many fascinating features about this curling iron is, it will actually shut off to prevent any damage.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron will curl your entire head of hair in under 10 minutes, and is good for anything from a bob to long, luscious hair.</li>
            <li> I laughed a little inside and wondered how my husband would take it if I showed it to him and said, “this is my new toy.”</li>
            <li> Amazingly Smart.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn, but it certainly hurt because it was trying to pull my hair out of my head.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to put large chunks in, my hair got stuck and burned it.</li>
            <li> This curler made it so easy though and now I can curl my hair every other day really quickly.</li>
            <li> She figured out after one minor knot exactly what to do, and she can do it very quickly and easily by herself, even at the back of her head.  </li>
            <li> so I bought a few more for them for Christmas!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been worth the money so far!</li>
            <li> My days of searching are over, and I&#x27;m definitely getting rid of those other old curling irons for good!</li>
            <li> It also has a protective heat case so you can put it away right away instead of waiting for it to cool back</li>
            <li> I can choose what kind of curls I want because I prefer tight, spiral curls</li>
            <li> but it pulled right out and most of the time it lets you know if something is not right by beeping a whole bunch and unlocking itself.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I can easily see how you&#x27;d end up having to cut your hair out of this thing if you mess it up, but it&#x27;s easy to get the hang of pretty quickly and start to predict when its going to complain and fix it fast enough to save your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This curler is just naturally pretty; I never taught I could find something like this, so my new roommate is a blessing!</li>
            <li> My hair is not long enough for this to be effective.</li>
            <li> I have straight coarse hair, my hair cuticle is also very compact so it doesn&#x27;t take curls every easily.  </li>
            <li> Because of my fine hair, I have only ever used this on the lowest heat and curl time setting (370 degrees/8 seconds)</li>
            <li> automatic curling as the main star, curling could not be any faster!</li>
            <li> Not only does it work perfectly and last a long time, it is also super affordable and is worth every penny spent on it!</li>
            <li> reading all of the directions first, and coming  my hair through very carefully before I got started, I was able to get the hang of this curling iron</li>
            <li> Kind of want to try another one, but I&#x27;m a little hesitant.</li>
            <li> This product got my hair to go in nice little waves.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a curling iron that can curl any hair type fast and efficiently!</li>
            <li> I say this because my hair is super long and super straight.  </li>
            <li> But I will say if I ever did suddenly have a &#x27;jam&#x27; where the hair got caught, you knew pretty quickly and it was easy with the open system to get the hair out and try again.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen seems much better than her other hair things, and she’s very happy with it (which is really what matters)!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, long story short, THANK YOU for helping this old man with his teenage daughter crisis.</li>
            <li> She also loves the 3 curl settings and the other options provided to easily create many different types of curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to create amazing curls across my whole head -- even those hard to reach places on the back of my head!!  </li>
            <li> Now, I just need a curling iron that will leave waves in my straight hair for the whole day, instead of just going straight again in an hour.  </li>
            <li> Its ready to go fast and the styling time is fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I got the Miraqueen curling iron, I use to have a traditional curling iron but not all my curls looked good because it&#x27;s difficult to do the back of your hair</li>
            <li> My hair is pin straight but using the Miraqueen Curling Iron helps to get the looks I want.</li>
            <li> Once your hair is in, the machine will beep, and once it is ready to release, it will beep faster.</li>
            <li> Thanks for bringing MiraQueen to amazon.  </li>
            <li> you are getting so much out of it</li>
            <li> the amount of hair spray I had to use just to keep the curl was so much that my hair would never&lt;br /&gt;look</li>
            <li> This has really better then what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> My wife has naturally straight hair and likes to curl it often.  </li>
            <li> It makes my mornings so much easier.  </li>
            <li> The curling iron itself is very durable and well made.</li>
            <li> I also really like the auto shut-off feature.  </li>
            <li> She has very wavy hair that tends to frizz</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helpful and convenient</li>
            <li> Took me 15 mins to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> It is really revolutionary</li>
            <li> I can set the timer and it beeps when the curlers are ready for use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s hair and worked very well.</li>
            <li> The technology and functionality of this iron is really amazing.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Not to mention the curls/waves are absolutely effortless to create.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this curler to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would however recommend you get the detangler and pay attention to how much hair you put in curler.</li>
            <li> The whole issue was my fault</li>
            <li> No need for too much hair spray.</li>
            <li> I guess I can&#x27;t say much for the product, because I never got to use it.  </li>
            <li> The ease of use (once you figure it out) makes curling your hair a much quicker process than &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; curling irons.</li>
            <li> With the MiraQueen, you hear a beep when your hair is done and ready to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went straight to the bathroom and curled my hair.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have much time or patience to fiddle with my hair</li>
            <li> It recognizes when you add too much and will beep to notify you and then uncoil.</li>
            <li> The device beeps @ you if you try putting too much hair in it, so don&#x27;t panic if that happens &amp; just release the lever &amp; try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did get my hair tangled a couple of times trying to curl either too much hair</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Haha.  </li>
            <li> (I put too much hair into it and it beeped and spit my hair out - then never took up hair again).</li>
            <li> It tells you when there is too much hair in chamber.  </li>
            <li> : I have so much hair, B:</li>
            <li> the real difference in any of them.</li>
            <li> My curls have never had so much volume and shine.</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and his mother really adored me with the curls.</li>
            <li> And that I didn&#x27;t used to curl my hair much before.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t very time consuming either.</li>
            <li> So basically I’ve just lived with straight hair forever.</li>
            <li> I really like doing the wavy curls, but I’ve done some tighter spirals too as part of up-dos and this iron works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like that they thought about that stuff when making this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have stick straight hair, and I had given up on trying to add any curl to it because it would never hold.</li>
            <li> , within an hour my hair would just fall straight again.</li>
            <li> but I never went through with it because I didn&#x27;t like the idea of putting that much chemical processing in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of layers in my hair, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> It saves her a lot of time because it curls her hair much faster.  </li>
            <li> So it really means something</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron for my wife, as I really like the way her hair looks when it&#x27;s curled, but she never enjoys the process of curling her hair.</li>
            <li> have to agree with the everyone else, the chamber feature is really neat to watch.</li>
            <li> and she really seems to like</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to anyone who need it!.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to even consider purchasing the MIraqueen because nothing ever works to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> The beeps helped me to know when the hair was ready also.</li>
            <li> timer function is very helpful, too.</li>
            <li> really hope you guys try this out.</li>
            <li> really hope you guys try this out.</li>
            <li> This is what my wife needs for her naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li> and she just absolutely adores this product for both its efficiency and simpleness in getting her hair to curl.</li>
            <li> so I can decide how much curl I want.</li>
            <li> 2) Don&#x27;t try to do too much at once.</li>
            <li> I can be really picky about the types of irons and wands I use on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Her hair is shorter and much thinner.  </li>
            <li> This is really what it is.</li>
            <li> to be a real celebrity look alike.</li>
            <li> This product really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I admit it, I don&#x27;t like to spend too much time and effort on my hair.</li>
            <li> Whenever I see advertised products, it just seems to take so much time and effort, and I don&#x27;t have that much time during the day.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this curling iron!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is extremely straight and even when we put curlers in overnight, her hair never seems to retain the curl.  </li>
            <li> Here are some tips, treat the curling iron gently, and do not put too much hair into the roller.</li>
            <li> The styling time is fast but the curls look like it may have taken me hours to create.</li>
            <li> After I remembered how much she cursed at her curling iron every morning</li>
            <li> It Heats up really fast and well.</li>
            <li> It heats fast.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Where has this curling iron been my whole life?  </li>
            <li> it wants to do.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The videos here were really helpful.</li>
            <li> Do not put too much hair at a time in.  </li>
            <li> Well, she&#x27;s very touchy about her hair and was very concerned with using devices like this to do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never paid that much for a curling iron before</li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> I watched a video before trying to use it which really helped get the hang of how it was supposed to work.</li>
            <li> style really holds up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heat up time is fast</li>
            <li> really like the led display because I can keep a eye on the temperature and the automatic curling feature is a life saver..</li>
            <li> No matter how much I used hair spray and a curling iron</li>
            <li> It was gentle on my hair and did not pull or tangle at all.</li>
            <li> gently remove the hair, brush it out, and retry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and efficient, and I can do a variety of things with my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these for my wife (my head is shaved) and she really loves it.  </li>
            <li> With Miraqueen, it sets every time painlessly, and the whole night people ask where I got my hair done.</li>
            <li> After you get the hang of it, it is much faster then curling your hair with an iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It won&#x27;t pull out ur hair even if u put too much</li>
            <li> I figured that after I slept on my hair it would be straight when I woke up</li>
            <li> It also beeps whens it ready to use and when to release the handle.</li>
            <li> Let start off saying that I have really straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Using this curling iron has made the processes go so much faster and easier.  </li>
            <li> The curling wand even detects when you have placed to much hair into it.  </li>
            <li> Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is so worth the buy, just wait 4 seconds</li>
            <li> For the money it is quite a value and is made really well.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s always spending way too much time curling her hair.  </li>
            <li> The wife and I purchased this curling iron for her as a gift, and she absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I got one, and I will never go back to my cheap curling iron</li>
            <li> If you have any questions, just look at the reviews with videos---they were very helpful in making a decision for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The “R” for ready will stop blinking when the iron has reached your selected curling temperature.</li>
            <li> I very much enjoy curling my hair, but would do it very occasionally because the metal irons felt (and smelled)</li>
            <li> like they were very damaging.</li>
            <li> And it looked really</li>
            <li> girlfriend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Smooth curls are achieved regularly and with no problem.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s made very well.</li>
            <li> And when you put too much hair in it gives you an error beep.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> The machine itself takes about 1 minute from the time you turn it on until it&#x27;s ready to use at this setting.</li>
            <li> You will know it&#x27;s ready when it stops blinking</li>
            <li> When it does, it&#x27;s always my fault from putting too much hair in at once and the machine promptly stops.  </li>
            <li> My hair is stick straight</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> so i had to play with it to the point that i might as well use a real curler.</li>
            <li> I have very baby-fine hair and layered about shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> it was too much hair and stopped.  </li>
            <li> It beeps at you if you put in too much hair (for me about 1 inch width is the max).</li>
            <li> I really like the results and may record a video...</li>
            <li> I really, really did.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for curling irons, I would absolutely suggest this one</li>
            <li> the curl held all day which was a real plus.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s design really targets those who want to save time and have hair like a goddess.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> Now with Miraqueen it stays curled all day, and I don&#x27;t have to use as much product in my hair.</li>
            <li> It seemed about a bit much for a hair curler, but the reviews made it seem so tempting, so I bought it anyways to see what the fuss was about.</li>
            <li> so she really can&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot longer than five minutes to curl 10&amp;#34; - 12&amp;#34; straight hair.</li>
            <li> Too much work.</li>
            <li> Plus it felt as if it took so much longer to curl my hair than if i were to use a curling iron!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it even \\&quot;knows\\&quot; somehow if you have too much hair in as it will unwind, and halt the curling pricess.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it because the heat is evenly distributed, thus produces longer lasting results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have as much time as I would hope to use this</li>
            <li> no diagrams telling you where to put your hair, how much, etc.</li>
            <li> and it tells you when it&#x27;s ready to be used.</li>
            <li> High quality product!</li>
            <li> You can really feel the quality when you use it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> How much hair do I curl at once?</li>
            <li> I have always done this but find with the Miraqueen it really holds up and make my locks bouncy.</li>
            <li> tourmaline technology really made a difference.</li>
            <li> I really recommend to have you try it out.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not thin</li>
            <li> especially compared to the mainstream curling iron we have had available for years&lt;br /&gt;--  </li>
            <li> Really seems to be kinder to my hair than the mainstream style curling iron</li>
            <li> and I love the way my curls last all through the evening even when I dance, perspire and am really wild.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how many settings it has for different curls</li>
            <li> However, in each case it was because I didn&#x27;t use the machine properly, either putting in too much hair or putting in hair with tangles (make sure your hair is COMPLETELY combed before using this or you will have issue).</li>
            <li> This is great for a casual, fun look.</li>
            <li> I have super thick, course hair and it gets tangled and ratty very easily</li>
            <li> It may be time for me to put down those hot rollers because this is just so much more convenient and much faster.</li>
            <li> This brand/model beats many others because you can make curls spiral left or right to hug your face or sweep back more&lt;br /&gt;--  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well and simplifies hair curling to a new degree.</li>
            <li> and NOTHING worked, This little appliance is easy and quick.</li>
            <li> It also got much hotter (450 degrees Farenheit) than most of the other models.</li>
            <li> It left my hair really curly and with its unique design</li>
            <li> I have used countless curling irons, curling brushes, hot rollers… all with the same results: after nearly frying my hair, I get nice curls, but within an hour or 2, they are falling out and my hair is straight again.</li>
            <li> so generally curls fall from my hair quite quickly.</li>
            <li> (None of them look as fancy as this, they are just the plain looking ones), but she always uses this one, so that is a good indication that this is a good curling iron, or at the very least, better than all of those average curling irons.</li>
            <li> I really like having this cutie as it&#x27;s also very easy to travel with, and an essential piece for every girl - I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just straighten my hair first, section it, put my hair in the chamber and set the timer for 10 seconds (which I also love that you can choose how tight of curls you want based on the timers).</li>
            <li> after a couple of tries, she got a pretty good idea on how it works and why it’s definitely an improvement over her old one.</li>
            <li> and I go through a lot of misery to keep it clean and curl, some curlers only end up giving me pain by drying my hair out too much and some just go to the extreme of giving me more frizz than my desired curl.</li>
            <li> The digital control/display is very clear and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After 6 months of very frequent use (practically daily) it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other curling iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Also make sure you don&#x27;t have any stray hairs from other parts of your head or they will get tangled.</li>
            <li> Unlike most of the other curling irons out there, it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair because it uses ceramic heating technology.</li>
            <li> It is a great little tool however, if you have a lot of hair as I do, this machine takes too long.</li>
            <li> She told that this is so much better than the other she have used before.</li>
            <li> but they just sprung back to it&#x27;s original shape.</li>
            <li> have extra long curly hair and this works great especially in humid weather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she had bought many other curling irons that did not work in her hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they work for other people, just not for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this after having tried so many other products out there.  </li>
            <li> Our friends are always asking her how she gets her curls so perfect, and after the first few days using it she has been thanking me at least once a day for it.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other hair curler because it doesn&#x27;t effect her hair in any way.</li>
            <li> I LOVE PINK! .</li>
            <li> Better than I expected !</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nonetheless, if you&#x27;re like me and LOVE your hair curled but become very nervous when someone gets too close to your head with a conventional branding--er, curling--iron, you&#x27;ll adore this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nonetheless, if you&#x27;re like me and LOVE your hair curled but become very nervous when someone gets too close to your head with a conventional branding--er, curling--iron, you&#x27;ll adore this product.  </li>
            <li> I insisted she get a new one from time to time, but she had none of it, claiming that her old one did a great job and that she was just clumsy when using it.</li>
            <li> This is so simple to use with its 3 heat levels and 4 timber settings, it is suitable for multiple hair types.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s family invited me to go to a famous oyster place to grab some fresh oysters and picnic at the beach this past weekend.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t take a chance if your hair is long and fine.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t try to curl your hair in the shower you will be fine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;--  Works very well on my relatively dry and fine hair and holds all day</li>
            <li> It turned out to be unnecessary: I was in the pouring rain, wearing hair-covering veil, but I thought it looked pretty good for the reception even after being drenched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t bother curling my hair or using more than a hair dryer to curl my hair due to time constraints and having very un-curler-friendly hair.</li>
            <li> The technology is VERY cool, but the results are very limited.</li>
            <li> I can last an entire week with a great loose curl after the one time.</li>
            <li> Knowing (and more important being reminded) how long the curler has been applied helps to get a consistent and predictable look every time.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so it holds curls very very well.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to curl their hair.</li>
            <li> I remember when it was a simple plug up, wait to heat, grip it and continuously burn your scalp, now we have the Miraqueen proffesional curling iron, which is equipped with digital controls, a rotary function allowing you to choose the direction it curls, it heats in an reasonable amount of time and very comfortable when holding.</li>
            <li> One of the things I love about it is that if something is not right, it beeps 3 times to let you know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had probably 20 or more conventional curling irons in my life.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t say much more about it, but I believe her because she has over 100k instagram followers and is a big influence on social media...</li>
            <li> like that the iron lets you know when it&#x27;s done by beeping and the whole system makes it feel much more safer than the ordinary curling iron (where it is entirely too easy to cause damage to your hair).</li>
            <li> which is a major accomplishment for me who ALWAYS has a pony tail for no reason other than it is a style that is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Evidently her old one did not have these settings.</li>
            <li> The product came out of the box and plastic full of water spots, greasy finger prints and had blonde hairs stuck in it, and hanging over it.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen curling iron works so well that her curls last a full day and even through the night.</li>
            <li> my hair looks full and bouncy, as if i stepped out of the salon- and last all day!&lt;br /&gt;love it!</li>
            <li> When my mom saw it the first time and saw it in action, she said she has dreamed about someone making something like this as she hand rolled her hair each time.  </li>
            <li> let you know when it&#x27;s ready, so you&#x27;re over-doing it or wasting too much time, And I have to admit the automatic curling is actually kinda fun to</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to be in control of their curling process but still be able to do it with ease and with a lesser risk of damaging their hair.</li>
            <li> I am a mother of two, one of which is a toddler, and fixing my hair is not a top priority though I&#x27;ve always sought out ways to curly my hair which is so popular now</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, is gives you a consistent curls.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That is why I never worry burning my hands while handling the curling iron because it leaves the outside area cool.</li>
            <li> I feel like this was due to the fact that, after sucking up the end section of hair, it kept trying to suck up more and more hair that wasn&#x27;t there, which could have tightly curled some of the hair in the chamber.  </li>
            <li> Its really safe, and as long as you keep the hair in the &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; then you wont have any issues with hair getting caught, and even when if it does a little bit, it lets go easily and doesn&#x27;t cause damage or hurt.</li>
            <li> also really like how it&#x27;s not hard to use</li>
            <li> case you forget, which I love because I don&#x27;t have to worry about the house burning down.</li>
            <li> And I love that it&#x27;s not hot!</li>
            <li> This is great for the mom on the go, the fashionista (like myself) any length of hair(I mean not bald obviously) and any type of hair, curly, straight, processed, not processed etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for: less time, no burnt smell, hair extension friendly, comfortable for small hands, and affordable.</li>
            <li> As a salon owner we are always seeing new products and well this one just blew us away!  </li>
            <li> And the price was great, it was like half the price of other brands I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> The kind of hair that you curl with a curling iron, hair spray until it’s as hard as plastic, and then somehow it’s still straight within 35 minutes.</li>
            <li> Automatic is really the new age.</li>
            <li> MiraQueen is also light and easy to grasp, making those accidental drops less likely to happen and reduce fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> This heats up very quickly and works as expected.</li>
            <li> I was able to curl all of my hair in less than 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> To hold the curl perfectly and add a bit of shine I used about an 1/8th of a teaspoon of coconut oil on the bottom half of my hair and the ends, to wet or dry hair before I curled my hair.</li>
            <li> It was more like a half wave.</li>
            <li> - less is better when loading it in.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is  ceramic, which makes it less damaging for your hair than metal curling irons.</li>
            <li> I love that it is ceramic, which makes it less damaging for my hair than metal curling irons.</li>
            <li> Luckily, once was enough!  </li>
            <li> I can report my hair did not tangle once, and after a few curls I was able to figure out how much hair was supposed to go in the barrel.</li>
            <li> After trying so many different curling irons, I have finally found a winner!</li>
            <li> It feels very solidly built to last for many years.</li>
            <li> I will personally always keep it on the alternate setting because I think the curls look better &amp; make your hair look fuller that way.</li>
            <li> It automatically turns off which makes me feel better since I have a two year old and am forgetful sometimes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great for everyone to use, definitely buy this curler if you want to be sure you aren&#x27;t going to have to buy a different again!</li>
            <li> Its way more convenient than a regular curler and the curls last forever.</li>
            <li> When I got this one (because of the digital controls) I could get the same curl pattern by setting it on 8 seconds and 370 deg, so this one is going to be more flexible in what I can do with it.  </li>
            <li> I love that I am choose different curls for different days.</li>
            <li> my hair holds cute corkscrew curls all day long with barely any hairspray.</li>
            <li> Super simple tho.</li>
            <li> this is just so you know my particular challenges as I was looking for something to style my hair in a manner that would stay and not turn</li>
            <li> I have spent my entire life wishing for nice curls.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and has multiple heat settings to choose from.</li>
            <li> I did not think it would, but I compared my older curling iron with this one and</li>
            <li> The only change I would make is to be able to decrease the temperature further than is allowed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I had to live my life so far without it!!!</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a new curling iron.!</li>
            <li> That being said, I would recommend the Miraqueen to ANY girl who wants to achieve natural, bouncy curls - or if you have very very straight hair, this iron will provide you with natural looking waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first I was hesitant about using it because it has such a different design than regular curling irons, but it is actually very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a fantastic product, I recommend it to all ladies and guys that are looking for a gift to give their significant other.</li>
            <li> It is not nearly as user friendly as it seems in the videos, or by reading instructions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally noticed that her hair looks and feels better, and it doesn&#x27;t take her nearly as long to get ready.</li>
            <li> To be such a high tech iron, it is extremely affordable compared to other models, and is very easy and safe to use.</li>
            <li> After getting my first curler from my new roommate, my hair and lifestyle has changed completely.</li>
            <li> you want a tight, classier, more controlled curl, do use a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight, very fine hair that will only hold a very loose curl for a minimum length of time of time.  </li>
            <li> With the protective case, you can put the curling iron away right after use instead of waiting for it to cool down.</li>
            <li> It came with a protective case, so I can put my curling iron away right after I use instead it of waiting for it to cool down.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for salon-styled hair at home, I would highly recommend this item as a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>

            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because it had everything I was looking for (ceramic - high heat – timer).  </li>
            <li> It appeared bulky and a bit high tech.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used very thin strands and even with that and the highest, longest heat setting, the best I got was big waves.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I suggest any girls that need a high quality curling iron purchase this because somehow it always manages to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you can get one, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I will admit I was more than a little hesitant to use this product given the price about the quality, but I am on a tight budget and did not have many options.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The curls are also longer lasting than when I&#x27;ve used other irons - It is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> It is less time consuming to use a regular curling iron or curlers, but the results are not as near as good.  </li>
            <li> and I could work the product very easily, however you could only take very tiny pieces of hair and even on the highest setting and the longest time the curls were not very tight.</li>
            <li> the powerful little motor in there must have a brain because it knew right away and un-raveled my hair automatically!</li>
            <li> The curls hold up well in dance even when they&#x27;re 12 hours old already!!)</li>
            <li> I also love that this will turn off automatically instead of staying all day causing a safety hazard with little kids running around.</li>
            <li> If you just want the ends you can use a little bit more hair.</li>
            <li> Curling was easy anf quick, even with my thick</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t pull a piece too small or too large or it won&#x27;t suck up the hair correctly.  </li>
            <li> Small hanks of hair work much better than large or medium.  </li>
            <li> NOT FOR FINE HAIR, and the curl on this is actually very loose and does not hold more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li> It definitely has a learning curve, the key is to place smaller strands in the iron, and to make sure your hair is absolutely tangle free and to also make sure the device is horizontal as any vertical movement causes it to jam (which is not a pleasant feeling, trust me).  </li>
            <li> My hair is super flat</li>
            <li> This is the new age and new technology!</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast and seems to handle the multiple tasks very well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to a woman that&#x27;s on-the-go but still wants to look really professional and put-together.</li>
            <li> The product works great and the curl actually not only stays in all day, but the next day it just needs a little touch-up</li>
            <li> THIS BAD BOY IS AWESOME...</li>
            <li> Wow... this really works.</li>
            <li> It is pin straight naturally.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, my whole head of hair took about twelve minutes to get a soft wave.</li>
            <li> This professional curling iron has worked miracles on my normally straight hair.</li>
            <li> It makes her hair look absolutely amazing and it wasn&#x27;t expensive at all, especially with the 20% off :).</li>
            <li> is that it beeps loudly the whole time you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> The beep it makes when it finished curling your hair is great because I was tired of guessing when it was done, now I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning any of my hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter who absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> With normal curling irons,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Found only about one inch of hair could be curled at a time, pretty fast but didn&#x27;t hold a curl well for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I am so tired of my straight long hair, though others always tell me, it&#x27;s beautiful anyway.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t normally curl her hair with curling wands but just ties it up at night and lets it curl with the rubber band as it dries.</li>
            <li> It has quite a few features that I love.</li>
            <li> This works great on my daughters thick long hair.  </li>
            <li> so normally when she uses curling irons</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll re-curl a few spots if I need to look better in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curl does stay on the entire day and rarely looses it&#x27;s form.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I don’t have to sit there and count out how long I have to hold the curler in place and that I don’t have to physically wrap my hair around a curling iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The thing that wowed me the most was how long the curls last.</li>
            <li> It is rare to have such a determining role in how your curls will look, and for this product to offer that is just another reason why I prefer this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> She was able to watch a few YouTube videos to figure everything out</li>
            <li> The everyday use of the Miraqueen curling iron is effortless and safe.</li>
            <li> I lost a few strands and decided that while with practice I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d get over the learning curve, BUT I&#x27;m too nervous to try it again.  </li>
            <li> it almost seemed like it grabbed a few stray hairs that weren&#x27;t in the chamber, but I&#x27;m not even sure how that could happen.  </li>
            <li> and my stepdaughter can use it on her normal hair (410 degrees).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using curling irons for decades and the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is definitely one of my top ten favorites.</li>
            <li> I used to fuss with hot rollers and had to allow for so much extra time in the mornings to get ready.</li>
            <li> Isn’t’ it time to stop the curling iron burns while creating long lasting curls and waves that you can be confident about?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like a normal iron</li>
            <li> The alternating curl directs each curl in the opposite direction of the last curl which looks a lot more natural than the curls all going in one direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Curling Iron turns limp, lifeless hair into gorgeous curls within seconds, the machine beeping to tell you hold long to hold the hair in for.</li>
            <li> I wear minimal makeup and don&#x27;t like spending too long on my hair, but I DO like to look nice.</li>
            <li> My normal method of obtain these curls is a grueling process that require me sitting under a hooded drier for hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to keep trying with different product then, curling.</li>
            <li> And for the most part it&#x27;s been a waste, until now!&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me and have struggled finding curlers that work the way they advertise and actually work son hair that is at time resistant to curling, this is worth trying.  </li>
            <li> I wouLd normally spend about and hour curling my hair.  </li>
            <li> The everyday use of the Miraqueen curling iron is effortless and safe.</li>
            <li> It is more like a hybrid cross between a traditional curling iron and actual hot rollers, and in minutes it can replicate the look of a perm--without the stink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even max temperature (450F) and max time heating didn&#x27;t give me anything more than a limp wave.</li>
            <li> My wife bought it a few weeks ago and really love using</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a girly-girl, so I&#x27;ve never been able to justify the time, attention and frustration to use most curling irons with such terrible results, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try along with the best rated hair spray and curl prep gel I could find.</li>
            <li> I have never found a curling iron that I met and liked because my hair is thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li> The directions are fair, lots of misspellings and poor grammar.</li>
            <li> This thing gives your hair a desired look; depending on the level of the setting, you can have beautiful loose curls or really tight curls that LAST.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the price is a little higher than the wands you can find at Target and other stores, it&#x27;s a great investment and will be the only curler you need!</li>
            <li> It was not hard to use.  </li>
            <li> After watching some iffy commercials and reviews on YouTube, I spent some time on the Miraqueen website and I was pretty intrigued right off the bat.</li>
            <li> This iron works amazing on wet and dry hair with no worry of over drying or burning your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that this curling iron offers this feature because it is one less thing I have to worry about.</li>
            <li> The digital control features made this really easy to use and get the same result every time.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and although it does hold a curl pretty easily, my hair frizzes rather quickly.</li>
            <li> My hair is really straight and fine and was a little unsure of how this Miraqueen iron would work on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has the option to have your curls go left, right, or automatic which alternates between the 2.</li>
            <li> You can chose between right, left, or alternating.</li>
            <li> It even has a curl direction control where you can make left and right spiraling curls according to your preference.</li>
            <li> You can curl your hair to the left, right or auto (which alternates between the two).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about it, so just go for it!  </li>
            <li> I also wanted to mention that in the past I have had lots of heat damage because of frequent heat-styling but, because of the ceramic design my hair actually feels much softer after curling and it is very shiny, so amazing.</li>
            <li> It really gives you full control to achieve what can&#x27;t be achieved with other products.</li>
            <li> cause my hair is super long.</li>
            <li> This iron lets me change the direction of each curl - pretty cool - and the curls I get are tight curls.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to store and works a heck of a lot better than the other irons I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, I can sit it down anywhere without burning something, I can watch tv and do my hair.</li>
            <li> But with this handy new device, I can easily curl my hair in about half the time it usually takes!</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I&#x27;ll get in a hurry and try to put too much hair in it, but when I do, it always makes a strange sound, stops and releases my hair.  </li>
            <li> On the second day I can just brush out my hair and I have those soft pretty day curls!  </li>
            <li> Congratulations on buying something you&#x27;ll be excited about, will use twice, will give you super mild results, and then you will put away awkwardly because it&#x27;s huge and think about throwing out for a year before you finally give it to a friend who will do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> My wife has been needing a new curling iron for quite some time</li>
            <li> but it also made my course hair well curled and seems to hold a new bounce to it.</li>
            <li> Don’t let a new style or technology of curler intimidate you.</li>
            <li> Everyone thought I got a new haircut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But with any new product out, it’s a trial and error process.</li>
            <li> so I thought I would surprise her with a new one.  </li>
            <li> This is my new go to curling iron.</li>
            <li> she got her new curling iron and tried it out a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Well, it really is my new toy.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic at first like any other customer would be, but this Miraqueen Iron is purely amazing.</li>
            <li> I seriously didn&#x27;t I could make my own hair look like this without paying someone.</li>
            <li> Love this and would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants some curls with less effort.</li>
            <li> Then when I first came across this device, first it caught my eyes because of the design &amp; features and then the reviews just made me curious.</li>
            <li> :) I can look like I spent hours on my hair when I only spend a fraction of the time I used to!</li>
            <li> Watch some youtube videos (even if they are for the conair pro or babybliss) for more tips or tricksd you can then grab all of them at the root together and carefully run your thumb and forefinger along them to combine into one big fat curl</li>
            <li> I bet after a tiny bit more practice, I could do my whole head in less than 15 minutes, maybe 10...</li>
            <li> However, this mostly happens if you either try to stuff too much hair into the curler at once or if you fail to adequately detangle/separate the hair before curling it.  </li>
            <li> If you are willing to put in a bit of time learning to use it and play around with it a bit the product gives quick long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> I might get lucky and end up with one curl that looks good and the next one looks all weird and bendy?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Something else that is very useful is that there is an lcd screen that shows the timer and temperature (among other information).  </li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a new curling iron, I highly recommend the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li> and I brought her attention to something very important to me, unlike several other curlers that I have tried out</li>
            <li> You also have to get used to the different grip from curling the right side to left (because you have to hold it differently since the same side of the device always has to be the side touching your head)</li>
            <li> Not only does it do an amazing job of curling your hair the curls last a really long time!!  </li>
            <li> , I just couldn&#x27;t get the technique right, so I stuck with just flat ironing it for years.</li>
            <li> I WOULD DEFINITELY WATCH THE YOU TUBE VIDEO ON HOW TO USE THIS MACHINE PRIOR TO FIRST USE!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Miraqueen to anyone from a pageant queen to a natural beaut - get on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very busy person and it outlast my day.</li>
            <li> The easy release trigger makes the whole process extremely easy and the curls last up to four days; saving you time and giving you a “high maintenance” look for several days with little to no maintenance necessary with the Miraqueen Curling Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the website clearly says that an R, L or A will show for Right, Left or Alternating curls.</li>
            <li> This amazing curler has three dynamic settings for three different kinds of curls; I am more obsessed with the lowest one because it gives me a very loose curl that I do enjoy during summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very often that as a Dad I find something that they both really like, but a friend recommended it to me and they were totally right.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to in the beginning but after a few times you&#x27;ll get more comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to use on yourself but great for doing other people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It did not get hot enough to burn my hand or head - though I still might not put it completely up to my scalp on the high setting.  </li>
            <li> The heat and timer settings allow you to easily adjust how tight you want your curls</li>
            <li> She said it heats up quickly, is easy to use, and the curls last much longer than any other curling iron she has used before.  </li>
            <li> It is very fine, but has just enough of a wave pattern to stick out at odd angles.  </li>
            <li> It worked for about five seconds longer than the cheaper models and then ended up in exactly the same place…the trash.  </li>
            <li> definitely a nono when trying to wield a hot iron!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> beeping timer helps you to make each curl exactly the same each time as well as protects against burning your hair if you happen to lose track of time.</li>
            <li> After my first fiasco (totally my fault) I have had no problems and my curls stay for hours without any type of spray holding them!</li>
            <li> If you try to give it any more than the very small section, it will give the warning beeps that there is too much hair.</li>
            <li> When I used hairspray first, similar to the video review for this produce, I could hear a sizzling noise.</li>
            <li> The first week I had it I must have created 6 different hair styles.</li>
            <li> Grab this professional Miraqueen curling iron now!</li>
            <li> got home after work and all I can say is Wow!</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my husband and I&#x27;ve used it more in the short time I&#x27;ve had it than any other hair tool I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li> Love it and the curl usually lasts 2 days.</li>
            <li> In fact, heaven forbid I lose this baby, I&#x27;ll be buying the exact same one.</li>
            <li> I love that I can choose from 3 different curl settings, which I have never seen on any other curling iron before.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> There was this award night I attended recently that left me breathless because more than six ladies came back to my home to use my curler</li>
            <li> With the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, Curling Wand, Hair Curler with Ceramic Curling Chamber you’ll have the option of  leaving waves in your straight hair for an entire day or wearing it straight once again in under an hour.</li>
            <li> I was able to neatly curl my hair in no more than 10 min.  </li>
            <li> After years of using a curling iron, my hair is pretty damaged especially at the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall, I really think this iron is worth the money and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last week for my birthday</li>
            <li> With the Miraqueen it&#x27;s so simple, you just place a section of hair into the compartment and hold it there for the timer you selected, then it beeps letting you know that your curl is ready to be released!</li>
            <li> and then I do have to re-curl a strand of hair that did not curl the first time, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I spend too much time on my hair and yet my curls barely make it through the day.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, this is no ordinary curling iron off the walmart shelf.  </li>
            <li> It truly is a professional tool of the trade for anyone with hair!</li>
            <li> Well not no more with this iron, it features a &amp;#34;curl chamber&amp;#34; , which allows the hair to glide and heat more evenly, rather than pull and tug at her hair.</li>
            <li> I did get &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; by the end and leaned it against my head because it doesn&#x27;t get too hot on the outside to burn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its features include three different heat levels and four timer settings, so you can get exactly the curls you want.</li>
            <li> I got the pink one and it looks really cool.  </li>
            <li> But the great thing was that when it did get &amp;#34;caught&amp;#34;, I just unplugged the device and slowly pulled out the strands very carefully and had no issue with getting my hair untangled.  </li>
            <li> my hair was fizzled and felt dry whereas the Mira Queen felt lively and fresh.</li>
            <li> My hair smelt burnt  and the little curl that the iron did give, did not last for more than an hour before completely going straight.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is ready to use in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is ready for me to use in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair that has a very hard time holding curl.  </li>
            <li> The machine is so easy to use too and on average, I have timed the entire process at 14 minutes to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li> With the protective case, you can put it away right away instead of waiting for it to cool back down.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all; the old fashioned type, the trendy no clip tapered barrel irons, and those in crazy shapes and in many different sizes.</li>
            <li> I still love it and it has held up under near constant use (just about every other day).  </li>
            <li> I decided it&#x27;s time to chuck out the old curlers and get a new one.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t wait around for too long, guessing if it is the right temperature</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t wait around for too long, guessing if it is the right temperature</li>
            <li> (this is a very minor issue but thought it was worth noting!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or bulky either which is great for small hands.</li>
            <li> Just fabulous ringlets, and perhaps a bit of hair spray after she&#x27;s done to extend how long it will last for her.</li>
            <li> My hair got stuck a few times but it was easy to ease it out and did not get split or cut up.  </li>
            <li> Given that she was used to her old one, the first time she tried it out she couldn&#x27;t quite work it properly</li>
            <li> It would be great for long thin hair.  </li>
            <li> (I always mess up my right side with the old iron &amp;#62;&amp;#60; )</li>
            <li> I saw that it&#x27;s advertised as only taking 5 minutes, which is NOT true (unless you barely have any hair), but you&#x27;ll be satisfied if you have reasonable expectations.</li>
            <li> The use of the curl chamber and rubber protector keeps any hot surfaces away from her face and head and since there isn&#x27;t any hot metal exposed, we never have to worry about where we set it down.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what it does exactly that is different than a normal curling iron on my super straight hair</li>
            <li> So far I have seen it work well on fine, dry and coarse hair!  </li>
            <li> It is a professional product without the professional price!</li>
            <li> I have tried curling my hair with curling irons, flat irons, hot rollers and even heatless curls</li>
            <li> The curls that comes out are real slick and nice.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen is a smart curling iron--If you try to curl too much at once, the iron will beep at you to tell you it&#x27;s too much and to try again with less.</li>
            <li> her curls won&#x27;t last for more than half a day.</li>
            <li> because it has more of a perm effect and style, she is half British</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this unit for a few months and it heats up super fast.  </li>
            <li> I was super hesitant because it was more expensive than I prefer to spend on a curling device</li>
            <li> Once you get it down though, you will be able to do your whole head is five to ten minutes unlike spending 45 minutes with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> It has several different settings for all different types of hair, so you can easily find a settings (or settings)</li>
            <li> It will only take so much hair to curl and beeps when it is ready, making it so easy to use for someone with such little experience like myself.</li>
            <li> The iron beeps when your hair is curled or waved to your specific desire (loose, medium, or tight), so hair is never in for a dangerously long amount of time (good for people like me, who sometimes get distracted whilst putting hot things on their hair).&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> This is the one product that we&#x27;ve found so far that easily achieves those results, no other iron has worked even half as well.</li>
            <li> Not only that, my curls are very pronounced and can last up to three days, with just a quick 20 mins the following morning to freshen up my curls.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and I finish curling my hair in almost no time, which is excellent because I hate getting up earlier than necessary just to fuss with my hair.</li>
            <li> This is great for loose, natural waves, or hard curls and is made simple!</li>
            <li> If you want a few extra tight curls to mix in with softer curls or you want the Shirlet Temple look, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical as I&#x27;m not the best on doing my hair</li>
            <li> so while it takes awhile for me to straighten my hair, which is my typical style, I was excited to have found another way of styling it.</li>
            <li> I like spending a little more on a purchase knowing that I&#x27;m going to have this product for the long-term, and it&#x27;s going to last, and get the results</li>
            <li> is different than any other curler that I have used before, but I found it really easy to use</li>
            <li> I love how this has reduced the amount of hair products I have, aside from my straightener which I spent hundreds on and am not ready to let go yet</li>
            <li> As someone with thick, coarse, hair, it&#x27;s amazing to find products that work so well and which is so efficient.</li>
            <li> The LCD screen makes it clear what I am using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried over brands before, but the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is the only one that really has worked for me.  </li>
            <li> and my wife absolutely loves to use it (especially the automatic shut-off because she is the type to not always remember to turn the curler off).</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has used it a couple of times so far when going out on the weekend.</li>
            <li> My curls last a whole week</li>
            <li> and I was quite surprised myself as far as the build quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the closest I&#x27;ve ever gotten to professional curls.</li>
            <li> I appreciate having as much information as possible before making any purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> On this iron, they are really well-designed and placed properly.  </li>
            <li> She really likes the different heat settings.</li>
            <li> I saw, what the Miraqueen Professional Hair Curler with the Ceramic Curling Chamber can do at a friend&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> have not used my old, cumbersome curling iron since I got the Miraqueen Hair Curler.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a curling iron, I would suggest this one and avoid some old metal rod that will burn you up.</li>
            <li> But the description hooked me and I had to see it in action for myself.</li>
            <li> Much faster than with a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Age 12 and uses it frequently.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works on some hair types far better---as it seemed to for the video review.</li>
            <li> I really like that it has different settings so you can customize the intensity of the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter</li>
            <li> (that I&#x27;ve tried by far)</li>
            <li> The result is soft and classy without looking overdone.  </li>
            <li> I get compliments frequently.</li>
            <li> At the bottom it curls just enough to keep it from looking like curled hair over straight hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 13 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I have tried it out 4x so far</li>
            <li> I feel like if I use it daily my hair won&#x27;t be enduring so much damage compared to when I use my flatiron.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen curling iron gives my hair the volume it really needs to last all day.</li>
            <li> It curls up my entire head of hair fast</li>
            <li> So I decided to splurge after using my old school curler for ages.</li>
            <li> as opposed to how I always burned myself with my old curler.</li>
            <li> This was by far the fastest and painless curling iron I’ve used.</li>
            <li> Her curls seems to last a lot longer, I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that is not harsh on my non chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> It used to take me thirty minutes to curl my hair the old way.</li>
            <li> I bought the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron with bated breath.</li>
            <li> I cant curl my hair the old fashioned way this a life saver.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron does not look like any curling iron you have seen before because it is NOT like any curling iron you have seen before.</li>
            <li> How much easier can it get than simply selecting a time setting to determine</li>
            <li> As a city girl and college student it&#x27;s embarrassing how far I have gotten in life without learning how to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> and I ran out and bought the same iron in another size, because I have so much confidence in it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has been using this product for nearly a month</li>
            <li> Furthermore, there&#x27;s also the protection and assurity this product offers to yourself and your hair.</li>
            <li> directions were fairly straight forward as were the controls on the actual curling iron.</li>
            <li> She received it nearly a week ago and has used it twice since.</li>
            <li> , I can always count on the same curl pattern and it cuts about 10 minutes off of my time to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get it while this deal is available, then you&#x27;re just missing out.</li>
            <li> I was completely inefficient - without the gloves I was burning myself and it took forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loves it because she doesn´t have to wake up early to make her hair before work.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair, which I thought might have been the problem, but my sister used it after I did.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see with this</li>
            <li> I used to forget to do this with manual curling irons, so my curls wouldn&#x27;t turn out quite as natural.</li>
            <li> , I think I&#x27;ll stick with my old school curling iron.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 12 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nonetheless, I have a few important notes about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron has changed all that for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quicker to use a curling iron in my opinion, but this product makes the curl last much longer.  </li>
            <li> No problems so far with this one.</li>
            <li> how ruined her old one...</li>
            <li> This curling iron has FAR EXCEEDED my expectations.</li>
            <li> Now I can curl my entire head, fast and with ease and the curls come out uniform</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and it tends to do whatever the heck</li>
            <li> Unlike several curlers I have been using, it takes me so much time before I get used to them.</li>
            <li> Then it beeps to know that the 12 seconds is complete.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I bought the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron as a gift for my sister who just finished cosmetology school.  </li>
            <li> and I came across the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.  </li>
            <li> Get a professional look for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> This professional curling iron does the job it says and</li>
            <li> I received the Miraqueen Professional Curing Iron as a gift from my mom.</li>
            <li> That is a complete fabrication.  </li>
            <li> I think I have been a guinea pig for nearly every hair care product ever made.</li>
            <li> I use Wen for cleaning my hair - don&#x27;t really think that makes a difference overall, but it does hold the color in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believed they would be simple, fast and give me the look i wanted.</li>
            <li> Professional curling iron, ceramic technology, protects hair from damage.</li>
            <li> (i always toasted the ends with my old fashioned iron)</li>
            <li> , that is straight everywhere except for the waves in the back.</li>
            <li> She is in her early teens</li>
            <li> heard Miraqueen Professional curling iron from a friend, who squares by it.  </li>
            <li> The setting let you control how hot for your hair type and even how long to heat the hair.</li>
            <li> It will beep when its ready and the curls are so curly and stay all day into the next day.</li>
            <li> My curls stayed completely in for the 4 hours I had my hair done.</li>
            <li> Curling iron aesthetics haven’t changed much in the last million years or so</li>
            <li> AND IT IS PRETTY LONG</li>
            <li> This is a professional product and that&#x27;s what you get.</li>
            <li> A well made professional product.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I leave the bathroom in the middle of getting ready and forget to unplug my curling iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long</li>
            <li> Read some reviews - decided to go with the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron -</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice so far</li>
            <li> Use the auto rotate feature except for the 1-2 curls directly by your face which you curl outward.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I received the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron as a gift</li>
            <li> I had completely given up on curling irons-</li>
            <li> At a friend&#x27;s request, I tried the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li> Throw away your old curling iron.</li>
            <li> Professional Curling Iron is what i use to curl my hair after taking a shower..</li>
            <li> Ready to have a different style week after week?</li>
            <li> the curls look totally professional.</li>
            <li> My curls last much longer</li>
            <li> I must say I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> They go from curly, curly to soft waves, but they are still there .....</li>
            <li> I thought I could only wear straight hair styles</li>
            <li> I used to forget to do this with manual curling irons, so my curls wouldn&#x27;t turn out quite as natural.</li>
            <li> It is a safe, efficient alternative to several cheap curling irons that don&#x27;t work or expensive chemical perm treatments that can eventually ruin your hair.</li>
            <li> It has a guided set of beeps sounds so that you know exactly how long to leave it in your hair to get the desired look shape and tightness of the curl.</li>
            <li> I recommend this curling tool over standard curling wands, much easier.</li>
            <li> This is a product I would expect to see at a professional and chic salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks and works like a professional curling wand.</li>
            <li> The LED display is clear and concise with built in timer, temperature and heat notice when the iron reached 370º.</li>
            <li> its natural frizzy wavy to it</li>
            <li> got it for my 11 year old daughter-</li>
            <li> So, I cannot comment on what it is going to do to your hair if used frequently.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m sure it will last me quite a few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to go a couple days with only having to put a few curls in after sleeping on.</li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s just me), and I wouldn&#x27;t go to the trouble of doing this just for work, but this works so much better than traditional curling irons, and</li>
            <li> This curling iron is one of the few I have used where the curl actually stays in for more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and most curls fall out within the hour</li>
            <li> It has beeped to tell me that I have too much hair it in many times and hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> Needless to say she loved it and could not stop talking about it every time she called me.</li>
            <li> This curling curling iron was able to handle my thick hair with ease.</li>
            <li> It took a bit of practice and time to figure out how to get nice curls for me, but I have extremely thin and flyaway hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical to make purchases online because you never know what you&#x27;re going to get, but this was a really good buy</li>
            <li> This device is great if you want very small tight curls.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve to it, however I found that by the time I was done with my head (it took me about 20 minutes the first time I used it), I really had a method down that worked for me.  </li>
            <li> and it sucked in her hair like a vacuum and was ready to curl</li>
            <li> Also you can select left, right, or alternate, which is the direction your curls will fall.  </li>
            <li> Considering that it&#x27;s actually on sale right now, I&#x27;m actually thinking of getting my mother one of these for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Up until now, I’ve used a professional Marcel Iron, even on my own hair, but I’m seriously considering switching just to this!</li>
            <li> Yeah, I’m a guy writing this review, but I’m also a single father who loves his daughter very much.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it turns itself off using a timer, so no more leaving the house worrying if I did or not!</li>
            <li> Other irons I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t get hot enough to keep my curl, or get too hot</li>
            <li> Oh, and one more thing, in my research, I did see where possibly some of the other brands don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;alternating&amp;#34; option for the curl direction or maybe only curled in one direction.  </li>
            <li> but I would say it took 35-40 minutes the first time (mostly because of trial and error) and less than 30 min the second time - definitely comparable to a flat iron timing for me.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to change so no more frying part of your hair</li>
            <li> easy release (no more hair getting tangled and scorched as you</li>
            <li> So, after less than about 15mins I had a full set of curls.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair, that used to never curl and have always wanted loose wavy curls.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to get the back of my hair into it successfully because it&#x27;s so huge that very little would actually be in the machine.</li>
            <li> So much easier than trying to use a flat iron to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> I left early for work and  left it on the kitchen table boxed in with a pretty purple ribbon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At first i was really confused about it because i have used many similar product</li>
            <li> Many a professional have struggled to get my hair to hold a curl for more than half an hour, and every one has failed.</li>
            <li> I use the lower setting for loose curls and the higher settings for when I want a lot of volume.</li>
            <li> This will probably be the last curling iron you buy... until you wear it out and need a new one!</li>
            <li> The most my hair would curl was slightly at the ends &amp; even with product, it would only last about an hour.</li>
            <li> I am particularly fond of the LED display and the different temperature settings.</li>
            <li> and it hangs pretty limp if I don’t use a lot of product and make the effort to really style it.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is worth it just because it is motorized and pulls the hair into the chamber, rather than clumsily having to wrap it around a hot barrel yourself.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend,don&#x27;t get hot enough &amp; the basis is to big!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only a hot curling iron NEXT to your face</li>
            <li> I found it to be so simple and easy, that someone like me, who is a beginner and has never bothered with curling irons (because of my thick, straight hair) could work it.</li>
            <li> my hair does not curl that easily and C: I am just not very good at curling it.</li>
            <li> You are able to get loose and wavy curls, medium curls, or tight and springy curls.</li>
            <li> Since growing out my hair, I have been searching high and low for something that will allow a curl to stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li> However, I have only been burned after keeping the curler on high for an extended period of time (while my sister, mom, and I were taking turns using it), which gave the protective lining time to heat up.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t curl very much hair at once without it getting jammed up</li>
            <li> short, I highly recommend this to all you ladies out there.</li>
            <li> The heat settings go up fairly high and the highest setting is not needed unless you have really coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried every barrel size, I have tried high end, low end, every price point you could think of and to no avail!</li>
            <li> This is not like any other curling iron, this isn&#x27;t the old fashioned type, the trendy no clip tapered barrel irons, and those in crazy shapes and in many different sizes.</li>
            <li> It only took 20min (with a bit of goofing around) to complete it!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally have a product that worked so well, especially since curling you hair can take so long and this just took minutes!</li>
            <li> This will earn you major brownie points fellas!</li>
            <li> so far.outside of the curler becomes hot enough to cause discomfort, simply allow the curler to cool down a bit or simply don&#x27;t allow it to directly contact your head during curling (not</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time getting it to hold a curl using traditional curling irons or wands, but this made nice curls, which I brushed into &amp;</li>
            <li> I have long, medium thickness, layered, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (mostly straight) with thinner strands (but a LOT of them).</li>
            <li> The curling iron&#x27;s ceramic chamber really helps curl all of my extremely long strands of hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well, and it goes for waves unless I practically fry it by keeping it in the iron too long.</li>
            <li> I am not good at curling hair, this curling iron seems like the most fool proof curlers that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> It heats up ridiculously fast, is super easy to use, and makes it almost impossible to accidentally burn yourself.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has a fairly long straight hair, and she loves to curl her hair sometimes.</li>
            <li> have fairly long straight hair, but I like to wear it curly.  </li>
            <li> I think this would work very well with long hair?</li>
            <li> My hair is dead straight, I’ve always looked for that extra boost to achieve those sexy long curls, and I finally found the tool to do it!</li>
            <li> Soon it will SAVE you time, but for the first use or two, give yourself a few extra minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-Detangle first.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions first; I was careful.  </li>
            <li> sponge rollers, hot rollers, crimping irons, waving irons, flat irons, wands, deep wavers, etc.  </li>
            <li> My fine hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl super well, it usually looks limp after a while, but I curled my hair with this Miraqueen, and it lasted all day.</li>
            <li> First of all is pink</li>
            <li> and I normally use a traditional curling iron</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, I WAS NEVER ABLE TO USE MY FLAT IRON TO MAKE CURLS, I WOULD ALWAYS END UP BURNING MY FINGERS</li>
            <li> Last but not least, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This gives me gorgeous loose curls and isn&#x27;t damaging to my thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to the Miraqueen, it’s now easier than ever before to create loose, natural curls</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was excited when receiving the product and it definitely didnt let me down what so ever.</li>
            <li> recently purchased two different sets of hot hair curlers, two flat irons, and a new curling iron -</li>
            <li> Lots of options, including left, right, or alternating curls and several different temperatures.</li>
            <li> This seriously leaves my entire head with full, voluminous, bouncy curls!!  </li>
            <li> I have VERY fine and thin hair,</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair that doesn&#x27;t curl well, but with this the curls hold all day.</li>
            <li> The LED display is also super cool and leaves all of the second guessing behind.</li>
            <li> don´t make the curls last for a long time since she has a very straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Why go through all the bother, when this new device makes curling my hair so simple?</li>
            <li> Not only is my new Miraqueen</li>
            <li> When the outside of the curler becomes hot enough to cause discomfort, simply allow the curler to cool down a bit or simply don&#x27;t allow it to directly contact your head during curling (not</li>
            <li> I personally feel that the swivel cord makes maneuvering so much easier and the digital LCD screen conveniently helps me keep track of my settings.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight, limp, and does nothing despite how much I beg it.</li>
            <li> Curls last so long that they are still pretty day 2, even after sleeping on.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;ve tried bunch of different curler styles (straight wand, brush, clamp etc)</li>
            <li> I would recommend Mariqueen to anyone, all you need to do is read the instructions, after a few tries its easy to maneuver and you&#x27;ll be your own perfessional stylist, heaven knows I was style depraved until I found this secret weapon.</li>
            <li> I have such thick hair that I have never been able to curl my hair before.</li>
            <li> I’ll be honest, when I heard about the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, unprocessed, medium length hair (about 2-3 inches past my shoulders) that has never held a curl a day in my life until now.  </li>
            <li> If you are going for the more long loose curls look, start halfway down your hair instead of near the scalp.  </li>
            <li> The handle is also small hand friendly.</li>
            <li> First of all, it heats up faster than any other curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used, and the foam protection cover protects your hair while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> Is pretty heavy plus your curls are to skinny and don&#x27;t last as much</li>
            <li> more than once, because her hair is past the middle of her back.</li>
            <li> swivel cord might just be my favorite thing about it, which may sound silly, but trust me, it&#x27;s no fun having to untwist and untangle the cord because it wouldn&#x27;t move the way you wanted it to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This thing is a major miracle.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to imagine how hot those other irons</li>
            <li> I will never go back to using my old curling iron after this!</li>
            <li> I use a product for heat protection on my hair, but no other styling products.  </li>
            <li> Get it, you can&#x27;t go wrong and you&#x27;ll love the results!</li>
            <li> But I only gave it four stars because it is very easy to get your hair tangled in it and very hard to get it out when you do.  </li>
            <li> Love how I can create loose, medium or tight curls with the same curling iron.</li>
            <li> I am an mechanical engineer by trade and a technology enthusiast, so once I started researching curling irons (which was a little weird at first), I began looking for an Iron that had many features but also is dependable and we won&#x27;t be replacing it after a week like so many things we buy trying to save a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have fine, not colored, and very straight hair that is a little past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> It has never tugged my fine hair (I always got my fine hair stuck in normal irons :( )</li>
            <li> Using this was easy and it took the stress out, especially once I watched the videos and tried it a few different ways.</li>
            <li> However, I did not lose any hair and just had to practice at making sure I only used very small sections of hair.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not cheap like many of the other curling wands I used before.</li>
            <li> Super high heat for a long, long, long lasting curl.</li>
            <li> The curls were so pretty and natural not those tight wedding look curls</li>
            <li> I also have fine hair, so usually whatever curling iron I use to control my uncontrollable curls, it doesn&#x27;t set or last all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, highly recommended for women and also men with long hair.</li>
            <li> Whether you are a woman who needs a high quality iron or a man with long hair, or even to use for your children&#x27;s hair, this is the curling iron I would recommend.  </li>
            <li> The section of hair right below that came out tightly curled (curls the size of your thumb).  </li>
            <li> Despite how fine and not big my hair is, the rate at which this goes, it would take me more than an HOUR to go around the full head - leaving me with shocking looking wavy</li>
            <li> It heats very fast and never burn my fingers( as always was with other curling irons)!</li>
            <li> Generally, curling irons just don&#x27;t work on my hair</li>
            <li> The wand is a huge struggle and my hair is so thick that it takes forever.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for THE ultimate curling iron for my long, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Also, the fact that this iron uses ceramic shows that it will protect my hair in the long run because it is not being constantly burned by stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save the trip to the salon for later and invest in the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li> I was actually a bit surprised when we out to dinner</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is a must have product if you’re one of those girls who loves adding some playful curls to your daily hairstyle.</li>
            <li> the girls are only 3 and 4 years old.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s the only curler that worked for me and my daughters.</li>
            <li> And it is so simply it really requires no real effort or concentration.</li>
            <li> and I got to see it in action on several occasions.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets..</li>
            <li> Money very well spent.</li>
            <li> The curls are natural looking and stay until the next wash.  </li>
            <li> well-designed curling iron can take the place of those old fashioned curling irons and newer curling wands that constantly lead to burnt fingers.</li>
            <li> So far, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I really like the pink colour.</li>
            <li> Which completely defeats the purpose for me since I was hoping for something to work faster than a traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Only happened once so far.  </li>
            <li> I am embarrassed to admit how much money I have spent on styling tools.  </li>
            <li> I had been busy with final exams and then Christmas break</li>
            <li> She had an old one that finally gave out on her.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend got scorched constantly while using her old curling iron.</li>
            <li> So yeah – I’d definitely recommend the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron for that reason alone.</li>
            <li> And how the heat stays on the inside of the iron and not on the outside where my busy fingers are.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long, its middle of my back length</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve used it once &amp; it took me roughly 30-35 minutes to curl my entire head the first time using it.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and my problem is i could never find a curling iron that would hold my curls for more than 15 mins.</li>
            <li> I sadly don&#x27;t truly have my own curler</li>
            <li> I have been curling my hair for most of my life and my arms would always get so tired from holding the hair and curling iron in position for varying time length.</li>
            <li> I love that my arms don’t get tired anymore while doing my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to being unable to do my own hair in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, pretty straight, not course at all, but it&#x27;s still really thick, so I knew it would take me longer.  </li>
            <li> However, my hair is as straight as uncooked spaghetti, and I needed something that would give me a little more help than the typical iron you buy at the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curling iron makes a sound when your hair is curled and you have the option between loose, medium and tight.</li>
            <li> Hot rollers, steam rollers, plain old ceramic irons....</li>
            <li> I think she&#x27;s taking far less time getting ready to go out</li>
            <li> This specific curling iron really does the trick and never leaves my hair dry or burnt ever.</li>
            <li> It curled my shorter hair just fine but tangled up my long extensions and pretty much ripped a whole chunk of hair out :(</li>
            <li> This curler gets hot enough to make loose curls that last for the duration of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, I have such fine hair that I usually use a fairly low temperature.</li>
            <li> I thought the shape was odd at first, but once I read the reviews and looked up the &#x27;how-to&#x27; instructions for it, I figured I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The curls last all day, and I am not going back to my old curling irons ever!</li>
            <li> There are 3different settings that I like which most other automatic curlers don&#x27;t (usually just has 2).</li>
            <li> I love that it isn’t expensive and it is such a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I chose it because she is very young and has difficulty sitting still for long periods of time to have her hair done before each pageant.  </li>
            <li> and yes, there were a few curls that were more limp than preferred but the overall look of my hair was large, loose, curls that looked effortless.</li>
            <li> The curls are also a lot more tight and last longer than my previous irons.</li>
            <li> Since she has a back injury regular curling irons take too long, causing too much pain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write the reviews, but read them, and in this case I think it is not fare to do not say anything , so after burning myself few times with traditional curling iron I decided to purchase this one because I liked the reviews and</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through too many curling irons in the past year, they all HATE my hair and NEVER do a good job...</li>
            <li> I am half African American, so as you can imagine, I have pretty thick hair that gets frizzy and tangled easily.</li>
            <li> No, they&#x27;re not as tight as when I first use it, but that&#x27;s also because I run my fingers through them to soften them up.  </li>
            <li> The automatic power off feature is extremely important because I have forgotten about my hair tools being on and left them sitting there for at least an hour before I noticed them.</li>
            <li> Normally it takes a ton of product and a long time to get curls that last maybe 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It worked only once but completely died on second time.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron actually gives me curls that last all day!</li>
            <li> The only thing you have to be careful of is not trying to put too much hair in there.</li>
            <li> The curls last by far longer then the curls i get with a traditional iron</li>
            <li> For someone like me with a laid back style, this was THE extra accessory I needed to complete my look.</li>
            <li> I am an African American with naturally kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I have to say that looking at a product is far different then actually using</li>
            <li> When I finally found this product, I was thrilled but skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Two failed irons later, I had given up hope of effectively curling my hair for my gatherings/events.</li>
            <li> Was it worth it for a few digital controls?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous curling irons that have repetitively fallen short of my expectations, however, my opinion was swayed when I purchased this unique iron.</li>
            <li> She was a little apprehensive about all the features and controls at first, but got the hang of it in no time.</li>
            <li> first it seemed  little bulky</li>
            <li> Because of a mild disability, I find it nearly impossible (and quite dangerous/time consuming) to curl my own hair with a conventional curling iron.  </li>
            <li> the end of the barrel where the plastic attaches never gets hot and it is big enough to hold stable so you can control the end and curl long long pieces.</li>
            <li> Depending on your hair type and thickness, you won&#x27;t need anything else but a hair dryer and perhaps a flat iron to smooth your hair down first if it&#x27;s really thick or coarse.  </li>
            <li> on.u won&#x27;t need anything else but a hair dryer and perhaps a flat iron to smooth your hair down first if it&#x27;s really thick or coarse.  </li>
            <li> On the first try, I managed to do my entire head within an hour and half</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found straighteners and curlers not very easy on the hands, but this is the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found straighteners and curlers not very easy on the hands, but this is the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical at first, and was hesitant in buying.</li>
            <li> Admittedly it&#x27;s a little intimidating at first if you&#x27;ve only ever used a standard iron like me, but it only took me one or two uses to adjust to the Professional level.</li>
            <li> My hair does have a little bit of natural curl, but it&#x27;s not the &#x27;pretty&#x27; natural curl, and more of the crazy, unattractive curl.</li>
            <li> swivel cord gives it a nice easy and free rotating base so you don&#x27;t have to hassle with a cord getting twisted or interrupting what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> It heats up quick And has a long heavy duty cord that you won&#x27;t get with most other brands, at least the ones I&#x27;ve seem.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that is hard to curl and keep curled!</li>
            <li> but I feel bad for my husband early mornings when I&#x27;m getting ready and all he can hear is my beeping :)</li>
            <li> With other curling irons I have tried I had to leave the iron there for a minute until my hair actually stayed curled and ended up smelling really</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because your hair can get caught if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> With my old curling iron, I was always worried if I was keeping it on too long and burning my hair.</li>
            <li> I actually finally set it to the hottest temperature, had product in my hair to hold the curl, set the timer for 12 seconds and it barely curled by hair.  </li>
            <li> She naturally has long and wavy hair, and wouldn&#x27;t stop talking about having curly hair.</li>
            <li> I always been struck by my long hair problems until I purchased this Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li> my hair would only hold it&#x27;s natural, bad-looking curls, so I usually just straightened it (which is pretty damaging).</li>
            <li> it is pretty heavy</li>
            <li> I curled a few sections of my hair and was amazed that the iron seemed to know if I had placed too much hair to be curled!</li>
            <li> I rarely curl my hair, because I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair with fine texture.  </li>
            <li> The Miraqueen cut her time down dramatically for getting ready each day, but doesn’t trade off quality.</li>
            <li> I taught that their hair was gonna break loose and fall after some hours because I did not have so much experience working on peoples hair until we were all amazed how long their hair lasted before they left my place.    </li>
            <li> The price is competitive with other high end ceramic curling irons and wands.</li>
            <li> Dry naturally or with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> If you have slightly too much hair in a section, it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Now, I can get ready in half the time.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it takes a lot less time to get ready every</li>
            <li> The curls are long lasting and done perfectly, as if a professional was doing it themselves.</li>
            <li> This product not only saved my social life, but also the way I see myself.</li>
            <li> As someone with persistently straight hair that won&#x27;t even hold a perm for more than a couple of weeks, I was very skeptical when my sister wanted to try this curling iron on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The automatic count down is idiot proof making a flawless curl.</li>
            <li> Other  curling irons I had used in the past just fried my hair which is baby fine.</li>
            <li> little skeptical at first only because I&#x27;ve tried so many which have never worked for</li>
            <li> This curling iron out performs other brands because it is not only cost-effective but also ensures high quality.  </li>
            <li> I would try holding the curler in place way after the curling action stopped to see if a curl would form because the heating element would still be working, but the curl would just come out loose, frizzy and somewhat kinky.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my fifteen year old daughter who has long, straight, thin hair, and wants curls, waves and body.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of being frustrated with curlers, this will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of being frustrated with curlers, this will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron for my wife who had really long thick hair and let me tell you, she was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the iron was going to be too strong because my hair is very very fragile (thin, blonde), but the technology just protects the hair so well.</li>
            <li> For her it comes all down to time-saving, ease of use and having it done effectively without the head-ache that usually follows use of a typical curling</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife a few days ago as she had mentioned wanting a new one and let me tell you, the reviews checked out, she LOVES IT!5 stars!!</li>
            <li> go&amp;#34; hair and haven&#x27;t messed with it - still can&#x27;t master a round brush and blow dryer except for on my bangs, and I wasn&#x27;t introduced to a flat iron until college when I decided to go short for the first time in my life....</li>
            <li> and I was able to curl my entire head of thick, mid back length hair in less than 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I usually have to do very tight curls to get them to last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> Automatic curling, super easy to use, and no more tired hands and arms because it does all the work for you!</li>
            <li> It has this little beep settings that will give you a proper idea about its preheating and will even give you an idea of the time you should hold down the curler to get the special type of curl you want.</li>
            <li> it was less expensive than the Conair Pro and had more features - mainly the curl direction</li>
            <li> She has used a straight on/off curling iron for the past 20 years and I can barely tell that she had curled her hair after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite beach wave that I prefer for casual and formal events.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person it was purchased for just loves it - easy to use even on very thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is hard to curl a lot of the time, and when I do manage to curl it, the curl either doesn&#x27;t look right or</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to use, and the little display shows you exactly what temperature it&#x27;s at - and even how tight your curl will be!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t that expensive either, I mean I&#x27;ve never had to buy a curling iron before (LOL)</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write product reviews, but as someone who has hair that is impossible to curl on my own, I have searched for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; styling tool and spent a lot of money doing it.  </li>
            <li> Since I haven’t been curling my hair my entire adult life, I was a bit afraid that it would be hard to use or something, but it’s super easy to use.</li>
            <li> My hair is a frizzy mess most days, and any heat makes it look dry, dull, and most unfortunately, DAMAGED.  </li>
            <li> My hair is too thick, not worth money, shuts off easily...</li>
            <li> ;) I&#x27;m not very good with technology to begin with, but figuring this out turned out to be simple.</li>
            <li> This thing has so little information that it took us a while to figure out that all you had to do was hold the thing wide ways to your head with just the right sized strands of hair laying flat across and it would do the rest.</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse hair that has a loose, but non-uniform natural wave to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made my decision partly due to other positive reviews here</li>
            <li> It is manufactured using ceramic technology that is essential in protecting my hair from damage due to frequent using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had long hair (to the middle of my back) and short hair (above my chin).</li>
            <li> In our family we have long hair, short hair, thick and thin - and this curling iron/wand is really, really good.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars only because it uses small sections of hair and if I try to use a strand of hair that is too large</li>
            <li> I have VERY straight hair and am always looking for an iron that actually holds the curl at least through the time I finish curling it.  </li>
            <li> I have hard to curl, very straight hair.</li>
            <li> have also had a problem in the past with irons that heated some parts of my hair too much and others not enough.  </li>
            <li> Add having long hair to the mix, and a normal curling iron can only reach half of the length of my hair, which makes each section need to be done twice.</li>
            <li> It allows you to choose different types of curls, but its efficient heating system means the curls will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The incessant loud beeping made my dog run outside and sit in the rain, and that cannot be turned off or down in volume.  </li>
            <li> I am hopeless when it comes to styling hair, and have tried to curl my hair before but it took so long only for it fall flat an hour later.</li>
            <li> Miraqueen curler is an odd looking device, especially if you&#x27;re not entirely sure how it works, but once you read the instructions you get the hang of it really quickly.</li>
            <li> (at salons it can take up to an hour and a half and when I ATTEMPT to do it myself, anywhere from 2-3 hours), but the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron works wonders on my hair!</li>
            <li> and I was hesitant to use it at first as my hair is usually hard to work with</li>
            <li> The ceramic technology allows you to use higher temperatures like 300 or 450 for hard to curl hair without the fear of damages.</li>
            <li> It looks complicated, but is easy enough to understand.</li>
            <li> I like it just that the curls are small and  it dosent take much hair in</li>
            <li> But this past year I had a bunch weddings and events lined up, and I really wanted to give curling my hair another try.</li>
            <li> The iron seems REALLY well made, I have had ones in the past that felt like they were going to fall apart</li>
            <li> Sucks up the exact amount of hair you want</li>
            <li> As someone with perfectly straight hair, I&#x27;ve spent SO many hours being frustrated in the morning, trying to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> And the curls last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is time consuming and the curls doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I had to drag myself in after barely brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> I have notoriously FLAT hair.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the apparent bulkiness of it compared to my usual, traditional curling iron, but I had no trouble using it.  </li>
            <li> This will last a long time.</li>
            <li> so that is the case with almost any curling iron or flat iron</li>
            <li> Younger one did not want to sit that long.</li>
            <li> (i.e. my hair doesn&#x27;t just fall flat in two hours)&lt;br</li>
            <li> had resolved myself to flat hair when a friend of mine insisted on using the MiraQueen on me.</li>
            <li> It has 3 heat levels and at up to 450 it packs enough heat for curls that lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention it went flat by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Curling my hair can be such a long process.  </li>
            <li> Using a regular curling iron or rollers from the drug store just takes too dang long for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope it last a long time and in the long run won&#x27;t seem like much especially if I add up all the cheaper devices I&#x27;ve purchase that don&#x27;t work at all for me.  </li>
            <li> some broken, most frizzy and damaged but at least not cut off near my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is always flat as a pancake</li>
            <li> my hair stays curled, before my hair would fall flat within an hour, even with hair spray.</li>
            <li> She had trouble curling her hair with just normal curlers (burning herself)</li>
            <li> break it down here is what I think sets the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron apart from others:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have nice tight curls on one side of my head and by the other side I&#x27;ve gotten tired and don&#x27;t hold them as long.</li>
            <li> My wife had tried several other brands of curling irons, some of them more expensive than this one, and there was always something she didn&#x27;t like about them.  </li>
            <li> After carefully reading reviews on different stylers, I chose the MiraQueen professional because of other glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> Another added benefit of it is the curls don&#x27;t go flat, they stay all day!</li>
            <li> does not work on short hair and might take a while on very long hair</li>
            <li> However, this curling iron has given me something to look forward to when going out with my because, honestly, my hair has always been a reason why I would have such bad self-esteem.</li>
            <li> I have some crazy wavy hair and have tried so many different products...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s 3 heat levels and 4 timer settings so she can have a different style of curl whenever she wants to, And The automatic power shutoff switch is a life saver for when she&#x27;s running late for work and forgets to unplug it from the outlet.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I almost felt guilty that it was so easy...</li>
            <li> /&gt;She loves the curls and its functioning capabilities,which has help her to spend far less time curling and styling.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t tug my hair, like standard curling irons, it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, like smaller ones, it doesn&#x27;t burn me or get stuck, like the brush curling iron, and it doesn&#x27;t take forever, and require that your hair be wet, like overnight curlers.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and was terrified to use this for the first time.</li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s safe to use, even when you&#x27;re dead tired or in a hurry and nor 100% paying attention to how you&#x27;re holding it or</li>
            <li> Even for women with thin hair, there&#x27;s little risk of burning your hair because you can select the right temperature for your particular hair type.     </li>
            <li> I left it in a little too long the first time and my curls were a little tighter than I wanted them so</li>
            <li> First of all, my hair is stick straight and very thick and heavy</li>
            <li> It also has nice safety features like a timer and auto shut off for those of you guilty of having left curling irons on in the past.  </li>
            <li> I was using the 8 second time setting which should have resulted in a loose curl.  </li>
            <li> I have super long thin hair</li>
            <li> The next day I went boating and pinned back just my front hair and left the rest down.</li>
            <li> This iron has temperature setting that allow you to have a tight or soft curl depending on the look you are going after.</li>
            <li> At first I was not sure if I could figure out all the choices it offers, but with a few tries I became an expert hair stylist.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well with my thin hair, and tried it on my hubby for fun, and works on his thick long hair too.</li>
            <li> Heats up in no time at all (seriously: I plug it in when I begin to brush my teeth and by the time I&#x27;m done with that, I am ready to use it to do my hair!)  </li>
            <li> Seriously, if you have a hard time curling your hair, take it from someone who has never been able to curl their hair in 23 years.</li>
            <li> Its funny when I think about in times past with other curling irons how I got my cord wrapped around me or</li>
            <li> I have been using it every other day since then and feel I have enough experience with it now to finally post my review</li>
            <li> Since I wash my hair every other day, I can say that the curls last until my next wash</li>
            <li> It takes me less than twenty minutes to curl my entire wig and the curls last long in my southern seventy degree humid weather.</li>
            <li> I never knew how far a little curler could go.</li>
            <li> Now that I have &amp;#34;Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron&amp;#34; I can with little to no stress.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and my hair is usually dyed, and this curling iron is better for my hair type than any other curling iron I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Curls like an iron worth twice as much, I mean, it even has a timer!</li>
            <li> I am very upset, I bought this and hardly used it</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first, but looked at a few videos on Youtube and thought i would give it a try....</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first, but looked at a few videos on Youtube and thought i would give it a try....</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it first because I have short, thin, and fine layer hair from about 3 inches to 5 inches.  </li>
            <li> Not only do my curls stay all day with this, but it&#x27;s still curly the next day and only needs a little touch up.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight hair and have a hard time setting and keeping curls.</li>
            <li> I was one of those too who steered clear of curling irons due to the various odd burns that I managed to give myself.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li> This curling iron hurt my head, possibly damaged my hair a bit, pulled out many strands of hair, could have left me with the decision to either break the device or cut my hair, and the resulting curls were disastrous looking.  </li>
            <li> For example, it&#x27;s much harder to curl the hair in back, because of the weight.  </li>
            <li> pending how long your hair is).</li>
            <li> I have long hair and was nervous about using this but went ahead and tried it out.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to get irritated about my hands hurting from holding a curling iron so long.</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the directions you will not end up with any problem.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews showed issues with hair getting tangled in the device; but I found it only to be a problem when I tried to use a swatch of hair that was too wide.  </li>
            <li> If you watch videos on YouTube you can not only see how it works but see how it reacts when jammed.</li>
            <li> I have long, layered hair.  </li>
            <li> Once you get used to it (it doesn&#x27;t take that long)</li>
            <li> At the bottom the hair is maybe 3 inches long.</li>
            <li> but it does not take long to figure out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since anyone has complimented my hair.  </li>
            <li> this is the one I&#x27;m looking for so long</li>
            <li> The curls just don&#x27;t stay as long as when I use a wand that I wrap the hair myself.</li>
            <li> There’s a rubberized layer that protects your skin from the heating element, and when used properly (you must read the directions carefully)</li>
            <li> I been doing this for years and it seems to get harder every time as I feel I  am running short of options.</li>
            <li> Not gonna lie, I totally expected to repackage this and send it back after the trial run.</li>
            <li> Why did it take SO long to find this?</li>
            <li> I have long, layered hair</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with curling irons is trying to remember how long I&#x27;ve had the hair rolled up.</li>
            <li> Long story.  </li>
            <li> My daughters all have long hair and it would not take all their hair into the curling mechanism.  </li>
            <li> I will never use it on her long hair again.</li>
            <li> They either took too long or damaged her hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it to use on children&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> I brought mine on vacation and did my sister&#x27;s long  hair</li>
            <li> it never EVER managed to keep curls as long as I could with this product.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully this thing lasts a long time - I&#x27;ll update again as time goes</li>
            <li> Hopefully this thing lasts a long time - I&#x27;ll update again as time goes on.</li>
            <li> The curls stay for a long time which is something else I&#x27;ve never had luck with.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> Excuse me while I go curl my hair...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strongly recommended to all the long hair ladies out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simply put, I have strange hair.  </li>
            <li> for long hair:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fairly long hair</li>
            <li> Curling irons have come a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and it works well.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter has tried a few curling products.</li>
            <li> (I have fairly long hair)</li>
            <li> I was worried that this item would not  curl my long hair</li>
            <li> No more having to hold the iron at weird angles to keep the cord from touching the hot barrel, no more getting tangled in the cord yourself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trashing mine because I waited too long to try it after it arrived.</li>
            <li> There is also a shutoff feature which prevents damage to your hair if you forget how long you’ve had the curling iron on.</li>
            <li> The curling iron is not heavy but it is heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> the directions are not clear about putting the hair into the machine.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, kinda terrifying to use the first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really frustrating because my hair never curls the same way consistently.</li>
            <li> I have long straight thick hair and it curls it well, though some curls have to be redone by the time I am done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a hairdresser, I can never get the curls to stay in my hair long enough.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and this one makes the maintenance so much easier and quicker.</li>
            <li> My hair is normal to thick, and reaches my lower back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s possible to burn yourself (short of intentionally sticking your finger down inside the heating chamber)</li>
            <li> I have been through numerous curling irons in my days and recently my CHI air broke down.</li>
            <li> It does get a little heavy if you have a lot of hair...but no worse than those 2&amp;#34; ceramic flat irons used to be or a hairdryer.</li>
            <li> More importantly it is far less likely that you will have that ugly iron burn on your forehead when you are finished.</li>
            <li> Although as previously stated, I have only used it twice; I have no idea as to the longevity of this product (although I hope it will last for a long time).</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing this product since it&#x27;s clear that more than half of the reviews are manufactured.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I haven&#x27;t burned myself since I&#x27;ve been using it (and it is most likely impossible to anyway)</li>
            <li> I mean, they practically lasted the whole night without falling apart.</li>
            <li> I had a different brand last year and whenever I used it my hair seemed to fall flat after a few hours</li>
            <li> I decided to try it out the next weekend when I actually had time to mess with curling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want thicker bigger curls - use the same direction for a few sequential curls and you can then grab all of them at the root together and carefully run your thumb and forefinger along them to combine into one big fat curl</li>
            <li> However, the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; was more of a discomfort and nowhere near as painful as a conventional curling iron burn.  </li>
            <li> She has multiple other curling irons</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the fact that I never have to worry about forgetting to turn it off when I&#x27;m done, due to the automatic shut-off feature, and the durability of this curling iron is nothing short of awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No more manual wrapping of the hair around old school curling irons!</li>
            <li> Even for my daughter whose hair normally goes limp after a few hours had curls last 3 plus days.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give off that burning hair smell, it gives me the bounciest curls and they last way longer than with other irons.</li>
            <li> I have always envied other girls because I felt like one of the only girls my age who couldn&#x27;t get her hair to curl.</li>
            <li> With the digital controls and the ability to adjust the heat settings this curling iron works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Like many, I was a little skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The curls stay in for soooo long!</li>
            <li> It gets a little heavy/awkward too, especially in the back.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this device to other as I did to my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> You can control the temperature, which way you want to curls to face, and how long you want to curl each section of hair!</li>
            <li> The technology involved with this curler is beyond what I’ve seen in other curlers, especially the safety features.</li>
            <li> It helps me keep my curl ALL day long!</li>
            <li> If only other irons had that.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to other who like to fix their hair.</li>
            <li> I was a bit leery about using a rotating curler due to back flashes of tangled hair as a child; but there was no reason to panic.</li>
            <li> My long hair is extremely difficult to manage and it is rare for any hair product to actually curl it.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair and it is super hard to get my hair to curl,</li>
            <li> that states &amp;#34;keep this side towards hair&amp;#34;  that is very important, if you start pulling at a angle your hair will jam in the motor section and be very very difficult to get out.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dry</li>
            <li> After experimenting with it, I found spraying dry hair with a thermal heat spray helps a lot.</li>
            <li> If I allow my hair to air dry that takes days</li>
            <li> Seriously I dont know much about curling irons</li>
            <li> She has ripped through curling irons from several big box stores, and basically thrown them each in the trash after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> The Curls last for hours and stay put even when you are active.</li>
            <li> Withing a few hours it inevitably goes back to blah.</li>
            <li> I actually have  a few clients who Bought the Miraqueen for their personal use.</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to get used to how it &amp;#34;sucks&amp;#34; the hair into it, since it is different from traditional ones.</li>
            <li> It takes me a whole 10 minutes to curl my entire head (although i do have thin hair).</li>
            <li> Now I can do other styles myself or give my tail some extra bounce by adding a couple loose waves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have hair that can be categorized in the following keywords: Asian, Korean, long, thick, slighty wavy, on its way to being coarse, couldn&#x27;t hold a curl to save my life.  </li>
            <li> It makes me feel like I&#x27;ve just stepped out of the salon chair, every single time.</li>
            <li> My one friend has every single hair curling, straightening, waving product out there.</li>
            <li> Unlike a single barrel curling iron, you can pick the size of the curl.  </li>
            <li> i get compliments on my hair every single time i&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> What you see on this page in their sales ad is just a photo copy of the only paperwork they give you with this sucker, and the only information to be had on their website - a wimpy one sided tri-fold out pamphlet that nowhere actually tells you HOW to use it, simply what the features are, and a few pointers that somehow also do not actually inform you of its quirks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t french braid, and unless it&#x27;s a messy bun, straightening with a flat iron, or throwing some curl creme into my hair - it&#x27;s not happening.</li>
            <li> I had seen other similar products where the curling area was closed in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally not into gadgets</li>
            <li> It sucked in my daughter&#x27;s long hair as expected and then wouldn&#x27;t let go after heating/beeping.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, normal hair.  </li>
            <li> Gotta keep up with the times, hot rollers, bendy foam curlers, and ol&#x27; curling irons are outdated.</li>
            <li> When you start halfway down the hair you can also get away with a larger section than by the scalp because it&#x27;s already smoothed into a single &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; instead of the &amp;#34;cone&amp;#34; of hair at the root when you gather it.</li>
            <li> They were tight which made them long lasting but the curls were also bouncy which I like.</li>
            <li> A little hard to use at first</li>
            <li> and my daughter prefers loose curls.</li>
            <li> and she said she always wanted loose wavy curls.</li>
            <li> may-care loose curls</li>
            <li> Likewise, the three timer setting makes it easier to obtain the curls that I want like medium, loose or tight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical that there was any curling iron that could tame my thin, stick straight hair that not only will not curl and will not hold a curl but goes limp at the first hint of any moisture.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair (about 2-3 inches past shoulders ), and it is both thin and fine.</li>
            <li> only wish is that you had an option to turn the volume up or down on the beeping.</li>
            <li> No one likes to have to run back home to check their iron so it can&#x27;t burn the house down, the heat protectors and automatic shut off are home savers for air-brained people like myself.</li>
            <li> I have long hair down to the middle of my back, sometimes even a little longer than that.</li>
            <li> This iron somehow manages to coax my hair into doing the impossible and the results are stunning.    </li>
            <li> Ever feel like your arms are screaming at you after only doing half of your hair?</li>
            <li> I have had the hair get stuck about 3 times but that is because I rushed and didn&#x27;t put a small enough piece in or didn&#x27;t lay it in properly.  </li>
            <li> Since I have long, thick hair, I’ve always struggled to find a curling iron that can both give my hair a natural looking curl and also keep that look throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I had less than 1&amp;#34; and I wouldn&#x27;t have wanted pieces curled smaller than that)  </li>
            <li> I can do all my hair in less than ten minutes.</li>
            <li> It looked just too weird for me at first, but after looking at several YouTube videos, I decided I would turn my efforts toward giving it a chance.  </li>
            <li> The Hair Curler has a Ceramic Curling Chamber which feels like it is less likely to burn the hair..</li>
            <li> Not good for shorter hair as advertised because the barrel is too big for the hair to completely wrap around it.</li>
            <li> Despite being so lazy about beauty regimes, I can definitely see myself using this regularly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive brands and the Miraqueen blows all the others out of the water!</li>
            <li> my entire hair in less than 5 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical about this product and others like it.</li>
            <li> you can set it to three different setting from 8, 10, or 12 seconds, depending how tight or loose you want your hair curls.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so I worry a lot about hair being broken by poorly made curling irons.</li>
            <li> product is extremely easy to use, which is a definite plus since I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with curling my hair other than my past failed attempts, I&#x27;d just given up on it after awhile.</li>
            <li> Nice features over the Conair and less bad reviews about hair getting stuck</li>
            <li> I used it hours earlier &amp; my curls still look tight &amp; bouncy.</li>
            <li> You can only in put a little bit of hair at a time.</li>
            <li> recently learned that the newest type of curling iron is one that will automatically curl my hair with little effort.</li>
            <li> recently learned that the newest type of curling iron is one that will automatically curl my hair with little effort.</li>
            <li> IF ITS EVEN POSSIBLE DUE TO YOUR HAIR TYPE!!</li>
            <li> Especially for the price, which is just stupid, better off paying for a CHI Ceramic curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I can style it and wear it for at least a week in various styles with the same curls.  </li>
            <li> She complained a lot about burning herself with the last curling iron she had, she couldn&#x27;t thank me enough when seen there was no way of burning herself at all.</li>
            <li> She complained about her old one</li>
            <li> I had no clue what I was looking for, I just read reviews and remembered what she complained about in reference to her old one.  </li>
            <li> this!The Miraqueen Professional Curling has been a time saver to say the least.</li>
            <li> I was totally skeptical about it actually working , but it really does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard absolutely no complaints</li>
            <li> For my  hair, when I curled it with the Miraqueen Curling Iron, the curls last me a few days.</li>
            <li> and I have to be careful with what I use on it</li>
            <li> Those pesky ends are constantly slipping out.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> It took me over an hour to curl my hair so not a fast process at all</li>
            <li> have very short hair, cut jut below my chin, with heavy layering.</li>
            <li> What helps me is to put in some Crew Fiber (men&#x27;s product) in when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> She finally let me borrow it a few days ago</li>
            <li> I still prefer the curl-former type curlers that you use with wet hair.</li>
            <li> after I get through curling, I use a hair pick to fluff it all up</li>
            <li> and I had absolutely no problems with any caught hairs or releasing.</li>
            <li> This curling wand/iron is a godsend for us girls with straight thin hair.</li>
            <li> I used to get impatient halfway through and leave the back of my hair uncurled, but now I can zip all the way around!</li>
            <li> well spent.</li>
            <li> This curling wand gives me the messy, sultry curls that I crave, but could never get with a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no curl at all.</li>
            <li> As a hairdresser, I spent a lot of time researching these types of curling irons, because you know, I like having hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thin flyaway hair like me I recommend combing it straight over and over and getting rid of any waves and tangles before using to minimize problems and challenges using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was simple to use, there were a few times where I could tell my hair was about to get caught in the chamber &amp; I</li>
            <li> after a few uses, I finally got the hang of this</li>
            <li> the package is kinda too simple for some thing not cheap like this</li>
            <li> I got my hair stuck in the machine twice, but that was because I tried to put too wide of a hair section into the chamber.  </li>
            <li> Arrived even faster than expected.</li>
            <li> The price seems a bit expensive, but I think it is well worth</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to friends, and maybe let a few borrow it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably because of build up on the barrel which I guess is expected over time.  </li>
            <li> pink</li>
            <li> And, there is absolutely no guesswork.  </li>
            <li> And if you are like me; forgetful, it comes with an Auto-off feature so you don’t burn the house</li>
            <li> talk about 3 mile wide hair.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll look like I spent $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair when I&#x27;m using it and doesn&#x27;t fry hair since you don&#x27;t have to have it on your hair but for only a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Say you want big fluffy curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really a no brainer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ceramic so the damage to your hair is minimal if any at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still playing with the time and temperature settings but you will get a few different curl looks with this curling wand.</li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve shied away from curling it because I end up burning myself, I fumble around with the curling iron for 20-30 minutes only to end up with a partially curled hair style that lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> First, I have extremely thick hair, and I have never had luck keeping a curl past</li>
            <li> Although it is thick, it does have some natural wave/curl and holds curl</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I used it before work the other day which I had work outside, on a windy, misty day, and by the end of the day, the curls were set so tight, they were still set at the end of the work</li>
            <li> Your hair is sucked into the hair chamber to get tight curls that won’t go flat in a day which is always admirable</li>
            <li> Although I usually curl her hair for her, She surprised me the other day by doing it herself!</li>
            <li> and i bought at least 7different types of curlers (remington, bed head, hot tools) from the typical round to ones with the wavy plates.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; When I looked at the item I thought it was a little different from any other curling iron I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> It has been really frustrating wasting money on other really expensive wands without getting the amazing curls</li>
            <li> Plain and simple!!</li>
            <li> and I always find it a bit difficult to get the right curl when using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I imagined my hair becoming impossibly tangled inside the curling chamber and burning off.  </li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron to replace my daughter&#x27;s older broken curling iron a few months back</li>
            <li> With other curling irons, I would have to wait forever curling my hair, with curlers that burn, and when I was done, my hair would be uneven throughout my head and wouldn&#x27;t last the night.</li>
            <li> Since I have long hair, it takes some time to curl, but compared to others, I&#x27;m done with my hair in less than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy, somewhat thin hair which was fully dried, product-free, brushed out, and tangle-free when I tested out the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.  </li>
            <li> The longer the setting, the tighter the curl, the less heat and less seconds on the Digital screen, the looser and wavier</li>
            <li> and my hair remains beatiful every single day!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I was a little confused how it worked at first</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick curly hair and we have spent so much money on other curling irons in the past, but nothing compares to the miraqueen curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid when it sucks your hair into the little chamber, it&#x27;s all part of the magic!</li>
            <li> I always seem to have a difficult time getting my hair to curl with a normal curling iron, but with this one it makes the process so simple and it works like a charm every time!</li>
            <li> so upset that it stopped working after TWO uses because it was fantastic when it was actually getting up to temp :(</li>
            <li> It looks like I spent hours on my hair, but really it only took a few minutes!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific little item!  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and its a little wavy and frizzy  </li>
            <li> tho wich would make it near impossible to do my whole head of hair even after straitng</li>
            <li> For someone like me, who previously had burned through curling irons and hair dryers like some people go through toothbrushes, I was hesitant to spend a few extra dollars on this one considering my track record.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend bought me a Miraqueen iron (because it was pink!)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical first</li>
            <li> /&gt;you&#x27;ve had with other curling irons</li>
            <li> At first she was skeptical</li>
            <li> This curler is unlike any other hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will only take a very small section of hair at time, which means that this will take a long time.</li>
            <li> DAY!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten three,  maybe four other people to buy one.</li>
            <li> Also, you CANNOT burn yourself, which I&#x27;m famous for with curling irons. :(  </li>
            <li> I have read other reviews that have said their hair has gotten caught, but I don&#x27;t see how when it alerts you and stops working if you are using incorrectly.</li>
            <li> Does not burn like other curlers.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to add a bunch of hair products to get this same hair luster.</li>
            <li> I have thin shoulder-length hair that normally doesn&#x27;t hold any curls or hair accessories for that matter.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried EVERY other product out there--</li>
            <li> technology to curling irons that has long been missing in the world of hair</li>
            <li> Mine also came with a protective heat case to put over the iron for storage, which I find extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> It just seemed easier to use than the other ones I’d seen, including my friends</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very intrigued!</li>
            <li> but I believe that was due to the length of my hair not the thickness of the section</li>
            <li> One other thing to note, the instructions included are in microscopic print vs. the other info.  </li>
            <li> Straighteners only work with small sections, curling irons too</li>
            <li> split ends like the other curling iron she had.</li>
            <li> I shopped at Ulta n other stores.</li>
            <li> Mine came with a protective heat case to put over the iron for storage, which I find extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re considering this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed :-)</li>
            <li> You must have patience and only do small sections at a time.  </li>
            <li> I noticed it was due to operator error, once I realized the angle of the curler had to be parallels with my head</li>
            <li> and It does it&#x27;s job faster then other curling irons</li>
            <li> I prefer the Miraqueen to any other way to curl hair.</li>
            <li> no more curling hair to discover you did the the opposite of what you intended to do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others but was always disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying another one, this pink one!</li>
            <li> I can do small areas or my entire head in four or five minutes, and my curls hold a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> being a retired hairstylist, I would recommend this to other stylist.</li>
            <li> What I like about this curling iron is its ability to curl up my hair without the difficulties I had with other curling irons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other curling irons don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I either have to use it on the other side of the house or not at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not willing to risk losing my hair while trying to figure out this device.  </li>
            <li> Small pieces are key.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very intrigued!</li>
            <li> I have stick thin hair that normally does not hold a curl WHATSOEVER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other irons before, but the effects would fall out within hours.  </li>
            <li> The perks to this compared to other irons is it heats to 450 degree F, has the highest heat to give long-lasting curls and waves, there&#x27;s ceramic technology, it protects hair from damage, has 3 heat levels and 4 timer settings, it automatically turns off, and has a LED screen that displays a timer, temperature, and curl direction.</li>
            <li> it is PINK!</li>
            <li> , it makes it a snap to to do, so I can focus on something else, like getting my makeup around or checking my phone with my other hand.</li>
            <li> Another thing --- the design has rubberize components to prevent you from getting burned, something that has happened with the other curling irons I&#x27;ve tried and</li>
            <li> I paid $80+ for the other curling iron... which I ended up selling on eBay, because I just couldn&#x27;t get it to work</li>
            <li> With all of the irons that I have owned in the past, I never had one with a digital display.</li>
            <li> (unlike other products I have had in</li>
            <li> I asked her what was the difference from any other curling iron</li>
            <li> I can make it loose or tight, depending on the settings I use.</li>
            <li> how tight or loose curls are.</li>
            <li> It gives you three timer settings so you can create loose, medium, or tight curls in your hair.</li>
            <li> There are three timer settings 8 seconds for loose curls, 10 seconds for medium curls, and 12 seconds for tight curls.</li>
            <li> The timer settings determine the tightness of the curl: loose, medium and tight.  </li>
            <li> With the rubber layer near the heater to protect your hands, the plastic base that keeps the iron cool, and the ceramic curling chamber that glides over your hair, this unit gives you an enormous amount of safety that is hard to come by in other irons.  </li>
            <li> Also, I’m a very forgetful person and can sometimes be scatter-brained</li>
            <li> there were Very Few times that the chamber actually released my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, red hair - i.e. prone to frizz - and a lot of it, which is currently bra clasp length.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than a curling iron that doesn&#x27;t generate enough heat to create a lasting hold.</li>
            <li> When I lost the curl from this in a few hours, my hair seemed dry and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some last for a few months, some a few years.  </li>
            <li> (less money spent at the salon).</li>
            <li> I had a curl secret which is more expensive.</li>
            <li> And even if you leave the curler on your hair too long, it&#x27;s designed to time itself out after a little bit so you have less of a risk of burning your hair.     </li>
            <li> I can get tight or loose curls and in either direction !  </li>
            <li> and I have a hard time doing the back of my head, but other than that</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t mattered whether it was thick, natural and to my waist or its now incarnation of overly bleached pink thin fray, its always handled curls the same way.</li>
            <li> Then I came across the Miraqueen Iron that is very simialar to the curl secret, but with a few pluses and $20 less.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and other curling irons just don&#x27;t fulfill the job, they uncurl after just a few hours and sometimes a few minutes.</li>
            <li> At one point, I did start to get a little impatient and tried to use a section of hair that was too big, so it got a little caught.  </li>
            <li> I was a little intimidated at first by the size, thinking it was going to be bulky and difficult to maneuver around my head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Semi-con: it can be hard to reach in the back to curl</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> So not worth it.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing difficult about using this machine.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> and then I have to go back and check (and then, of course, I’m late for work).</li>
            <li> My hair is suppppperr long, so it usually takes quite a while to curl it.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT WORTH THE RISK.</li>
            <li> you really can’t go wrong.</li>
            <li> And plus I&#x27;m just a big sucker for the color</li>
            <li> no matter what I use and using the usual long curling iron I tend to burn myself rather than give my hair bounce.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You simply place strands of your hair in the chamber of the iron and SWOOSH—it sucks your hair into a curling motion automatically.</li>
            <li> It simply will can&#x27;t handle/ suck in thick strands of hair.</li>
            <li> Now I am a 35 year old tired soccer mom</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and at one point I used too big a piece.</li>
            <li> When that happens, immediately open the curler, slowly work your hair out, fix the problem, and try again.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and the only way I can ever get curls to stay curly is with a ton of hairspray.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to get the curling procedure down.  </li>
            <li> So knowing that it won’t burn down my house because it turns off automatically and has protections in place even if it stayed on--</li>
            <li> it smoothed my hair down and the curls lasted for days.</li>
            <li> the area that I clamped the device down on, came out crimped.  </li>
            <li> Five stars, hands down.</li>
            <li> Start pulling your hair out of curler while you hold the trigger down as if your curling your hair, so it is trying to curl your hair while you pull.</li>
            <li> you get the hand movement down.  </li>
            <li> Stop wasting your money on all the other devices out there!</li>
            <li> I know that she had complained about other brands of curling irons that did not work well with her long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thin curly hair, it is very frizzly feeling and all over the place.  </li>
            <li> Some of my hair was back past the foam roller caught as well which was pulling and very tight.  </li>
            <li> Down, ponytail, and half ponytail.</li>
            <li> Plus, I am terrible at doing my own hair and usually you can see lines when I use a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> My wife normally wears her hair straight because it is too difficult to get curly hair with just a curling iron and it is too expensive to go get a perm at the salon.  </li>
            <li> Being so bulky and close to the scalp this can be a little scary, especially as it sucks your hair in, I have found if you hold the end, almost giving a little pull as the hair is being pulled in that it does seem to help guide the hair in better and helps cut back on the hair getting tangled in the chamber.</li>
            <li> Simply turning a wheel up or down like on a standard curling iron is relatively meaningless.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it you can curl and go in less than 15 minutes (</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend abut a month and a half ago on her birthday as one of her presents.</li>
            <li> I seriously didn&#x27;t know about purchasing initially</li>
            <li> Since hair has to be curled in strips of less than half an inch, it took forever to end up with hair that looked like</li>
            <li> Previous curling attempts always resulted in ponytails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And she gets it done in a lot less time.</li>
            <li> I have been looking a product that will curl my hair without using the typical barrel curling iron.</li>
            <li> To give you an idea, I&#x27;m half Indian...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s LESS damaging than metal curling irons are (although it will still damage your hair).</li>
            <li> but, she tried to use that one on my hair for an event a month and a half ago</li>
            <li> I have extremely long (below my waist) and thick, dark hair that is resistant to just about any styling product or tool.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical after to many 5 star reviews that maybe the reviews were fake.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions keeping hair width to an inch or less</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t burned myself or my hair, unlike previously owned models and I can use it one handed.</li>
            <li> As you work with the device and get the hang of it, it takes much less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it also makes my hair less damage, I think it is because of the Ceramic chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What this means for me is that I dont need to wait for half an hour to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> I already have heat damage from previous appliances,  so this doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I can curl my hair in 8 minutes or less</li>
            <li> you want anything more than a standard boring curler, go for this one.</li>
            <li> This one works just as well for $30-$40 less.</li>
            <li> and I used the recommendation to use about half an inch of hair each time if you want all over curls.</li>
            <li> One of the issues that my wife had was previous curls burning her hair, and this was not an issue with this curler.  </li>
            <li> Using this one is so much less hassle and</li>
            <li> , I can do it in less than 10 mins.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For safety, I like that it has an auto shut off feature too - less worry and concern in those events that you forget to unplug your iron!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has cut my time in half.</li>
            <li> This curling iron isn&#x27;t your typical curling iron.</li>
            <li> significant other give this a shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is slightly wavy.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews here carefully, and usually the reviews here don&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> I had a few frizzy curls released, then one or two that were normal and in between that, a handful of failed curling attempts due to the amount of hair or some tangle that occurred on the way in.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anybody with thin hair!</li>
            <li> I have really really hard to curl hair &amp; it just takes so long.</li>
            <li> Because of her long and thick hair previous curling irons would damage her</li>
            <li> You may mess up a time or 2</li>
            <li> , however I didn&#x27;t care it looked a frizzy mess</li>
            <li> I have really thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> people with long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> She has long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair</li>
            <li> I have extremely long thick hair that NEVER holds curls.</li>
            <li> I have really thick long hair</li>
            <li> Well, one hand down - you won&#x27;t be putting down this baby!</li>
            <li> I can play with those tight silver screen ringlets all night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes fairly tight curls.  </li>
            <li> It has wound the hair too tight and caused it to be stuck</li>
            <li> , it lets me calculate how tight I want my curls.</li>
            <li> I like my curls tight</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to get those big-almost-waves-but-still-curls thing but wasn&#x27;t sure I had the skills for a traditional curling iron and was just plain terrified of the clipless/wand things (sorority sister got a really nasty burn on that thing in college</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward to use at first (or maybe I&#x27;m just uncoordinated).</li>
            <li> Curling my coarse hair is usually really hard, but this one does the trick!</li>
            <li> Now, a couple of tricks my friend shared with me: you&#x27;ve got to make sure the lock you put through it is not too thick and doesn&#x27;t have a very wide base, and you need to run a brush through it before curling to get any tangles out.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair, and it takes FOREVER to curl it using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> The pivoting base makes it easy to handle the Miraqueen without getting tangled and interrupting the task at hand:</li>
            <li> The rubber protector and heat insulating base are pretty key and almost</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had so much trouble trying to curl my thick long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little scary, the first time it sucks your hair in.  </li>
            <li> have naturally wavy hair with thick strands that usually has a hard time holding a curl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s naturally a little wavy but has never held a curl.  </li>
            <li> I just have to up the time and heat and add a little hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Sooooo disappointed after being excited to wait to receive but found it was defective.</li>
            <li> Get one for your little self now.</li>
            <li> I had some hair pull out a little.</li>
            <li> , this little babe came into my life</li>
            <li> It did take a little bit to get the hang of how to hold the Miraqueen when I switched sides of the head, but once I got it under wraps</li>
            <li> Took me a little while to get the hang of how to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> Until I bought this little miracle.</li>
            <li> And at $60 which is a little pricey for me.</li>
            <li> I have thick long dark hair a little past my shoulder length.</li>
            <li> So, in the beginning I was a little apprehensive when I bought the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to get used to</li>
            <li> curls relax just a little and ran my fingers through it.  </li>
            <li> Also, you&#x27;ll notice this iron has a little chamber.  </li>
            <li> With a little bit of setting spray, my curls lasted all day without unwinding or getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> I never got burned and my hair was never burned which has happened in the past with other curlers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the time will get a little shorter.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Curing Iron also has a plastic base so it doesn’t get hot to hold like some curling or flat irons out</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little heavy</li>
            <li> Doing the back of your head is tough but that&#x27;s the case with curling irons too</li>
            <li> She now thinks I&#x27;m not such a bad old guy and that I have it going on,what ever that means.</li>
            <li> For starters, no more fear of scorching herself – there are a number of protection measures implemented in this model that offer maximum safety while it is being used.&lt;br /&gt;Second of all, the LED display might seem like an unnecessary feature, but it apparently helps with controlling the temperature and curl direction, while also showing the timer.</li>
            <li> This also has a curl direction setting that lets you control which wan</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to purchasing a few for some of my besties for the holidays.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m awful at doing my own hair,so trust me when I say anyone can do this.</li>
            <li> but now she uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have such thin flimsy hair, it seems like</li>
            <li> but my hair is so heavy the curls die after about a hour.</li>
            <li> I have it got it stuck a few times.</li>
            <li> But after reading a few reviews on it, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this after watching a few Youtube videos &amp; reading some of the reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Did not at all wasted money</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was hesitant but after watching a few youtube videos and reading some reviews I decided to get it.  </li>
            <li> but if you want to &amp;#34;re-curl&amp;#34; your hair you can do that, OR you can touch up a few pieces.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> (even worse) doesn&#x27;t last!</li>
            <li> The curls didn&#x27;t hold all day, but held for the few hours</li>
            <li> I like to style my hair differently everyday</li>
            <li> You need to understand that the part of the brain that manages hair styling skills is missing from my brain.  </li>
            <li> My hair also got caught in the iron a few times.</li>
            <li> It is heavy too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another feature I enjoy are they rubber protector and heat insulating base that prevent me from fumbling around and burning myself or my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have it, you&#x27;re definitely missing out.</li>
            <li> There was a concern it would suck up my hair in a messy tangle.</li>
            <li> If you have not tried this yet, you just don’t know what you are missing out on.  </li>
            <li> and I started using her curler behind her back</li>
            <li> , I think my roommates&#x27; curl is sometimes childish</li>
            <li> That was until a girlfriend of mine recommended Miraqueen to me a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of irons, gels, sprays, creams even salon perms fall out leaving me with limp dead</li>
            <li> I washed and blow dried my hair.  </li>
            <li> So I look really uneven.</li>
            <li> My hair tangled a few times but it was manageable</li>
            <li> I had been eyeing the MiraCurl for a few years now but couldn&#x27;t justify the price.  </li>
            <li> so I just run my fingers through it a few times after I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> the Miraqueen, I get a long-lasting style for my thick hair in a minimal amount of time.</li>
            <li> but it seems sturdy and not cheaply made at all.  </li>
            <li> The few times I got overzealous with section sizing the device</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want her to have to use it everyday and  hair styling is time consuming.</li>
            <li> It is rather heavy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another feature I enjoy are they rubber protector and heat insulating base that prevent me from fumbling around and burning myself or my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble trying to figure out the techniques of how to use curling irons ---</li>
            <li> When this arrived my hair had air dried from the night before so my hair had</li>
            <li> However, I am not one to use these things on my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when reading all of the positive reviews on this one, simply because I&#x27;ve been so disappointed with similar products in this price range.</li>
            <li> Before, she just did her hair with different things and then went to school, but she was very frustrated that she hadn&#x27;t found the right hair iron.</li>
            <li> My arms, neck, and chest were all vulnerable to other curling irons, especially wands, before.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to mess up, with it beeping and releasing if there is too much hair, a tangle, etc.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair that is hard to curl.  </li>
            <li> and I desperately needed a new look!</li>
            <li> temperature and time settings are not good enough, it does not curl properly even with very thin strands of hair.</li>
            <li> but that is not true with this product!  </li>
            <li> I have long very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long and unruly hair.</li>
            <li> The self- curling feature is very cool, but I really  hated the end results.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am bad with hair.</li>
            <li> This was pretty bad.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty bad at curling my hair with those</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that is usually very difficult to straighten, but this product gets the job done no problem.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s a few inches past my shoulders, so</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is down to my waist.  </li>
            <li> If your looking to try something new and cutting edge I would start here.</li>
            <li> Very tight curls, like Shirley Temple.</li>
            <li> I had one of the Babyliss ones and found that it would need to be on the maximum time and temperature to make a curl that would stay, and it was not even very tight.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend has thin hair and she always complains that her hair will just not hold curls for very long.</li>
            <li> Good idea, bad product and bad service.</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely straight hair and it is almost impossible to keep in a curl with heat curling.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored and chemically straightened (at least the bottom half).  </li>
            <li> She is black and her hair is thick</li>
            <li> I already had a mountain of curling irons that never worked out for me because my hair texture is so thick and slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> , WELL... PROBLEM SOLVED WITH THIS LITTLE MACHINE!</li>
            <li> that looks like a hickey, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about it with this little beauty!</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and was desperately looking for this curling  iron in dual voltage, but in the US , all the other brands were only 110 V and the cheaper versions did not even have the curl direction control.  </li>
            <li> Definitely made a difference with my tough to curl hair!</li>
            <li> Even at the highest settings there was very little curl.  </li>
            <li> I mean lets face it, to get tight  curls</li>
            <li> She was searching for a new one, and she was not willing to be disappointed this time.</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if my husband was already awake when I am getting ready, but he&#x27;s always still asleep and this beeping wakes him up.</li>
            <li> I can be a bit disorganized in the morning and am usually rushing around to get out on time, so</li>
            <li> I tried small sections.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste time get yours today!</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical about using this one simply for the way it looks and is shaped.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife as a random present as she had been discussing curling her hair.</li>
            <li> No more turning around or switching from side to side just to get to the hair side you want done.</li>
            <li> I anxiously awaited for my Miraqueen Curler to arrive.</li>
            <li> Usually what happens is this: I fight for hours trying to get my hair to curl and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is</li>
            <li> Just a SMALL amount.</li>
            <li> Or a lazy day when you don&#x27;t want to do a lot of work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use almost any brand as I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> No more split ends and breakage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every time I curled my hair in the past, it took over an hour and the curls wouldn&#x27;t hold for anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have thin brittle shoulder length hair, and not much of it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;-There is a small learning curve.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the Miraqueen has been nothing short of a revelation, which is a weird thing for me to say as I&#x27;ve never given praise like that to any type of machine.</li>
            <li> While it does take small amounts of hair the amount of time to curl my hair is about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it beeps to let you know when it is done.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong with buying these curlers.</li>
            <li> But this curling iron solves the problems I&#x27;ve had in the past with curling irons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have hair that falls just past my shoulders</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> That frustration is now a thing of the past since I have found this thing.</li>
            <li> and you are probably skeptical about the actual results for your hair.</li>
            <li> Usually, I dread the time I have to spend in the morning working with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I have had some irons in the past that try to curl my daughter&#x27;s hair and have to stop because it&#x27;s not curling the hair, hurting my hands, etc.  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly no issue with tangling if used following the instructions.</li>
            <li> I also used really small sections</li>
            <li> I was almost convinced that I was going to have to get the scissors out and suffer the most awful grow out but</li>
            <li> No more hit or miss curls.</li>
            <li> You do have to take small sections  of hair at a time, if not it catches your hair and starts beeping at you.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone who likes the idea of shaking up their usual style by wearing curls.</li>
            <li> Just a ton of waste d time, money, and effort.&lt;br /&gt;However, the MiraQueen is a godsend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Goodbye uncomfortable foam rollers and forehead burning wands, I now have the one and only curling iron I need…the MiraQueen!</li>
            <li> Hate to leave a bad review, but even after I brushed my hair very smooth, and was careful to only use small sections of hair, this wrapped up and tangled my hair so badly</li>
            <li> A private high tech hairdresser / barber robot for everyone who wishes to improve their looks from ugly to mediocre.  </li>
            <li> I persistently tried to tug out my hair (any or all of it) and released very few strands.  </li>
            <li> But I hate traditional curling irons - they don&#x27;t do well in small bathrooms, they scorch hair, the curl doesn&#x27;t last, and who hasn&#x27;t had a burn from using one?  </li>
            <li> The instructions included in the box are not very good, basically how to turn the thing on</li>
            <li> I have thick, straight, almost un-curlable Asian hair and it is DREADFUL.</li>
            <li> I would always have to load up on hairspray leaving my hair very stiff and without a lot of movement.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s impossible to achieve soft curls.</li>
            <li> My thick long hair is extremely difficult to curl.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and it usually takes at LEAST 30 min to do my hair, no matter what it is I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> I am so guilty of this,, I always curl my hair close to my scalp to give it a tight curly look, but the iron is designed to give it a tight curly look without burning your scalp or burning your hair.</li>
            <li> and my hairdresser always says it&#x27;s fairly difficult to style, but this curling iron glides over my hair and doesn&#x27;t loose its grip at the ends.</li>
            <li> So I had to have one also, and I could hardly wait until it was delivered.</li>
            <li> It was so hard to curl my hair because it would not grasp the strands.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s so thick!), but this one managed to tame it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely had models with hard to read displays and buttons that are awkward to reach -</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t just ignore his gift without using it at least once.  </li>
            <li> Her biggest complaint has always been that none of them can give her a curl that will hold for any length of time.  </li>
            <li> It automatically sucks your hair inside and curls it according to your settings.</li>
            <li> but I lost at least 3-4&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Maybe I should borrow hers, because I at least know where the hair came from....</li>
            <li> That incudes blow drying my hair as well, which takes me @ least 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 months now, and I use it at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about a tool that sucks your hair up inside of it.  </li>
            <li> , I looked at the negative reviews too, but I found if you follow the directions</li>
            <li> My one complaint -</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m clumsy</li>
            <li> It sucks the hair in, curls it, and releases when done.</li>
            <li> For my hair at least.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 60s),</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, and it literally took me maybe 7 mins.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy medium length hair.</li>
            <li> If you grab a thick strand it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and the curling iron</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick hair</li>
            <li> She has really thick hair</li>
            <li> Maybe if you had really thick hair and a lot of it</li>
            <li> well - my daughter has incredibly thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick chemically straightened hair (yuko) and no matter the temp or the time I tried to set the curls, these lackluster bended waves would come out.</li>

            <li> Having thick hair makes curling your hair a timely task.</li>
            <li> I haev impossibly thick hair and it takes hours to curl.</li>
            <li> Because it is so thick I dislike curling it.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with curling irons because I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t say thick either.</li>
            <li> (idk what she&#x27;s sarong and what it mean,  iI don&#x27;t speak hair products)</li>
            <li> Let me just say, that is a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> No more frying my hair!</li>
            <li> No more getting burned!</li>
            <li> I dont usually write reviews, but this one swiped me away!</li>
            <li> no more thinking all day if you remembered to unplug!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was not interested in the process at all.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing anywhere to identify what all the beeps mean, or how to fix it once it messes up.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely difficult to curl - it&#x27;s very thick and long.</li>
            <li> I have crazy thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> Now I want to start off by saying I am a failure when it comes to styling hair.</li>
            <li> but I waited for the failure that always comes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that you have to do very small strands</li>
            <li> Use very small strands of hair to keep it from rejecting.</li>
            <li> ( I use a very small amount of hair spray)&lt;br /&gt;--  </li>
            <li> I can curl my hair in less than 10 minutes!!!</li>
            <li> less expensive.</li>
            <li> Seriously</li>
            <li> it takes some SERIOUS time for me to curl if I put myself up to it, which isn&#x27;t too often.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, do it.</li>
            <li> It is virtually impossible to burn yourself with it unlike regular hair wand curlers, and this doesn&#x27;t entail wrapping or twisting.</li>
            <li> No more sloppy hair curl days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing the Miraqueen for months now and held off on purchasing it because I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> It sounds a little scary, but it hasn&#x27;t pulled my hair once.  </li>
            <li> have used it every single day, and my wife is obsessed!</li>
            <li> I always burned myself and the last time was so bad that I was scared to ever use the curling iron again.</li>
            <li> This product looked overly complicated and heavy.</li>
            <li> I did try this on my mom&#x27;s very thin hair and it snagged up quite a few times.</li>
            <li> The other issues is that the curler has to always face one direction, which can be awkward for holding and loading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even if I do manage to get even a little curl to it, it will fall out within 30 minutes and that is even with hair spray!!!</li>
            <li> my hair tangled 4x and it was not pleasant getting it out, and yes, I did comb the strand before placing it in the iron.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product because I&#x27;ve heard bad things about the other version of it and with my mixed race course, frizzy hair alot of products don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> We used to use a conventional curling iron with an exposed metal cylinder and we were always afraid that if she moved or bounced or shifted, she would get burned.  </li>
            <li> This Maraqueen Proffessional Curling Iron is so simple, and you won&#x27;t burn yourself like other nasty hair</li>
            <li> At least I know it worked!  </li>
            <li> duh!  </li>
            <li> I would playfully swat him away since I was afraid he&#x27;d mess them up</li>
            <li> have a lot of very thick hair that does not like to curl.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and works like a charm, just don&#x27;t overload the curling iron or it&#x27;ll snag up.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and wavy hair</li>
            <li> However, my sister has VERY thick hair.</li>
            <li> The automatic shut-off feature is also a lifesaver since pageant days can be a little hectic and crazy.  </li>
            <li> I have burned my arm and face on other curling irons but it is virtually impossible to do with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works just like The Curl Secret but way</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> One of the settings is specifically for thin hair.</li>
            <li> secret-</li>
            <li> Well you hold the device to your head and it sucks up your hair so it was stuck in a position that makes it difficult to get your hair out.  </li>
            <li> The rotating base will do it itself, freely following whenever you turn.</li>
            <li> During the unboxing she was a bit skeptical about it working because of how thick her hair is but as soon as she turned it on</li>
            <li> Curling my hair has been frustrating because A</li>
            <li> I have medium-length hair, and this is definitely not great for it.</li>
            <li> I asked her what her secret was, and she told me about this product.</li>
            <li> I have thin frizzy shoulder length</li>
            <li> so my arms never got tired while holding it up.</li>
            <li> so I believe there is a charm behind this.    </li>
            <li> I hated using my old curling iron and always managed to burn myself but this has a protective layer so that I don&#x27;t do that anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying out my sister&#x27;s Curl Secret.</li>
            <li> It takes approximately 35-40 minutes to curl all my hair, pinning it up and curling it by layers.</li>
            <li> Holy crap this thing actually works!</li>
            <li> The pink is a god awful pepto bismol puke pink.</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny and bouncy even though I have tons of hair processes due to a bad dye work...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Late last year, I had purchased the CHI Air curling iron and I absolutely hated it!  </li>
            <li> Normally I am not very good at buying gifts.</li>
            <li> but this is honestly not that expensive for something she uses quite often!</li>
            <li> Worst of all, it takes so much pressure to hold the button in place to curl, that my finger was numb for about 1 week.</li>
            <li> and I definitely recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> No more bad hair days for her.</li>
            <li> They did work, but I hated how it would take sooo long (it would take me 30min-1h).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to twist my hair around, losing strands and having it stick out at weird angles.  </li>
            <li> this will solve everything, I&#x27;m obsessed with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;d recommend it to the ladies who are hair obsessed</li>
            <li> (The brush iron actually got caught in my hair, and I had to cut like 4 inches off, it was terrible).</li>
            <li> Anything that saves me time styling my difficult hair is a lifesaver.  </li>
            <li> My sister has been hair obsessed since she was a child.</li>
            <li> I did try the iron without any product or hair spray and was not impressed.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Miraqueen Hair curler.</li>
            <li> This iron isn&#x27;t difficult to use.</li>
            <li> anything EVER does go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is difficult with holding a curl.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the price...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing wrong, but I figure it shouldn&#x27;t be this</li>
            <li> (To say I was skeptical is an understatement.</li>
            <li> I have about six or seven, including an expensive ceramic one.</li>
            <li> You can´t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I tried a curling wand with mediocre results.  </li>
            <li> Anything that saves me time styling my difficult hair is a lifesaver</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> and I was not impressed at all</li>
            <li> But I was SO wrong.</li>
            <li> if I looked at them wrong, my MiraQueen has even dove off the counter and lived to tell the tale;</li>
            <li> These were all expensive, high-end products.  </li>
            <li> My niece is 13 and is flat-out obsessed with fashion.  </li>
            <li> Works as well as the expensive Curling Iron.</li>
            <li> and I was so skeptical</li>
            <li> and I could be wrong</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical that it would work for her.</li>
            <li> so it feels weird.</li>
            <li> The literature that came with the curler was useless -</li>
            <li> She was unable to use this product.  </li>
            <li> I mean REALLY bad.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> No more having to worry about burning yourself with your curling iron, it is just about impossible to even burn yourself with this one!</li>
            <li> Somehow when I look in the mirror, I turn into a clumsy idiot.  </li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do anything but return it and not bother reordering, because I&#x27;m afraid of what I might get.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> Also, the curl starts at least 1&amp;#34; away from the scalp, closer to 2&amp;#34; which is another thing I hated about it.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter if I used tons of product, styled while hair was dirty....</li>
            <li> Disappointment abounds with this product.</li>
            <li> so the size can make awkward at times.</li>
            <li> For the money it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want her to know my secret!!</li>
            <li> It was very difficult to try to get my hair out.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I purchased.</li>
            <li> I have always had very thin hair that can never seem to hold a curl, but with the Miraqueen the curls lasted all day!</li>
            <li> My friend said that she got this for me because, &amp;#34;You&#x27;re always complaining about your thick, horrible hair...</li>
            <li> It is very difficult for me to curl my hair</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use - my hair got stuck and at one point</li>
            <li> The results of a tangle while loading are almost impossible to undo.  </li>
            <li> have a bad habit of running out the door leaving my curling irons on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, I am bad with gadgets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Always have the roller part facing your head and it will never turn out bad.</li>
            <li> Testing out the settings isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I was having an extremely bad hair day on the day of an event my friend and I were supposed to go to.</li>
            <li> In the mornings, I would often be inside of my bathroom frustrated beyond belief with my hair.</li>
            <li> I just put it on and the miraqueen sucks it up, curls it, and viola!!!!  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and think this thing seems a bit pricey and hesitant on whether or not it will work, don&#x27;t be, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I anticipated the arrival of this curling iron but after using it was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I know you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, it is very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> It is idiot proof.  </li>
            <li> Even without any hairspray or curl prep gel, and on greasy filthy hair, it still held a curl for 6+ hours.</li>
            <li> My hair is nearly impossible to curl!  </li>
            <li> very disappointed...</li>
            <li> .. very disappointed..  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was SOOOO skeptical about this curling iron!!!!</li>
            <li> I never curl my hair because I&#x27;m terrible at it!</li>
            <li> and I felt terrible.  </li>
            <li> it helped avoid those nasty burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I can honestly say that I have tried many curling irons and this by far is the best that I have used yet. There is nothing worse than a curling iron that doesn&#x27;t generate enough heat to create a lasting hold. This curling iron has a maximum heat setting that will definitely lock in the style for a glam look. My hair looks absolutely stunning and it is full of bounce after I am finished working my magic with the Miraqueen. If you are looking for salon-styled hair at home, I would highly recommend this item as a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;. I also wanted to mention that in the past I have had lots of heat damage because of frequent heat-styling but, because of the ceramic design my hair actually feels much softer after curling and it is very shiny, so amazing. I must say that I do love the sleek design and color, it is totally stylish and modern looking. This also has a curl direction setting that lets you control which wan you want your curls to roll...what a genius idea! Having the option to change heat settings to 3 different levels with the use of a timer is also priceless, technology that is a must when considering quick styles on the run.&lt;br /&gt;Another safety feature that I think is great and always look for is the automatic shutoff, this is great for quick sets. This is an amazing product with great functionality and ease of use. I am looking forward to purchasing a few for some of my besties for the holidays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing the Miraqueen for months now and held off on purchasing it because I was a little skeptical. I should&#x27;ve purchased this a while ago instead of a pricy curling wand for my hair extensions! To say that I love this product is a complete understatement. It takes me less than twenty minutes to curl my entire wig and the curls last long in my southern seventy degree humid weather. My favorite feature would have to be the LCD which shows the timer and temperature, which is important do I don&#x27;t burn my hair weave. The handle is also small hand friendly. If you want to shave off time from your daily hair routine, buy the Miraqueen curling iron! What more can you ask for: less time, no burnt smell, hair extension friendly, comfortable for small hands, and affordable.</li>
            <li> PULLS HAIR, TRIED SEVERAL TIMES AS DIRECTED BUT NO SUCCES, WILL GIVE IT AWAY</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so it holds curls very very well. That being said, I would recommend the Miraqueen to ANY girl who wants to achieve natural, bouncy curls - or if you have very very straight hair, this iron will provide you with natural looking waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any curling iron - it&#x27;s best if you spray your hair first and last with hairspray to elongate the hold time of the curl, and play around with the time you keep the Miraqueen clamped down and the heat setting you have on - but it&#x27;ll definitely produce awesome curls! It even has a feature to guarantee you dont have too much hair in the curler, so you get the perfect curl every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and hate using a curling wand because you burn your fingers five times every morning when you try to use it, the Miraqueen is great for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the price is a little higher than the wands you can find at Target and other stores, it&#x27;s a great investment and will be the only curler you need!</li>
            <li> Curls have always been on my wish list.  I say this because my hair is super long and super straight.  Curling irons, curlers - none of them worked because my hair apparently LIKED being straight, and the sheer weight would make the tightest curl stretch out. So I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my boyfriend bought me a Miraqueen iron (because it was pink!) and I couldn&#x27;t just ignore his gift without using it at least once.  Luckily, once was enough!  This is so cool!  I don&#x27;t have to twist my hair around, losing strands and having it stick out at weird angles.  Instead, I take a piece, it goes into a chamber and curls all by itself.  One awesome feature of the Miraqueen is that I get to choose my temperature!  For example, it&#x27;s much harder to curl the hair in back, because of the weight.  I use a higher temperature for that area, a lower temperature for my layers and bangs - you get the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature I don&#x27;t know how I have lived without is the direction feature.  So many times I&#x27;ve used curling irons or curlers and when I took them out, the hair curled in some random direction, never where I wanted it.  This iron lets me change the direction of each curl - pretty cool - and the curls I get are tight curls.  People don&#x27;t realize how important that is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hassle-free, Stress-free, GREAT results - I highly recommend the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is you want control over your hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I got the Miraqueen curling iron, I use to have a traditional curling iron but not all my curls looked good because it&#x27;s difficult to do the back of your hair and it takes time. The Miraqueen saves a lot of time and every curl comes out perfectly. The curling iron makes a sound when your hair is curled and you have the option between loose, medium and tight. I was skeptical first but I&#x27;m happy I got it never have to struggle again with traditional curling irons. Besides that my hair is not super dry anymore if you want perfect curls without damaging your hair you will love the Miraqueen.</li>
            <li> I received this curling iron as a gift and I am fairly pleased. It took a little while to figure out the controls, but once I got the hang of it, the results were amazing! There are so many possibilities with this tool.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!!!  Once you get the hang of it you can curl and go in less than 15 minutes (pending how long your hair is).</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron with the Ceramic Curling Chamber is such a great investment and a brilliant addition to anyone’s beauty regime. This is so simple to use with its 3 heat levels and 4 timber settings, it is suitable for multiple hair types. My hair is pin straight but using the Miraqueen Curling Iron helps to get the looks I want. I will be buying a couple of these for Christmas gifts, for sure. I love that it isn’t expensive and it is such a high quality product. One of my favorite features is the fact that it has automatic shut off! I am definitely one of those people that are trying to get a thousand things done at once and I simply forget in the hustle and bustle to always shut off everything. That extra feature is just a nice security. It also has a really easy to read screen that displays the curl direction, the time, and the temperature of the Curling Iron. Beautiful results every time!  My new favorite tool.</li>
            <li> To preface I want to say that I have NEVER been able to figure out curling irons or wands. I&#x27;ve tried curlers, I&#x27;ve tried all the \\&quot;no heat\\&quot; methods I see online, and it just never works out well. So I was really excited to try a product that promised to give me perfect curls with zero skills or effort. And I am happy to report that this product does the trick!! Miraqueen curler is an odd looking device, especially if you&#x27;re not entirely sure how it works, but once you read the instructions you get the hang of it really quickly. It will give you perfect curls every time. It has 3 heat settings (I use the 2nd setting) and 3 curl settings.. The device heats up SUPER quickly, which I love, because I am not very patient. I can report my hair did not tangle once, and after a few curls I was able to figure out how much hair was supposed to go in the barrel. Once your hair is in, the machine will beep, and once it is ready to release, it will beep faster. Again, the tighter the curl you want, the longer it will be in the chamber. The only time consuming part of the process is actually separating your hair into sections, so that your curled and uncurled hairs don&#x27;t mix up. I am SUPER excited about this product and I know I will be using it a lot. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and was desperately looking for this curling  iron in dual voltage, but in the US , all the other brands were only 110 V and the cheaper versions did not even have the curl direction control.  While I was in Europe and Australia, i found only 220v brands, some with curl direction control and some without.  All brands though had the the 3 heat settings and the timer.  So, I was ECSTATIC when I found the MiraQueen which has it ALL: 3 heat settings, timer, curl direction control and above all the DUAL Voltage.  To me this was very important, so now I can take my Miraqueen with me anywhere, just have a plug adaptor for the region I am traveling to.  I got the pink one and it looks really cool.  Thanks for bringing MiraQueen to amazon.  Why buy a uni voltage and no curl direction control one while you can get it all in the Miraqueen?</li>
            <li> My wife has been needing a new curling iron for quite some time so I saw all the great reviews on this and bought it for her. Every time she uses it her hair looks flawless and my wife has really thin hair but this just makes it so much easier on her! Honestly this is really cheap for this amazing curler you are getting so much out of it and my wife absolutely loves to use it (especially the automatic shut-off because she is the type to not always remember to turn the curler off).</li>
            <li> After trying so many different curling irons, I have finally found a winner! This curler puts the others to shame and I only wish I had found it sooner. My hair is really thick and most curls fall out within the hour but with this product it held it&#x27;s curls the whole night! It&#x27;s very easy to use and has a temperature control panel and a LCD screen that I found very convenient. My favorite part was that it automatically curls your hair for you so you don&#x27;t have to manually do it and each curl looks the same! I also love the fact that it turns itself off using a timer, so no more leaving the house worrying if I did or not!</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend abut a month and a half ago on her birthday as one of her presents. Honestly, I know absolutely nothing abut curling irons, but I&#x27;m leaving this review because every time I see my wife curl her her since I&#x27;ve gotten this for her, she has used this. She has multiple other curling irons (None of them look as fancy as this, they are just the plain looking ones), but she always uses this one, so that is a good indication that this is a good curling iron, or at the very least, better than all of those average curling irons. This isn&#x27;t that expensive either, I mean I&#x27;ve never had to buy a curling iron before (LOL) but this is honestly not that expensive for something she uses quite often!</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is a simply amazing product! It&#x27;s very sturdy, easy to use, and a real  steal for the price! I use this product several times a week and am amazed at how awesome my hair looks each time! The curls are always perfect and precise, and I feel confident each time I use this product. I am particularly fond of the LED display and the different temperature settings. The product comes with a one year warranty, but I can guarantee you will never need it! This curling iron is durable and easy to control, and the curl chamber ensure your hair never gets pulled or snagged. The Miraqueen is a MUST HAVE for any beauty enthusiast. It&#x27;s a purchase you will not regret!</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen curling iron has done wonders for me and my hair. I seriously didn&#x27;t know about purchasing initially but now I wish I would&#x27;ve bought sooner! I feel better, look better and get major compliments from people that seem to barely notice me. Save the trip to the salon for later and invest in the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron. If it works for me, it will work for anyone!</li>
            <li> I needed an original idea to buy for my wife for her birthday. I know that she had complained about other brands of curling irons that did not work well with her long hair. This Miraqueen professional curling iron fit the bill and exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She first told me how nice the swivel was to avoid getting tangles and tripped up by cords like units she used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she used it, she liked that her curls stayed in for 4+ hours and stayed looking good. She talked about the control panel being superior to other models and easier to make changes on the fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes the LCD monitor which easily shows the status without wondering. She likes that the surface stays cool to handle also, and overall is very happy with this product design and its operating quality.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try after watching the videos and reading all the positive reviews. I was&lt;br /&gt;a little skeptical at first only because I&#x27;ve tried so many which have never worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only writing this review for people like me who have tried so different products and&lt;br /&gt;are just looking for something that works. THIS IS AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m awful at doing my own hair,so trust me when I say anyone can do this. With normal curling irons,&lt;br /&gt;I would always get this crimp at the end that of each piece that would look so bad!&lt;br /&gt;Plus the amount of hair spray I had to use just to keep the curl was so much that my hair would never&lt;br /&gt;look good curled. If you&#x27;ve had any one of these problems or a similar problem with curling irons, I&lt;br /&gt;swear this will solve everything, I&#x27;m obsessed with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use and if this could solve all my hair problems, I know it will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the curls last all day!You won&#x27;t have to load up on hair spray which is something I love.&lt;br /&gt; I have really thick hair, and it literally took me maybe 7 mins. for my hair to look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this curling iron is that you can actually change the direction of the curl with one push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you the Miraqueen Curling Iron is the best one out there. I really can&#x27;t say enough good things&lt;br /&gt;about this. This has really better then what I expected it to be. All I can say is regardless of what problems&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;ve had with other curling irons you won&#x27;t have it with this, you&#x27;ll be amazed how great your curls look!!</li>
            <li> My wife recently purchased this and asked me to write the review.  She is incredibly happy with this product for a variety of reasons.  My wife has naturally straight hair and likes to curl it often.  She goes through a bunch of different styles, depending on her destination, or her mood that day.  She has ripped through curling irons from several big box stores, and basically thrown them each in the trash after a few uses.  Her biggest complaint has always been that none of them can give her a curl that will hold for any length of time.  She started looking around on line for more expensive models and bought one that was well over $100 dollars.  It worked for about five seconds longer than the cheaper models and then ended up in exactly the same place…the trash.  My wife shops on Amazon all the time and found this curling iron for sale.  She had been reading up on the products, and liked the porcelain chamber and the high heat.  She went for it, and has been very pleased.  This is the first model that did not hit the trash can within the first week. For that fact alone I am grateful.  This product not only made my wife very happy, but it also stopped the financial bleeding for me personally.  I don’t have to buy another curling iron!  Thank you!  Great product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used ceramic because it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair but this curler is one of a kind!  It makes my mornings so much easier.  My thick long hair is extremely difficult to curl. I find that with Miraqueen curling iron I am able to curl my hair with one hand and that is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very quick and automatic. I can set the time and temp, and it basically runs itself. I especially love the rotary function that lets me change the direction of my curls. The curls are clean looking and they last!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to curl my hair using anything else.  It is so lightweight I can take it with me on trips.  It also has a protective heat case so you can put it away right away instead of waiting for it to cool back down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am amazed at how darn easy it is to use!!!</li>
            <li> I saw this curling iron on some YouTube tutorial, and I had to purchase it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use, very smart technology in my opinion, so I am very happy with my purchase&lt;br /&gt;I think every woman has to have this kind of product just because it&#x27;s so convenient :)</li>
            <li> I love it its super easy and fast. It works just like The Curl Secret but way less expensive. I have no complains about, I glade I bought it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend after watching some of the great videos and testimonials. This is the first innovation in curling irons in 20 years that really works. It is really neat and makes curling your hair fun. It automatically sucks your hair inside and curls it according to your settings. This brings hi-tech to the standard low tech curling gear and makes it ultra safe and easy. The price is also right and cheaper than many standard curling irons. It feels very solidly built to last for many years. My girlfriend has used it a couple of times so far when going out on the weekend. The results have been stunning.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! Generally, curling irons just don&#x27;t work on my hair (it&#x27;s so thick!), but this one managed to tame it. I think it&#x27;s the ceramic that really makes the difference, honestly. My hair feels so soft and shiny after using this curling iron and I love it! The LED display is also super cool and leaves all of the second guessing behind. No matter if I want wavy hair or full on curls, this curling iron handles it. The no-tangle cord really makes everything so much easier, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Amazing curler, works just like the miracurl from Babybliss but so much cheaper! My curls last a whole week + and my hair remains beatiful every single day!! Everybody keeps complimenting my locks ^.^ Loving this curler!!</li>
            <li> Got my sister one for her birthday and she was so thrilled! Heats up very fast and seems to handle the multiple tasks very well. I&#x27;ve heard absolutely no complaints and I was quite surprised myself as far as the build quality. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good hair styling device.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!  At first she was skeptical but now she uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is simply amazing. I absolutely love it. My boyfriend bought this for me when my curling iron broke (he broke it) . When I first saw it I was horrified because he knows nothing about curling hair. It was a great choice by him. The curling iron itself is very durable and well made. I also love the LCD screen as it makes it much easier to use. It heats very quickly and has a lot of protection so you don’t get burned. The Curls last for hours and stay put even when you are active. I would recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> I saw this on my sister&#x27;s wishlist on amazon and wanted to get this for her for her birthday since she needed a curling iron for her hair and she loved it. She uses it all the time now it&#x27;s great that she is actually using something i brought her lol. My sister likes how there is a LED display and variations in heat tempertures and timer settings on it. For someone who cares all about her hair this was the perfect gift for my sis and i&#x27;d recommend it to the ladies who are hair obsessed this does the job and is better then a regular curling iron that&#x27;s why i got it for my sis.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best curling iron I have ever owned!  It has made doing my hair before I head to work a breeze.  It feels like I am now able to get about 15 more minutes of sleep in the morning since I got this.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a professional grade iron that has many features.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this curling iron! It gives my hair perfect waves for a beachy style, or I can hold the curls longer for more bouncy curls. It heats up very quick and is easy to use once you get the hang of it. The curls last all day, and I am not going back to my old curling irons ever! Overall, it is a great curling iron and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to curl their hair.</li>
            <li> I curl my hair almost every day, because, honestly, I look about 10 times cuter with it curled. I&#x27;ve tried curlers, foam overnight curlers, standard curling irons, smaller curling irons, and brush irons. (The brush iron actually got caught in my hair, and I had to cut like 4 inches off, it was terrible). This is, by far, the best curling iron, or even the best curling device (curlers and over-night curlers included) I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t tug my hair, like standard curling irons, it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, like smaller ones, it doesn&#x27;t burn me or get stuck, like the brush curling iron, and it doesn&#x27;t take forever, and require that your hair be wet, like overnight curlers. I absolutely love the screen, you can know exactly what temperature it&#x27;s at, which is actually important for what kind of curls you want (longer and bouncier or tighter and more curly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the closest I&#x27;ve ever gotten to professional curls. For everything on the market, this is the absolute best curling iron that you can get. It makes me feel like I&#x27;ve just stepped out of the salon chair, every single time.</li>
            <li> The first thing that attracted to me to this product was the overwhelming number of positive reviews, and the product detail!  I appreciate having as much information as possible before making any purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many similar products, and this is definitely the best in terms of being easy and efficient to use, and creating a style that will stay in place for a long time.  Anything that saves me time styling my difficult hair is a lifesaver.  I can be a bit disorganized in the morning and am usually rushing around to get out on time, so I also really like the auto shut-off feature.  If there is anyone who might dash out and accidentally leave something on, it&#x27;s me.  Finally, I want to also specifically mention the display and controls.  On this iron, they are really well-designed and placed properly.  I&#x27;ve definitely had models with hard to read displays and buttons that are awkward to reach - definitely a nono when trying to wield a hot iron!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the holiday season coming up, I think this would also be a great gift.  Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! I have such thin flimsy hair, it seems like no product or styling product will actually make it stay the way I want it. Withing a few hours it inevitably goes back to blah. This curling Iron heats up very quickly and helps me get the look I want so I can face the day. Best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> My sister has been hair obsessed since she was a child. She has very wavy hair that tends to frizz and she first started her straightening routine at the age of 13. Since then she has become sort of a bona fide hair junkie. She has many curling irons but loves the Miraqueen the best. It allows her to achieve salon quality results in a matter of minutes, especially when pressed for time. My sister is no longer a 13 year old girl but a grown career driven woman and buying this product for her months ago, she says has been her best gift yet. Achieve flawless waves and curls with the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron. Be sure to get yours today!</li>
            <li> I had purchased one of these curling iron for my girlfriend birthday, 2 months ago, and I have ever since gotten some pretty good compliments on how much she loves this thing. For her it comes all down to time-saving, ease of use and having it done effectively without the head-ache that usually follows use of a typical curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made it stand out for me, was its electronically intuitive LED screen- for the timer, temperature control, and curl direction display. It works pretty well and simplifies hair curling to a new degree.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen professional curling iron is DEFINITELY one of the BEST professional-grade curling irons on the market! First of all, it heats up faster than any other curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used, and the foam protection cover protects your hair while you&#x27;re using it. The control buttons are easy to use to find the heat setting that works best for you. I personally feel that the swivel cord makes maneuvering so much easier and the digital LCD screen conveniently helps me keep track of my settings. I also appreciate the fact that I never have to worry about forgetting to turn it off when I&#x27;m done, due to the automatic shut-off feature, and the durability of this curling iron is nothing short of awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally recommend this curling iron to anyone and everyone, regardless of your hair type. I have thick hair and my hair is usually dyed, and this curling iron is better for my hair type than any other curling iron I&#x27;ve used before. It has several different settings for all different types of hair, so you can easily find a settings (or settings) right for your hair type. All in all, if you are looking for an EXCELLENT professional-grade curling iron, then the Miraqueen professional curling iron is DEFINITELY the best way to go!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helpful and convenient</li>
            <li> I quickly used this product this morning.  It works!!  I bought it to use on my daughter and I think it will be perfect for her.  I won&#x27;t have to worry about burning her, which is really nice.  I even think her dad will be able to curl her hair.  This machine is that easy to use.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because your hair can get caught if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Just buy a good small curling iron. I have thin hair and I could work the product very easily, however you could only take very tiny pieces of hair and even on the highest setting and the longest time the curls were not very tight. After an hour I still was not done and had to go to the doctor. So never finished it. But I feel it is a good concept but they need to improve it. It is not worth the money. I could of gotten the same effect with my curling iron in about 10-15 minutes top and it would of lasted.</li>
            <li> This is a gem of a buy. I read all the reviews and watched the film. It requires thinner strands of hair to be inserted into the wheel otherwise it does jam and the panic button is pushed as you think your hair is stuck in the hair curler. If this happens, just continue to hit the release button, sliding your hair out and all is well. It simply will can&#x27;t handle/ suck in thick strands of hair. I place it on the highest heat, with the maximum time. Very tight curls, like Shirley Temple. Finger them out to loosen them. I can last an entire week with a great loose curl after the one time. I constantly get compliments.&lt;br /&gt;It does not work on short hair and might take a while on very long hair but well with it. The sale price makes it all the more a &#x27;must have&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have really thick long hair. I first tried it from the bottom of my hair and it took maybe 5 inches, it curled nice though. But when I tried it from the middle or top of my hair, it was too much for it. I tried small sections. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with my hair getting stuck. I will be returning this.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has thin hair and she always complains that her hair will just not hold curls for very long. Her birthday was coming up so I searched for curling irons and stumbled across the Miraqueen. I read some of the reviews and decided to take a chance and purchase it for her. She said she would try it out and see how it worked on her hair. I was actually a bit surprised when we out to dinner a couple nights later and she brought up the curling iron. She said she loved her curls and how easy the curling iron was to use. Actually told me I did good. Normally I am not very good at buying gifts. I make her tell me exactly what she wants so I don&#x27;t screw up. She really likes the different heat settings. One of the settings is specifically for thin hair. Evidently her old one did not have these settings. The beeps when using the timer settings are a great touch also. Overall she seems to be very happy with it. The biggest problem before was her curls would not hold and now she says she does not have to curl her hair every day.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a curling iron and came across this online. I was drawn to it because of it&#x27;s ability to adjust settings to maximize the strength of your curls. I have naturally coarse hair and this was perfect for me, i was able to turn up the strength to the right temperature to allow hair to maintain it&#x27;s curls. It lasted longer than what I was used to which is awesome and what was also cool is that the Mariqueen does not damage my hair like my previous irons, which means I can style my hair as often as I want. I would recommend Mariqueen to anyone, all you need to do is read the instructions, after a few tries its easy to maneuver and you&#x27;ll be your own perfessional stylist, heaven knows I was style depraved until I found this secret weapon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It is very easy to use and has all the features I could ever want! Works better than any other curling iron I have ever used. I have very curly hair that is usually very difficult to straighten, but this product gets the job done no problem. I recommend to all!</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use</li>
            <li> If your hair curls easily it may be ok.  Found only about one inch of hair could be curled at a time, pretty fast but didn&#x27;t hold a curl well for my daughter.  CAUTION - there is a sign on the side that states &amp;#34;keep this side towards hair&amp;#34;  that is very important, if you start pulling at a angle your hair will jam in the motor section and be very very difficult to get out.  Also if you pull and put pressure on it while using it your hair will be more straightened than curled.</li>
            <li> Since growing out my hair, I have been searching high and low for something that will allow a curl to stay in my hair.  I have long, medium thickness, layered, straight hair. Hot rollers, steam rollers, plain old ceramic irons.... I tried them all and nothing could create an all over consistant curl that would stay longer than 15 minutes. I heard great things about the conair curl secret- someone wrote a review that they didnt even need to use hairspray or hair product to get their curls to stay- but was hesitant to drop $100 on a curling iron, especialy when everything I had been trying wasnt working. Then I came across the Miraqueen Iron that is very simialar to the curl secret, but with a few pluses and $20 less. I decided to give it a try and am very happy that I did. The Miraqueen paired with a good hair product (I use Catwalk Curls Rock Amplifier) has been amazing!! I have been using it for over a week now and I have beautiful, look like they were just curled curls for 12+ hours. One time I used more product than I usually do, and I had awesome relaxed curl/waves the next day after I had slept on them...My husband even commented on how I had sexy bed head ;) I did try the iron without any product or hair spray and was not impressed. I think if I had shorter hair it probably could of happened, but with my length weighing on the curls, it was not meant to be.</li>
            <li> I have hair that can be categorized in the following keywords: Asian, Korean, long, thick, slighty wavy, on its way to being coarse, couldn&#x27;t hold a curl to save my life.  It took me 2 hours to curl one side of my head with my regular curling iron (of a good name brand) and the curls...they unraveled within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in lieu of going to a salon that would have taken 3 hours out of my wedding day.  On the first try, I managed to do my entire head within an hour and half (I watched the videos many time before attempting).  It held out using texturing spray and the stiffest hairspray I could find.  It turned out to be unnecessary: I was in the pouring rain, wearing hair-covering veil, but I thought it looked pretty good for the reception even after being drenched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, never had curls that lasted more than an hour without the help of a perm.  This did it.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. I have thick wavy medium length hair. It curls easy with a curling iron but my hair is so heavy the curls die after about a hour. Not only do my curls stay all day with this, but it&#x27;s still curly the next day and only needs a little touch up. I have it got it stuck a few times. Don&#x27;t try and put too much hair in it, make sure there are no snarles. Also make sure you don&#x27;t have any stray hairs from other parts of your head or they will get tangled.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and was nervous about using this but went ahead and tried it out.  It worked ok not much curl at first so I turned up the heat and length of time to 12 seconds.  Then it sucked in my hair and it was immediately caught.  Well you hold the device to your head and it sucks up your hair so it was stuck in a position that makes it difficult to get your hair out.  I tried the release button and nothing.  I unplugged it since it was also 450 degrees cooking my hair.  It was very difficult to try to get my hair out.  I had my husband come and help and he said there is just no way, there is no where to just take it apart in this situation either then it also being so hot to touch to try.  After about 20 minutes we were able to free my hair but I lost at least 3-4&amp;#34; in the chamber and fried ends another 3&amp;#34; up from it literally breaking off from being fried and trying to release it.  Now I am sure people will say I must have done it wrong but I assure you I did it as directed and that is what happened to me.  I think longer hair has its challenges.  Given that it has already eaten and destroyed some of my hair I am not going to gamble that it won&#x27;t do it again.  It twists your hair up and then from what I saw winds it around something.  It is not as easy for maybe shorter hair people to release the button and the hair unwinds out.  Some of my hair was back past the foam roller caught as well which was pulling and very tight.  I would like curly hair from time to time but I don&#x27;t want to go through that situation again.</li>
            <li> Love, love ,love this! Easy to use! Great product!</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair. Curls never hold this was awesome and curls look great!!! Also super easy to use. Took me 15 mins to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> Wow... this really works. I saw, what the Miraqueen Professional Hair Curler with the Ceramic Curling Chamber can do at a friend&#x27;s house. She looked fabulous! So I had to have one also, and I could hardly wait until it was delivered. I am so tired of my straight long hair, though others always tell me, it&#x27;s beautiful anyway. It finally arrived and out of the box it came and I tried it out. The results were as fabulous as my  friend&#x27;s ! Long lasting wonderful curls in no time - divide off a strand and feed the hair in the curling chamber and after just a few second--- there they are, beautiful, shiny, glamorous curls!&lt;br /&gt;I have not used my old, cumbersome curling iron since I got the Miraqueen Hair Curler. Why go through all the bother, when this new device makes curling my hair so simple? It is really revolutionary and I love the way my curls last all through the evening even when I dance, perspire and am really wild. It is exactly, what a fun loving woman like me needs to stay beautiful all through the day and all through the night. Those curls are really lasting and people ask me, how I manage to always look so glamorous. Come to think of it, that&#x27;s just how I found out about the  Miraqueen Hair Curler to start with. I am so grateful, my friend told me about it, and now I just wanted to pay it forward and let you know about it. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Miraqueen Hair curler.</li>
            <li> This Miraqueen Professional curling iron is fantastic. I got it for my girlfriend for her birthday and she can&#x27;t stop talking about it. She is very particular about her hair both for her job and the acing she does on the weekend. It is working perfect for her whether in the office or preparing for a performance! The three heat levels and four timing settings work for all the different styles she needs it to. I love the auto power off so it is not left on in the bathroom. I cannot say enough good things about this Miraqueen product!</li>
            <li> All i could say was YESSSSS :-)! I finally found a curling iron that not only works but holds curl. I have thick long hair and my problem is i could never find a curling iron that would hold my curls for more than 15 mins. The fact that i curl my hair that morning  before going to work and made it to dinner that evening with my curls still in tact was amazing to me. To think i have the options of changing the setting blows my mind. Oh and lets not talk about how quick it takes to make the perfect curl. I no longer have to get irritated about my hands hurting from holding a curling iron so long.Ladies and gents if your looking for your next best friend than this is it! don&#x27;t waste time get yours today!</li>
            <li> All I know is my girlfriend&#x27;s hair looks great and she&#x27;s always talking about it (idk what she&#x27;s sarong and what it mean,  iI don&#x27;t speak hair products)</li>
            <li> amazing i brought this for my girlfriend and she absolutley loved it would recommend this to all! 5/5</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is a must have product if you’re one of those girls who loves adding some playful curls to your daily hairstyle. From the ease of use to the curls that last up to four days, this product has focused specialization, curls, and definitely doesn’t disappoint in this arena!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few big differences about this curing iron that really made it stand out. The first is the technology that they included in both safety and most importantly, hair health.  The Miraqueen Curling Iron contains tourmaline ceramic technology, which not only protects the hair but also helps the curls to last longer while locking in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you out there who, like me, aren’t exactly the most functional person in the morning, the safety features are a huge advantage of the Miraqueen Curing Iron. A foam layer on the top of the heading chamber helps to prevent any burns to the skin. In addition to the foam layer, there is a rubber protective layer raised from the heated surface so that the heated part of the iron never touches skin. The Miraqueen Curing Iron also has a plastic base so it doesn’t get hot to hold like some curling or flat irons out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The easy to use LED display gives you any option you could possibly need in the most functional setup possible for perfect curls. You can set the temperature up to 450 degrees as one of three heat settings and four different timed settings to choose from depending on the look and style of the curl you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beeping timer helps you to make each curl exactly the same each time as well as protects against burning your hair if you happen to lose track of time. The easy release trigger makes the whole process extremely easy and the curls last up to four days; saving you time and giving you a “high maintenance” look for several days with little to no maintenance necessary with the Miraqueen Curling Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another compelling featureI really enjoy is the 360-degree swivel cord, which helps to keep from becoming tangled while styling your hair. Throw in the one-year warranty, and I couldn’t recommend a better curling iron than the Miraqueen Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron! The great ratings agree!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic curler.  I gave it to my daughter who has waist length hair.  She doesn&#x27;t normally curl her hair with curling wands but just ties it up at night and lets it curl with the rubber band as it dries. However, when she tried it she was very excited and said she would keep it and use it.  We tried it on every one in the house and we were all walking around with beautiful curly hair.  Its a wonderful thing to have to make sexy hair quickly.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!! THIS PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! I WOULD DEFINITELY WATCH THE YOU TUBE VIDEO ON HOW TO USE THIS MACHINE PRIOR TO FIRST USE!! IN ADDITION USING 1 INCH SECTIONS IS A BIT OF A STRETCH, START SMALLER AND WORK YOUR WAY UP IF ITS EVEN POSSIBLE DUE TO YOUR HAIR TYPE!!</li>
            <li> Love this curler. The led screen is so helpful and the auto turn off is a lifesaver. I have some crazy wavy hair and have tried so many different products... This one finally works!  The curls last a long time and look great! Easy to use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many curling irons before and I was skeptical about using this one simply for the way it looks and is shaped. It was something I was not accustomed to. But after reading a few reviews on it, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I must say I am not disappointed with this curling. It has quite a few features that I love. I can set the timer and it beeps when the curlers are ready for use. I especially like the auto shut off, as there are times I leave the house and can&#x27;t remember if I did turn it off, so the auto shut off feature gives me a sense of security. There are various head levels and an LCD monitor. For my  hair, when I curled it with the Miraqueen Curling Iron, the curls last me a few days. They were tight which made them long lasting but the curls were also bouncy which I like. I like that I can style it and wear it for at least a week in various styles with the same curls.  The Miraqueen Curling iron also seems to be good quality so i&#x27;m sure it will last me quite a few years. I like being creative with my curls now that I have found an easy way to curl my hair.  Like I&#x27;ve said I&#x27;ve been through a number of curling irons, so far this is the easiest to handle and best one on the market.</li>
            <li> Does not work and tangles and pulls hair.  Had to return it.</li>
            <li> perfect for a nice curl</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a birthday present. This was not the brand she wanted; she wanted the Conair Brand, Infiniti Pro; however I thought this was a better curling Iron as it will roll in both directions and heats to 450. My daughters comments were &amp;#34;it works; I&#x27;m just going to have to get use to using it as I was familiar with the Conair (she has been using a friends Infiniti Pro). I believe this has more bells and whistles and great written verified buyer reviews ; lets hope it does not fail or I&#x27;m in hot water!  I can&#x27;t comment on how the curl holds as I haven&#x27;t seen my daughter&#x27;s hair after she used it.  Sorry I can&#x27;t write a better review.</li>
            <li> Magnificent device, it heats up rather quick so no fussing about in the morning waiting for it to heat up but it also made my course hair well curled and seems to hold a new bounce to it. A wonderful device of that there is no doubt, so if you are looking for a curling iron, I would suggest this one and avoid some old metal rod that will burn you up.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this curling iron. It has such amazing features. My husband got this for me and I was surprised at how many settings it has for different curls and I adore him for it. The screen that tells you everything you need to know and the trigger are what makes it so easy to use and so worth it. If you are reading this, GET IT, and you will not regret it. As long as you follow the directions you will not end up with any problem. When my husband  first saw this he said he did not now wether to get it or not, but I wish he would have just gotten it because it truly works miracles with your hair.</li>
            <li> When I saw how this looked, I was in a state of shock and disbelief. There&#x27;s no way this thing could work, I thought to myself. But the description hooked me and I had to see it in action for myself. And, whoa. Full stop. This thing is a DREAM curling iron.    My hair is straight, limp, and does nothing despite how much I beg it. That was before the Miraqueen Pro iron got hold of it. This iron somehow manages to coax my hair into doing the impossible and the results are stunning.    Most of my friends are jealous and some even want to pay me to do their hair. The best of all? This iron isn&#x27;t difficult to use. It looks like it would be, but isn&#x27;t. Love. A million and one stars. Just love.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing curling iron! I love the fact that it automatically shuts off, and has a led screen that tells me what way i&#x27;m curling my hair as well as the temperature! This is the best one I&#x27;ve had and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for the most efficient and safest way to get your hair to look like it was freshly done at a salon!</li>
            <li> Works very well. You have to pay attention to the thickness of hair you grab when you use it. If you grab a thick strand it won&#x27;t work. I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s hair and worked very well.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product. it’s so easy to use. I love that it has different heat levels and timer settings. It’s ceramic so it slides through my hair without pulling or tugging, protecting it from damage. Also, I’m a very forgetful person and can sometimes be scatter-brained so I absolutely love the automatic one-hour shut off feature JUST IN CASE I do ever happen to forget to turn it off so I don’t burn the counter or in that case (the HOUSE) down, lol and I like that there is a foam protection cover for this reason as well. It heats up so quickly and I don’t have to wait forever because I want to be able to use it when I’M READY to use it. I like that I can choose what kind of curls I want because I prefer tight, spiral curls and my daughter prefers loose curls. The ready light makes it easy to know when it’s ready to be used. I’m also very happy to hear that it has a one year warranty in case (knock on wood) anything EVER does go wrong with it. The Miraqueen is definitely by far, MY FAVORITE curling iron thus far. Thank you Miraqueen! :)</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she looks great! Her old curling iron stopped working, so I surprised her with this for her birthday a few weeks ago. Out of all of the curling irons I found, I chose this one because the price was reasonable and it had a lot of features that most of the others did not have. Unlike most of the other curling irons out there, it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair because it uses ceramic heating technology. It also got much hotter (450 degrees Farenheit) than most of the other models. So far, my wife loves it and she looks great. I can really tell the difference with this item because her hair looks so beautiful. She looks like she just left a beauty parlor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister.  She loves to put her granddaughters&#x27; hair in ringlets and she thought this would be a great way to do it. She told me it was great!  She was able to get both girls&#x27; hair curled in about 15 min.  Much faster than with a regular curling iron.  Both girls have very fine hair that is just below the shoulder.  Normally it takes a ton of product and a long time to get curls that last maybe 5 minutes.  With this curling wand the girls had curls that lasted all day.  My sister did the curling.  the girls are only 3 and 4 years old. This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Designed with the heating inside of the chambers, there is no burning of the hands involved. All the heating and curling action occurs within the head of the device, leaving the outsides cool to touch. Awesome, no more &amp;#34;hickey&amp;#34; burns!  Ever feel like your arms are screaming at you after only doing half of your hair? MiraQueen is also light and easy to grasp, making those accidental drops less likely to happen and reduce fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;With automatic curling as the main star, curling could not be any faster! Your hair zips into the heating chambers, and after mere seconds, your perfect curls will come bouncing out. No more manual wrapping of the hair around old school curling irons! This is the new age and new technology!</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this iron for my birthday and I was hesitant to use it at first as my hair is usually hard to work with and I have to be careful with what I use on it but I am so glad he got it for me! I absolutely LOVE it! I have super thick, course hair and it gets tangled and ratty very easily but when I use this, I have no problems what so ever. It&#x27;s quick and easy to use which as a mom of 2 babies, that&#x27;s very important to me as I&#x27;m always on the go. One of the things I love about it is that if something is not right, it beeps 3 times to let you know. It&#x27;s true to color as well! I&#x27;ve had this item for about 6 months now and have used it SEVERAL times and have had zero issues and it has held up strong. My sisters are always asking how I get my curls so perfect so I bought a few more for them for Christmas! I look forward to using this for many more years to get the perfect curls I love!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these for my daughters--one a freshman in college and the other a sophomore in high school--and they love it! It&#x27;s not very often that as a Dad I find something that they both really like, but a friend recommended it to me and they were totally right. My daughters have long straight hair and the Miraqueen gives them really beautiful curls. Now my wife wants one for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!!! Just a heads up it is pretty heavy and my thumb started to hurt, but it&#x27;s well worth it! I still have to figure out what to do when my hair tangles in cuz it happens, but I&#x27;m sure once I learn more about it I&#x27;ll learn how to get it out or hopefully just not have it happen again! My curls still looked good even after sleeping on it! Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife as a random present as she had been discussing curling her hair. She LOVES it. She&#x27;s looking more beautiful than ever and to be completely honest I think she&#x27;s taking far less time getting ready to go out lol. I&#x27;m thinking its because she&#x27;s knows how great she&#x27;s looking a whole lot sooner. Guys buy this for your lady and you&#x27;ll have a happier wife or girlfriend I promise you. Ladies you&#x27;ll love the ease of use and the speed at which it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Amazingly The Best! Why 5 stars? Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st &gt; The Rapid Beeping Sound that tells you when to start and when to stop. Amazingly Smart. I just relax and wait for it to beep to the timer I set and whoa-la, done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd &gt; The Three Timer Setting! What? Oh yeah! you can set it to three different setting from 8, 10, or 12 seconds, depending how tight or loose you want your hair curls. Amazingly Easy! Set it to the timer you want, wait for the beep to finish and boo-ya! you got what you wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd &gt; The Swivel Cord. No more turning around or switching from side to side just to get to the hair side you want done. The rotating base will do it itself, freely following whenever you turn. And what do you call that? Amazingly Accessible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th &gt; The Rubber Protector. Why not? I get burned every time I use a curling iron but with Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, it is Amazingly Safe! It has a raised rubberized layer that ensures my skin will not get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5th &gt; I think this is the most important feature, the Automatic Shut Off. I am forgetful and always in a hurry, and this Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron make my hair and life easier and safer. It will turn off automatically whenever my brain forgets to shut it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh wait, is that 5 stars already? I could still go on and on to 7 stars but hey, why don&#x27;t you try it yourself and see how amazing it is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one word for this product, AMAZING!</li>
            <li> OMG!! I was SOOOO skeptical about this curling iron!!!! I honestly thought that I would be returning it, but NO WAY I am sending this back!!! It is the ONLY curling iron that I have EVER used that actually WORKS! I have VERY fine and thin hair, a regular curling iron just won&#x27;t curl my hair, it just falls out. Even hot rollers don&#x27;t work.  Even if I do manage to get even a little curl to it, it will fall out within 30 minutes and that is even with hair spray!!! Not this iron though!! It does take a bit of practice to get a feel for something this bulky and I did get it hung in my hair once but it pulled right out and most of the time it lets you know if something is not right by beeping a whole bunch and unlocking itself. Seriously, this is the BEST thing I have bought for curling hair! NO DISAPPOINTMENTS with this miracle curling iron, IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> Works as well as the more expensive similars.</li>
            <li> I anxiously awaited for my Miraqueen Curler to arrive. Shipping was remarkably quick, so it arrived even sooner than anticipated. This curler is unlike any other hair product I have ever used. The technology and functionality of this iron is really amazing.&lt;br /&gt; One of the parts I love about this iron (despite the finished product it gives me) is the LCD screen that displays the temperature, timer and status of the curls. This makes curling even easier. I no longer have to guess if everything is going to be cohesive and blend because the timer manages that for me.&lt;br /&gt; Never before have I had such consistent and beautiful curls. The timer and temperature settings allow me to achieve the exact desired curl tightness that I am looking for. Not to mention the curls/waves are absolutely effortless to create. Not having to wrap and hold each strand makes all the difference. I love that this curler took the “work” out of having to do my hair and left me with perfectly sculpted curls!&lt;br /&gt; I would absolutely recommend this curler to anyone. Don’t let a new style or technology of curler intimidate you. This product really is the most simple curler to use, and it delivers a fantastic finished product. I’ll never go back to the standard wand/iron again now that I have tried the Miraqueen Curler. It quickly became one of my favorite beauty products!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron! I have really thick hair and the curling iron does wonders. My curls are perfect and I feel confident about my hair! I was even able to get some of my friends to purchase the curling iron as well. This curling iron is super easy to use. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I love it!! I never thought I can curl my entire head by myself. It is so easy to use that if I can do it, anybody can do it.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Curling Iron works great. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it takes some practice to get the look you want. It&#x27;s a little awkward to use at first (or maybe I&#x27;m just uncoordinated).</li>
            <li> This works great on my daughters thick long hair.  Every time I curl her hair with this she gets several compliments.</li>
            <li> She loves it. And looked like Pam Anderson for our xmas party. Seriously</li>
            <li> LOVE IT...works great.  I would however recommend you get the detangler and pay attention to how much hair you put in curler.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and the recipient loves it.  I&#x27;ve seen the results, curly hair when there was none.  She especially likes the feature that lets you curl in both directions.  Nice features over the Conair and less bad reviews about hair getting stuck</li>
            <li> My favorite this curling iron. The quality of curls is awesome and it has a really sophisticated mode of functioning. Really flexible and has given me the perfect iron.I’m satisfied in this result. So i recommended.</li>
            <li> huge dissapointment. temperature and time settings are not good enough, it does not curl properly even with very thin strands of hair. I will need to get a different brand of product, this one did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I love this curling machine.  Some of the reviews showed issues with hair getting tangled in the device; but I found it only to be a problem when I tried to use a swatch of hair that was too wide.  But the great thing was that when it did get &amp;#34;caught&amp;#34;, I just unplugged the device and slowly pulled out the strands very carefully and had no issue with getting my hair untangled.  The whole issue was my fault and I&#x27;m getting better at selecting the proper amount of hair and have had no issues whatsoever.  I really do love the way it curls and stays curled until I the next time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this thing! Works great and fast!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. I have long very thick hair so it takes while to curl it all but it is that way with any curling iron for me. This is just like advertised. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!! Curls last all day! No need for too much hair spray.</li>
            <li> I guess I can&#x27;t say much for the product, because I never got to use it.  The product came out of the box and plastic full of water spots, greasy finger prints and had blonde hairs stuck in it, and hanging over it. I have RED hair, so obviously nothing resembling mine. There was quite a bit of hair IN the chamber as well, and I was so turned off by this product and how it came to me, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do anything but return it and not bother reordering, because I&#x27;m afraid of what I might get.  Hopefully they did not resell it to another unsuspecting buyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in the first place because a friend of mine has this and curled her hair BEAUTIFULLY. Maybe I should borrow hers, because I at least know where the hair came from....</li>
            <li> This is the first curling iron I have bought in many years as my hair will not hold a curl. After trying my sisters this Christmas I was amazed by how well the curl held!! The ease of use (once you figure it out) makes curling your hair a much quicker process than &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; curling irons. So far I have seen it work well on fine, dry and coarse hair!  I do have a warning...Be sure to put your hair in correctly or it may get tangled and stuck. I had to cut a small amount of my hair off during my first use as I did not properly place my hair. The side with the buttons should be facing your head! After my first fiasco (totally my fault) I have had no problems and my curls stay for hours without any type of spray holding them! Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend said she wanted this for christmas. I purchased the Miraqueen and she absolutely loved it. She says this is the best curling iron + curling wand online. There are 3-4 different heat settings for optimal heat depending on your preference. One of the greatest features is the auto-off switch, because she always leaves things on. She also mentioned the option to control the curl direction.    She said this is the most reliable curler shes ever purchased.    Overall she was extremely pleased with this and recommends this to all her friends.</li>
            <li> Love how I can create loose, medium or tight curls with the same curling iron. I don&#x27;t have to buy 3 curling irons to get different looks. The longer I hold it on my hair, the tighter the curls get. With my old curling iron, I was always worried if I was keeping it on too long and burning my hair. With the MiraQueen, you hear a beep when your hair is done and ready to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also not the best at wrapping my hair around the curling iron. Those pesky ends are constantly slipping out. This curling iron has something called &amp;#34;Automatic Curling.&amp;#34; Your hair is sucked up into the heating chamber so you don&#x27;t have to worry about winding strands of hair around the wand. Best Christmas present ever!</li>
            <li> After 23 years of pin straight hair and no curling iron to help me, for the first time in my life I was able to curl my hair and have it HOLD for 24 hours. I have crazy thick and long hair. It worked so well, I almost cried I was so excited. I have tried every curling product on the market, and this is the ONLY one that has worked for me. Seriously, if you have a hard time curling your hair, take it from someone who has never been able to curl their hair in 23 years. Don&#x27;t look any further. Buy it. Now.</li>
            <li> I just got mine in the mail today. I went straight to the bathroom and curled my hair. I absolutely love love love it.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my grand daughter for Christmas.  She loves it.  Age 12 and uses it frequently.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, and I was so excited when it first came in. I read the reviews here carefully, and usually the reviews here don&#x27;t let me down. I did notice that a lot of reviews did not have the \\&quot;verified purchase\\&quot; next to the review---and also, a lot of reviews have been done in a very short time---which did make me wonder for a bit about the validity. However, I purchased it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, not colored, and very straight hair that is a little past my shoulders. Here are the reasons I do not care for this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Time:&lt;br /&gt;It will only take a very small section of hair at time, which means that this will take a long time. Longer than a curling iron and hot rollers. If you try to give it any more than the very small section, it will give the warning beeps that there is too much hair. Thankfully, it is easy to release hair (so my fear of hair getting tangled and stuck did not happen).&lt;br /&gt;2. Lasting Power:&lt;br /&gt;I tried this with the hairspray sprayed on first (like the video review) and without. Now my hair is difficult with holding a curl. It is pin straight naturally. However, the curls died off much quicker than what happens with my hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;3. Damage:&lt;br /&gt;I put this on the lowest temperature setting, but it&#x27;s still very hot. This is why it can curl in 8 seconds. When I used hairspray first, similar to the video review for this produce, I could hear a sizzling noise. I wouldn&#x27;t think this would be helpful for hair. Even a good heat protectant won&#x27;t be able to help that. When I lost the curl from this in a few hours, my hair seemed dry and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am not a fan and returning. Maybe it works on some hair types far better---as it seemed to for the video review. I really wish it did on mine! I&#x27;m going to stick to hot rollers. Hot rollers are not as fun as a device like this could be, but I find them very efficient as I can put makeup on while my hair is curling.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am bad with hair. I mean REALLY bad. All my life I&#x27;ve shied away from curling it because I end up burning myself, I fumble around with the curling iron for 20-30 minutes only to end up with a partially curled hair style that lasts a few hours. I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of how to videos and Pinterest  instructional. As soon as I look in the mirror, my hands get all catawompus. I&#x27;m a mother of a toddler and I don&#x27;t have much time or patience to fiddle with my hair so I basically have three daily hair styles I stick with. Down, ponytail, and half ponytail. Don&#x27;t judge me! Then comes the MIRAqueen!!! So this is love! It&#x27;s so easy a child could go it. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s possible to burn yourself (short of intentionally sticking your finger down inside the heating chamber), it takes me between 5-10 minutes, and my curls last ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten three,  maybe four other people to buy one. The number one question they have when I show them how it works is, &amp;#34;will it eat my hair?&amp;#34;. The answer is, no. It recognizes when you add too much and will beep to notify you and then uncoil. If you watch videos on YouTube you can not only see how it works but see how it reacts when jammed.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person it was purchased for just loves it - easy to use even on very thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> I REALLY Love this! I was skeptical because of the price...but i bought it and love it. Makes my hair look AMAZING for 2 days, easy to use, and compared to other similar curlers this was actually a great price.  I recommend it a lot to friends.</li>
            <li> Perfect curls everytime.</li>
            <li> Did not curl hair...very disappointed...will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Returned.</li>
            <li> This was pretty bad. It curled my shorter hair just fine but tangled up my long extensions and pretty much ripped a whole chunk of hair out :(</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy this is to use &amp; how incredible the results are!  I have medium to thick hair &amp; it&#x27;s a few inches past my shoulders, so it takes some SERIOUS time for me to curl if I put myself up to it, which isn&#x27;t too often.  It looks awesome when it is curled, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold too long in my hair when I do it &amp; I&#x27;ve had my hairdresser show me multiple times, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this after watching a few Youtube videos &amp; reading some of the reviews on Amazon.  I got it a week ago &amp; I&#x27;ve used it once &amp; it took me roughly 30-35 minutes to curl my entire head the first time using it. That incudes blow drying my hair as well, which takes me @ least 10 minutes.  If you watch a video on Youtube, you don&#x27;t even need to read the instructions, but basically you have to know to adjust the heat according to your hair type.  I used a medium heat setting &amp; I selected 10 seconds for the curl time (8 lowest/12 highest).  Also you can select left, right, or alternate, which is the direction your curls will fall.  I will personally always keep it on the alternate setting because I think the curls look better &amp; make your hair look fuller that way. Also, you CANNOT burn yourself, which I&#x27;m famous for with curling irons. :(  The device beeps @ you if you try putting too much hair in it, so don&#x27;t panic if that happens &amp; just release the lever &amp; try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this product is amazing &amp; exceeded my expectations.  My hair held the curls for 3 days, which sounds gross, but it&#x27;s actually  awesome because I don&#x27;t like washing my hair everyday because it keeps it healthier with just 3-4 washes per week. Totally worth the money &amp; I would highliy recommend!! *PS: My profile picture is what my hair looked like after using this fabulous product. :)</li>
            <li> This is a really cool product! I was super hesitant because it was more expensive than I prefer to spend on a curling device but it&#x27;s been worth the money so far! I really like that it has different settings so you can customize the intensity of the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little heavy but you get used to the weight after awhile. There is definitely a learning curve to this product. I did get my hair tangled a couple of times trying to curl either too much hair or if I didn&#x27;t brush it out enough. I think if you follow the instructions, you should get perfect curls every time! It does get easier the more you do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten so many compliments on my hair! This was a great purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the option to have your curls go left, right, or automatic which alternates between the 2. I love the automatic features I almost always use this one because it gives it more of a natural look, as opposed to the &amp;#34;curling iron&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that you had an option to turn the volume up or down on the beeping. It&#x27;s super helpful when curling your hair but I feel bad for my husband early mornings when I&#x27;m getting ready and all he can hear is my beeping :) (this is a very minor issue but thought it was worth noting!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product it is really great.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this curling iron as one of my girlfriends Christmas presents. She has really thick hair so normally when she uses curling irons her curls won&#x27;t last for more than half a day. During the unboxing she was a bit skeptical about it working because of how thick her hair is but as soon as she turned it on and it sucked in her hair like a vacuum and was ready to curl she knew it was better than any traditional curling iron. The Miraqueen curling iron works so well that her curls last a full day and even through the night. There&#x27;s 3 heat levels and 4 timer settings so she can have a different style of curl whenever she wants to, And The automatic power shutoff switch is a life saver for when she&#x27;s running late for work and forgets to unplug it from the outlet.&lt;br /&gt;This was the perfect gift to get thank you Miraqueen for the excellent product.</li>
            <li> Did not at all wasted money</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have shoulder length, very straight, fine hair but lots of it. The product works great and the curl actually not only stays in all day, but the next day it just needs a little touch-up and it still looks good. It is easy to use and it lets you know if you are using too much hair. I have read other reviews that have said their hair has gotten caught, but I don&#x27;t see how when it alerts you and stops working if you are using incorrectly. It is not as quick as they say to curl your whole head when you have lots of hair, but it is well worth it. I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Superior features over the other available variants.</li>
            <li> omg this product really IS a MiRAcurlll lol. its amazing.  i have never been able to curl my hair, and it makes beautiful curls with my thick black hair. and its very time efficient, and makes curling my hair fun.</li>
            <li> This is the best &amp;#34;curling iron&#x27; I have ever used!!!  The only problem I had was figuring out how to use it....the directions are not clear about putting the hair into the machine.  I watched a video on You Tube and then using the Miraqueen was so easy.&lt;br /&gt;This is a terrific product!!  Massive curls and they last several days with no touch up.</li>
            <li> Great, great, great you should buy it, you Will never ever regret,wonderful curler. 10 stars</li>
            <li> This thing is awesommmme!  I have long, layered hair.  It gives perfect curls, or even just waves if you want.  A lot quicker than a curling iron, too!  My 11 year old daughter and I have a lot of fun with this!  Also.. thank you for the super fast shipping!  Came sooner than I thought. :D</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it absolutely the best curling iron she has ever had. Wife has had many over the years but finally found one that she is really happy with and says she wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the most expensive one in the market. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best hair curler out there (that I&#x27;ve tried by far) I get so many compliments after using this product</li>
            <li> it doesnt even work on my hair</li>
            <li> I guess there&#x27;s a learning curve to using this machine. But I haven&#x27;t learned yet. Takes me forever (okay, about an hour) to do my whole head. So not worth it. I&#x27;m sure it would be better if I were using it on someone else&#x27;s head. Does make a nice curl.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This item worked great at first. Gave me beautiful curls. But then my hair got stuck and it released it, but after that, IT KEPT ON REWINDING THE HAIR! It stopped curling the hair and immediately started beeping, Even without the hair in the device it would still give a warning beep and rewind.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these for my wife and she absolutely loves it. I must admit, her hair has never looked better.  Ad a family with 5 daughters, the durability is a welcome change to the brands we&#x27;ve been used to</li>
            <li> I love this curler. So far it&#x27;s the only curler that worked for me and my daughters. Really easy and simple to use without the fear of burning yourself. And the curls last for a long time. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is far and above the best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I have long, thick hair with fine texture.  It&#x27;s naturally a little wavy but has never held a curl.  Usually what happens is this: I fight for hours trying to get my hair to curl and about 30 minutes after I finish my hair is straighter than it was when I began.  With the Miraqueen I get beautiful, bouncy, and shiny curls that last.  For an every day curl I use the 10 second time on the lowest heat and use no product.  The result is soft and classy without looking overdone.  If I want an amped up night look I just have to up the time and heat and add a little hairspray.  On the second day I can just brush out my hair and I have those soft pretty day curls!  There is absolutely nothing difficult about using this machine.  Just follow the directions and be patient at first while you learn how much hair you need to put in and how smooth it should be.  Once you get used to it (it doesn&#x27;t take that long) you can fly through the process and it&#x27;ll look better each and every time you do it.  I&#x27;m so pleased with my purchase!  I recommend it to all of my friends and use my Miraqueen to do their hair as often as I get so they can see how amazing it is for themselves.  Even my husband loves to watch me curl my hair and has asked to try curling my hair himself a couple times because it &amp;#34;looks so cool&amp;#34;.  Haha.  Buy this...you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> it really works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> It does create great curls, no doubt about it.  But I only gave it four stars because it is very easy to get your hair tangled in it and very hard to get it out when you do.  However, I did not lose any hair and just had to practice at making sure I only used very small sections of hair.  It took me over an hour to curl my hair so not a fast process at all but I imagine I will get faster with practice.</li>
            <li> Love the curls and ease of use!</li>
            <li> My two girls think it is the best thing in the world</li>
            <li> My hair NEVER took or held a curl before I got this product!!! Now it not only curls beautifully, but it holds for days with no special product or hair spray (ewwww) in my hair. I am still amazed. Every day amazed! I can get tight or loose curls and in either direction !  And it takes no time at all. Compliments abound!!  Great holiday hair or every work day hair! And my hair never gets stuck in it , it won&#x27;t allow it!  I can go on all day about how good it is. But you must try it yourself! You will LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> I never curl my hair because I&#x27;m terrible at it! But this makes it so easy! A+++++</li>
            <li> The pink is a god awful pepto bismol puke pink. Fortunately it broke 5 minutes into using it (I put too much hair into it and it beeped and spit my hair out - then never took up hair again). I returned it, got a quick refund, then ordered the all-black one. Much better looking and no problems so far. It has beeped to tell me that I have too much hair it in many times and hasn&#x27;t broken yet. It gives me a more natural, playful curl than a curling iron. I use the setting that alternates the curling direction. I get compliments frequently. Everyone thought I got a new haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very short hair, cut jut below my chin, with heavy layering. The shortest pieces on top are about 4-5 inches long. At the bottom the hair is maybe 3 inches long. I put it right up to my head and get a really good curl out of it. At the bottom it curls just enough to keep it from looking like curled hair over straight hair. I can make it loose or tight, depending on the settings I use. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is because for whatever reason I cannot get it to give a nice curl on the parts in front, to frame my face. I&#x27;m not sure what it is I&#x27;m doing wrong, but I figure it shouldn&#x27;t be this difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally wavy hair with thick strands that usually has a hard time holding a curl. What helps me is to put in some Crew Fiber (men&#x27;s product) in when my hair is wet. Just a SMALL amount. Dry naturally or with a hair dryer. The curl holds better and lasts to some degree all day long. Sometimes I&#x27;ll re-curl a few spots if I need to look better in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a tight, classier, more controlled curl, do use a curling iron. This is great for a casual, fun look. Or a lazy day when you don&#x27;t want to do a lot of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After 6 months of very frequent use (practically daily) it is still going strong. Better yet, it doesn&#x27;t kill my hair like my old curling iron. I can use it daily and my hair is still healthy. And it gives such a playful curl I get compliments ALL THE TIME. Just recently at dance class (YES! The curls hold up well in dance even when they&#x27;re 12 hours old already!!) someone commented on how cute my curls were and another woman said Oh yes, she always has the cutest hair! Now I am a 35 year old tired soccer mom so it&#x27;s a big boost to hear such commentary.  :)  I love this curling iron. Ok, it takes some getting used to, so give it a chance.  :)</li>
            <li> If I could give this curling iron 20 stars I would.  The most amazing tool ever to curl hair.  3 different levels to adjust the level of curliness.  I curled my hair 3 days ago and it is still curly.  It tells you when there is too much hair in chamber.  It is idiot proof.  The price is well worth it.  I have 3 daughters and this will get its full use quickly.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Does not damage hair.  Can tangle hair if not used properly. But gives hair great texture.  Recommend watching a tutorial before using.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was hesitant but after watching a few youtube videos and reading some reviews I decided to get it.  I love how easy it is to use although you need to be patient because the pieces of hair need to be pretty small and you have to wait until the last beep (I believe 5 in total)  I have had the hair get stuck about 3 times but that is because I rushed and didn&#x27;t put a small enough piece in or didn&#x27;t lay it in properly.  Curls are nice and stay a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product... works well. It is sturdy and durable, even under use by 2 teenagers!</li>
            <li> It is a great little tool however, if you have a lot of hair as I do, this machine takes too long. You can only in put a little bit of hair at a time. This machine is perfect for women with thin hair. The curl does stay on the entire day and rarely looses it&#x27;s form. It takes a little getting used to in the beginning but after a few times you&#x27;ll get more comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> My hair is not long enough for this to be effective.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron! I have long hair (mostly straight) with thinner strands (but a LOT of them). Curling my hair has been frustrating because A: I have so much hair, B: my hair does not curl that easily and C: I am just not very good at curling it. I was nervous about this because it honestly seemed a little too good to be true. IT&#x27;S NOT. It is so easy and very rarely have I figured out how to curl my with a new device on the first try. You definitely have to get used to the amount of hair you are allowed to use each time but it does not take long to figure out. You also have to get used to the different grip from curling the right side to left (because you have to hold it differently since the same side of the device always has to be the side touching your head) but once again, it came easy to me and these things rarely do. I love the curls. I love the setting options. The nice thing is, the curls might look looser the following day and if you like that, then leave them but if you want to &amp;#34;re-curl&amp;#34; your hair you can do that, OR you can touch up a few pieces. For anyone who hasn&#x27;t been able to master curls, this is the item for you!</li>
            <li> Buyers beware, used this on my daughters hair. It sucked in her hair wrapping it around the motor had to break this curling iron into several pieces to get her out. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 13 year old daughter. Easy for her to use and does a great job curling her straight hair. Curls last all day.</li>
            <li> save your money and get a curling wand instead. It is time consuming and the curls doesn&#x27;t last as long. Worst of all, it takes so much pressure to hold the button in place to curl, that my finger was numb for about 1 week. Not worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES this curling iron! It&#x27;s fast, easy, and makes beautiful curls! I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t create those kinks at the end of the curl. Great purchase, and worth the money!</li>
            <li> This device is great if you want very small tight curls. I don&#x27;t like it. Yes, my hair curled, and the curls held. But it&#x27;s impossible to achieve soft curls. I ended up with hair that looked curly but stringy. Since hair has to be curled in strips of less than half an inch, it took forever to end up with hair that looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in a month. The curls would not combine at all. If you want a few extra tight curls to mix in with softer curls or you want the Shirlet Temple look, it&#x27;s great. The self- curling feature is very cool, but I really  hated the end results. Maybe someone will produce a similar product that produces larger curls. The technology is VERY cool, but the results are very limited.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!  Not only does it do an amazing job of curling your hair the curls last a really long time!!  Even for my daughter whose hair normally goes limp after a few hours had curls last 3 plus days.  IF you follow the directions you will not have a problem with this product.</li>
            <li> Hate to leave a bad review, but even after I brushed my hair very smooth, and was careful to only use small sections of hair, this wrapped up and tangled my hair so badly I thought I was going to have to cut my hair to get it out of the iron.</li>
            <li> Hair was getting caught in the curler.  I was afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> This thing works well for hair challenged people such as myself. Takes longer than a curling iron because you do smaller chunks of hair, but this is what helps my hair hold the curl better. And it is so simply it really requires no real effort or concentration. I use a flat iron on the roots of my hair once I&#x27;m done to help it lay better.</li>
            <li> This curling iron has changed my life!  If only I had purchased one sooner!  I&#x27;ve told everyone I can about this product!  I have a LOT of wavy, unmanageable hair.  Each individual strand is pretty fine, but there are a ton of them.  I was able to curl my whole head in about 20 minutes on my first try and it looked amazing!  I think with time, my speed will increase.  Two days after I first used the iron; I had to go to the doctor for the flu... I had to drag myself in after barely brushing my teeth and I felt terrible.  The doctor came in and commented on how pretty my hair was... TWO DAYS LATER!  I almost laughed but it probably would have hurt.  Thanks Miraqueen for giving me more confidence when leaving the house.  It&#x27;s been a long time since anyone has complimented my hair.  I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this product and I hope it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> WAsn&#x27;t for me but my girlfriend loves it.  It is hassle free and additionally she mentioned that it keeps your hair in good order.  Does not burn like other curlers.  so far she seems to be loving it.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical about this product and others like it. I asked for it as a Christmas present. I have tried it out 4x so far and it actually works. I have long hair down to the middle of my back, sometimes even a little longer than that. My hair does NOT get stuck. The curls come out beautifully. It is a more formal look for me so I haven&#x27;t used it a lot but I love it for holiday&#x27;s and special nights out. It is very much worth the money. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> BEST THING EVER INVENTED!! THIS BAD BOY IS AWESOME... HAD TO SHOW IT TO EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> NOT FOR FINE HAIR, and the curl on this is actually very loose and does not hold more than a few hours.  And forget about brushing out the curl, it just turns into waves.  Maybe if you had really thick hair and a lot of it maybe it would work, but not for the masses in my opinion.  Especially for the price, which is just stupid, better off paying for a CHI Ceramic curling iron.  While it is large and cumbersome to use, which is a drawback, it would get a better review from me if the curls lasted, which they do not.  Also, the curl starts at least 1&amp;#34; away from the scalp, closer to 2&amp;#34; which is another thing I hated about it.  You get a much better curl with just a plain old fashioned curling iron and while this is inventive it has a long way to go to be a good product, right now just a really good idea that needs improvement.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fill my expectation is not as marvelous as it seems. Is pretty heavy plus your curls are to skinny and don&#x27;t last as much only if you hair spray it could last.</li>
            <li> easy to change my hair style, love it!! this is the one I&#x27;m looking for so long</li>
            <li> I LOVED a this curler! Until it broke. My boyfriend got it for me and I had it MAYBE two months. When it did work, it worked great. Contacted the manufacturer and nothing.</li>
            <li> I have medium length wavy hair and I always find it a bit difficult to get the right curl when using a curling iron. Yea, certain types of products and sprays help but Its hard to get that perfect curl right from the get go. After purchasing the Miraqueen curling iron I am hooked. It doesn&#x27;t give off that burning hair smell, it gives me the bounciest curls and they last way longer than with other irons. I am absolutely convinced that this is the best curling iron out there.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is beyond amazing. I have been using a traditional 1 inch curling iron for years. I use almost any brand as I&#x27;m not sure the real difference in any of them. However, using this Miraqueen I could tell immediate the difference. My curls have never had so much volume and shine. I usually have to add a bunch of hair products to get this same hair luster. My favorite part of this curling wand is the chamber. I feel like if I use it daily my hair won&#x27;t be enduring so much damage compared to when I use my flatiron. I appreciated that the wand was easy to use. This was my first time using a curl wand. I think anyone who has used a curling iron before will find this easy to use. I would recommend Miraqueen to anyone who just wants beautiful curls every time.</li>
            <li> This iron is awesome!!!! I got this as a birthday gift for my wife and she totally loves it!!</li>
            <li> I bought a Miraqueen Professional to my mom as a gift, and she loved it. She told that this is so much better than the other she have used before. She said it is very easy to use and made gorgeous waves in her hair. For me, the best part is the cheap price!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and the price is very reasonable. It makes perfect curls every time! I have gotten many compliments on my hair and people ask who did it. Now I have salon curls at my fingertips!!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has owned this curling iron for several months and I got to see it in action on several occasions. The curls she created with this thing looked really cool! She finally let me borrow it a few days ago and I got to use it on my hair. I have thin shoulder-length hair that normally doesn&#x27;t hold any curls or hair accessories for that matter. Everything falls out of it and any curls disappear within an hour. Granted, I used a bit of hair spray this time, but the results were still very different from what I&#x27;ve ever been able to get with any tool of this kind. The curls looked really pretty and they lasted for the whole evening! Even the next morning when I woke up they were still there and I&#x27;m sure I could have gone around all day with the curly hairdo if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair. It&#x27;s an awesome tool! Now, a couple of tricks my friend shared with me: you&#x27;ve got to make sure the lock you put through it is not too thick and doesn&#x27;t have a very wide base, and you need to run a brush through it before curling to get any tangles out. I&#x27;ll be putting this curling iron on my wishlist!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for THE ultimate curling iron for my long, straight hair. My hair is very slippery and tends to not hold a curl for more than 5 minutes. After reading all of the great reviews, I purchased my own Miraqueen and couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By reading all of the directions first, and coming  my hair through very carefully before I got started, I was able to get the hang of this curling iron very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now I have to say this about the Miraqueen system ....WOW!!! Here are the most important features to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.control panel that allows you to change the temperature, time, and direction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.LCD display that gives you status&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.Swivel cord that rotates as your body turns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.Base - keeps the iron&#x27;s surface cool when you&#x27;re using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.Trigger button&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.Foam protection on the instant heater&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.Rubber protector ensures your skin is a safe distance away from the heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. Curl chamber - glides over hair strands protecting it from damage and breakage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just set the temperature to the degree you like and the screen on the device lets you know when you&#x27;re done with each curl. No more split ends and breakage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that my curls that are so tight they stay bouncy and perfect all day! I always spritz on some hairspray and the curls stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am thrilled with the Miraqueen curling iron. It is very easy to use with lots of convenient settings. Definitely worth the price! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this curling wand! My hair is hard to curl a lot of the time, and when I do manage to curl it, the curl either doesn&#x27;t look right or (even worse) doesn&#x27;t last! This is the one curling wand i&#x27;ve used where I haven&#x27;t had that issue. It heats up fast, it&#x27;s easy to use, and I even love the color! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is too thick, not worth money, shuts off easily... RETURN!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because of the reviews and I can say all the reviews are right this works wonders! It heats up so fast and leaves my hair looking better than ever!  I would highly reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a new curling iron.!</li>
            <li> My hair is dead straight, I’ve always looked for that extra boost to achieve those sexy long curls, and I finally found the tool to do it! The Miraqueen curling iron gives my hair the volume it really needs to last all day. It gets super hot and has an auto power off in case you forget to turn it off. There’s a really cool LED screen that tells you the temperature, curl direction, and it even has a timer. My curls are soft and healthy, I’m so glad I got this. Very high quality product for a great price, couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> grand daughter loves this</li>
            <li> This curling iron is pretty awesome. So much easier than trying to use a flat iron to curl your hair. No skills needed, just put your hair in and it&#x27;s done!! You need to brush tangles out first and not put too much hair in or it will get stuck.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s family invited me to go to a famous oyster place to grab some fresh oysters and picnic at the beach this past weekend. I wanted to look nice for the family outing and I had just got the curling device last Friday so I figured I should use it. I curled my hair and wow, it works really fast and is super easy to use. So, after less than about 15mins I had a full set of curls. I waited for my boyfriend&#x27;s family to come pick us up and his mother really adored me with the curls. She asked me if I curled my hair often, and I told her that I will curl my hair more now since I have an automatic curler! And that I didn&#x27;t used to curl my hair much before. Even my boyfriend can&#x27;t stop telling me how cute I looked and kept playing with my curls. I would playfully swat him away since I was afraid he&#x27;d mess them up but they just sprung back to it&#x27;s original shape.</li>
            <li> was not quite what it advertised.</li>
            <li> People are greedy and want to collect everything that they can to make them selves beautiful. My one friend has every single hair curling, straightening, waving product out there. I don&#x27;t get why she has so many products when she barely uses them all. I sadly don&#x27;t truly have my own curler so I tend to borrow from her, but when I saw how versatile this automatic curler is, I thought to myself. I can finally have a product that&#x27;s all the styles in one! I got it, used it, and love it. All I need.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way a normal curling iron has the capacity to produce such great curls every time. This product has the power! The curls that comes out are real slick and nice. With a touch of hair spray you&#x27;re set to go out. Really awesome automatic curler!</li>
            <li> I have tried out many brands and products and this is honestly the best curling iron I have ever tried. This curling iron is fantastic!</li>
            <li> We needed &amp;#34;Cheer Hair&amp;#34; and this seemed to work well - my daughter has incredibly thick hair and we decided to give this iron a try after using a similar iron that a friend had. The curls didn&#x27;t hold all day, but held for the few hours we needed them to do. I still prefer the curl-former type curlers that you use with wet hair. I think they worked better for cheer hair ringlets.</li>
            <li> Very awesome curler! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very good curling iron ( this is my 3rd one it is a gift for my daugther)</li>
            <li> This works great! Curls come out beautiful and easy to use. Isn&#x27;t very time consuming either.</li>
            <li> I like it just that the curls are small and  it dosent take much hair in</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have been curling my hair for most of my life and my arms would always get so tired from holding the hair and curling iron in position for varying time length. I’ve used almost every type of curler there is out there and by far this one is the easiest to use and gives my hair amazing curls. I love the fact that I don’t have to sit there and count out how long I have to hold the curler in place and that I don’t have to physically wrap my hair around a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I abolutely LOVE this curler! I have thick, straight, almost un-curlable Asian hair and it is DREADFUL. I have always envied other girls because I felt like one of the only girls my age who couldn&#x27;t get her hair to curl. My roommate got me this curler for my birthday and I absolutely love it! :) This is the only curler that has EVER curled my hair and the curl stayed in ALL day. I didn&#x27;t have to use much hairspray and the curl held up for fifteen hours (would have been longer, but I showered when I got home!). I am never using another curler again. It heats up fast and gives me an AMAZING curl...and it is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> So I recently purchased on of these MiraQueen curling irons after a friend recommended it to me. I have notoriously FLAT hair. The kind of hair that you curl with a curling iron, hair spray until it’s as hard as plastic, and then somehow it’s still straight within 35 minutes. So basically I’ve just lived with straight hair forever. But this past year I had a bunch weddings and events lined up, and I really wanted to give curling my hair another try. So I gave this product a try as a last resort. (To say I was skeptical is an understatement. I’ve tried EVERY other product out there-- none of which worked.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to tell you that I LOVE this curling iron. It’s the ONLY product that has ever gotten my hair truly curly, and it stayed that way for hours! Since I haven’t been curling my hair my entire adult life, I was a bit afraid that it would be hard to use or something, but it’s super easy to use. I’ve never burnt myself or damaged my hair, and I’ve learned to style my hair 3 or 4 different ways with just this one curling iron. I really like doing the wavy curls, but I’ve done some tighter spirals too as part of up-dos and this iron works really well. It’s amazing how the iron does all the work automatically, and I actually will curl my hair now for day to day stuff too because it’s just so easy to use. It curls up my entire head of hair fast, I can use it one-handed, and I can always just look on the LED screen to see if it’s the right temperature, so there’s no guess work. I guess maybe that’s not a problem for girls that have been curling their hair all their lives, but for me, it’s nice to have it be such an easy process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I just want to mention that I like the rubberized protectors and heat insulators. I’m THAT person that thinks they left the curling iron on 5 minutes after I leave the house, and then I have to go back and check (and then, of course, I’m late for work). So knowing that it won’t burn down my house because it turns off automatically and has protections in place even if it stayed on-- I really like that they thought about that stuff when making this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Definitely recommend the MiraQueen.</li>
            <li> This really is the best Curling Iron I have ever used. I Purchased this as a gift for my Mom. She had read about it and could not wait to try it. Needless to say she loved it and could not stop talking about it every time she called me. So for my birthday guess what she got me. I have to say I have never had a curling iron work this well. It really is amazing. The first week I had it I must have created 6 different hair styles. I highly recommend this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Love curling my hair with this, don&#x27;t get burned, gives you real nice body or curls. The expense of it is the only downfall.</li>
            <li> Sooooo disappointed after being excited to wait to receive but found it was defective. It worked only once but completely died on second time. The LED screen froze and the chamber only heated up but didn&#x27;t spin. Already returned.</li>
            <li> I like it but I like the way a regular wand curls my hair. The curls just don&#x27;t stay as long as when I use a wand that I wrap the hair myself.</li>
            <li> So I decided to splurge after using my old school curler for ages. This curling iron has so many useful features, I&#x27;ve been in awe of it since I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I haven&#x27;t burned myself since I&#x27;ve been using it (and it is most likely impossible to anyway) as opposed to how I always burned myself with my old curler. It also changes direction with the press of a button which makes it easy to add dimension to my curls. It automatically turns off which makes me feel better since I have a two year old and am forgetful sometimes (so I just love that safety feature).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal preference while I use it is 8 seconds at 370 F. This gives me gorgeous loose curls and isn&#x27;t damaging to my thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on so many good reviews I just had to try it..I have no regrets.. it&#x27;s so easy to use..The curls were so pretty and natural not those tight wedding look curls you get when you curl. I could do it myself..no help needed with this..In love with this..great price. .great delivery!</li>
            <li> The BEST iron I ever had! I was a little skeptical as I&#x27;m not the best on doing my hair but with this iron, I put my hair in, press and the curls come out perfect and they last a good 3 days or more if I don&#x27;t wash my hair. I had so many compliments on my hair and everyone wants to know what I&#x27;m using. My hair looks shiny and bouncy even though I have tons of hair processes due to a bad dye work...anyhow, I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase and will recommend to anyone that is looking for full, shiny and bouncy curls :)</li>
            <li> One of my best hair product buys!! This was purchased to replace one that cost twice its amount. So happy I found it and of course it works wonderful! Beautiful curls, and three different sizes!! Will buy again it needed!!</li>
            <li> All the curler up in here aint compared to this one. No body makes curlers this good anymore. Automatic baby. I be loving the curls that comes out of this baby. Sweet deal if ya ask me hun. Get one for your little self now.</li>
            <li> Got this for my fifteen year old daughter who has long, straight, thin hair, and wants curls, waves and body. Miraqueen has given my baby what the gods did not: Fabulous hair that she is thrilled about. She needs no assistance. She figured out after one minor knot exactly what to do, and she can do it very quickly and easily by herself, even at the back of her head.  She&#x27;s thrilled with this, and the operation is simple, trouble-free and reliable. The value for this product was unparalleled. Money very well spent. What this cost would not have paid for her to get her hair done at a salon more than once, because her hair is past the middle of her back. No burns on her skin, no curling irons, no scorching of hair. And just seconds per curl. Just fabulous ringlets, and perhaps a bit of hair spray after she&#x27;s done to extend how long it will last for her.</li>
            <li> Finally! The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron actually gives me curls that last all day! I&#x27;m so glad this curling iron was recommended to me. Best curling iron I&#x27;ve used by far!&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of very thick hair that does not like to curl. Every time I curled my hair in the past, it took over an hour and the curls wouldn&#x27;t hold for anything. Previous curling attempts always resulted in ponytails.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I can now be confident my curls will hold throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I decided to get this for my wife because she always was complaining about trying to curl her hair. She has used a straight on/off curling iron for the past 20 years and I can barely tell that she had curled her hair after a couple of hours. She loves this curling iron by Miraqueen. It is comfortable to hold and the ceramic works tons better than the old metal one she was using. Now her curls hold the entire day! With the digital controls and the ability to adjust the heat settings this curling iron works extremely well. Now curling her hair is a joy! And she gets it done in a lot less time. There is also a timing feature so that she doesn&#x27;t overheat! This unit works so well we are thinking of getting them for our girls for Christmas!</li>
            <li> This curler met all of my expectations. I especially love the rotary function. I get to choose which direction it spins my hair. That makes styling my hair so much easier!!!  I like to style my hair differently everyday and this gives me the freedom to do so. Since I got this curler, I have been experimenting a whole lot more with my hair. I love it!! I wish I could give it 5 more stars!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking a product that will curl my hair without using the typical barrel curling iron. I stumbled upon Miraqueen  curling iron. This heats up very quickly and works as expected. I was able to curl all of my hair in less than 8 minutes. This was by far the fastest and painless curling iron I’ve used. It does take some time getting used to. But with any new product out, it’s a trial and error process. Just make sure you brush every strand you insert into the curling iron. This eliminates the fear of getting burned by a regular curling iron. I will definitely recommend this product to my friends. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I can&#x27;t believe I had to live my life so far without it!!! This thing is amazing. I have really really hard to curl hair &amp; it just takes so long. not anymore. Its so fast &amp; easy to use, its just crazy &amp; finally I get to have beautiful amazing curls. I love that it has adjustable heat settings and heats up quickly. The Miraqueen is my new favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li> What can I say - I absolutely LOVE this curling iron.  I&#x27;ve owned and bought many different irons over the years. Some last for a few months, some a few years.  But NONE have ever curled my hair so quickly, and looked so stylish in the process :)  I&#x27;ve owned this unit for a few months and it heats up super fast.  I love the detailed control panel and the bright color, too.  Every time I travel with this iron, I feel confident that I&#x27;ll be looking my best even when away from home.  It&#x27;s easy to store and works a heck of a lot better than the other irons I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  Overall, a great purchase that I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I received this product for Christmas and I&#x27;m in love! I have stick straight hair, and I had given up on trying to add any curl to it because it would never hold. It didn&#x27;t matter if I curled my hair or if my hairdresser attempted it or what products I used in it to try to maintain it, within an hour my hair would just fall straight again. My hairdresser even advised me that if I ever wanted curls in my hair to hold, I&#x27;d probably have to resort to getting a perm but I never went through with it because I didn&#x27;t like the idea of putting that much chemical processing in my hair. This curling iron is a miracle! I tried it out soon after I opened it and my curls held up all evening and didn&#x27;t fall out until I washed my hair last night. I used it again this morning and the curls are still holding strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is extremely easy to use, which is a definite plus since I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with curling my hair other than my past failed attempts, I&#x27;d just given up on it after awhile. It heats up quickly and I finish curling my hair in almost no time, which is excellent because I hate getting up earlier than necessary just to fuss with my hair. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone, professionals to amateurs like myself because it&#x27;s so quick and easy. It is easily going to become my go-to when I want to treat myself to an awesome hair day.</li>
            <li> I got my curler when it was cheaper,  but I&#x27;m not even sure it was the same product that everyone else has reviewed.  Mine looked like the one pictured,  but my instructions were not detailed at all: it didn&#x27;t mention anything about beeps or how much hair to feed in. When I used it, it would suck the hair in wonderfully, make a beep sound but the curling action would stop after only a few seconds, no matter what the timer was set on. The result was a frizzy wave. I would try holding the curler in place way after the curling action stopped to see if a curl would form because the heating element would still be working, but the curl would just come out loose, frizzy and somewhat kinky.  Got it on Prime, return was a snap. Kind of want to try another one, but I&#x27;m a little hesitant. Maybe the one I got was a factory 2nd or something and they were trying to get rid of them by selling them cheaper - who knows....</li>
            <li> Literally the best hair styling product i have ever purchased (and i have about 4 irons, 3 curing irons, 2 blowdryers etc)...&lt;br /&gt;i have thin brittle shoulder length hair, and not much of it... my hair looks full and bouncy, as if i stepped out of the salon- and last all day!&lt;br /&gt;love it!</li>
            <li> Have a New Year’s resolution for beautiful, bouncy and curly hair? Grab this professional Miraqueen curling iron now! Its ceramic technology protects your hair from damage, and you’ll love the 3 heat levels and 4 timer settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m also a huge fan of the auto shut-off, as is my family! The LED screen is pretty awesome – it displays your timer, the curling iron temperature, and your curl direction. There’s a rubberized layer that protects your skin from the heating element, and when used properly (you must read the directions carefully) the ceramic iron will not pull, tangle, or tug your hair. The iron will also reverse directions, which is a great feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is versatility in the curls that you can get, depending on how long your hair is in the iron. You are able to get loose and wavy curls, medium curls, or tight and springy curls. The Miraqueen is a smart curling iron--If you try to curl too much at once, the iron will beep at you to tell you it&#x27;s too much and to try again with less. I have a lot of layers in my hair, and it works very well. Be patient, learn to use it, &amp; get great results! Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have such thick hair that I have never been able to curl my hair before. With the first try I had salon perfect curls, and with my super thick hair it took me only about 30 minutes to curl my hair. I was even more impressed that I could wear a winter hat, sleep on it, and the next day it was still perfectly curly. To hold the curl perfectly and add a bit of shine I used about an 1/8th of a teaspoon of coconut oil on the bottom half of my hair and the ends, to wet or dry hair before I curled my hair.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today, and I love it! You may mess up a time or 2 but once you get the hang of it, AMAZING! I could never used the curl wand correctly but this is so simple and doesn&#x27;t burn! Worth every penny</li>
            <li> LOVE it! Glad I went with my instinct and bought it. I have relaxed hair and it works great on it leVing it smooth. I was worried because I have long hair and wasn&#x27;t sure if my hair would get stuck a lot. Honestly, I did 1 inch sections and took my time and no tangles! I used the 12 second setting on 410. I also love how you can change the direction of the curls! Ladies you won&#x27;t regret! Beach waves or right curls, it does an amazing job for women who don&#x27;t usually do this because of lack of skill and time :)</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  It saves her a lot of time because it curls her hair much faster.  She is able to do more in less time.  Her curls seems to last a lot longer, I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve been looking for something that is not harsh on my non chemically treated hair. This is perfect!  Try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this curling iron. I have about six or seven, including an expensive ceramic one. The price was an investment, one that after i used it I was totally happy that I bought it. I loved that it was so safe to use! I couldn&#x27;t burn myself if I tried! It&#x27;s not too heavy or bulky either which is great for small hands. I have thick hair and at one point I used too big a piece. the powerful little motor in there must have a brain because it knew right away and un-raveled my hair automatically! Amazing! All I had to do was re-brush my hair and try it with a smaller piece. Once I got the hang of it, my whole head of hair took about twelve minutes to get a soft wave. It used to take me thirty minutes to curl my hair the old way. This one also makes the coolest ringlets! Buy this curling iron! You won&#x27;t regret it for a moment!</li>
            <li> Worked as promised!  I did a lot of research and almost bought the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; more popular brand...until I read the reviews and started reading about hair catching on fire, big bald spots because the hair wouldn&#x27;t come out of the curler, etc.  I did not see those types of reviews on the Miraqueen brand, so I took a chance and bought it.  You need to understand that the part of the brain that manages hair styling skills is missing from my brain.  So it really means something when I say this product was so easy to use, that I did my hair almost perfectly the first time.  Occasionally, I&#x27;ll get in a hurry and try to put too much hair in it, but when I do, it always makes a strange sound, stops and releases my hair.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my hair getting stuck or tangled.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the ringlet curls, so after I get through curling, I use a hair pick to fluff it all up and I have received a lot of nice remarks on my new hair style.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I pride myself for always getting a valuable gift for my wife because she is such a wonderful woman. I been doing this for years and it seems to get harder every time as I feel I  am running short of options. I bought the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron with bated breath. Not sure if she would be happy with it. I left early for work and  left it on the kitchen table boxed in with a pretty purple ribbon.&lt;br /&gt;I got home after work and all I can say is Wow! Your curling iron has transformed my wife into a sexy siren. I can play with those tight silver screen ringlets all night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for such an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Amazing device.  The curls are natural looking and stay until the next wash.  It takes a few tries to get the curling procedure down.  I recommend watching an online tutorial before attempting to curl your hair.  You will love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as described.  I cant curl my hair the old fashioned way this a life saver.</li>
            <li> This Miraqueen I just received and I love it. It&#x27;s everything the positive reviews say about it. I habe been looking and reading about it for so long, watching videos too, that if you FOLLOW DIRECTIONS it works beautifully. I have fine, very straight shoulder length hair and it makes great curls that last long. The multiple settings are great too and I had absolutely no problems with any caught hairs or releasing. Everything went very smoothly and this was just my first time use. I am looking forward to doing lots of experimenting with different styles.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron does not look like any curling iron you have seen before because it is NOT like any curling iron you have seen before. With this smart design Miraqueen has applied smart, effective (and beautiful!) technology to curling irons that has long been missing in the world of hair care.&lt;br /&gt;To break it down here is what I think sets the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron apart from others:&lt;br /&gt;-High temperature settings, but hair is still PROTECTED. This curling device heats up to an impressive 450 degrees F, but because of ceramic technology your hair is still protected. The combination of healthy hair and high temp curls means that curls will last and last.&lt;br /&gt;-LED display takes away the guess work. If you are like me, you like to know what you are doing. Simply turning a wheel up or down like on a standard curling iron is relatively meaningless. With this easy to read display I know time and temperature with just a glance.&lt;br /&gt;-Timer settings for curls. How much easier can it get than simply selecting a time setting to determine how tight or loose curls are. Genius!&lt;br /&gt;This well-designed curling iron can take the place of those old fashioned curling irons and newer curling wands that constantly lead to burnt fingers. With all the good though, I will also mention two small tips to help others get started.&lt;br /&gt;-There is a small learning curve. Try this out when you have some time to play with it as opposed to when you are rushing out the door. Soon it will SAVE you time, but for the first use or two, give yourself a few extra minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-Detangle first. Like with any hair device, your results will look much better if you get any tangles out first.&lt;br /&gt;Happy curling!</li>
            <li> As a city girl and college student it&#x27;s embarrassing how far I have gotten in life without learning how to curl my hair. The wand is a huge struggle and my hair is so thick that it takes forever. The Miraqueen Iron has been a godsend. Being able to adjust the tightness of the curls is great for changing my style without even doing damage to my hair or burning my hand. It will only take so much hair to curl and beeps when it is ready, making it so easy to use for someone with such little experience like myself. I would highly recommend the Miraqueen to anyone from a pageant queen to a natural beaut - get on it girls, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Really cool and it works!  I have super straight hair and curled my whole head in about 20 mins!  Just make sure you don&#x27;t pull a piece too small or too large or it won&#x27;t suck up the hair correctly.  I had some hair pull out a little. But once I realized that- it&#x27;s worked well!</li>
            <li> Not gonna lie, I totally expected to repackage this and send it back after the trial run. I was so pleasantly surprised! I have fine stick straight hair and it never holds a curl. Plus, I am terrible at doing my own hair and usually you can see lines when I use a traditional curling iron. This gadget is so amazing and takes all the user error off the table! The only thing you have to be careful of is not trying to put too much hair in there. It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair as it winds it up inside, it makes beeping noises to let you know when it&#x27;s done. The digital control/display is very clear and easy to work with. I did my hair after work and slept on it and the next day I still had lovely bouncy curls! No hairspray, just the mousse I&#x27;d put in to blowdry in the morning. Not only will I be keeping this wand, but I will be telling people how awesome it is! Very pleasant surprise to have this work as well as it does.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this gadget!  I was skeptical about it first because I have short, thin, and fine layer hair from about 3 inches to 5 inches.  The item shipped and I received it two days of ordering from Amazon which is fantastic!  The instructions only comes in like one page, so I would suggest to watch the video posted on the review and instructions at the Amazon site.  The width of the curling iron is about 4 inches.  It works as it said and the reviews claimed on the Amazon site.  It has give me shine and fuller hair for the entire day.  It was not hard to use.  When my mom saw it the first time and saw it in action, she said she has dreamed about someone making something like this as she hand rolled her hair each time.  Now she is wanted to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice and I already can&#x27;t say enough about this curling iron. My hair is extremely difficult to curl - it&#x27;s very thick and long. To give you an idea, I&#x27;m half Indian... have you ever seen Indian women&#x27;s hair? It&#x27;s ridiculous! Anyway...this iron is more capable of making flawless curls than any other I&#x27;ve tried. Since it&#x27;s ceramic it&#x27;s LESS damaging than metal curling irons are (although it will still damage your hair). It is also very easy to slide your hair through the clasp, while some other curling irons will snag on your hair if you try. Mine also came with a protective heat case to put over the iron for storage, which I find extremely helpful. With the protective case, you can put it away right away instead of waiting for it to cool back down. The iron also heats up very quickly and has multiple heat settings to choose from. I started out with the 0.75 inch and I ran out and bought the same iron in another size, because I have so much confidence in it. Although as previously stated, I have only used it twice; I have no idea as to the longevity of this product (although I hope it will last for a long time). So far, I definitely recommend it. I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron for my wife, as I really like the way her hair looks when it&#x27;s curled, but she never enjoys the process of curling her hair. Let me just say, that is a thing of the past! She LOVES the Miraqueen, and says that this curling iron makes it easy to create long-lasting curls, unlike her old curling irons. She also loves the 3 curl settings and the other options provided to easily create many different types of curls. As for myself, I noticed that it shuts off on its own if not in use, which is great since my wife will often forget she left her iron on. And her hair looks great now! She&#x27;s happy, and her hair looks great, so I am doubly pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This curling wand/iron is a godsend for us girls with straight thin hair. It makes doing my hair a breeze, I have literally knocked 5-10 minutes off of my morning routine when i use this baby and i could not be happier. The timers and heat settings make it very easy to see and operate this to get your desired curl, If you are thinking about getting a new iron spend the couple of extra dollars and get the Mirqueen you will not regret it at all.</li>
            <li> Well let me just start by saying I am impressed. This is my husbands account that I use to purchase everything by the way. Anyways, I love curling my hair and went ahead and purchased this the Miraqueen iron. I was a little skeptic at first like any other customer would be, but this Miraqueen Iron is purely amazing. It left my hair really curly and with its unique design it helped avoid those nasty burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and totally recommend it to everyone. It will be the last curling product you will need.&lt;br /&gt;The thing that wowed me the most was how long the curls last. I mean, they practically lasted the whole night without falling apart. This Miraqueen Iron does an amazing job, not to mention it is very easy to use and very safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase one for my mom and sister as well. I know they will love it just like I did. I can’t wait for them to get theirs as well because I know they will love it.</li>
            <li> Why did it take SO long to find this? I&#x27;ve gone through too many curling irons in the past year, they all HATE my hair and NEVER do a good job... Then I found this perfect little thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with the everyone else, the chamber feature is really neat to watch. It&#x27;s also nice to know I can fiddle with the temperature and get the job done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls came out soooo tight &amp; perfect I almost felt guilty that it was so easy... I wanted to buy one for my friend but I don&#x27;t want her to know my secret!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this product and she absolutely LOVES IT! She uses it nearly every day and her hair looks absolutely stunning. The ceramic technology integrated into this device protects her hair from damage, so no matter how much she uses it, her hair looks full and healthy. The heat levels and timer settings are perfect and the auto shut-off is great when she accidentally leaves it on. The LED screen is crystal clear and very easy to read. My girlfriend has been using this product for nearly a month and shes had zero problems with it. To top it all off, if something happens to your Miraqueen Curling Iron, the One Year Warranty covers it! Overall this is a fantastic product, I recommend it to all ladies and guys that are looking for a gift to give their significant other.</li>
            <li> Amazing bottom line get it</li>
            <li> I have medium-length hair, and this is definitely not great for it. It was very hard to get the back of my hair into it successfully because it&#x27;s so huge that very little would actually be in the machine. And what did make it in was way too curly, even on the lowest and shortest settings. I definitely think this is more for long hair because it&#x27;s just too big to try to successfully work with shorter hair</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my husband and I&#x27;ve used it more in the short time I&#x27;ve had it than any other hair tool I&#x27;ve ever owned. The entire process is practically automated. I used to get impatient halfway through and leave the back of my hair uncurled, but now I can zip all the way around!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous curling irons that have repetitively fallen short of my expectations, however, my opinion was swayed when I purchased this unique iron. The qualities that this iron possesses makes your hair styling experience significantly easier and much more enjoyable.  The feature that was prominent to me was the diversity in the amount of control one has when curling their hair. When styling my hair, I was able to alter the temperature, curl direction, time, and styling blocks. This resulted in a much more preferred and satisfied result of my curls. It is rare to have such a determining role in how your curls will look, and for this product to offer that is just another reason why I prefer this curling iron.  Furthermore, there&#x27;s also the protection and assurity this product offers to yourself and your hair. From prior experience, I cannot fully express to you how many times I have accidently burned my hands. However, the rubber layers and cool plastic assist in keeping your limbs safe. Not once have I burnt myself with this iron, and that makes the experience all the better with this added sense of security. My hair is also gives this protection with the ceramic curling chamber. The chamber doesn&#x27;t pull your hair in a way that would cause damage. Your hair will remain healthy and smooth after you curl it, so there&#x27;s no fear of a reduced hair quality with the use of this iron. With the rubber layer near the heater to protect your hands, the plastic base that keeps the iron cool, and the ceramic curling chamber that glides over your hair, this unit gives you an enormous amount of safety that is hard to come by in other irons.  With this newfound curling iron, I have a feeling of confidence and bliss in the curling of my hair.  All of these phenomenal, unique, and rare qualities make it so easy to recommend this to others looking for a fantastic curling iron that will exceed your expectations.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron for my sister as a birthday present and she really seems to like it considering her&lt;br /&gt;past experiences with curling irons. Because of her long and thick hair previous curling irons would damage her&lt;br /&gt;hair and the iron itself. But this one is different she has been using it for about a month and she says its the&lt;br /&gt;best curling iron she has ever had. Judging from my sister&#x27;s reaction i would recommend this curling iron to everybody&lt;br /&gt;especially people with long and thick hair. What she loves most is the accessibility it is available for use with in 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;She also thinks that the LED display is quite innovative as it allows you to see the temperature, curling direction, and&lt;br /&gt;timer. She says that she would recommend this product to everybody as it is easy to use and works on every type of hair.</li>
            <li> This product did not work on my hair at all.  I actually finally set it to the hottest temperature, had product in my hair to hold the curl, set the timer for 12 seconds and it barely curled by hair.  It was more like a half wave.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife! Once I got it and gave it to her she started to use it right away. I was actually scared she wouldn&#x27;t like since I do not know much about these things, but she loved it! she said it was easy and fun to use. Once I explained how the timer settings worked she found it even more useful. Overall I can say this is a must have for anybody who curls there hair!</li>
            <li> I have very thin curly hair, it is very frizzly feeling and all over the place.  I had decided to try the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron and I cannot believe how smooth and silky my hair is. My curls are beautiful.  The product is light weight, easy to hold onto, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have a bad habit of running out the door leaving my curling irons on.  This curling iron turns itself off  within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, I can&#x27;t believe the difference a curling iron makes</li>
            <li> It has been about a week since I started using this product. This product quality is very good and This product is totally awesome and I would highly recommend it to anyone who need it!.</li>
            <li> First of all, my hair is stick straight and very thick and heavy so even if I am able to get it to curl, the curls do not stay in. I was very hesitant to even consider purchasing the MIraqueen because nothing ever works to curl my hair. Well, I am glad that I took the chance. I read the reviews on Amazon before purchasing but I still was not convinced. I ordered the Miraqueen on a Friday and it came the next week. I decided to try it out the next weekend when I actually had time to mess with curling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions were fairly straight forward as were the controls on the actual curling iron. I curled a few sections of my hair and was amazed that the iron seemed to know if I had placed too much hair to be curled! It would actually &amp;#34;unwind&amp;#34; itself. The beeps helped me to know when the hair was ready also. This is a really nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was impressed by the Miraqueen. It curled my hair and the curls actually stayed in. It gives you three timer settings so you can create loose, medium, or tight curls in your hair. I tried it out using the tight setting first and was happy with the result. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This Miraqueen curling iron is great!&lt;br /&gt;The swivel cord might just be my favorite thing about it, which may sound silly, but trust me, it&#x27;s no fun having to untwist and untangle the cord because it wouldn&#x27;t move the way you wanted it to.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the ceramic technology at work in this product. My straightener uses this as well, and I loved how it provided an even distribution of heat on my hair. This product does the same and makes curling your hair a breeze! It used to be that you would have to wrap your hair around the rod of a curling iron to get it to curl, but with the Miraqueen your hair is pulled through the chamber and comes out curly/wavy. It is almost like magic - you have to see it to believe it. Not having to wrap your hair around the rod also pretty much eliminates the chance of burning yourself, so if you were prone to burning yourself on curling irons before and have the blisters to prove it, do yourself a favor and buy this.&lt;br /&gt;The timer function is very helpful, too. The iron beeps when your hair is curled or waved to your specific desire (loose, medium, or tight), so hair is never in for a dangerously long amount of time (good for people like me, who sometimes get distracted whilst putting hot things on their hair).&lt;br /&gt;With so many great features and at such a great price (seriously, the super cheap irons have NOTHING on this), I would recommend this to anyone in search of a hair-friendly, burn-free, SIMPLE curling iron!</li>
            <li> Did a great job. Ive used the $200+ $ ones this worked just as well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. This curling curling iron was able to handle my thick hair with ease. The design made it easy for me to make even bouncy curls. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the Miraqueen- money well spent.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow! This curling wand gives me the messy, sultry curls that I crave, but could never get with a traditional curling iron. I never burn my hands. It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair (which I always seemed to think the BabyBliss did) and it doesn&#x27;t pull on it either. I also love the digital controls and how quickly it heats. I would highly recommend this to a woman that&#x27;s on-the-go but still wants to look really professional and put-together.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I’m a guy writing this review, but I’m also a single father who loves his daughter very much. I&#x27;ve been going out of my mind trying to help her move into her teenage stage, hair just isn&#x27;t my thing. Before, she just did her hair with different things and then went to school, but she was very frustrated that she hadn&#x27;t found the right hair iron. So we&#x27;ve been looking for quality products that are easy to learn and use. She has very straight hair, that used to never curl and she said she always wanted loose wavy curls. This is the one product that we&#x27;ve found so far that easily achieves those results, no other iron has worked even half as well. She was able to watch a few YouTube videos to figure everything out and then it worked like a charm! Curls like an iron worth twice as much, I mean, it even has a timer! It heats up quickly and is ready to use in less than 2 minutes. The Miraqueen seems much better than her other hair things, and she’s very happy with it (which is really what matters)!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, long story short, THANK YOU for helping this old man with his teenage daughter crisis.</li>
            <li> I got this great curling iron as a gift from my friend and I absolutely love it. I have very thin hair and I need the extra curl to get my hair to do anything. I especially like the automatic shut off because I used to always forget to turn my curling iron off. I also like the automatic curling feature and the beep timer. I get perfect curls every time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother and she loved it she is always posting new pictures of herself, its really awesome, I will be getting this for all the girls in my family for Christmas</li>
            <li> I got this iron as a birthday gift for my sister and she hasn&#x27;t stopped raving about it, so I felt compelled to share a review. She claims that she uses it every day and that it has eliminated the need for a daily headful of unsightly rollers. My sister tends to be a chronic complainer about practically anything so, if she gives this product her stamp of approval, you can believe it!</li>
            <li> I personally like it. I don&#x27;t like that you have to do very small strands tho wich would make it near impossible to do my whole head of hair even after straitng but it is a good iron. However I fryed this on my friends hair and it wouldn&#x27;t even make it wavy. Absolutely no curl at all. We changed the temp straitened her hair everything and it didn&#x27;t do anything to her hair...</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this product. She received it nearly a week ago and has used it twice since. The curls are long lasting and done perfectly, as if a professional was doing it themselves. She plans on buying a few more for Christmas gifts. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sleek and useful design is also a favorite. Along with the LCD monitor, which helps to prevent any burning or damage.</li>
            <li> Great!  Love it and the curl usually lasts 2 days.</li>
            <li> FINALLY! I was so excited to get this in the mail, I’ve been watching for it like a hawk for 2 days! As a hairdresser, I spent a lot of time researching these types of curling irons, because you know, I like having hair. After watching some iffy commercials and reviews on YouTube, I spent some time on the Miraqueen website and I was pretty intrigued right off the bat. It just seemed easier to use than the other ones I’d seen, including my friends Babyliss.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was great. Arrived perfectly fine. After trying it on my own hair though, I’m really hooked. I can’t wait to take it to my salon and show my guests how to use it! I love that it knows how much hair is inside so that I don’t end up having to recurl hair that didn’t take the first time because of thickness. I also like that there is literally NO way to burn yourself on this item at all! Up until now, I’ve used a professional Marcel Iron, even on my own hair, but I’m seriously considering switching just to this! Marcel burns hurt!! I understand that the Marcel is what we were “raised” on, but Holy Technology, Baby! Get this!&lt;br /&gt;One of the best features about these, I think, is the fact that they’re ceramic, so it won’t heat damage your hair any more than necessary, and it leaves it really shiny instead of frizzy like the Babyliss one my friend has at her house. It works great on her ECH hair but, she tried to use that one on my hair for an event a month and a half ago and I turned into frizzy Goldilocks, so I kept up with my Marcel.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say how happy I am that this product was able to change my mind! I never get the chance to jump on the new hair ‘tech’ fads because my hair is fine and takes ages to curl, so I’m really excited that this is one I can brag about! I don’t have to crank the heat to max to get a good curl, it doesn’t smell when I put it in my hair, I can always count on the same curl pattern and it cuts about 10 minutes off of my time to get ready in the morning. Which is great, because, I love my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I would say, good for girls 12 and up who KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR HAIR! If your child isn’t brushing her hair, I wouldn’t expect this to get used without your help. There are guided beeps and it’s pretty foolproof to use, but as always, safety first.&lt;br /&gt;I really hope you guys try this out. It already has so many great reviews! I’m happy that I get to be one more!ready in the morning. Which is great, because, I love my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I would say, good for girls 12 and up who KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR HAIR! If your child isn’t brushing her hair, I wouldn’t expect this to get used without your help. There are guided beeps and it’s pretty foolproof to use, but as always, safety first.&lt;br /&gt;I really hope you guys try this out. It already has so many great reviews! I’m happy that I get to be one more!</li>
            <li> Super high heat for a long, long, long lasting curl. This is what my wife needs for her naturally straight hair. Excellent design too!</li>
            <li> Ever use a below standard curling iron? Well my experience with the miraqueen professional curling iron has been nothing short of incredible! It heats up to 450 degrees and also uses ceramic technology that protects your hair from damage; it comes with a LED screen that displays the temperature, curl direction and timers. It also comes with 3 heat settings, 4 timers and automatically powers itself off. I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> Delivery time is amazing. Nice Product</li>
            <li> I am a Salon owner , and I use this on my clients . This is the  best curling Iron  professionally that i have found it is less damaging to  my clients hair. The heat is evenly produced ,  I have client who use to complain about their hair becoming frizzy after a blow out and curl,but using the  Miraqueen  I haven&#x27;t gotten any complaints or  remarks I actually have  a few clients who Bought the Miraqueen for their personal use. It is an Excellent Curling Iron and I would recommend it to Anyone!! I Love IT!!!</li>
            <li> I love it!  Totally worth it!  Curls stayed unlike when I use a curling iron!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this. I have thick chemically straightened hair (yuko) and no matter the temp or the time I tried to set the curls, these lackluster bended waves would come out. My hair also got caught in the iron a few times. Great concept, just not for me.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing as a gift for any special girl in your life. I got this is a gift for my girlfriend for her birthday and she just absolutely adores this product for both its efficiency and simpleness in getting her hair to curl. Now I&#x27;m sure most guys wouldn&#x27;t get what to get for their special someone for any occasion, but I can guarantee that any girl who has trouble getting their hair to curl without hassle would just adore this product. My girlfriend praises how this product has both easy mobility with the swivel cord and the simpleness of the control panel making her hairdressing a messy-free time after she washes/dries her hair. Considering that it&#x27;s actually on sale right now, I&#x27;m actually thinking of getting my mother one of these for Christmas. If you don&#x27;t get it while this deal is available, then you&#x27;re just missing out.</li>
            <li> This machine is awesome! The first thing I noticed was the amazing controls. It really gives you full control to achieve what can&#x27;t be achieved with other products. There is a perfect setting for every hair type. I bought this because of all the technologies it possess for such a reasonable price, it was kind of a no brainer to try it. The three timer settings are perfect, I set it for a tight curl when I feel the weather is going to be rough on my hair. And medium when I&#x27;m going out for the night. I love my curls that MiraQueen gives me. Its so simple to use and the heating element is on the inside so I never have to worry about burning my hands and scalp again. If your looking to try something new and cutting edge I would start here. Thanks again for producing such a great product. MiraQueen!!!</li>
            <li> Like many, I was a little skeptical about this product. I have tried absolutely anything you can think of to curl my hair - curlers, every wand or curling iron out there, heat rollers, and more. But after trying this, I am NEVER going back.  My curls were absolutely gorgeous after using this product AND they lasted me through the night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to create amazing curls across my whole head -- even those hard to reach places on the back of my head!!  Overall this curler was so easy to use, very comfortable to use, and it performs better than expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for everyone to use, definitely buy this curler if you want to be sure you aren&#x27;t going to have to buy a different again!</li>
            <li> I love this curling tool.  I was concerned about the apparent bulkiness of it compared to my usual, traditional curling iron, but I had no trouble using it.  It takes a few times to get used to how it &amp;#34;sucks&amp;#34; the hair into it, since it is different from traditional ones. However, it worked well, and I loved that I did not burn myself at all, as I often do when curling my hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the best curling I have come across in a very long time. The LCD screen is so easy to read and this curling iron has three heat levels and the timer insures you get the right curl every time. But my favorite feature is the auto turn off, it’s easy to forget to turn it off between being rushed, or a teen’s forgetfulness. This curling iron also features ceramic technology, which protects your hair from damage, another thing I like.</li>
            <li> I have owned different curling irons across the years, but this one is my current favourite. It&#x27;s made of quality ceramic and has a pretty high temperature to produce strong curls. I have wavy hair which is quite dense and my hairdresser always says it&#x27;s fairly difficult to style, but this curling iron glides over my hair and doesn&#x27;t loose its grip at the ends. I use the lower setting for loose curls and the higher settings for when I want a lot of volume. This is a good iron in its price range and I really like the pink colour.</li>
            <li> For someone like me, who previously had burned through curling irons and hair dryers like some people go through toothbrushes, I was hesitant to spend a few extra dollars on this one considering my track record. However, my hair is as straight as uncooked spaghetti, and I needed something that would give me a little more help than the typical iron you buy at the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Miraqueen has been nothing short of a revelation, which is a weird thing for me to say as I&#x27;ve never given praise like that to any type of machine. I seriously didn&#x27;t I could make my own hair look like this without paying someone. This iron pays for itself quickly. The automatic beeping sounds let you know when it&#x27;s ready, so you&#x27;re over-doing it or wasting too much time, And I have to admit the automatic curling is actually kinda fun to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wasn&#x27;t sure I needed all the extra bells and whistles, as I&#x27;m not the most technical person in the world, but now I&#x27;ve been spoiled by the luxuries of the LCD monitor and being able to choose the curling direction. Admittedly it&#x27;s a little intimidating at first if you&#x27;ve only ever used a standard iron like me, but it only took me one or two uses to adjust to the Professional level. I won&#x27;t ever buy an iron without these features. In fact, heaven forbid I lose this baby, I&#x27;ll be buying the exact same one.</li>
            <li> I received the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron as a gift from a friend… she is now my favorite friend ever!!! I have baby fine hair that is hard to curl and keep curled! I have used countless curling irons, curling brushes, hot rollers… all with the same results: after nearly frying my hair, I get nice curls, but within an hour or 2, they are falling out and my hair is straight again. This one WORKS! I was skeptical, but I was able to get a full head of beautiful, bouncy curls that actually lasted ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this has 3 heat settings and 4 timer settings so I can decide how much curl I want. Then it has a handy beep that lets you know when it is done! No more frying my hair! It was super easy to use and the curl honestly lasted all day! That never happens with my fine hair! Stop wasting your money on all the other devices out there! This is the only one I&#x27;ll be using from now on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably the worst at doing hair. I can&#x27;t french braid, and unless it&#x27;s a messy bun, straightening with a flat iron, or throwing some curl creme into my hair - it&#x27;s not happening. I had a curling wand, and with the gloves that came with it I was completely inefficient - without the gloves I was burning myself and it took forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this little babe came into my life and I was able to curl my entire head of thick, mid back length hair in less than 45 minutes. It did take a little bit to get the hang of how to hold the Miraqueen when I switched sides of the head, but once I got it under wraps it was quite easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to most anyone. My only tips of advice are 1) make sure you brush out any tangles. Seriously, do it. Before you send any hair through just take a brush or comb through the section and make sure that you are tangle free. 2) Don&#x27;t try to do too much at once. The larger the section of hair you do the looser your waves will be, and in turn the smaller the section is the tighter and more ringlet like the curl will be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write the reviews, but read them, and in this case I think it is not fare to do not say anything , so after burning myself few times with traditional curling iron I decided to purchase this one because I liked the reviews and the way it looked on a picture. From the day I received it my hair change the style from straight to curly completely, it so easy and fun using this iron , love it.</li>
            <li> The results of a tangle while loading are almost impossible to undo.  I read the instructions first; I was careful.  It sucked in my daughter&#x27;s long hair as expected and then wouldn&#x27;t let go after heating/beeping.  Please don&#x27;t take a chance if your hair is long and fine. I don&#x27;t know why it did this. This is only a guess as to why it occurred.  My husband had to disassemble and then break open the motor to release her hair. Good thing was that it did not burn her hair.</li>
            <li> It even straightens my curly hair. I love this product. it smoothed my hair down and the curls lasted for days. You know the sound you hear &#x27;cush&amp;#34; the frying your hair sound of a regular curling iron, well this curling iron did not make a sound and made my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> This professional curling iron has worked miracles on my normally straight hair. Since I have long, thick hair, I’ve always struggled to find a curling iron that can both give my hair a natural looking curl and also keep that look throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was hesitant about using it because it has such a different design than regular curling irons, but it is actually very easy to use. The heat and timer settings allow you to easily adjust how tight you want your curls~it’s truly a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The split-end damage that I typically experienced with regular curling irons is greatly reduced because it’s a professional level curling iron made with ceramic, which my stylist told me protects the hair from damage. Love the LED-screen displays and timers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d highly suggest the Miraqueen iron to anyone that has had frustrations with their old curling irons and wants to get gorgeous, long-lasting, natural-looking curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! I am soo happy with my Miraqueen!!  I can be really picky about the types of irons and wands I use on my hair.  My hair is a frizzy mess most days, and any heat makes it look dry, dull, and most unfortunately, DAMAGED.  It has been really frustrating wasting money on other really expensive wands without getting the amazing curls I want.  With this iron, I never have to worry about any of that! :)  Other irons I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t get hot enough to keep my curl, or get too hot and I end up burning myself and literally frying my hair.  Being able to regulate the temperature and set the timer, I get the same curl EVERY TIME!  If you&#x27;re looking for a tool that is consistent, easy to use, and gives you an amazing (and lasting) curl - this is my top recommendation!  Appropriately priced and customizable to what works best for YOUR hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loved it!  She has tried to get a curling iron that can make perfect curls and last for a long time. Regular irons don´t make the curls last for a long time since she has a very straight hair.  She loves it because she doesn´t have to wake up early to make her hair before work. She also can do her hair in so many ways because of the different curling options that this iron has. She even did her own hair for going to a wedding and it looked perfect. With a display to see the temperature, she takes good care of her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it´s a great product. You can´t go wrong with it. She is happy with her hair and I´m happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do the job that was advertised</li>
            <li> Great product! Thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the current price and the great reviews.  I watched the videos of it working, and thought, &amp;#34;even I can do that&amp;#34;.  I am no professional, but I have been doing my own hair for about 25 years, so I have a fair amount of experience with gadgets.  I have used everything over the years; sponge rollers, hot rollers, crimping irons, waving irons, flat irons, wands, deep wavers, etc.  I was so excited for Santa to bring me this that I had to stop myself from trying it out early.  So Christmas day, I finally got to check it out.  It is not nearly as user friendly as it seems in the videos, or by reading instructions.  If you have slightly too much hair in a section, it won&#x27;t work.  Which completely defeats the purpose for me since I was hoping for something to work faster than a traditional curling iron.  I have pretty long hair, which I thought might have been the problem, but my sister used it after I did.  Her hair is shorter and much thinner.  Not only did it not work well for her, but her hair got stuck!  Took me about 10 minutes to free it.  Luckily it did not come out crispy.  I have tried several times since, and had slightly better results (despite getting my hair stuck as well).  I find that even with ample time and patience, some curls come out beautiful, and others never quite curl at all.&lt;br /&gt;Glad some find this to be amazing.  I just don&#x27;t happen to be one of them.  Wish I had spent my money on something more user friendly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and my daughter likes it well enough. It makes fairly tight curls.  It has wound the hair too tight and caused it to be stuck but I was able to get it undone, so be ware of that.  Only happened once so far.  It is heavy too.</li>
            <li> I rarely curl my hair, because I&#x27;m lazy. As such, this is a great tool to have around as it makes curling  hair easy and fast in the mornings. I have thick, coarse hair and although it does hold a curl pretty easily, my hair frizzes rather quickly. I was surprised to see with this my curls lasted all day without frizzing. Great product; definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have a huge event coming up in October and I desperately needed a new look! I like my long hair but wanted more volume and curls. After doing a ton of research I settled on this Miraqueen Curling Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! It has changed my life. I have been practicing over the last couple of weeks and everybody can’t stop raving about my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is different than any other curler that I have used before, but I found it really easy to use and I am so thrilled with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an easy to use, safe and effective curling iron than don’t hesitate, this is an amazing product. My hair has never looked this good. It is so fun to use that it doesn’t feel like a chore every day, instead I am enjoying this part of my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I love that my arms don’t get tired anymore while doing my hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long (below my waist) and thick, dark hair that is resistant to just about any styling product or tool. Despite this, I love to have shiny, bombshell curls in my hair. Before I found this curler I would have to take two hours with a traditional curling iron, curling and re-curling to make sure the curls stayed. I love that this curler gets hot almost immediately, and the high heat is perfect for my thick hair. I just straighten my hair first, section it, put my hair in the chamber and set the timer for 10 seconds (which I also love that you can choose how tight of curls you want based on the timers). I get perfect curls each time that last for hours, and it only takes me about 30 minutes to do. I also travel to see my family in Germany a lot and love that this is dual voltage. This is one of the best styling tools I&#x27;ve ever bought, and more affordable than most of them too!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing! There are so many features that I absolutely love! For starters, there is an automatic shut off at one hour. I am always forgetting to turn off my styling products. So that is definitely something that was a must when I was looking to buy. Secondly, there is a setting where you can make the curls go different directions. That comes in handy because it makes it look more natural. Lastly, this is just an overall GREAT product. It was worth the money and it holds up very well. All my friends use it and they&#x27;re looking to buy one! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who curls their hair. Its way more convenient than a regular curler and the curls last forever.</li>
            <li> This is not like any other curling iron, this isn&#x27;t the old fashioned type, the trendy no clip tapered barrel irons, and those in crazy shapes and in many different sizes. This Maraqueen Proffessional Curling Iron is so simple, and you won&#x27;t burn yourself like other nasty hair curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently learned that the newest type of curling iron is one that will automatically curl my hair with little effort. Needless to say, I was very intrigued! This curling iron has a ceramic curling wand inside of the chamber, which minimizes damage and makes my hair shiny. I pull the trigger and allow my hair to enter the chamber, then release it once the curl is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I am able to curl my hair with one hand; it is very quick and automatic. Since I don&#x27;t need to manually curl my hair around the barrel, it makes my curling time much faster! The screen helps me ensure that the iron is at the right temperature so I don&#x27;t wait around for too long, guessing if it is the right temperature yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls produced are beautiful, and if creates a variety of different curling options from tight, defined curls, to relaxed, beachy curls. I enjoy the mulch-directional setting that lets me change the direction of my curls. I used to forget to do this with manual curling irons, so my curls wouldn&#x27;t turn out quite as natural. Now I can switch back and forth for the best possible look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature I enjoy are they rubber protector and heat insulating base that prevent me from fumbling around and burning myself or my bathroom counter. This stops me from having to go back and forth, checking to make sure it is balanced right and won&#x27;t burn anything or pose a fire hazard. The everyday use of the Miraqueen curling iron is effortless and safe. I will never need to buy another curling iron again!</li>
            <li> This is really what it is. A private high tech hairdresser / barber robot for everyone who wishes to improve their looks from ugly to mediocre.  From mediocre to beautiful and handsome.  And for those who already pride themselves as nice looking. to be a real celebrity look alike.</li>
            <li> I like the way this curler works. Excellent.</li>
            <li> I was ready to LOVE this based on the reviews.  I made it 3 curls before I had a signficant snag/pull.  I unplugged the curling iron and tried not to panic when the release trigger didnt release the hair.  It did finally release the hair.  I lost a few strands and decided that while with practice I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d get over the learning curve, BUT I&#x27;m too nervous to try it again.  I have long, layered hair and I did get a beep on the first attempt that I had too much hair in the chamber but I believe that was due to the length of my hair not the thickness of the section (I had less than 1&amp;#34; and I wouldn&#x27;t have wanted pieces curled smaller than that)  I&#x27;m kind of at a loss as to snag.  it almost seemed like it grabbed a few stray hairs that weren&#x27;t in the chamber, but I&#x27;m not even sure how that could happen.  there is no way I&#x27;d be able to do the back of my head.  OK.. maybe with practice..but I&#x27;m pretty good with a curling iron although I was intrigued by the perfect, easy curls, I think I&#x27;ll stick with my old school curling iron.  One other thing to note, the instructions included are in microscopic print vs. the other info.  the website clearly says that an R, L or A will show for Right, Left or Alternating curls. I could see R, L and then nothing showed when I pushed that button a 3rd time for Alternating.  I&#x27;m assuming that meant it was still on Alternate, but since the website also said the chamber wouldn&#x27;t pull or tug (which it can and did) then who knows</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand it makes realy pretty curls. I do wish they would make one of these for bigger curls tho.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron ever!!! I love it!! I can curl my hair in less than 10 minutes!!!</li>
            <li> Now I want to start off by saying I am a failure when it comes to styling hair. My hair is thick and it usually takes at LEAST 30 min to do my hair, no matter what it is I&#x27;m using. Straighteners only work with small sections, curling irons too, curlers take forever to set up and set in, etc. I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to being unable to do my own hair in a timely manner. Not any more! With this magical device, I did my whole head in 20 minutes; less time than it took for me to do my own makeup! Perfect curls, and they STAY. My hair is known to fall over the subsequent hours but these curls stay strong. It is also ridiculously easy to do. Easy enough that my inept hair doing self can do it. Even with my short asymmetrical cut, the back bits were a breeze. Grab a piece, pull it taught, press the button and it does all the work for you. Amazing. It also gives you great control for temperature, time, and direction of the curl. The only thing you&#x27;d want would be a size control, which I&#x27;m sure these people are working on. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 12 yr old daughter. She has long thick hair. This curling iron is amazing and very simple to use! Although I usually curl her hair for her, She surprised me the other day by doing it herself! Great product!</li>
            <li> Because of a mild disability, I find it nearly impossible (and quite dangerous/time consuming) to curl my own hair with a conventional curling iron.  I tried a curling wand with mediocre results.  When I finally found this product, I was thrilled but skeptical.  Then, my sister gave me one for my birthday.  I was nervous the first time I used it.  I imagined my hair becoming impossibly tangled inside the curling chamber and burning off.  However, let me assure you that nothing of the sort has happened yet.  I love this product!  It&#x27;s incredibly easy and safe to use (in comparison  to conventional curling irons).  This morning, for the first time in my life, I was able to curl my hair (and not just the front of my hair) without assistance.  This product really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I have a few important notes about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  It is possible to get your hair tangled in the curling chamber.  This happened while I was curling my mom&#x27;s hair.  However, this mostly happens if you either try to stuff too much hair into the curler at once or if you fail to adequately detangle/separate the hair before curling it.  If you avoid those mistakes, your hair should not become tangled in the curling chamber.  If your hair DOES become tangled, the curler will instantly stop spinning and beep three times.  When that happens, immediately open the curler, slowly work your hair out, fix the problem, and try again.  This approach worked painlessly when my mom&#x27;s hair became tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It is also possible to be burned.  However, I have only been burned after keeping the curler on high for an extended period of time (while my sister, mom, and I were taking turns using it), which gave the protective lining time to heat up.  However, the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; was more of a discomfort and nowhere near as painful as a conventional curling iron burn.  (Think of the sensation when someone is curling your hair with hotsticks and lets them touch your skin.)  When the outside of the curler becomes hot enough to cause discomfort, simply allow the curler to cool down a bit or simply don&#x27;t allow it to directly contact your head during curling (not too difficult).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, if you&#x27;re like me and LOVE your hair curled but become very nervous when someone gets too close to your head with a conventional branding--er, curling--iron, you&#x27;ll adore this product.  I feel very safe while using it.  I&#x27;m definitely giving this product five stars.  While I haven&#x27;t tried the steam version yet, this is the best curling product I&#x27;ve used so far.outside of the curler becomes hot enough to cause discomfort, simply allow the curler to cool down a bit or simply don&#x27;t allow it to directly contact your head during curling (not too difficult).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, if you&#x27;re like me and LOVE your hair curled but become very nervous when someone gets too close to your head with a conventional branding--er, curling--iron, you&#x27;ll adore this product.

            <li> This curling iron is the best. The curls stay all day. Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I have extra long curly hair and this works great especially in humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;It even has a designer look to it.</li>
            <li> this worked beautifully and i love it.  very easy to use and half the price of the most popular one!!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is AMAZING. I had attended my cousin&#x27;s wedding a few months back, and her hair looked beautiful. I asked her what her secret was, and she told me about this product. I just got around to purchasing this recently. I absolutely love it. Where has this been all of my life? This product does just what it says! By far, this is the best curling iron that I have ever used. This does not damage my hair, is super easy and convenient and easy to use, and I always achieve the desired curls that I had in mind. Replace your current curling iron with this one! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I bought the curling iron for my girlfriend, she was very pleased to see it didn&#x27;t pull on here split ends like the other curling iron she had. She also got ready much quicker than usual which I was happy about. She complained a lot about burning herself with the last curling iron she had, she couldn&#x27;t thank me enough when seen there was no way of burning herself at all. It makes her hair look absolutely amazing and it wasn&#x27;t expensive at all, especially with the 20% off :). It shipped very quickly too.</li>
            <li> I admit it, I don&#x27;t like to spend too much time and effort on my hair. Whenever I see advertised products, it just seems to take so much time and effort, and I don&#x27;t have that much time during the day. The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron has changed all that for me. It is easy to use, and works fast. Once I plug it in, it gets started in no time at all. I love that I can choose from 3 different curl settings, which I have never seen on any other curling iron before. The iron is made from ceramic, so I know that my hair is protected. The curling iron also has a chamber for the hair, making sure that my hair doesn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron also has 3 heat settings depending on your hair health. I love this because I can control use the one that is for dyed hair (370 degrees) and my stepdaughter can use it on her normal hair (410 degrees).&lt;br /&gt;Functionally, I love the swivel cord because it makes it convenient to move. I love the design too (pink is definitely my favorite color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this curling iron!</li>
            <li> I loved it!! I curled my hair so fast and curls were so perfect and identical!!) It heats very fast and never burn my fingers( as always was with other curling irons)! It&#x27;s very nice and convenient curling iron --- fast and perfect))))) I would recommend it to all girl</li>
            <li> I have tried many similar products, and this is definitely the best curling iron in terms of being easy and efficient to use, and creating a style that will stay in place for a long time. Anything that saves me time styling my difficult hair is a lifesaver and it&#x27;s makes my hair look quite healthy .The handy LCD screen displays the timer setting, temperature, and curl direction is so easy and safe.</li>
            <li> I had one of the Babyliss ones and found that it would need to be on the maximum time and temperature to make a curl that would stay, and it was not even very tight.  When I got this one (because of the digital controls) I could get the same curl pattern by setting it on 8 seconds and 370 deg, so this one is going to be more flexible in what I can do with it.  In addition, the way the hair goes in is easier to get right, and it does not seem to twist the curl quite as much.  I&#x27;ll definitely be using this one instead.</li>
            <li> This thing is AMAZING for what it does for my hair.  And it gets easier the more I use it. My curls last for several days.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a lady friend and I can not stop getting phone calls from her inquiring and asking where I purchased this curling Iron. Of course I did not want to give the information away as I will be giving both the price and so on. Even though, she kept telling me she loved it and the girls at work need the information because they were so impressed with her results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I eventually gave the information in the interest of World peace [LOL] but the request forced me to do more research and here I am, I can now see why this got recommended to me in the first place. I am compelled to write this to help others.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but thought this deserves one. I was one of those too who steered clear of curling irons due to the various odd burns that I managed to give myself.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy this is you&#x27;re like me. I have long and thick hair and it takes me between 30-45 minutes to get beautiful curls that LAST.</li>
            <li> Took me a little while to get the hang of how to use it correctly. My daughter&#x27;s hair is extremely straight and even when we put curlers in overnight, her hair never seems to retain the curl.  For whatever reason, this seems to work. Giving it four stars because it just takes quite a while, especially if you have a lot of hair.  It&#x27;s quicker to use a curling iron in my opinion, but this product makes the curl last much longer.  Definitely use caution when separating out hair - less is better when loading it in.  But I will say if I ever did suddenly have a &#x27;jam&#x27; where the hair got caught, you knew pretty quickly and it was easy with the open system to get the hair out and try again. I had seen other similar products where the curling area was closed in and I can see if the hair got caught in one of those, it could be a huge problem. So the design of this is better from that perspective.</li>
            <li> Works great. A little hard to use at first until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product. It took me sometime to learn how to use it, but it&#x27;s a great product. Here are some tips, treat the curling iron gently, and do not put too much hair into the roller. Otherwise, the hair do tend to stuck.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tool!  I am embarrassed to admit how much money I have spent on styling tools.  I have a closet full of curling irons, styling wands, hot rollers, etc.  I have never found anything as easy to use with the most amazing results.  I am challenged in the area of styling and I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy this is to use.  Creates beautiful long lasting curls.  Took about 15 minutes.  I have fine medium-long hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl well but that is not true with this product!  Yay!  I can finally clean out my closet!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  Great curls and easy to use.  I initially bought the steam iron version.  I actually like the curls better but the iron broke after one use.  No problems so far with this one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Saves a lot if time</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron. I shopped at Ulta n other stores. My husband showed me a vidio of Miraqueen. I said &amp;#34;This is the one I want&amp;#34;. It is great!! I have very thick, long and unruly hair. It takes me such a shorter time to get my curls rather than a regular curling iron. Not only that, my curls are very pronounced and can last up to three days, with just a quick 20 mins the following morning to freshen up my curls. I highly recommend the&amp;#34;Miraqueen&amp;#34;. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This is a nifty product and creates consistent, pretty curls. You can&#x27;t curl very much hair at once without it getting jammed up and I have a hard time doing the back of my head, but other than that, I&#x27;m very satisfied  with it. I saw that it&#x27;s advertised as only taking 5 minutes, which is NOT true (unless you barely have any hair), but you&#x27;ll be satisfied if you have reasonable expectations.</li>
            <li> Congratulations on buying something you&#x27;ll be excited about, will use twice, will give you super mild results, and then you will put away awkwardly because it&#x27;s huge and think about throwing out for a year before you finally give it to a friend who will do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best hair curling invention/product ever! Doesn&#x27;t burn your head or hands, makes perfect curls every time and the curls last a long time!! I don&#x27;t know why curling irons are even still around with something this awesome to take its place.</li>
            <li> Tons of curls can be created with one tool... I love that. It heats up quickly and is ready for me to use in less than 2 minutes. This curling iron also has multiple heat settings to choose from. The styling time is fast but the curls look like it may have taken me hours to create. I love that I am choose different curls for different days.The curling iron is light weight, which helps with your arm getting tired while using it. The curling iron hit all of my expectations. I especially love the rotary function. This lets the me choose the direction that the motor spins my hair. My curls are bouncy, frizz free, and full of volume. I love that it is  ceramic, which makes it less damaging for your hair than metal curling irons. It is also very easy to glide your hair through the clasp, while some other curling irons will snag your hair while pulling it through. Mine came with a protective heat case to put over the iron for storage, which I find extremely helpful. With the protective case, you can put the curling iron away right after use instead of waiting for it to cool down. I also find the LED screen to be a pretty cool feature to have on a hair tool. It displays the timer, temperature, and direction of the curl. The swivel cord is also a added life saver, because it doesn&#x27;t limit you while you are working on your hair. The automatic power off feature is extremely important because I have forgotten about my hair tools being on and left them sitting there for at least an hour before I noticed them. I love that this curling iron offers this feature because it is one less thing I have to worry about. And I love the &amp;#34;safety first&amp;#34; attitude! Over all this is a great curling iron. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very upset, I bought this and hardly used it and it stopped working after maybe 8 uses. I also can not find this on Amazon nor find the seller. Way too pricey for this to happen. Don&#x27;t buy.  I ended up getting a refund from Amazon. Good idea, bad product and bad service. I would give zero stars.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how easy this product is to use. I always seem to have a difficult time getting my hair to curl with a normal curling iron, but with this one it makes the process so simple and it works like a charm every time! I also love the fact that it has an LED screen which makes it easy for you to see the temperature and any other information you need to know to give you the best curl in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the iron lets you know when it&#x27;s done by beeping and the whole system makes it feel much more safer than the ordinary curling iron (where it is entirely too easy to cause damage to your hair). I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to be in control of their curling process but still be able to do it with ease and with a lesser risk of damaging their hair. Even with my super straight hair, this product worked wonders! If you don&#x27;t have it, you&#x27;re definitely missing out.</li>
            <li> it is good to use. my daughter likes it.</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron. It works pretty well, and the color is nice. It&#x27;s good to find a new brand with great products. I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend. Worth trying!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my girlfriend.  She complained about her old one so I thought I would surprise her with a new one.  I had no clue what I was looking for, I just read reviews and remembered what she complained about in reference to her old one.  Her hair looks great and it takes a lot less time for us to get ready to go.  Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> This the best cutest curling and iron I&#x27;ve owned!  I love the easy to read display and buttons.  The color looks great in my bedroom AND bathroom!  It worked wonders on my hair for Halloween dress up as well as going out on the town! It makes my hair bouncy and full, exactly what I wanted!  I would suggest you buy this as well!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical after to many 5 star reviews that maybe the reviews were fake. My fine hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl super well, it usually looks limp after a while, but I curled my hair with this Miraqueen, and it lasted all day. Then I slept on it and it lasted all the next day too, which only hairspray. Yes, the second day was a bit more of a relaxed curl, but it still looked good. I brought it to work and all my co-workers want one now  but looking online it isn&#x27;t on Amazon any more. Weird.</li>
            <li> I have been using curling irons for decades and the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is definitely one of my top ten favorites. It&#x27;s quick, works well, and best of all, it has a timer! My biggest problem with curling irons is trying to remember how long I&#x27;ve had the hair rolled up. Of course, I’d worry about damaging my hair, but end up not getting the best curling action.  This curling iron solves that problem with its built in timer. If you are in the market for a new curling iron, I highly recommend the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for her birthday and she absolutely LOVES it!!! She loves curly hair, but with three kids she never had the time, or privacy, to work on curling her hair. She asked me to get her a high end curling iron for her birthday; I researched the “Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron” and saw so many people having success. My wife was very happy with the purchase and brags about her curly hair to all of her friends. The Miraqueen cut her time down dramatically for getting ready each day, but doesn’t trade off quality. She was a little apprehensive about all the features and controls at first, but got the hang of it in no time. This is definitely worth the investment because it works great on any type of hair, and saves time in the process. Needless to say that we have been very happy with this purchase; yes I say “we” because I live by Rule #1 – Happy wife, happy life!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling for my girlfriend when I some how ruined her old one... Long story.  Anyways, she loves it.  She tells me every time that her curls last a lot longer than her last one and shes glad I broke her old one.  According to her its lightweight and has the perfect temperature controls.  She loves the curling iron she even get some of her friends to buy the same the same one.  The thing isn&#x27;t too big I guess for a curling iron and according to my lady, it does what it needs to do really good too.  Lightweight, great temperature settings, and a nice design.  For long lasting curls I would say give it a shot if you want to look as good as she does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into her side of things, (looking presentable) but I wanted to get her something special that also is practical ( and not jewelry). After I remembered how much she cursed at her curling iron every morning, I did some digging and found the Miraqueen. She raves about it. I&#x27;ve personally noticed that her hair looks and feels better, and it doesn&#x27;t take her nearly as long to get ready. There is even a feature where it shuts itself off just in case you forget, which I love because I don&#x27;t have to worry about the house burning down. She also mentioned the rubber protector which keeps her skin at a safe distance. Another perk! I&#x27;d recommend it if you want to keep your significant other happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely delighted to have bought this. I have thin frizzy shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used the lowest heat setting on the longest timer, and every curl came out perfect! I followed the directions keeping hair width to an inch or less and I had no troubles with it getting caught in the machine.&lt;br /&gt;I alternated the curl direction and my hair looks so natural, smooth and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;It was light weight so my arms never got tired while holding it up. It has a generous cord length so i was free to move around with it.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed :-)</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair that is hard to curl.  I absolutely love this curling iron.  While it does take small amounts of hair the amount of time to curl my hair is about 20 minutes. It works so much better on my hair than the regular curling irons.  I was very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I purchased. I have medium length hair (about 2-3 inches past shoulders ), and it is both thin and fine. I have NEVER been able to get my hair to hold any curl for longer than maybe an hour....and thats being generous. It didn&#x27;t matter if I used tons of product, styled while hair was dirty....nothing ever worked. Until I bought this little miracle. Even with zero product, this amazing contraption leaves my hair with perfect curls every single time. Like curls I never thought I&#x27;d have without purchasing a high-end wig. I don&#x27;t know why this works so well, but it does. I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 months now, and I use it at least twice a week. Curls last so long that they are still pretty day 2, even after sleeping on. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product. I&#x27;m not going to go so far as to say it has changed my life, but its pretty damn great.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is so unique. Before my sister got one, had never seen anything like it. Honestly, kinda terrifying to use the first time. There was a concern it would suck up my hair in a messy tangle. My fears were all unfounded! The curling iron&#x27;s ceramic chamber really helps curl all of my extremely long strands of hair. The digital settings are easy to use and once you find a sweet spot, you always know what you are getting. Has a rubber protector too that protects your face from getting burned by the heating component. In short - great for curling long hair.</li>
            <li> After much research and debate, I chose to purchase this amazing curling iron. The heating control is terrific. the handle is very easy to hold on to. It Heats up really fast and well. Tames coarse and frizzy hair.  the end of the barrel where the plastic attaches never gets hot and it is big enough to hold stable so you can control the end and curl long long pieces. This iron is AMAZING!! my hair holds cute corkscrew curls all day long with barely any hairspray. This will last a long time. It is a great product. it is simply the best curling iron I have ever owned/used. It heats fast. It creates wonderful curls. My hair is straight and I tried many different brand names but this curling iron has always produced the best results for me, and I have had my hair at various lengths over the years. You won&#x27;t regret spending the extra money to buy this. It&#x27;s a great purchase for your money.</li>
            <li> Loving this curling iron.  I have purchased 2 others and neither compare to quality of the curl I experience with this iron.  I have thick hair so generally curls fall from my hair quite quickly. Not with this iron. I wish I could insert a picture. My curls last all night and get this ladies into the morning too.  If you have thicker hair and want curls this is the iron for you.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this curling iron. I have never been great at curling my hair, but with this, it&#x27;s makes things so simple. The automatic count down is idiot proof making a flawless curl. I have very thick hair and works like a charm, just don&#x27;t overload the curling iron or it&#x27;ll snag up. I did try this on my mom&#x27;s very thin hair and it snagged up quite a few times. Maybe a sure thing for women with thicker hair. I&#x27;m able to curl my whole head in about 20-25 minutes, without any struggling. Shipping was fast and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> It works.  You must have patience and only do small sections at a time.  I took mine to the office to show the gals - they all loved it.....</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and it hangs pretty limp if I don’t use a lot of product and make the effort to really style it. I love this curler because my hair looks so nice and full. And, it doesn’t take much time, either! I used to fuss with hot rollers and had to allow for so much extra time in the mornings to get ready. Now, I can get ready in half the time. And this curler makes curls exactly how I wanted. I’ve tried the Remington curler and did not like it as I could only curl in one direction. This device makes my curls lay so much nicer!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend since she wanted her hair curled and she had bought many other curling irons that did not work in her hair. She has been using this curling iron for about 2 weeks and its working perfect on her hair ( she looks HOT lol ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is really happy that I bought this for her and I am happy as well for her to look good for me ha.</li>
            <li> This curling iron gets hot very fast and maintains temperature the whole time while I&#x27;m doing my hair. The automatic timers comes in handy. My curls have last all day and are very cute.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought this years ago!! I can curl all of my hair in about 5 minutes and it looks super cute!</li>
            <li> Ohhhh emmmm gggggg !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shizity actually works!!!&lt;br /&gt;Holly molls it&#x27;s like I went to the salon. Awesome curls! No more sloppy hair curl days. This is the real deal. I recommend watching some YouTube videos just to see how to use it. Super simple tho. And very quick! Loveeeeee</li>
            <li> My daughters all have long hair and it would not take all their hair into the curling mechanism.  Today we tried it one last time and we almost had to take it apart to get my oldest daughters hair out because it became so tangled inside and I wasn&#x27;t going to cut her hair out.  After 20 minutes of wrestling with it, we finally were able to pull/untangle her hair.  I will never use it on her long hair again.</li>
            <li> ehhh it works but even with my thick obedient hair the curls didn&#x27;t come out that great and they didn&#x27;t hold. I had been busy with final exams and then Christmas break so I missed my window to return it. It was the most expensive hair tool I ever purchased and I was not impressed at all</li>
            <li> I was crushed when my old iron died.  I ordered this one because it had everything I was looking for (ceramic - high heat – timer).  WOW!  Now I’m glad the old one is gone!  Not only is my new Miraqueen beautiful but TOP quality.  The LED screen helps me achieve my best hair ever!  Disclaimer: I obtained this item at a discount for my unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> Words can do no justice to the awesomeness that is this curling iron. I was a bit skeptical when reading all of the positive reviews on this one, simply because I&#x27;ve been so disappointed with similar products in this price range. I can happily say that as I write this review, not only does my hair look fabulous, but it didn&#x27;t cost me an arm and a leg to make it happen. This curling iron has FAR EXCEEDED my expectations. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Good product alternative to the high priced versions, has great setting features.  The drawbacks are that you have t be meticulous as to how you load your hair, or it will get &amp;#34;rejected&amp;#34;.  I suppose this happens regardless of the brand.  The other issues is that the curler has to always face one direction, which can be awkward for holding and loading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps with time and practice, the advertised increased speed of curling your hair will actually happen.</li>
            <li> Where has this curling iron been my whole life?  That’s what I want to know.  I absolutely love everything about it!  The way you can easily adjust the tightness of the curls, the lack of additional damage to the hair, the perfect curl every time with very little effort.  I have long, coarse hair that has a loose, but non-uniform natural wave to it.  It has never held a curl well until now.  Now I can curl my entire head, fast and with ease and the curls come out uniform and there’s no frizz!  That alone makes this product worth its weight in gold to me.  If you have not tried this yet, you just don’t know what you are missing out on.  Beautiful, uniform, long-lasting, no-frizz curls, and no burnt fingers, I can’t recommend this product enough!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and it tends to do whatever the heck it wants to do. I also have fine hair, so usually whatever curling iron I use to control my uncontrollable curls, it doesn&#x27;t set or last all day. Upon first use, I wasn&#x27;t expecting good results. By the end of my work day, my hair was still bouncy curly and the curls held! If you have fine, naturally curly hair, this is the iron you want!</li>
            <li> Love the timing settings and audible beeps on this curler. Knowing (and more important being reminded) how long the curler has been applied helps to get a consistent and predictable look every time.  I also love that this will turn off automatically instead of staying all day causing a safety hazard with little kids running around. Great curling iron.</li>
            <li> After getting my first curler from my new roommate, my hair and lifestyle has changed completely. I have always lived a misery and always trying to find the best hair style for myself often and often. As a fervent addict and a woman with very big obsession for natural curl, you really should have noticed that I have my own day dreams about how I want my hair to look like. I have problems with my natural lovely curly hair because I have never found any curler that could not damage my hair. My hair is naturally dry and I go through a lot of misery to keep it clean and curl, some curlers only end up giving me pain by drying my hair out too much and some just go to the extreme of giving me more frizz than my desired curl. But the curler here is just the best, it does the exact opposite, it curls my hair so perfectly without leaving any trace of frizz at all.    The most interesting thing about this Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is that I did not spend too much time to get used to it. Unlike several curlers I have been using, it takes me so much time before I get used to them. Immediately I handle this curler, I just get the perfect angle from several directions of my head and the result is the beautiful, gorgeous new me! This amazing curler has three dynamic settings for three different kinds of curls; I am more obsessed with the lowest one because it gives me a very loose curl that I do enjoy during summer. It is my favorite beach wave that I prefer for casual and formal events. This curler is just naturally pretty; I never taught I could find something like this, so my new roommate is a blessing! She asked me why I would like to share my review and I brought her attention to something very important to me, unlike several other curlers that I have tried out, this one does not wear out later in the day, I just keep looking brilliant from morning till the end of the night, my curls are now permanent and neat, this is because the curler products adequate heat that results in the permanent curls.    The second curler setting on its own is the medium setting which I also prefer for very good formal events such as weddings, book dedications and most times when I am getting a new award. There was this award night I attended recently that left me breathless because more than six ladies came back to my home to use my curler and I had to spend time doing their hair lol, that was the first time I became a hair stylist. Two of the ladies are from South Korea with this lovely beautiful shinning black hair; I had so much fun to change their thick straight long hair to beautiful curly style without so much trouble using my curler. The curler is absolutely simple to use and easy to play around with. I taught that their hair was gonna break loose and fall after some hours because I did not have so much experience working on peoples hair until we were all amazed how long their hair lasted before they left my place.    The last curl setting for this curler is my roommate&#x27;s favorite because it has more of a perm effect and style, she is half British so she likes this Taylor Swift curl. That&#x27;s what captivated me and I started using her curler behind her back, her curls are so natural, pretty, and they appear to be so damn tight, I am not yet used to her own kind of curl and the setting so much but I think am still doing pretty fine with my super curls that looks so cute, I think my roommates&#x27; curl is sometimes childish but she is such a lovely belle that looks so cute so I believe there is a charm behind this.    Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is super cool, very easy to understand and smooth to use. It has this little beep settings that will give you a proper idea about its preheating and will even give you an idea of the time you should hold down the curler to get the special type of curl you want. The beep is adjustable and to several heat levels for different type of hair. This is the fifth month of using this curl now, my little niecejust took my curler so am here to get another one right now, I don&#x27;t have any kind of issues with this curler. Is is such a great product and a wonderful brand that every woman needs to get at home, I really recommend this Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron to everyone out there who wants to look simply awesome, if you have a curler presently, I am pretty sure this one is better than your best curler.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic curling iron and the absolute best bargain you can get for your money.  My wife had tried several other brands of curling irons, some of them more expensive than this one, and there was always something she didn&#x27;t like about them.  They either took too long or damaged her hair.  This one is perfect. Quick curling and great results!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great product! Easy and safe to use for all with a dynamic incorporation of ceramic heating chambers and safety pads to keep you and your hair at your best. Easily the easiest way to curl your hair; and what&#x27;s even better, the LED screen and controls make it easy to adapt the heat and timer, allowing you to get just the right curls with ANY kind of hair. The pivoting base makes it easy to handle the Miraqueen without getting tangled and interrupting the task at hand: PERFECT CURLS!!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical that there was any curling iron that could tame my thin, stick straight hair that not only will not curl and will not hold a curl but goes limp at the first hint of any moisture. And at $60 which is a little pricey for me. But I was SO wrong. This thing is a major miracle. It works just like it is advertised to. And so many great features. I have burned my arm and face on other curling irons but it is virtually impossible to do with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it seemed  little bulky but once I got the hang of it, it was easy. The videos here were really helpful. I was impressed that the manufacturer put the actual temperature of the iron on the control panel. Other  curling irons I had used in the past just fried my hair which is baby fine. I can&#x27;t begin to imagine how hot those other irons were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this one hadn&#x27;t had such great reviews, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have even tried another curling iron. For years I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair in a simple pony tail or bun because my hair just didn&#x27;t curl. Now, except for house cleaning days, those days are gone, gone, gone. It is so cool to have pretty, curly hair again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had long hair (to the middle of my back) and short hair (above my chin). I&#x27;ve tried other curling irons, but they didn&#x27;t really work great for what I&#x27;d need. I have thick hair, and that makes curling it tricky. It doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well, and it goes for waves unless I practically fry it by keeping it in the iron too long. The Miraqueen curling iron works amazingly well for my hair. The timer system on it is great! I can set it for the time I want and be sure it will give me the best curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ceramic curler gives an even distribution of heat over the entire section of hair to be curled, without pulling like metal curlers do. The time and temperature settings make it easy to set the exact specifications for your unique hair curling needs. It even has an automatic shut off if it&#x27;s left in your hair for more than 25 seconds, or if it&#x27;s simply left on for more than an hour. The safety features in place on this curling iron are fantastic, and very much appreciated by an easily distracted adult such as myself. The handle on it even turns to adjust when I need to move around while curling!</li>
            <li> My sister bought this for me as a gift, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d get much use out of it. But I love it. My hair is really straight and fine and was a little unsure of how this Miraqueen iron would work on it. I&#x27;ve use rod curling irons before and always end up with burnt fingers and thumbs...and it was a nightmare trying to curl my fine hair around the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron has revolutionised my curling process. No fighting trying to get all of your hair around the rod and my fingers and thumbs are burn-free. The whole process to curl your hair is a safer and more efficient process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s multiple heat settings so you can control the strength of the curl, and there&#x27;s an audible reminder when it&#x27;s time to release you hair from the curling iron. It couldn&#x27;t be more simple! Very easy to use, and ideal when you&#x27;re feeling a little bit sleepy in the morning and not paying attention!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another useful feature is the swivel socket so your cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled up as you move around your head creating curls. All in all a really great product that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who wants a head full of curls with the least amount of pain and effort.</li>
            <li> Best hair straightener on the market. I have used this multiple times a week, for about two weeks now. I have thick long dark hair a little past my shoulder length. I can do all my hair in less than ten minutes. The iron heats up very quickly, and i use the 12 second timer. Then it beeps to know that the 12 seconds is complete. Love this and would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants some curls with less effort.</li>
            <li> Finally a company that understands how to make a curling iron!  I have very fine, straight thinning hair and adding some volume or curl to it makes it look much fuller.  But I hate traditional curling irons - they don&#x27;t do well in small bathrooms, they scorch hair, the curl doesn&#x27;t last, and who hasn&#x27;t had a burn from using one?  This curling iron is worth it just because it is motorized and pulls the hair into the chamber, rather than clumsily having to wrap it around a hot barrel yourself.  The number of adjustments is amazing - adjust the heat to exactly what works for your hair... change the direction the winding barrel turns... and a trigger control.  This will probably be the last curling iron you buy... until you wear it out and need a new one!</li>
            <li> Great Product! Miraqueen iron is so easy to use! Its worth the price. One of the best curling device out-there. I&#x27;m definitely recommending it!</li>
            <li> Wow. This is the most sophisticated curling iron... period! incredible. Easy to use yet fully maximum control. This is like a luxury vehicle - but for your hair. If you are deciding to get it - GET IT!!</li>
            <li> I bought the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron as a gift for my sister who just finished cosmetology school.  I had no idea what to get her and I came across the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.  Lucky for me, she absolutely loves it!!  She had all of her friends come over and try it out too.  She said it heats up quickly, is easy to use, and the curls last much longer than any other curling iron she has used before.  It is also safer then traditional curling irons, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about burning yourself.  The purchase was definitely worth the money and I will be recommending it as a gift in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this still trying to play with it but first 2 times I have used it worked awesome!! I have long hair with layers and still work, still getting use to it. :)</li>
            <li> I seriously love this product. First, let me tell you I have overly processed hair. I have dyed it and relaxed it many times. So, in the beginning I was a little apprehensive when I bought the product. When I first used it, I noticed it did not leave my hair feeling &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; like smoke coming from it. I really love how it has a timer on it to tell me when to release the iron. I mean lets face it, to get tight  curls we often leave the iron in our hair longer than we should. Next, I like how it does not damage my hair because of the cermanic in the iron. I went to my stylist the other day, and she was impressed that I didnt have a lot of split ends. My most favorite part of the product is it keeps me from burning my scalp and fingers. I am so guilty of this,, I always curl my hair close to my scalp to give it a tight curly look, but the iron is designed to give it a tight curly look without burning your scalp or burning your hair. Did I mention I didnt have to wrap my hair around the iron to curl it? LOL that was always the hard part for me cause my hair is super long. A task like that tires me out. Personally, I think every female should have this iron in their beauty box.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife.  After doing many hours of extensive research I came to the conclusion of purchasing this model.  I am an mechanical engineer by trade and a technology enthusiast, so once I started researching curling irons (which was a little weird at first), I began looking for an Iron that had many features but also is dependable and we won&#x27;t be replacing it after a week like so many things we buy trying to save a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife told me &#x27;just get me a simple one&#x27;.  The Miraqueen is a simple one, with many,many awesome features.  We purchased this a few months ago, and since then she has praised me almost daily for buying her the perfect birthday gift.  And it makes her look great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the women:  This is a great product and gives you the capability of amazing beauty.&lt;br /&gt;For the men:  Buy this for your wife/girlfriend or anyone you think needs better looking hair!</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is the perfect gift to put an end to the curling iron nightmares and horrors. I like the many good things that were being said about this product. Isn’t’ it time to stop the curling iron burns while creating long lasting curls and waves that you can be confident about?  This amazing curling iron is made with the coolest ceramic technology in helping to eliminate frizz and loss through hair breakage and damage.&lt;br /&gt;  Since different hair types require different settings that’s not a problem  with The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron because it has 3 heat levels to choose from and 4 timer settings and if you forget about your timing, one of the many fascinating features about this curling iron is, it will actually shut off to prevent any damage.  If for some reason you forget which setting you placed it on, don’t worry because it has an LED screen which displays timer, temperature, and also curl direction.&lt;br /&gt;  Its funny when I think about in times past with other curling irons how I got my cord wrapped around me or I knocked things over reaching for a comb.  Another great feature of The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is that is has a swivel cord connection that would prevent you from getting tangled.  This iron can also be used by any gender because of its ease of use and if you work in a hair salon your customers will appreciate their awesome hair experience.  Your hair is sucked into the hair chamber to get tight curls that won’t go flat in a day which is always admirable and that’s one of the best features of this amazing curling iron.  Get a professional look for a fraction of the cost. You will welcome those extra admiring glances!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. It took a bit of practice and time to figure out how to get nice curls for me, but I have extremely thin and flyaway hair so that is the case with almost any curling iron or flat iron I use so can&#x27;t complain about that. If you have thicker hair it will probably go in much much easier with less practice since fly aways aren&#x27;t much of an issue for you. If you have thin flyaway hair like me I recommend combing it straight over and over and getting rid of any waves and tangles before using to minimize problems and challenges using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls came out nice and bouncy and held good all day without adding any hair product so great for a natural look that you can run your fingers through. The best thing about this product is how quickly it set the curls, much faster than other products I have used. If you are willing to put in a bit of time learning to use it and play around with it a bit the product gives quick long lasting curls. Very very nice.</li>
            <li> No more getting burned! Yea, this works well. My wife and daughter agree. It is easy to use, lightweight and very stylish they say. This professional curling iron does the job it says and the customer service was great too. Highly recommended for your girl teens and wives that are into looking cute :-) I would definitely recommend to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> stopped working after 2 months</li>
            <li> Read the instructions!  Read the instructions and you&#x27;ll be fine.  IF you don&#x27;t, you may get your hair tangled up in it.  Do not put too much hair at a time in.  If used properly, it does a great job!</li>
            <li> The best curling iron out there! I have used this so many times and it just works so perfectly. I have thick hair and it just seems to not be affected by it. I love this and I will be getting another one for my sister. I recommend you get this also</li>
            <li> A gift to my girlfriend. She naturally has long and wavy hair, and wouldn&#x27;t stop talking about having curly hair. Well, she&#x27;s very touchy about her hair and was very concerned with using devices like this to do the job. Myself, I wouldn&#x27;t mind her hair being straight or curly, but this device has really made her looks stunning. The speed it works in is just incredible. I never knew how far a little curler could go. She&#x27;s very impressed with this iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron for a friend and she loves it! I tested it out on my hair and I did her hair with it too for her birthday. It&#x27;s not like a normal iron so it takes some getting use to. First of all is pink so that makes me like it even more. We also noticed that our curls lasted a bit longer. I liked the automatic curling and the beep that lets you know when to release your hair. I&#x27;ve never paid that much for a curling iron before but now I want one for myself.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I used it hours earlier &amp; my curls still look tight &amp; bouncy. It was simple to use, there were a few times where I could tell my hair was about to get caught in the chamber &amp; I just released the button to allow the hair to come out. The times this would happen I noticed it was due to operator error, once I realized the angle of the curler had to be parallels with my head it corrected the issue. Would def recommend!</li>
            <li> I got this curling wand to help with my niece&#x27;s hair during pageants and I cannot say enough great things about it.  I chose it because she is very young and has difficulty sitting still for long periods of time to have her hair done before each pageant.  We used to use a conventional curling iron with an exposed metal cylinder and we were always afraid that if she moved or bounced or shifted, she would get burned.  This fantastic curling iron makes it easy to do her hair without all the worry.  The use of the curl chamber and rubber protector keeps any hot surfaces away from her face and head and since there isn&#x27;t any hot metal exposed, we never have to worry about where we set it down.  The automatic shut-off feature is also a lifesaver since pageant days can be a little hectic and crazy.  Can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough!!</li>
            <li> I received the Miraqueen Professional Curing Iron as a gift from my mom. A friend of hers said her daughter loved this curling iron.  I wasn’t too sure what to make of it as I have never seen a curling iron that looked quite like this.  It appeared bulky and a bit high tech.  But since my mom recommended it, I gave it a try and the results were amazing.  I have kinky hair and wanted a smoother, looser curl.  And that is exactly what I got.  It was a BREEZE to use. Unlike a single barrel curling iron, you can pick the size of the curl.  Another really cool feature is the alternating curl.  The alternating curl directs each curl in the opposite direction of the last curl which looks a lot more natural than the curls all going in one direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron also has temperature settings based on your hair type.  You don’t have to worry about scorching your hair.  No guessing if the temperature is going to be too hot or too cool to get the job done.  But you can also adjust the temperature manually if you wish.  And there is a timer for your curls to make sure you leave your hair in the chamber the right amount of time for the curl you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Miraqueen to anyone who wants beautiful, quality, natural looking, long-lasting curls in half the time without the work.</li>
            <li> This works very well.  I was nervous about a tool that sucks your hair up inside of it.  However, you don&#x27;t even feel it pulling your hair inside.  I thought I would feel a tugging feeling.  You don&#x27;t.  You do have to make sure that you&#x27;re not trying to put too much hair in it at once.  Smaller sections works much better.  I really like how it does my hair, and I thought it was worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> My hair is in love with this curling iron. Sometimes I want to do my hair in fun waves and go out with the friends. Now that I have &amp;#34;Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron&amp;#34; I can with little to no stress. It heats up fast and is easy to you. I know what you will love it too.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you guys something... this curling iron is ALL OF THAT and then some!  It takes a lot to win me over and the Miraqueen  Curling Iron did just that. My long hair is extremely difficult to manage and it is rare for any hair product to actually curl it. In the mornings, I would often be inside of my bathroom frustrated beyond belief with my hair. Late last year, I had purchased the CHI Air curling iron and I absolutely hated it!  It was so hard to curl my hair because it would not grasp the strands. My hair smelt burnt  and the little curl that the iron did give, did not last for more than an hour before completely going straight. Two failed irons later, I had given up hope of effectively curling my hair for my gatherings/events. That was until a girlfriend of mine recommended Miraqueen to me a few months ago. After using hers a couple of times and noticing positive results, I had to have this iron for myself.  I ordered this  curling iron in August and have been in love with it ever since. It is fairly easy to use and is by far the best hair investment that I have made this year. I would definitely recommend this, ladies!</li>
            <li> I started using this wonderful curler as soon as it arrived. It works just as the tutorials on Youtube described and I absolutley love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron to replace my daughter&#x27;s older broken curling iron a few months back and so far she says it has been fantastic for her. She loves the way it does her hair and she loves how simple it is to use. She has recommended this already to all of her friends, so I figured I would put her positive review on the internet! Great purchase and fantastic value!</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen has totally won both my wife, and my daughter over. Every morning is a rush to bathe, dress for school, work and out the door. So a product like this is invaluable to the lovely ladies in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the weight is good and the girls say the design, placement of the buttons, and heating time are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making two important people in my life so happy!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! To begin, I love how the buttons are a digital fashion and easy to reach while you are using the iron. I love that I do not have to spend two hours in the morning doing my hair. Instead, I can do my hair in under an hour! I don&#x27;t even have to do my hair every day. The curls last for several days! Overall, this is a great product and I highly recommend to all!</li>
            <li> Great Product! Works great and looks good. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> One needs practice to use efficiently.  Small hanks of hair work much better than large or medium.  Medium length hair also works better.  And FORGET it only taking 5 minutes to do your hair.  That is a complete fabrication.  I purchased it to use on children&#x27;s long hair. Younger one did not want to sit that long. Tried to speed it up by using larger widths of hair...don&#x27;t be tempted.  It got caught in the chamber and had to be wrenched out thus breaking off the hair strands (not to mention pain to the client.)  Probably a great product for teenagers and younger adults.  Be sure to section hair and work from the bottom up.  I watched a video before trying to use it which really helped get the hang of how it was supposed to work.</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use, so it saves time in the morning when you rushing to get out of the house with two kids biting at your ankles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- style really holds up (i.e. my hair doesn&#x27;t just fall flat in two hours)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- safety features - I admit that I was dubious about the &amp;#34;rubberized layer&amp;#34; that supposed to keep you from burning yourself.  It actually does work as advertised!  Even better is auto shutoff.  Mornings in my house are hectic - I have not yet left a a curling iron on, but it&#x27;s definitely something I worry about, so this gives some peace of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> You may not believe in love at first sight, but you’ll truly like the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron. It’s also a hair curler and curling wand with ceramic curling chamber. It’s easy to use and you’ll be able to figure out how to use it in no time at all. And it’s also a fantastic gift idea for both teens and adults.

It will be totally up to you!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.She had an old one that finally gave out on her. This thing looked awesome and its at a good price.She loves it. tells me how easy it is to use. She loves the heat setting on it and the with the timer she dont forget how long she has been at it.(thats another story on its own lol) anyway this is a great product I am glad i found it because she loves it and is buying another for a back up just incase. Keep up the great work.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!! This miraqueen iron is totally next level... has a control panel, LCD screen, cord that swivels, and a trigger to press. Works excellently and is superior to the other irons I&#x27;ve had over the years. You can lower or increase the heat, based on your preference. This is a great treat for those who want their hair to look better and to save time when doing it. 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> My hair is suppppperr long, so it usually takes quite a while to curl it. This made it really easy to curl my hair in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready, way better then the cheap one I used to use :D!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED screen is really splendid, it makes me feel like I&#x27;m using the future of beauty products. I like the timer, it lets me calculate how tight I want my curls. Automatic Curling is the best. thing. ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls stay in for soooo long! I definitely recommend the Miraqueen Curling Iron! Give it a try! :D</li>
            <li> This is a really great product, I have nothing but good things to say... It&#x27;s heat up time is fast and It does it&#x27;s job faster then other curling irons I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the led display because I can keep a eye on the temperature and the automatic curling feature is a life saver..This is my new go to curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have the hair from hell when it comes to curling irons, NOTHING will keep it curled. I have tried a ton of irons, gels, sprays, creams even salon perms fall out leaving me with limp dead hair.&lt;br /&gt;I had resolved myself to flat hair when a friend of mine insisted on using the MiraQueen on me. I think I have been a guinea pig for nearly every hair care product ever made. The curls looked good at first but I waited for the failure that always comes. It didn&#x27;t, 4 hours later it was still curled. Further testing showed that the curls could hold up for nearly 10 hours before being completely flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered one and loved how fool proof the machine is. The LED display tells me when it is up to temp. It beeps when I should remove it there is no guess work, which is great for those like me that don&#x27;t use an iron every day and know less than nothing about them. There are hundreds of styles that can be obtained with just this one iron. I haven&#x27;t burned myself or my hair, unlike previously owned models and I can use it one handed. And I can use it myself; which is a major accomplishment for me who ALWAYS has a pony tail for no reason other than it is a style that is quick and easy. Now I can do other styles myself or give my tail some extra bounce by adding a couple loose waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The safety features are also great, because I don&#x27;t use an iron all the time I am highly prone to not shutting it off. No one likes to have to run back home to check their iron so it can&#x27;t burn the house down, the heat protectors and automatic shut off are home savers for air-brained people like myself. I really have no complaints with the product, it is well worth the price. Should mine ever die I will look into replacing with another MiraQueen. The iron seems REALLY well made, I have had ones in the past that felt like they were going to fall apart if I looked at them wrong, my MiraQueen has even dove off the counter and lived to tell the tale; which makes it one well build iron in my book.on in my book.</li>
            <li> This things great! :D It gives maximum heat, once I sprits some heat protector on my hair, my curls aren&#x27;t going anywhere!  I like the monitor and timer. I curl only for a set time without burning my hair. Great for prom days! :)</li>
            <li> If you are using a traditional curling iron, you need to trade it in for this gem!! I love my Miraqueen pro curling iron. It is far more advanced, timing each curling for you and letting you know when to remove from the hair. This prevents frying and drying it out too.  You can modify the settings according to which type of wave or curl you would like. I brought mine on vacation and did my sister&#x27;s long  hair and now she&#x27;s hooked.  It is not only effective at giving great curls, but its FAST. This is a must for me before work in the morning. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in awhile.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t believe that this actually worked!  My hair is nearly impossible to curl!  I was able to curl my hair and not have to use a whole can of hair spray!  No matter how much I used hair spray and a curling iron it never EVER managed to keep curls as long as I could with this product.  As long as you don&#x27;t try to curl your hair in the shower you will be fine.  It won&#x27;t work there.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curler. I have hair as short as above my ears, and it curled it wonderfully. I haven&#x27;t ever been able to curl my hair so easily, and it even works on my heat resistant wigs, which is a major plus with Comic Con tomorrow! The package arrived in perfect condition and the instructions were very clear. Thank you so much for this amazing product!!</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is absolutely phenomenal! The instructions are easy to understand and I had no difficulty figuring out how to use it the first time. It was gentle on my hair and did not pull or tangle at all. The curls are amazing. I have always had very thin hair that can never seem to hold a curl, but with the Miraqueen the curls lasted all day! I prefer the Miraqueen to any other way to curl hair. Unlike other curling irons I never have to worry about burning myself, which is something I have experienced a lot. It is also very quick, easy and comfortable unlike foam curlers. I will never go back to using my old curling iron after this! Everyone needs the Miraqueen!</li>
            <li> This Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is an amazing product. The price listed here is well below where you could purchase anywhere else. Bought this for my wife and it has worked wonders on her hair. She feels like a queen and it is great to see the smile on her face. Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> after a few uses, I finally got the hang of this and i love it!  just the curls i want.  i&#x27;m throwing my out of date hot rollers out.  in the time it takes me to just put rollers in, i&#x27;ve got a full head of soft or springy curls - depending on heat and time.  i get compliments on my hair every single time i&#x27;ve used it.  highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note - for beginners, if your hair gets tangled (and it will), just keep calm and release button.  gently remove the hair, brush it out, and retry.  you&#x27;ll get the hang of it soon...</li>
            <li> i love this product! i can get out the door in about 15 minutes now compared to 45 minutes before. I don&#x27;t regret the splurge at all. It&#x27;s so worth it.  It&#x27;s nice to know I can spend less than $300 on a professional iron and get such great results. I love the bright LCD monitor and I never have to worry about getting burned.  I love the rubberized layer.  The Miraqueen is by far one of my favorite hair styling items  It&#x27;s fast and efficient, and I can do a variety of things with my hair. The best part is it never pulls my hair and I can be more precise with what heat setting I prefer. You won&#x27;y regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love how this has reduced the amount of hair products I have, aside from my straightener which I spent hundreds on and am not ready to let go yet, this is the best hair curling and waving product ever! Firstly, it&#x27;s quick to heat up, so by the time I finish seperating my hair to prepare curling it, the hair curler is ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like how it&#x27;s not hard to use so I don&#x27;t accidentially burn myself like I do with regular hair curling wands as I try to get my hair to wrap all the way around! Best of all, you&#x27;re able to create TONS of different hair styles with this, form super super curly so nice loose beach waves! I love this and am going to repurchase for my sister!</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these for my wife (my head is shaved) and she really loves it.  Its multifunction ability is fantastic and the safety features really make this a standout option.  I bought mine at full retail price, I wish I had seen this here first, I would have saved $40.00!  That&#x27;s why I am adding a 5 star review, hoping people will find it here first and save themselves some money.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely amazing item! I have long, straight hair and have a hard time setting and keeping curls. With other curling irons, I would have to wait forever curling my hair, with curlers that burn, and when I was done, my hair would be uneven throughout my head and wouldn&#x27;t last the night. With Miraqueen, it sets every time painlessly, and the whole night people ask where I got my hair done. I used it before work the other day which I had work outside, on a windy, misty day, and by the end of the day, the curls were set so tight, they were still set at the end of the work day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to struggle with cheap devices that burned my skin and often destroyed the texture of my hair. I gave up for awhile even trying to curl the hair I love, but my friend told me to try the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, Curling Wand, Hair Curler with Ceramic Curling Chamber, I did, and am so thankful I did. You can set the temperature you wish to use in setting, which is great because I found how the different temperatures set my hair differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER go back to another device, and have already purchased this for several friends and family for Christmas presents this coming year. It is so easy to use, safe, and provides professionally looking curls.</li>
            <li> This curling iron does exactly what it says it will do. My hair is extremely thick and the only way I can ever get curls to stay curly is with a ton of hairspray.  Not with this curling iron. My curls stay a lot longer,  it easy to use and the design is great. I love that it&#x27;s digital and you just can&#x27;t beat the price. I definitely recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Makes great ocean waves. After you get the hang of it, it is much faster then curling your hair with an iron.</li>
            <li> so far love it。but the package is kinda too simple for some thing not cheap like this</li>
            <li> The ONLY curling iron I need. So impressive and the curls actually stay :) Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this thing!!  Makes doing my hair super quick and easy.  I like the digital controls and I like that it has the alternating mode.  And the price was great, it was like half the price of other brands I&#x27;ve seen.  This is my new favorite hair tool.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron has too many good features to list in this little review. I will try my best to cover most of them.&lt;br /&gt;Because I am not good at curling hair, this curling iron seems like the most fool proof curlers that I have ever owned. It has many features for safety including the rubber protector and isolated heat to prevent me from burning myself. The foam protection cover insures the safety of my hair. The ceramic tourmaline helps to keep moisture in my hair and it insures smooth gliding so my hair does not get jagged and damaged. It is very easy to handle. The cord swivels so that it does not get rolled up and tangled like most curling irons. The features include automatic shutoff and an lcd monitor to see the temperature, the time, and which direction you are curling in. I can switch to different curl times to change the style and type of look that I want. There are three timer settings 8 seconds for loose curls, 10 seconds for medium curls, and 12 seconds for tight curls. Lastly, it beeps to let you know when it is done.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong with buying these curlers. I highly recommend them to everyone who likes perfect and pretty curls.</li>
            <li> I just had a birthday and I got this as a gift. My friend said that she got this for me because, &amp;#34;You&#x27;re always complaining about your thick, horrible hair...&amp;#34; When I looked at the item I thought it was a little different from any other curling iron I have ever seen. She told me that she purchased her own Miraqueen Curling iron a few months ago she was very happy. I thoroughly read the instructions and had her style my hair the first time I was in love! I have never found a curling iron that I met and liked because my hair is thick and frizzy. However, this curling iron has given me something to look forward to when going out with my because, honestly, my hair has always been a reason why I would have such bad self-esteem. This product not only saved my social life, but also the way I see myself. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!  Let me describe my hair: below shoulder length, fine, but naturally curly and frizzy.  My hair is colored and chemically straightened (at least the bottom half).  I have been straightening my hair for years (what used to be called Japanese straightening), so it&#x27;s straightened all except about the top 6 inches or so, but it does tend to wear off a bit after awhile - this is just so you know my particular challenges as I was looking for something to style my hair in a manner that would stay and not turn frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased two different sets of hot hair curlers, two flat irons, and a new curling iron - I kept one set of the curlers and the curling iron - the rest were returned.  These were all expensive, high-end products.  I&#x27;m sure they work for other people, just not for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to give the Miraqueen a try.  It looked just too weird for me at first, but after looking at several YouTube videos, I decided I would turn my efforts toward giving it a chance.  I tried it for the first time, and it worked like a champ.  I washed and blow dried my hair.  I use a product for heat protection on my hair, but no other styling products.  FYI - I use Wen for cleaning my hair - don&#x27;t really think that makes a difference overall, but it does hold the color in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the lowest heat setting and the 8 second setting, and I had to work at it a bit to pull some of the curl out of my hair when I got it all done.  I got my hair stuck in the machine twice, but that was because I tried to put too wide of a hair section into the chamber.  It didn&#x27;t harm the hair or anything - just had to start those sections over again.  The first time I used it, it probably took me 30 minutes to do my hair, but that was because of the learning curve.  As you work with the device and get the hang of it, it takes much less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!  Depending on your hair type and thickness, you won&#x27;t need anything else but a hair dryer and perhaps a flat iron to smooth your hair down first if it&#x27;s really thick or coarse.  Hopefully this thing lasts a long time - I&#x27;ll update again as time goes on.u won&#x27;t need anything else but a hair dryer and perhaps a flat iron to smooth your hair down first if it&#x27;s really thick or coarse.

            <li> I love it!  It is so easy to get beautiful curls.  I have a lot of fine, straight hair, so it takes a good half hour to get my whole head done, though.  It is less time consuming to use a regular curling iron or curlers, but the results are not as near as good.  It gets a little heavy/awkward too, especially in the back.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for a friend. She LOVES IT. Great craftsmanship, when she is done curling it looks like a pro did it. (less money spent at the salon). I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a nice curling iron with a lot of features.  It has 3 heat levels and at up to 450 it packs enough heat for curls that lasts all day long.  It also has nice safety features like a timer and auto shut off for those of you guilty of having left curling irons on in the past.  The blue led screen is nice and legible and has the anti tangle feature for the cord which should be included on every device with a wire.  The iron is easy to use and you can achieve the look you want without putting too much effort into it.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this curling iron!!! Got it for myself for Christmas and am not disappointed! There is a bit of a learning curve, but I am so glad to have this item in my bag of tricks! Will experiment more with the different directions of curls at some point. Used automatic today. Didn&#x27;t make my hair smell burnt, which is something I can&#x27;t stand about regular curling irons!! Gets nice and hot and makes beautiful curls that are bouncy and soft. Use very small strands of hair to keep it from rejecting. My hair got stuck a couple times, but nothing a couple clicks of the wand couldn&#x27;t fix! Looking forward to using this a lot more!! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy, somewhat thin hair which was fully dried, product-free, brushed out, and tangle-free when I tested out the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.  My hair consistently got tangled in the curling chamber.  I turned off the device each time to keep my hair from getting damaged by the heat and it took several minutes for each attempt to release my hair from the chamber.  If my hair ever got stuck to the point that I couldn&#x27;t remove it (which didn&#x27;t happen), I was fully prepared to break the device before ever considering chopping off a section of hair.  So- why keep trying to curl my hair if it kept getting stuck?  I wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t user error.  (Plus- I wanted to make sure I&#x27;d have a thoroughly written product review.)  I tried smaller sections of hair, larger sections of hair, and in-between.  I tried both the 370* and 410* temperate settings.  I also tried straitening my hair, and then curling it again, which didn&#x27;t help either.  Sometimes, the device only partly took my hair and didn&#x27;t suck the ends into the chamber.  There were multiple times when, after sucking up the middle and end sections of hair, the device sucked itself against my scalp.  It didn&#x27;t burn, but it certainly hurt because it was trying to pull my hair out of my head.  During the few times that the device actually seemed to work, (when it sucked up the whole section of hair without sucking itself to my scalp and it properly released the curl) the curls came out terrible.  I feel like this was due to the fact that, after sucking up the end section of hair, it kept trying to suck up more and more hair that wasn&#x27;t there, which could have tightly curled some of the hair in the chamber.  What I&#x27;m trying to say is that- the area that I clamped the device down on, came out crimped.  The section of hair right below that came out tightly curled (curls the size of your thumb).  I was using the 8 second time setting which should have resulted in a loose curl.  The end section of hair was the only part that came out looking perfect.  Again, I&#x27;ll point out- there were Very Few times that the chamber actually released my hair.  This curling iron hurt my head, possibly damaged my hair a bit, pulled out many strands of hair, could have left me with the decision to either break the device or cut my hair, and the resulting curls were disastrous looking.  It was a huge pain in the butt and I will be returning it.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great curling iron for most chicks, however, I think long, thin haired women should avoid this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best curler! I always wanted to be those girls who has beautiful curls (I have straight to wavy hair) and i bought at least 7different types of curlers (remington, bed head, hot tools) from the typical round to ones with the wavy plates. I believed they would be simple, fast and give me the look i wanted. They did work, but I hated how it would take sooo long (it would take me 30min-1h). For someone who mostly puts her hair into a bun or ponytail, that&#x27;s pure torture!&lt;br /&gt; But after using this Miraqueen, I&#x27;ll probably curl it more. It only took 20min (with a bit of goofing around) to complete it!! My hair is normal to thick, and reaches my lower back. There are 3different settings that I like which most other automatic curlers don&#x27;t (usually just has 2). This one has settings for the seconds it holds ur hair, the temperature AND the rotation of the curl (right/left/alternating) (many of others I found don&#x27;t have this feature which is great for unexperienced people like me).&lt;br /&gt;Also, its pink! More like a purple/pink but my favorite colors so love it!&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t pull out ur hair even if u put too much ( it can only take about an inch of hair, but also seems to depend on the length of ur hair). It will automatically try to release ur hair if it gets stuck and will beep when its stuck (~2beeps) and when its done (1beep).</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I would call it the &#x27;All In One&#x27; hair curler, because it does so much more. It was great for my daughter because her hair is always hanging, from dry and damaged to smooth and silky, so the 3 temperature settings helps her not burn her hair. I like the auto shut off, so I don&#x27;t have too remind her each time, to shut it off. Plus, she thinks the automatic curling feature is cool and the timer settings, let&#x27;s her know when make another curl. Overall, great curler for teens!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This curling iron is AMAZING!  I have stick straight, very fine hair that will only hold a very loose curl for a minimum length of time of time.  I have spent my entire life wishing for nice curls.  Now I can have the curls I have always wanted.  I found this product by accident, bought it on a whim and am so glad I did.  I watched the video posted in another review and within an hour of taking the package into the house I had a headful of beautiful springy curls.  The hardest part for me was sectioning my hair in the back.  This is easy to use and following the advice in the video, very easy to use.  I figured that after I slept on my hair it would be straight when I woke up but there was still a nice wave there.  I think if I had used some kind of product in my hair the curl would have lasted even better, but I was still happy with how it looked after sleeping on it.  The only downside I could see is that it is a bit heavy, but I think as I get better at using the process will go more quickly and the weight wont even be an issue.</li>
            <li> I bought this after having tried so many other products out there.  I have very thick and wavy hair and it looks like like it does after I go to my stylist.  She&#x27;s nervous that she&#x27;s going to be out of a job!!  I&#x27;m always skeptical to make purchases online because you never know what you&#x27;re going to get, but this was a really good buy and I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend got scorched constantly while using her old curling iron. I insisted she get a new one from time to time, but she had none of it, claiming that her old one did a great job and that she was just clumsy when using it. Now, while that may be true, I decided to take matters into my own hands and buy her the new Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron. I&#x27;ve made my decision partly due to other positive reviews here and I’d like to thank everybody who took the time to post one here. And now, I want to return the favor.&lt;br /&gt;So she got her new curling iron and tried it out a couple of times. Given that she was used to her old one, the first time she tried it out she couldn&#x27;t quite work it properly – I don’t know the details, just took her word on it, because I don’t know how to use this kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;But after a couple of tries, she got a pretty good idea on how it works and why it’s definitely an improvement over her old one. For starters, no more fear of scorching herself – there are a number of protection measures implemented in this model that offer maximum safety while it is being used.&lt;br /&gt;Second of all, the LED display might seem like an unnecessary feature, but it apparently helps with controlling the temperature and curl direction, while also showing the timer. A timer which is used to make sure you don’t overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I’m just glad she stopped getting her fingers and ears occasionally burnt. So yeah – I’d definitely recommend the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron for that reason alone. But it also comes at a great price for what it can do and my girlfriend never looked back ever since she started using this one.</li>
            <li> Would buy another one!! Would not recommend,don&#x27;t get hot enough &amp; the basis is to big!</li>
            <li> I found the perfect solution with Miraqueen curling iron. At first I was not sure if I could figure out all the choices it offers, but with a few tries I became an expert hair stylist. I left it in a little too long the first time and my curls were a little tighter than I wanted them so the next time I used it I released the curl after 7-8 seconds and it was perfect. I also worried about damaging my hair but I swear, the ceramic chambers and padding makes my hair seem healthier, bouncier and more lustrous. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Well I bought this as a gift for my grand daughter and she was speechless because she didn&#x27;t think I would buy her something like this for her birthday.I love my grand daughter and her mother told me this is want she wanted. She loves it and said it the best one to buy. She now thinks I&#x27;m not such a bad old guy and that I have it going on,what ever that means. if she is happy,I&#x27;m happy. She said it does a lot of different things and I bought the best</li>
            <li> Professional curling iron, ceramic technology, protects hair from damage. Great hair curler with 3 heat levels and 4 timer settings, auto power off. Hot hair wand with LED screen- displays timer, temperature, and curl direction.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll be getting. At first I thought it was too good to be true. Surely it won&#x27;t work that well, I thought at first. But after I tried it I realized this device is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but it&#x27;s not cheap like many of the other curling wands I used before. Many of them have felt like cheap plastic that will break in my hand if move to quickly, reminiscent of something you would but at the .99 cent store. This is not the case with the Miraqueen. It&#x27;s light,  but strong and sturdy. The materials are top notch. I hope you like saving money, because you&#x27;re going to have this thing for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to my next point. Price. I&#x27;m always looking for a great deal. (Who isn&#x27;t?). Well, I&#x27;m really happy with the price I paid and for what I got.&lt;br /&gt;In short, I highly recommend this to all you ladies out there.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair that has a very hard time holding curl.  I would always have to load up on hairspray leaving my hair very stiff and without a lot of movement.  This curling wand leaves my hair curly all day without all the hairspray.  It gives my hair a lot of movement and body. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> One of my friend suggested me to buy this product.At first i was really confused about it because i have used many similar product but those did not worked well. But this product is really excellent.This curler is easy to use and easy to take control of strands of my hair. I&#x27;ll buy another when needed.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific little item!  We used it for a photo shoot and the make-up gal was very pleased with its results as well as ease of use and timely results--the models loved it as well.  Arrived even faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I dont usually write reviews, but this one swiped me away! I absolutely love the neat design of symmetry that makes you feel powerful just to have it in your hand. I was worried that the iron was going to be too strong because my hair is very very fragile (thin, blonde), but the technology just protects the hair so well. I already recommended it to my best friend. I really like having this cutie as it&#x27;s also very easy to travel with, and an essential piece for every girl - I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Iron&amp;#34; is AMAZING! It may not look like what you are used to seeing, but it works and it works better! It has never tugged my fine hair (I always got my fine hair stuck in normal irons :( ) The curls last by far longer then the curls i get with a traditional iron and it&#x27;s faster too. It has a nice display that tells you how hot it is, and how long it&#x27;s set to curl and it&#x27;s easy to change so no more frying part of your hair (i always toasted the ends with my old fashioned iron) This iron even shuts it&#x27;s self off, so no more thinking all day if you remembered to unplug! O and you can set the curl direction too! no more curling hair to discover you did the the opposite of what you intended to do (I always mess up my right side with the old iron &amp;#62;&amp;#60; ) I love this Iron and recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is my absolute favorite! I use it every day and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel or look damaged at all! It&#x27;s so easy to use! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> One day I was looking on YouTube, and I saw some great curlers for my sister. She had trouble curling her hair with just normal curlers (burning herself) so I decided to get this for her birthday. When she got it, she put it through her hair, and the curler curled her hair by itself. It just grabbed her hair and wrapped her hair up in a curl. It beeps to let her know when to take it off her hair. She loved it! I think that girls that don&#x27;t know how to curl their hair should use this like my sister does. My mom even steals it from time to time.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife a few days ago as she had mentioned wanting a new one and let me tell you, the reviews checked out, she LOVES IT!5 stars!!</li>
            <li> I have been through numerous curling irons in my days and recently my CHI air broke down. I was doing alot of research online and I came across Miraqueen and based on the reviews and features I had to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when receiving the product and it definitely didnt let me down what so ever. Some cool features I enjoyed right away. I like my curls tight and It has a preset timer for 12 secs which does wonders! It also beeps whens it ready to use and when to release the handle. I&#x27;ve had the Miraqueen for 6 months now and use it regularly without any problems. Overall its a fantastic product! I would recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> I’ll be honest, when I heard about the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, I was skeptical. I have very long thick hair, and it takes FOREVER to curl it using a curling iron. Not to mention it went flat by the end of the day. This tool has saved me tons of time! The best part is that I don’t have to worry about burning myself anymore! I seriously love this curler. I don’t think I’ll ever use a regular curling iron again!</li>
            <li> This is the most magical hair styling device ever. It does great curls that last, even with my fine hair that typically never holds a curl longer than an hour once i leave the house. It takes me a whole 10 minutes to curl my entire head (although i do have thin hair). The timer/heat settings are awesome, and the rotation option for the direction of curl is super rad. I LOVE this! Its really safe, and as long as you keep the hair in the &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; then you wont have any issues with hair getting caught, and even when if it does a little bit, it lets go easily and doesn&#x27;t cause damage or hurt.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it enough said</li>
            <li> Wow, what a great product!</li>
            <li> I got the Miraqueen Curling Iron as a gift for my sister&#x27;s birthday and she can&#x27;t keep gushing about how great the product is. The iron is effortless to use, quick, automatic, and one-hand doable. There are beep sounds and easy-to-read displays that let you keep track of time and temperature pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says that the iron has a few safety features that prevent you from burning yourself...which is important because she&#x27;s kind of a clutz sometimes. The rubber protector and heat insulating base are pretty key and almost &amp;#34;child-proof.&amp;#34; The tourmaline ceramic technology also protects your hair from heat damage, so that&#x27;s pretty fool-proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, highly recommended for women and also men with long hair. I used to have long hair, and if I grow it out again, I&#x27;ll definitely confiscate this iron from my sister lol!</li>
            <li> This incredible device gives my wife the curl she wants every time.  The timer is great as it allows her to decide exactly how much curl she wants and takes the guess work out of how long to hold it in place.  Perfect curls, every time.</li>
            <li> Let start off saying that I have really straight hair.  Curling my hair can be such a long process.  Using this curling iron has made the processes go so much faster and easier.  With its easy to use heat settings and curl direction I was able to neatly curl my hair in no more than 10 min.  My hair fed into the Iron so perfectly. The curling wand even detects when you have placed to much hair into it.  The curling iron is so safe there is no way of burning your self.  Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is so worth the buy, just wait 4 seconds and you have a perfect tight curl. You can switch up the direction of the curl for more texture and volume.  This an awesome curling iron. So fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! IT IS NOT WORTH THE RISK. My hair got caught in the curling chamber with no way to release it, and I had to cut off a chunk of my hair. BUYERS BEWARE</li>
            <li> Using this curling iron is so simple! It works great and it’s really efficient! No more having to worry about burning yourself with your curling iron, it is just about impossible to even burn yourself with this one! Its’ perfect for any hair type too and won’t even damage your hair either. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a curling iron that can curl any hair type fast and efficiently! The best part is this is really affordable compared to a lot of the other ones on the market today.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is the best! I&#x27;ve tried many others but was always disappointed. This curling iron is very easy to use and I get the curls I want very fast! With other curling irons I have tried I had to leave the iron there for a minute until my hair actually stayed curled and ended up smelling really burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron is amazing and I definitely recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love so many things about this curling iron! I have very fine hair, that is straight everywhere except for the waves in the back. So it always looks...off. But this curling iron solves the problems I&#x27;ve had in the past with curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to burn myself, but with the curling chamber that doesn&#x27;t happen anymore. Also, I have such fine hair that I usually use a fairly low temperature. However, my sister has VERY thick hair. She doesn&#x27;t curl or straighten her hair often so she doesn&#x27;t want to buy something of her own so it&#x27;s nice that she can use this product as well since it has a variety of temperature settings. The LED screen makes it easy to see the temperature (and how far along the iron is in heating up) and direction of the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my absolute favorite feature is the automatic timers. Whenever I curl my hair I&#x27;m really ambitious at the beginning. I&#x27;ll have nice tight curls on one side of my head and by the other side I&#x27;ve gotten tired and don&#x27;t hold them as long. So I look really uneven. This curling iron assures me that I hold all the curls the same amount of time and get even curls.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!!! There are so many features that I have never seen on another curler before, it is quick, easy, and literally does all the work for you. My favorite feature has to be the curl direction. You can chose between right, left, or alternating. You don&#x27;t have to worry about which way your curls are or how to hold the barrel. All you do is select temperature which goes up to 450 degrees, the time which is between 8, 10, or 12 seconds, and the curl direction. It beeps when it is finished. You no longer have to worry about being burned. My arms, neck, and chest were all vulnerable to other curling irons, especially wands, before. Not with with this curler. Your hair will thank you as well. With the timer and temperature control you will not ruin your hair. If your in a rush and forget to cut it off, no worries. It has a 1 hour safety timer so it will go to sleep. The curls definitely last. I&#x27;m a very busy person and it outlast my day. You will not be disappointed in the product. I&#x27;m going to be purchasing another one for my niece for Christmas. She is in her early teens so I feel this would be safer for her to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Great product.  In our family we have long hair, short hair, thick and thin - and this curling iron/wand is really, really good. For the money it is quite a value and is made really well.  It is good for all types of hair.  Highly recommended. I would like to get one for sister.</li>
            <li> Mine stopped working.....I am trying to contact the seller to see if the product has a manufacturer warranty</li>
            <li> This made the perfect gift for our teenage niece.  My niece is 13 and is flat-out obsessed with fashion.  She&#x27;s always spending way too much time curling her hair.  The wife and I purchased this curling iron for her as a gift, and she absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to our niece, the curling iron heats up quickly, maintains a consistent temperature, and makes curling her hair seemingly effortless.  She even told us that she would recommend it to all of her friends because as she put it, &amp;#34;yeah, it&#x27;s that great&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making such a fantastic product!  Our niece couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Im glad I stumbled across this hair curler. This is one of the best purchase I have made in a long time. It is some very nice settings that you can set to make it a  pleasurable experience. I never seen my wife hair so curly and nice. I would buy this over and over again for her. Great price!!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use....just as described. Love it</li>
            <li> How have I not heard of this before now?? I had pretty much given up on attempting to use a curling iron when this one was recommended to me.  I was super skeptical at first, and was hesitant in buying. It was SO worth it. It heats up ridiculously fast, is super easy to use, and makes it almost impossible to accidentally burn yourself. I have extremely long thick hair that NEVER holds curls. After using this, not only did it hold the curls for my important meeting at work, but they stayed beautiful all that day, through the night, and all the way up until my shower the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to others. It is fast, efficient, and safe. The combination of the timer, the rubber/foam protections and the different array of settings makes this the best curling iron I have ever laid my hands on. 5 stars all the way!</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair and this iron works great with my hair.  It&#x27;s quick, easy to use and I love the look!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product because I&#x27;ve heard bad things about the other version of it and with my mixed race course, frizzy hair alot of products don&#x27;t work for me.  However I was surprised and happy to find that this miraqueen produced perfect curls in my freshly washed and blow dried hair!  I was able to spiral curl my hair for Thanksgiving and it stayed in all day!  Love this miraqueen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen products like this on TV before and always wondered how well they worked. My mother-in-law purchased this and once I found out I just had to try it; what better way to know if I want one? I was super impressed with how easy it was and how well it worked. I have hair that falls just past my shoulders so while it takes awhile for me to straighten my hair, which is my typical style, I was excited to have found another way of styling it. The curls stay for a long time which is something else I&#x27;ve never had luck with. My hair does have a little bit of natural curl, but it&#x27;s not the &#x27;pretty&#x27; natural curl, and more of the crazy, unattractive curl. I definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised, even on course hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the Best Curling Iron EVER!  I have straight coarse hair, my hair cuticle is also very compact so it doesn&#x27;t take curls every easily.  I often have to almost fried my hair to get it to curl.  But I love to have curls, it give volumes to my thinning hair.  After years of using a curling iron, my hair is pretty damaged especially at the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard Miraqueen Professional curling iron from a friend, who squares by it.  So I got one, and I will never go back to my cheap curling iron again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Miraqueen curling iron not only gives me great curls but it also makes my hair less damage, I think it is because of the Ceramic chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, I recommend it to anyone who is tired of the cheap stuff.  Once you own one you will see what I am talking about.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my step-daughter so she could get beautiful, glorious curls for all those dances without us having to spend a fortune on hair-dressers. After carefully reading reviews on different stylers, I chose the MiraQueen professional because of other glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I looked at the negative reviews too, but I found if you follow the directions you really can’t go wrong. If you have any questions, just look at the reviews with videos---they were very helpful in making a decision for me.&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron has a digital readout, 3 heat settings for different hair types. The “R” for ready will stop blinking when the iron has reached your selected curling temperature. It even has a curl direction control where you can make left and right spiraling curls according to your preference. Genius!&lt;br /&gt;Another cool feature is the timed curl function. You set the time to hold the curl and it will beep to let you know when to release it. If the curl is held for longer than 25 seconds, the iron shuts off. It has an auto-off feature that many will find useful. My step-daughter has ruined two flat-irons by leaving them on. The Miraqueen comes with a protective case, tangle-free swivel cord, heats up quickly and is light-weight. Great for a young girl to use.&lt;br /&gt;Many great features packed into one cool tool. I am glad I chose this particular iron for my step-daughter.</li>
            <li> I never had a luck with curling iron- I always burned myself and the last time was so bad that I was scared to ever use the curling iron again. My friend introduced me to Miraqueen curling iron and I fell in love with it right away! It&#x27;s been a couple of years and I never burned myself even once! I&#x27;m buying another one, this pink one! I highly recommend this to anybody with thin hair! Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I received this as a gift I love love love it. I use it almost every day and plan to purchase one for my friend for her birthday. The price seems a bit expensive, but I think it is well worth it considering the fact that you can choose heat settings and time your curls. I am hopeless when it comes to styling hair, and have tried to curl my hair before but it took so long only for it fall flat an hour later. It wasn&#x27;t worth it. This curler made it so easy though and now I can curl my hair every other day really quickly. I hated using my old curling iron and always managed to burn myself but this has a protective layer so that I don&#x27;t do that anymore. I LOVE that I can pick between types of curls to change things up, it&#x27;s more fun to do my hair in the morning, and I get compliments on it all the time! Another plus is that I am not burning my hair since the miraqueen tells me when to let go of the trigger. I would definitely recommend this to friends, and maybe let a few borrow it.</li>
            <li> Great.Its service really awesome.i like it very much.I gave A++++++++.Also recommend you.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> There are so many things to love about the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron.  This curling iron comes in such an affordable and easy to use package and is literally the perfect tool for anyone who loves to curl their hair.  Some of my favorite things about this product is that it heats up fast.  What this means for me is that I dont need to wait for half an hour to curl my hair.  This iron also gets hot, maxing out at 450 degrees.  The three different heating levels are also amazing because I can customize what type of curl I want based on which level I choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else that is very useful is that there is an lcd screen that shows the timer and temperature (among other information).  This makes it easy for me to see how warm the iron is and how long I need to hold that curl in place - there are four timer settings.  Also, the fact that this iron uses ceramic shows that it will protect my hair in the long run because it is not being constantly burned by stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing gift for the holidays or even birthdays.  This allows the user to create the perfect curl, and from my personal experience, I could not be happier with the price and performance.  Please buy today !!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! There is a learning curve to it, but once you get the hang of using it you will never use another curling iron again. I have long straight hair, and this thing works great! There are many advantages of using the Miraqueen compared to regular curling irons: it is cool to not have to worry about a hot barrel burning your fingers, forehead, neck, or ears. With the Miraqueen you don&#x27;t have to twist or wind your hair and the ends of your hair don&#x27;t fall out of the barrel. I can’t express how many times I’d wind my hair around a normal curling iron just to have the ends of my hair fall out before finishing and having to re-curl and re-curl and re-curl. That frustration is now a thing of the past since I have found this thing. I found that using it on thinner strands gives you the best results for tighter curl and bigger sections is best for a more uniform wave. Also, if you leave it on for the 12 seconds it is better than doing 10, for me anyways. I would recommend watching some YouTube videos before trying to use this. As I mentioned, there is a bit of a learning curve to using this, and the videos really help you get a good idea of what you should do. Once you get it down though, you will be able to do your whole head is five to ten minutes unlike spending 45 minutes with a regular curling iron. The biggest challenge is doing the back of your hair. I recommend either using multiple mirrors or getting a friend to help you out. When you consider the price and the time the Miraqueen saves you, it is definitely a great purchase to make.</li>
            <li> Just tangles hair, sending back</li>
            <li> Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is a Super Affordable Curling Wand.  The Hair Curler has a Ceramic Curling Chamber which feels like it is less likely to burn the hair..A hair curler to create beautiful, shiny, long-lasting curls without all the effort..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This must-have Curling wand works on all hair textures and types to create a stunning curl with a glossy finish. A curl chamber gently draws the hair in and heats it from all directions to form a perfect curl every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still working with it.. and look forward to hearing from my beloved what else she likes about. I highly recommend this over the cheap metal that can burn your hair or give it a burnt smell.  I think The Miraqueen Brand has created a good product and will be on the look out for other items they may carry.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would lessen the heat and time required to do my hair every day.  Even at the highest settings there was very little curl.  I also could smell my hair burning.  I already have heat damage from previous appliances,  so this doesn&#x27;t work for me.  It would be great for long thin hair.  The incessant loud beeping made my dog run outside and sit in the rain, and that cannot be turned off or down in volume.  This is the 4th hair appliance I&#x27;ve purchased in the last four months to hopefully reduce damage.  My search continues.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this item is that it is made of ceramic. I very much enjoy curling my hair, but would do it very occasionally because the metal irons felt (and smelled) like they were very damaging. I am happy that there is a solution to this. This curler feels a lot safer for my hair, and totally does the job and holds the curl. For that, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has a fairly long straight hair, and she loves to curl her hair sometimes. But she was not that happy with her devices she have been using. She was searching for a new one, and she was not willing to be disappointed this time. So I joined her helping searching, and we both been searching in our way. I have gone through a many similar devices. Then when I first came across this device, first it caught my eyes because of the design &amp; features and then the reviews just made me curious. So I thought I should recommend her to give it a try. And she did so. It took a little bit time to get her used to, but I have noticed that she’s already been very satisfied with the result she is having, and it’s really noticeable. The curls of her hair started looking different than ever which seriously I love. Even it takes her very short time to do her hair with no burning risk or anything. It is easy to use for everyone. I definitely recommend this device to other as I did to my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron not for my own lovely locks, but because my girlfriend had been using the same junky one for years now. Being a short haired person myself, I wasn&#x27;t exaclty to sure where to start. But after looking for hours, I decided to go with the Miraqueen because of all the positive things people are saying about it. And it looked really cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend absolutely loves it. It works so much better than her old one, that it&#x27;s even given her more time in the mornings when she&#x27;s getting ready. Not to mention how beautiful she looks afterwards. Also, she&#x27;s actually happy to do her hair now, when it just used to be a burden. So I don&#x27;t know if it was my luck or what, but the Miraqueen was the first curling iron I&#x27;ve purchased, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> OMG. Okay okay okay, so I know you have seen something like this and you are probably skeptical about the actual results for your hair. My biggest concern even after watching some videos of similar products was this thing pulling my hair. It is smooth and so easy to use. The setting let you control how hot for your hair type and even how long to heat the hair. It will beep when its ready and the curls are so curly and stay all day into the next day. I have really long hair and I normally use a traditional curling iron but after using this Miraqueen Curling Wand, I will NEVER go back. The setting allow for so much adjustment that you have to experiment with it a few times to figure out what will work best for you. Its honestly like my new toy, my kids are like &amp;#34;c&#x27;mon mom stop doing your hair already&amp;#34;. I love it so much, so happy I made the purchase. Its awesome, I can not tell you enough. Try it and love it.</li>
            <li> Having thick hair makes curling your hair a timely task. Add having long hair to the mix, and a normal curling iron can only reach half of the length of my hair, which makes each section need to be done twice. Before I purchased this curling iron, I would rarely spend the time to curl my hair. However this drastically decreases the time I need to spend because it can fit the full length of my hair in just one go. The curls are also a lot more tight and last longer than my previous irons. Overall, I really think this iron is worth the money and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this curling iron!!!!! I have thick coarse hair and it is super hard to get my hair to curl, let alone stay curled. After reading the reviews on the Miraqueen, I decided to give it a try. I used it for the first time last week for my birthday and it worked amazingly!!! My curls stayed completely in for the 4 hours I had my hair done. I even slept in my curls and woke up with them still mostly in tact! I cannot recommend this hair curler enough!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Miraqueen is one of the BEST Curlings wands/irons that I have worked with! Easy to use, accessible, easy to store, works well with all types of hair. I use it in my salon all the time on customers and they adore the way it comes out. 5 Stars across the board, one of the best hair products there is!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had so much trouble trying to curl my thick long hair. At this point I have tried everything from your traditional curling iron, a curling wand, heated rolls, and even a straightener. It&#x27;s really frustrating because my hair never curls the same way consistently. I finally tried the Miraqueen curling iron and I FINALLY found something that works on my hair! So here&#x27;s what I love about it and what works for me. First off it&#x27;s consistent!! You can control the temperature, which way you want to curls to face, and how long you want to curl each section of hair! This is awesome because before one side of my head would have tighter curls and the other side would have looser curls and they would be facing all different types of directions. With the Miraqueen it&#x27;s so simple, you just place a section of hair into the compartment and hold it there for the timer you selected, then it beeps letting you know that your curl is ready to be released! If your not a fan of hairspray like me then this is perfect for you because the curls hold without having to put icky hair spray in. From my experience I would recommend to purchase the Miraqueen. Happy Curling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had probably 20 or more conventional curling irons in my life.  Invariably, they scorch the back of my neck and fry my hair, and I&#x27;ve accidentally burned myself numerous times when they were sitting on my vanity immediately after use.  So when this Miraqueen curling iron came out, I was intrigued and hopeful, though a bit hesitant.  Quite honestly, I didn&#x27;t believe in the hype, but when me latest iron bit the dust a few weeks ago I decided to bite the bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was I glad I did!  For slightly more than most of the curling irons I&#x27;ve bought in the past, I have one that does not fight me!  Its ceramic design prevents burns, either while using or after use.  You can set the length of time for it to curl your hair and it counts off the seconds with simple beats, then lets you know when it&#x27;s done.  I can do small areas or my entire head in four or five minutes, and my curls hold a couple of days.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a grumpy teen at home?  Get her one and you&#x27;ll be her hero for life.  I&#x27;ve already put this iron on my shopping list for my daughter and two nieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been considering buying this curling iron - three words: GET IT NOW!  You will NOT regret it!</li>
            <li> This curling iron has two of the best attributes in my opinion; tourmaline and ceramic. Smooth curls are achieved regularly and with no problem. The heat settings and automatic timing make this hair tool easy to use for the new user or for a person who has been styling their hair for years. The heat settings go up fairly high and the highest setting is not needed unless you have really coarse hair. Although this iron looks a bit chunky, the handle is of a comfortable size. The larger area is where the curling barrel area is that does the curling. I have been a hairstylist for years and, in my personal and professional opinion,  this iron is wonderful and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - easy to use and produces wonderful curls. Has a lot of settings - heat and time, which give you good control over your results. If you have straight hair and dream of perfect curls - definitely give it a try. Makes a perfect gift too.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is by far the best of all the ones I have tried. It sits nicely in my hand and is simple to operate. I will definitely recommend this product to my friends. Excuse me while I go curl my hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this curler. I have very fine, thin hair that doesn&#x27;t curl well, but with this the curls hold all day. Even the second day, it still looks good. After experimenting with it, I found spraying dry hair with a thermal heat spray helps a lot. Also taking smaller sections, and biggest tip:... Keep hair smooth as you put it into the curler.&lt;br /&gt;I recently used it for my niece&#x27;s hair for her wedding....it was awesome...being a retired hairstylist, I would recommend this to other stylist. This brand is cheaper than some others but performs as good. I feel it&#x27;s made very well.</li>
            <li> May seem a bit bulky at first, but this iron is a must have! It&#x27;s a salon in your hands! Sucks up the exact amount of hair you want and then when it&#x27;s done, your hair comes out perfectly curled. You just need to hold it up, gather the amount of hair you want, and it does the rest for you, no kidding.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and other curling irons just don&#x27;t fulfill the job, they uncurl after just a few hours and sometimes a few minutes. This is the only curling iron that actually does what it says. Also this defiantly has more settings then an average curling iron, also the timer feature is super helpful and makes it so I don&#x27;t burn my hair. Not only does it work perfectly and last a long time, it is also super affordable and is worth every penny spent on it!</li>
            <li> Not good for shorter hair as advertised because the barrel is too big for the hair to completely wrap around it.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron. So easy to use! Especially for a person like me who hates doing hair. My hair tangled a few times but it was manageable it didn&#x27;t rip out my hair or anything. And when you put too much hair in it gives you an error beep. It works really well.</li>
            <li> My grandmother bought this curler for me and gave it to me as a gift on my birthday. I give it 4 stars only because it uses small sections of hair and if I try to use a strand of hair that is too large it gets tangled and stuck. I haev impossibly thick hair and it takes hours to curl. Because it is so thick I dislike curling it. But with this handy new device, I can easily curl my hair in about half the time it usually takes! It isn&#x27;t super fast but it&#x27;s better than a curling wand! It&#x27;s a little tricky to get used to but I really enjoyed it after getting the hang of it! :)</li>
            <li> This curler is awesome!!! No complaints whatsoever. I can curl my hair in 8 minutes or less but I have fine fair but lots of it. Shortest time for bleached fine hair...it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> I must admit the first thing that drew me to this curling iron were the looks. Curling iron aesthetics haven’t changed much in the last million years or so and it was nice to have something prettier adorn my counter.&lt;br /&gt;It does so much more than just a simple curl. The device is actually quite amazing with the breadth of what it will do for your hair. The technology involved with this curler is beyond what I’ve seen in other curlers, especially the safety features. It both protects you and your hair from the heat and also has an auto shut off button.&lt;br /&gt;If you want anything more than a standard boring curler, go for this one.</li>
            <li> I run a boutique in Cali and this has been one of the greatest additions to my set of tools.  All the girls have been dying for these super curly locks this winter and I needed something with a digital screen and some more flexible options.  I wish I would have found this one a long time ago , its just perfect for what I&#x27;m trying to do.  If you let it go to the end , you get super tight locks perfect for styling how you want and its really easy to use.  It may be time for me to put down those hot rollers because this is just so much more convenient and much faster.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Curling Iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it every single day, and my wife is obsessed!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!  Make sure your hair is smooth and that you don&#x27;t load too much hair in the chamber as it will get stuck.  It is just a matter of not overloading.  Otherwise, this product is fantastic!!!!</li>
            <li> I had been eyeing the MiraCurl for a few years now but couldn&#x27;t justify the price.  My husband ended up getting me this for Christmas and I&#x27;m so glad he did.  I love it!!!  I have been using it every other day since then and feel I have enough experience with it now to finally post my review (although I wanted to gush about it right away!)  I have very fine, unprocessed, medium length hair (about 2-3 inches past my shoulders) that has never held a curl a day in my life until now.  Because of my fine hair, I have only ever used this on the lowest heat and curl time setting (370 degrees/8 seconds) so my review is for that heat and time setting only.  The machine itself takes about 1 minute from the time you turn it on until it&#x27;s ready to use at this setting. You will know it&#x27;s ready when it stops blinking and you hear three rapid beeps. You can curl your hair to the left, right or auto (which alternates between the two). I find it works best when you put 1-1.5 inches of hair in the curler at a time.  Any more than that seems to get caught, which has happened to me, but infrequently.  When it does, it&#x27;s always my fault from putting too much hair in at once and the machine promptly stops.  My hair has never gotten tangled or stuck; it slides out easily.  Even at the lowest setting, I cannot believe how curly this makes my hair.  You can get the barrel quite close to your head too so it curls from root to tip.  I&#x27;ve used it on both freshly washed and unwashed hair and it works beautifully either way.  This seriously leaves my entire head with full, voluminous, bouncy curls!!  I prefer softer waves so I just run my fingers through it a few times after I&#x27;m done and I&#x27;m good to go.  Since I wash my hair every other day, I can say that the curls last until my next wash so, for 48 hours. No, they&#x27;re not as tight as when I first use it, but that&#x27;s also because I run my fingers through them to soften them up.  The machine is so easy to use too and on average, I have timed the entire process at 14 minutes to do my whole head.  You can&#x27;t beat it!!  I love this machine and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  It&#x27;s awesome and truly works.  ***** UPDATE (2/1/16) ***** It has been well over a year since I first started using this and it still works great!!  I still love it and it has held up under near constant use (just about every other day).  I even dropped the thing once from my bathroom vanity and it&#x27;s still working great.  I will say that every now and then I do have to re-curl a strand of hair that did not curl the first time, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  It&#x27;s probably because of build up on the barrel which I guess is expected over time.  I see that Amazon has not been selling this anymore for a while so I&#x27;m hoping the one I have will last forever.  I can&#x27;t live without it!!! :)</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! This product is amazing!! I had really high hopes and it exceeded my expectations!!</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying out my sister&#x27;s Curl Secret. This one is a much better deal for what you pay. Lots of options, including left, right, or alternating curls and several different temperatures. Cord wraps up nicely and velcros. My hair is stick straight and I have a hard time getting it to hold a curl using traditional curling irons or wands, but this made nice curls, which I brushed into &amp;#34;beachy waves&amp;#34; that lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, I WAS NEVER ABLE TO USE MY FLAT IRON TO MAKE CURLS, I WOULD ALWAYS END UP BURNING MY FINGERS, WELL... PROBLEM SOLVED WITH THIS LITTLE MACHINE! NO BURNS! BEAUTIFUL CURLS! YES IT DOES TAKE A WHILE SPECIALLY BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF HAIR AND IT IS PRETTY LONG BUT WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I had a curl secret which is more expensive. This one works just as well for $30-$40 less. Im very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for Grand-daughter. She loves it. Works as well as the expensive Curling Iron. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I always been struck by my long hair problems until I purchased this Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron. What I like about this curling iron is its ability to curl up my hair without the difficulties I had with other curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temperature control is done very well and it ensures that the right temperature is achieved for the perfect curling.I also loves how the LCD panel shows the different settings that I am using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended to all the long hair ladies out there.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it was going to be another curling iron.  Boy was I tremendously and amazingly surprised!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried just about everything to form the perfect curl... heat rollers, leave in rollers, straighteners curling irons... you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. But I never get the perfect curl and I&#x27;m never able to consistently reproduce curls that are almost perfect. I finally gave up for about a good year. Then I came across this! I was a little hesitant at first, but looked at a few videos on Youtube and thought i would give it a try.... THIS ACTUALLY WORKS! I always have perfect curls and I am able to reproduce those curls for my whole entire head of hair. The curler heats up very quickly and stays hot throughout my entire use. It is also very easy to hold and comfortable-- I&#x27;ve always found straighteners and curlers not very easy on the hands, but this is the exact opposite. The price is an ultimate steal-- I&#x27;ve paid double this price for curlers that were nothing as great as this! Awesome buy! If you&#x27;re tired of being frustrated with curlers, this will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic device. It heats up quick And has a long heavy duty cord that you won&#x27;t get with most other brands, at least the ones I&#x27;ve seem. My curls hold brilliantly throughout the day. I love this device. Love it! I would recommend it to anyone, and buy it again if I had to. This is a professional product and that&#x27;s what you get. A well made professional product. I love how this one looks heavy but is quite light. And plus I&#x27;m just a big sucker for the color pink All my friends are always asking were and how i got my hair done.And i tell them using this item.And they are so wanting one.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, Curling Wand, Hair Curler with Ceramic Curling Chamber is a great little find!  I was a little intimidated at first by the size, thinking it was going to be bulky and difficult to maneuver around my head.  But, that just wasn’t the case.  It is quick and more effortless than a regular curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, I have strange hair.  It is very fine, but has just enough of a wave pattern to stick out at odd angles.  So I have to either straighten it or curl it.  And even though it is fine, my hair doesn’t like to take a curl or hold a curl.  Usually, I dread the time I have to spend in the morning working with a curling iron.  Not so with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Miraqueen has 3 heat levels, so is should be a good fit no matter what hair type you have.  I like that it heats up to 450 degrees.  I have tried cooler irons and they just won’t curl my hair.  I also love the fact that it has multiple curl directions and timer settings.  The timer settings determine the tightness of the curl: loose, medium and tight.  So you can create a range of looks.  And, there is absolutely no guesswork.  You adjust the setting on the handle to the type of curl you want and it will tell you exactly when to remove it with a series of beeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made of ceramic, which is a huge benefit for me.  I won’t even consider buying a product that is not anymore – my hair is just too easily damaged.  I also like the safety features because I don’t know how many times I have burned my head or hand on a regular curling iron.  Not possible with the Miraqueen.  And if you are like me; forgetful, it comes with an Auto-off feature so you don’t burn the house down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little scary, the first time it sucks your hair in.  But there was no pulling or tugging at all.  Overall, it is a very good little investment in time-savings and money.</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter who is 12.  Easy for her to use and her hair looks really cute!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. The three-beep notification helps make sure that all of her curls are equal. With the LCD screen she can adjust the settings to fit exactly what she wants. With such ease of control she can choose the way it curls. She loves how quickly and accurately it works. As a bonus it is easy on her hair so she enjoys using it. By far this is the best curler she’s ever used.</li>
            <li> Omg I love this! It&#x27;s amazing and super easy and fast to use!</li>
            <li> This device is truly amazing. Not hard to use, and actually fun! Don&#x27;t be afraid when it sucks your hair into the little chamber, it&#x27;s all part of the magic! The Miraqueen Curling Iron turns limp, lifeless hair into gorgeous curls within seconds, the machine beeping to tell you hold long to hold the hair in for. This curling iron will curl your entire head of hair in under 10 minutes, and is good for anything from a bob to long, luscious hair. It&#x27;s not hard to use, and the little display shows you exactly what temperature it&#x27;s at - and even how tight your curl will be! The best part - you can&#x27;t even burn yourself with this thing! Five stars, hands down. Well, one hand down - you won&#x27;t be putting down this baby!</li>
            <li> Got this product for a gift to a friend, and she said it was amazing! It&#x27;s one of the better curling irons my friend had used. I couldn&#x27;t say much more about it, but I believe her because she has over 100k instagram followers and is a big influence on social media...</li>
            <li> First, I have extremely thick hair, and I have never had luck keeping a curl past lunchtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I&#x27;m a very low-key kind of girl. I wear minimal makeup and don&#x27;t like spending too long on my hair, but I DO like to look nice. Using a regular curling iron or rollers from the drug store just takes too dang long for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I am bad with gadgets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this Miraqueen was a no-brainer purchase for me. It helps me keep my curl ALL day long! This is important because I work full-time and then I go to night school. I do NOT like showing up to work after lunch or my evening classes looking haggard and frumpy. This curling iron makes me look good ALL day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it does not take me forever and a day to curl my hair. With regular curling irons, I never know how long to leave them in my hair to get a nice, full curl. The Miraqueen beeps when I&#x27;m supposed to take it out. So effortless and easy for me, even someone who isn&#x27;t good at gadgets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it&#x27;s safe! Sometimes I leave the bathroom in the middle of getting ready and forget to unplug my curling iron. The Miraqueen will turn itself off if left unattended. My other curling irons don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Miraqueen, I get a long-lasting style for my thick hair in a minimal amount of time. It&#x27;s a winner. :) I can look like I spent hours on my hair when I only spend a fraction of the time I used to!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of professional curling irons on the market, and as a guy, most of us don&#x27;t use curling irons, but for my daughter&#x27;s sake, we do.  Let me tell you I have had some irons in the past that try to curl my daughter&#x27;s hair and have to stop because it&#x27;s not curling the hair, hurting my hands, etc.  This Miraqueen curling iron has a great contour design, an awesome LED screen that shows the temperature, curl direction, and even has a timer.  Whether you are a woman who needs a high quality iron or a man with long hair, or even to use for your children&#x27;s hair, this is the curling iron I would recommend.  Oh, and on Amazon, the price is awesome!</li>
            <li> Great product that is unlike anything else I&#x27;ve used. The beeps are cool. It&#x27;s like R2-D2 is doing my hair! What else can I say?</li>
            <li> I read all thegreat reviews for this item and i just don&#x27;t see the awesomeness. I have long hair and its a little wavy and frizzy  and i had problems doing my back. If i don&#x27;t insert it perfectly it doesn&#x27;t work so i had to play with it to the point that i might as well use a real curler. Maybe this is a great product if you don&#x27;t know how to use a curler. It takes less time to hold a strand in the heating system but too long to set the hair perfectly. In the end the time is about the same to finish hair.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning it because its another machine that most likely wont use. I think if you have straight hair without any fuzz you my enjoy this product more than me.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tool! love it!</li>
            <li> I really love this thing. It&#x27;s so easy to use and makes great curls. My one complaint - and it&#x27;s a big one - is that it beeps loudly the whole time you&#x27;re using it. It has a countdown beep and then it beeps quickly to let you know your curl is ready. This wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if my husband was already awake when I am getting ready, but he&#x27;s always still asleep and this beeping wakes him up. So I either have to use it on the other side of the house or not at all. I wish there was a way to adjust the volume of the beeping.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product but it doesn&#x27;t work well on my short shoulder lengthen layered hair.. Had to return! Otherwise I would have kept it, easy to use!</li>
            <li> Well made and easy to use. I suck ay curling my hair, but this makes it simple. I haven&#x27;t noticed any damage either. Curling was easy anf quick, even with my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I am certainly impressed and very happy with my new purchase.  I have very baby-fine hair and layered about shoulder length.  I was able to use this immediately just by having watched the video posted on it.  I ordered it through Amazon.com on sale.  I ordered in one evening and it arrived the day after that by 2 pm.  Amazing product and fast shipping :-)</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter loves it. She uses it all the time on her hair. Was a surprise Christmas gift. Thank you. Works great!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I don&#x27;t review products as often as I should considering that I depend on reviews a lot when determining whether or not to purchase items online.  This product exceeded my expectations so much that I just have to let anyone know how wonderful it is if they are hesitant to spend the money.  (and I am an actual customer)  I am a mother of two, one of which is a toddler, and fixing my hair is not a top priority though I&#x27;ve always sought out ways to curly my hair which is so popular now and I haven&#x27;t found anything that works like this.  I, like so many others, have bought wands and straightners and watched countless videos on how to use them to achieve pretty curly hair with no luck.  I might get lucky and end up with one curl that looks good and the next one looks all weird and bendy?  I also must admit that if it involves much more skill than putting my hair in a pony tail (which is my look 99% of the time) I&#x27;m all thumbs.  Somehow when I look in the mirror, I turn into a clumsy idiot.  This curling device has changed all that.  Finally, my hair looks like I want it to look and it&#x27;s EASY!  My hair is pretty long and I can curl it with this in 15 minutes.  I have gotten so many compliments.  The instructions included in the box are not very good, basically how to turn the thing on so I suggest you watch some videos on this device or a similar one for some tips but there isn&#x27;t much of a learning curve, it just works!  A big question people ask is whether or not it tangles your hair up in it and I can honestly say it has not happened to me yet. If you are like me and think this thing seems a bit pricey and hesitant on whether or not it will work, don&#x27;t be, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I hope it last a long time and in the long run won&#x27;t seem like much especially if I add up all the cheaper devices I&#x27;ve purchase that don&#x27;t work at all for me.  I love it so much, I&#x27;m almost considering buying a &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; just in case this one quits and they discontinue it or something.  One tip, I can give for any other &amp;#34;hair challenged&amp;#34; people like me that I found on a video at some point that I found helpful is to section your hair and curl the top first, which is backwards of most tuturiols you see.  I curl the top first while the bottom section is tied out of the way with a hair tie then gently clip the curled top section and curl the bottom.  When doing it the traditional way, I always felt that the top section just got intermingled with the bottom while trying to finish the top.  One more thing, I was a bit hesitant on this one just because it was cheaper than the perhaps the more well known brands but it seems sturdy and not cheaply made at all.  I&#x27;m very happy that I decided on this one.  Oh, and one more thing, in my research, I did see where possibly some of the other brands don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;alternating&amp;#34; option for the curl direction or maybe only curled in one direction.  I always use the alternating option because it gives me the look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product.  This is the only curling iron that I have used that my hair will actually keep the curl.  Easy to use and so glad to have it.</li>
            <li> I am not one of those women who is &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; at doing hair. Most of my life I&#x27;ve been blessed with &amp;#34;wash and go&amp;#34; hair and haven&#x27;t messed with it - still can&#x27;t master a round brush and blow dryer except for on my bangs, and I wasn&#x27;t introduced to a flat iron until college when I decided to go short for the first time in my life....in Florida...talk about 3 mile wide hair.  Just setting expectations for what kind of hair skill person I am.  Also I guess I should note my hair type for comparison - I have very thick, red hair - i.e. prone to frizz - and a lot of it, which is currently bra clasp length.  Although it is thick, it does have some natural wave/curl and holds curl fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to get those big-almost-waves-but-still-curls thing but wasn&#x27;t sure I had the skills for a traditional curling iron and was just plain terrified of the clipless/wand things (sorority sister got a really nasty burn on that thing in college and I still have nightmares about it).  Read some reviews - decided to go with the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron - it was less expensive than the Conair Pro and had more features - mainly the curl direction choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and it&#x27;s amazing!  I didn&#x27;t really time myself to the exact minute - but I would say it took 35-40 minutes the first time (mostly because of trial and error) and less than 30 min the second time - definitely comparable to a flat iron timing for me.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair!  The first time it was a bit tighter than I was going for, but still pretty.  I was able to get the look I was going for by doing it the night before with no hairspray, medium heat/timing, and combing out in the morning to soften.  In the two times I&#x27;ve used it I have NEVER gotten my hair stuck/tangled in it.  Follow the instructions and brush out right before you feed it in with a fine tooth brush, and respect the 1/2-1 inch rule.  The few times I got overzealous with section sizing the device immediately figured out it was too much hair and stopped.  The curls stay for days without hairspray.  I did not use a protector - but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34;.  It does get a little heavy if you have a lot of hair...but no worse than those 2&amp;#34; ceramic flat irons used to be or a hairdryer. It did not get hot enough to burn my hand or head - though I still might not put it completely up to my scalp on the high setting.  Despite being so lazy about beauty regimes, I can definitely see myself using this regularly.  I&#x27;m going to be a bridesmaid this fall and will DEFINITELY be bringing this with me to DIY my hair - side pony/braid and use the &amp;#34;ringlet&amp;#34; feature of this thing on the ends and it&#x27;ll look like I spent $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for long hair:&lt;br /&gt;1. I did find that I needed to use the medium heat and longer time setting for the bottom section and shorter time setting for the top section/layers to keep it non-poodle-esque.  If you are good with hair you probably already knew this - I did not.  The bottom section fell out after about a day, the top section stayed curly for 3 sleeps after the initial curl - with NO hairspray - probably would have stayed longer but I washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you are going for the more long loose curls look, start halfway down your hair instead of near the scalp.  I have more than enough volume and decent natural wave, I just wanted something more controlled looking.  When you start halfway down the hair you can also get away with a larger section than by the scalp because it&#x27;s already smoothed into a single &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; instead of the &amp;#34;cone&amp;#34; of hair at the root when you gather it. If that makes sense... Also curl the night before and sleep on it, then comb out in the morning and go.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use the auto rotate feature except for the 1-2 curls directly by your face which you curl outward.&lt;br /&gt;4. If you want thicker bigger curls - use the same direction for a few sequential curls and you can then grab all of them at the root together and carefully run your thumb and forefinger along them to combine into one big fat curl&lt;br /&gt;5. Watch some youtube videos (even if they are for the conair pro or babybliss) for more tips or tricksd you can then grab all of them at the root together and carefully run your thumb and forefinger along them to combine into one big fat curl&lt;br /&gt;5. Watch some youtube videos (even if they are for the conair pro or babybliss) for more tips or tricks</li>
            <li> Works perfectly no issue with tangling if used following the instructions.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I get lots of compliments when I use it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money. I anticipated the arrival of this curling iron but after using it was extremely disappointed. I used very thin strands and even with that and the highest, longest heat setting, the best I got was big waves.  My hair is fine and I have a lot of it. I get much better curls with my conair regular iron. It also mentions tanglefree...umm no, my hair tangled 4x and it was not pleasant getting it out, and yes, I did comb the strand before placing it in the iron.  Disappointment abounds with this product. Sending it back immediately.</li>
            <li> I received the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron as a gift and I was so skeptical when I first went to use, not to mention terrified that it would destroy my hair! After letting it heat up completely I decided to be brave and try it on my hair and the results were absolutely stunning! My hair was so curled with gorgeous ringlets and the device was super east to use. The curl stuck in my hair overnight and into the next day with no fall-out or loosening of the curls, and I received A TON of compliments. I was so excited to finally have a product that worked so well, especially since curling you hair can take so long and this just took minutes! Unfortunately, I was only able to use this device TWICE before the heating unit went out and stopped curling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I say the heating unit went out, that&#x27;s just my guess. I&#x27;m not an expert and I could be wrong but the device just stopped getting hot. It would get warm but not nearly as hot as it needed to be. The ringlets soon become just waves and it was no longer giving me the results it once did. I waited to make sure it was &amp;#34;completely&amp;#34; warmed up, it beeped to indicate that it was. I held it in my hair for the duration selected and waited until it beeped after 12 seconds as well. I tried switching the direction of the curl, I tried making it hotter, I tried leaving it in my hair longer, NOTHING WORKED. I even made sure I had it plugged in to a power source that had the required amount of voltage needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so upset that it stopped working after TWO uses because it was fantastic when it was actually getting up to temp :(</li>
            <li> Great hair curler, but I had to wait 5 months for it to be back in stock prime and the regular price ($89.99) since Christmas 2014. The curler itself works well. It beeps at you if you put in too much hair (for me about 1 inch width is the max). I have long straight thick hair and it curls it well, though some curls have to be redone by the time I am done. It takes approximately 35-40 minutes to curl all my hair, pinning it up and curling it by layers. I use Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner and the oils in these do not cause my hair to burn. It is virtually impossible to burn yourself with it unlike regular hair wand curlers, and this doesn&#x27;t entail wrapping or twisting. My hair got stuck a few times but it was easy to ease it out and did not get split or cut up.  I use organic sweet almond oil as frizz control and heat protectant with this curler, and I have heard that avocado oil works well as heat protectant with it too. I haven&#x27;t needed a hair spray to hold the curls, though I recommend Herbal Essence flexible hold hair spray because of its ingredients.</li>
            <li> I do not normally review products, but this was so great I feel compelled to tell everyone!!!! I have long, thick hair and was terrified to use this for the first time. It was so easy and worked perfectly! It is impossible to mess up, with it beeping and releasing if there is too much hair, a tangle, etc. I was done in no time and the curls lasted all day! I cannot say enough great things about this. I will never use a curling iron again. Best $60 I have spent in a long time!</li>
            <li> A must buy! I love it! I watched some YouTube videos to know how to work it and it&#x27;s too simple! I have fairly long hair and I used the recommendation to use about half an inch of hair each time if you want all over curls. If you just want the ends you can use a little bit more hair. Always have the roller part facing your head and it will never turn out bad. Also play with the seconds and temp to find the right setting for you.  10/22/15- I had to add a comment after I&#x27;ve used this so many times. I still love it. I&#x27;ve never gotten my hair stuck. I have super long thin hair and it works. I like to spray it with holding spray and then curl all over and let the curls cool then comb through. It gives me the most beautiful beach waves and its holds for 2 days. The best product I have ever tried</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally kinky hair. I&#x27;m normally not into gadgets but I love to wear my hair in big, sexy curls. My normal method of obtain these curls is a grueling process that require me sitting under a hooded drier for hours. If I allow my hair to air dry that takes days so I was willing to give this curling wand a try. It worked great for me BUT I did have to make sure my hair was blown out already so I could obtain the silky look that I like. I also used really small sections so I wouldn&#x27;t have to manipulate the curl after I finished curling my hair. I really like the results and may record a video... stay tuned.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this. I really, really did.  I had these visions of beachy waves, effortlessly created that lasted throughout the day.  And that may be a possibility...if you can prevent it from sucking your hair and trapping it.  After a few successful and unsuccessful attempts, I thought I had figured it out (I had watched a youtube video as a guide in preparation but it&#x27;s also about testing on yourself). I had a few frizzy curls released, then one or two that were normal and in between that, a handful of failed curling attempts due to the amount of hair or some tangle that occurred on the way in.  The dealbreaker was when I finally got the perfect sized section, brushed smoothly and as the Miraqueen started to do its thing, the warning went off that something wasn&#x27;t right.  I released the handle expecting it to release my hair as it&#x27;s supposed to.  It didn&#x27;t.  I pressed and released to no avail--in fact, that just resulting in it tightening it&#x27;s lockdown on my hair--hair that was on the top level, right next to my crown. I persistently tried to tug out my hair (any or all of it) and released very few strands.  I was almost convinced that I was going to have to get the scissors out and suffer the most awful grow out but the prospect of that made me more determined. After another 10 minutes or so, I managed to wrench my hair from its grasp--some broken, most frizzy and damaged but at least not cut off near my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as you might imagine, this is going back.  I&#x27;m not willing to risk losing my hair while trying to figure out this device.  Now, I just need a curling iron that will leave waves in my straight hair for the whole day, instead of just going straight again in an hour.  Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She loves it. She told me that the ceramic curling chamber is what makes the difference. I&#x27;m no hair stylist, but I know my wife is the kind of woman who knows exactly what she wants and why.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing!  Okay I am guy but I bought this for my wife and we BOTH absolutely love it.  I get 4 different women with this one curling iron :)  My wife normally wears her hair straight because it is too difficult to get curly hair with just a curling iron and it is too expensive to go get a perm at the salon.  With this curling iron she is able to wear her hair straight, or with 3 different types of curls.  The Miraqueen curling iron pulls in the hair without pulling out the hair.  All she has to do is wait for the set number of beeps and she knows exactly when to release the curl for the looks she (and I) want.</li>
            <li> As a salon owner we are always seeing new products and well this one just blew us away!  How unique and functional this was.  We now have all the stylist with them!  Perfect waves or ringlets ~ this is one cool curling wand.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing! I had completely given up on curling irons- my hair would only hold it&#x27;s natural, bad-looking curls, so I usually just straightened it (which is pretty damaging). Then I was gifted this for Christmas, and it did exactly what you hoped it would. Now I take it with me everywhere, cheerleading events and on trips, and I get the most perfect look with curls ever. And I love that it&#x27;s not hot! I&#x27;m the type of girl you&#x27;d find with a hair straightener burn on her neck (I&#x27;m clumsy okay) that looks like a hickey, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about it with this little beauty! My mother even let my eight-year-old sister use it, because it was so safe. This is actually great for anyone from younger children to older women.&lt;br /&gt;Not to get emotional, but this hair straightener kinda changed my life... When you know your hair looks good, you are more confident, and I did get a little more attention with fabulous hair too :D.  Now I never have to worry about how my hair looks, or being able to style it or change it up. I fully recommend this curler for all women (or men!)!</li>
            <li> As someone with perfectly straight hair, I&#x27;ve spent SO many hours being frustrated in the morning, trying to curl my hair. One of my friends let me try this at her place and I knew I just had to get it. I love how quick and efficient it is, compared to a lot of other curling irons. I didn&#x27;t think I would love it this much, but now I can&#x27;t even travel without it. If you are looking for curling irons, I would absolutely suggest this one</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product! She loves using it to give herself beautiful curls before formal events. The best part is that she doesn&#x27;t need to use any additional products! The curls usually last a day or two after she has used the product. Highly recommended. A+.</li>
            <li> This was a fantastic purchase.  I picked one up for my wife who has thick hair, and it worked perfectly.  Her hair was able to go through easily, and the curl held all day which was a real plus.  The digital control features made this really easy to use and get the same result every time.  One of the issues that my wife had was previous curls burning her hair, and this was not an issue with this curler.  One of the best things about the product is its durability.  My wife dropped it a couple of times, and she never had a problem with it.  It worked the same every time.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she was very pleased with it. it has a ceramic technology and protects hair from damage</li>
            <li> Works best with small stands of hair. Don&#x27;t try to put large chunks in, my hair got stuck and burned it.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks when it&#x27;s curled but with all the time curling my full head of hair takes, it is often too time-consuming to do. It&#x27;s always such a hassle and my hair ends up looking damaged. At a friend&#x27;s request, I tried the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron. All I have to say is &amp;#34;Wow.&amp;#34; It effortlessly curls my hair, saving me time, and also my hair doesn&#x27;t look damaged at the end of the week. I have tried tons of curling irons and this one is the best by far. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this Curling iron for my wife for her birthday a couple of weeks ago and she absolutely loves it!  She loves the timer and the adjustable heat settings.  In addition the LCD screen makes it easy for her to tell the temperature .  Her curls last all day and the waves also look amazing!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife she said it works GREAT but does take awhile to do all your hair. The curls really last.</li>
            <li> It seems to work great. I have hard to curl, very straight hair. But this makes ringlettes on the highest setting and they hold about 8 hours. It&#x27;s worth it to keep trying with different product then, curling.</li>
            <li> It works really well, and I believe that it should be used more by many others. It&#x27;s design really targets those who want to save time and have hair like a goddess. Works pretty well with my thin hair, and tried it on my hubby for fun, and works on his thick long hair too. My recommendation is that you should find the right time and temperature for yourself. Testing out the settings isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Gentle waves are beautiful, but getting them at home takes too much time and effort! Thanks to the Miraqueen, it’s now easier than ever before to create loose, natural curls more-simply at home. The curler&#x27;s unique heating barrel safely pulls hair in and curls it with ease. This is great for loose, natural waves, or hard curls and is made simple!</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to use. Just one suggestion, it will be great product, if the roll size could adjustable( the curl make me look older). Anyway, I would recommend this products, it&#x27;s cheap but useful.</li>
            <li> As someone with thick, coarse, hair, it&#x27;s amazing to find products that work so well and which is so efficient. It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair like most curling irons do, and it leaves curls that last for days. Also, very easy to use!</li>
            <li> I bought this through my husband&#x27;s account.  Normally I don&#x27;t write product reviews, but as someone who has hair that is impossible to curl on my own, I have searched for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; styling tool and spent a lot of money doing it.  And for the most part it&#x27;s been a waste, until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far that BEST curler I have ever used!  It couldn&#x27;t be any easier to use, and the results actually come out just as the manufacturer claims!  The only thing that wasn&#x27;t really true for me was that I would be able to curl my whole head in 5 minutes.  My hair is shoulder length, pretty straight, not course at all, but it&#x27;s still really thick, so I knew it would take me longer.  The first time I used it, it was probably closer to 25 minutes, and a lot of that was probably just because it was the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did also buy the Babyliss Pro Miracurl Hair Product Kit to go with it.  I prepped the hair with the curl prep spray, dried thoroughly, and just grabbed about a 1 inch section of hair, set the curler to 450 and used the setting for 10 seconds and got a perfect curl!  At one point, I did start to get a little impatient and tried to use a section of hair that was too big, so it got a little caught.  It triple beeps to let you know it&#x27;s stuck, and stops trying to pull the hair in.  I pulled the plug to make sure the heat was off and just tugged a little section of hair out at a time and had it free in about 5 seconds.  My hair was not tangled, knotted or damaged so that was good!  So that&#x27;s my only note, just make sure you are not using sections of hair that are too big, and brush out the section before you feed it in, or it might get caught.  Even when it starts to get caught, I started to get a feel for it, and was able to pull the hair out before it started to really catch and then just re-feed it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls held all day, and even though I am not used to being able to curl my own hair, it was actually pretty easy to style.  I letthe curls relax just a little and ran my fingers through it.  Then I sprayed with thermal shine spray and defining spray and I couldn&#x27;t believe how good it looked!  I have always been good with makeup, and did my own for my wedding, but hair has never been my strong area.  If I had owned this curler then, I would have done my hair myself too!  That&#x27;s how happy I am with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and have struggled finding curlers that work the way they advertise and actually work son hair that is at time resistant to curling, this is worth trying.  I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about it, so just go for it!  You won&#x27;t regret it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Shayna</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing! I have extremely fine hair that I have always had difficulty curling. I usually have to do very tight curls to get them to last more than a couple hours. This curler gets hot enough to make loose curls that last for the duration of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had some mild issues with tangles, maybe one or two per curling session. However, in each case it was because I didn&#x27;t use the machine properly, either putting in too much hair or putting in hair with tangles (make sure your hair is COMPLETELY combed before using this or you will have issue). Overall I&#x27;ve tried bunch of different curler styles (straight wand, brush, clamp etc) and this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Wow! This really works like a charm! I have really thick long hair and I can curl all my hair in about 20 mins. The curls last too! I&#x27;m able to go a couple days with only having to put a few curls in after sleeping on. I really like how easy it is to use and how quick it works. I would recommend this product to anyone. Try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome, works just great!!!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the product but after three months of use it brokes&lt;br /&gt;the inner tube does not rotate so it can not be used.. very disappointed..  and I couldn´t communicate with the seller for warranty</li>
            <li> The best curling iron ever. It seems to be more gentle to my fine hair than traditional curling iron. My hair stay curled even next day. Can&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Does not work AT ALL. Yes, I&#x27;m using it correctly.</li>
            <li> Holy crap this thing actually works! I&#x27;m the girl who can&#x27;t keep good looking curls in her hair at all. I can use my straightener, but I still have to do every curl twice or more for about 45 mins, and when I&#x27;m done my hair smells burned, looks burned, and the curl doesn&#x27;t last all day. If I use a curling iron, well, that&#x27;s 3 times minimum and no lasting curls at all, after over an hour of effort. I tried this on a Friday and I got perfect curls the first time, and even using the smaller chunks of hair as recommended, I was finished in 35 mins which was very satisfactory in time savings! The next day I went boating and pinned back just my front hair and left the rest down. Several hours later, I STILL HAD GREAT CURLS. Woke up Sunday and yes, there were a few curls that were more limp than preferred but the overall look of my hair was large, loose, curls that looked effortless. I just touched up a couple and went about my day. This machine is a LIFE SAVER. Buy it. Throw away your old curling iron. You&#x27;ll gain the cost back in just a couple uses. Every woman needs this!!!</li>
            <li> I was worried about using this and getting my hair tangled the first time I used it and my hair started to tangle the iron started beeping at me and stopped pulling in my hair. I just opened the chamber and released my hair. No biggie! It was quick and easy to use. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair, and have spend hundreds of dollars on hair products that did not work.  This is the BEST money I have ever spent on a hair product!  It is quick, easy, and the curls last all day!  I LOVE IT!!&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, but sometimes if I try to put too much hair in, it gets stuck, but it always comes out if you wait for the warning beeps to stop and for it to release the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the $$!!!</li>
            <li> I am now a hugeee fan of miraqueen. This curler is one of a kind. I have very straight hair, that used to never curl and have always wanted loose wavy curls. This is the one product that helped me achieve those results. No other curling iron has made me this satisfied.</li>
            <li> Professional Curling Iron is what i use to curl my hair after taking a shower..i blow dry my hair and then use this wonderful curler,and i have used this for months its very durable..great product</li>
            <li> Quick fast and in a hurry to wonderful curls! The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, is a awesome innovative product. Although it takes some getting use to, it is an iron that all women with longer hair should invest in. Why? Because if you are anything like me and need curls in a hurry then this is for you. More importantly it is far less likely that you will have that ugly iron burn on your forehead when you are finished. No more hit or miss curls. The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, is gives you a consistent curls.&lt;br /&gt;I have been in the hair industry for over 20 years and I have come to find that this Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is great and by far a product of fine design. The ceramic technology allows you to use higher temperatures like 300 or 450 for hard to curl hair without the fear of damages. This iron has temperature setting that allow you to have a tight or soft curl depending on the look you are going after. Not to mention, the timer is awesome and a very handy tool. If only other irons had that. I would recommend this iron to hair dressers that deal with clients that have longer hair. It is fast and it works!</li>
            <li> I love curling my hair, but its always such a complicated situation. I am not a fan of regular curling irons but didn&#x27;t know anything else existed until my cousin told me about this curler! I am so impressed with the beautiful and long lasting curls it gives me! Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on how to use it.  All of the reviews said how great it is.  I&#x27;ll keep practicing .</li>
            <li> I have tried just about everything to form the perfect curl... heat rollers, leave in rollers, straighteners (got talked into it in the Mall lol), curling irons... you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. But I never get the perfect curl and I&#x27;m never able to consistently reproduce curls that are almost perfect. I finally gave up for about a good year. Then I came across this! I was a little hesitant at first, but looked at a few videos on Youtube and thought i would give it a try.... THIS ACTUALLY WORKS! I always have perfect curls and I am able to reproduce those curls for my whole entire head of hair. The curler heats up very quickly and stays hot throughout my entire use. It is also very easy to hold and comfortable-- I&#x27;ve always found straighteners and curlers not very easy on the hands, but this is the exact opposite. The price is an ultimate steal-- I&#x27;ve paid double this price for curlers that were nothing as great as this! Awesome buy! If you&#x27;re tired of being frustrated with curlers, this will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li> This is really fun to use and effective.  Its ready to go fast and the styling time is fast.  Why wasn&#x27;t I turned on to this earlier!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curls are frizz free, bouncy and full of volume.  This is my new best friend and I highly recommend this to anyone serious about getting the best curls they can get.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write the reviews, but read them, and in this case I think it is not fare to do not say anything , so after burning myself few times with traditional curling iron I decided to purchase this one because I liked the reviews and the way it looked on a picture. From the day I received it my hair change the style frome straight to curly completely, it so easy and fun using this iron , love it, wish it will never break.</li>
            <li> This product is one of a kind. Never seen anything like it. Curling irons have come a long way. I remember when it was a simple plug up, wait to heat, grip it and continuously burn your scalp, now we have the Miraqueen proffesional curling iron, which is equipped with digital controls, a rotary function allowing you to choose the direction it curls, it heats in an reasonable amount of time and very comfortable when holding. No longer will you have to worry about time and burns. For this device has it under control. With multiple heat settings and a nice LED screen you can&#x27;t go wrong with styling your hair nicely and easily. I highly recommend this product for the price and high class functions you&#x27;ll simply love it! Ready to have a different style week after week? Then don&#x27;t hesitate to try this fantastic product. A+++</li>
            <li> Gifted this to my girlfriend and She just loves it. Thanks a lot Miraqueen.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product. Works as mentioned here. Definitely a buy.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is awesome! I am very pleased with my purchase! My hair is always flat as a pancake no matter what I use and using the usual long curling iron I tend to burn myself rather than give my hair bounce. Using this one is so much less hassle and the curls look totally professional. I will admit I was more than a little hesitant to use this product given the price about the quality, but I am on a tight budget and did not have many options.  I am so glad it turned out to be such a great value! It is a professional product without the professional price! I definitely recommend this to anyone considering this purchase!</li>
            <li> This curling iron did not disappoint. It&#x27;s lightweight and has a swivel cord so I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting tangled up while doing my hair. The display lets you know when your desired temp is set. It even has a timer that beeps when your hair is curled. It sucks the hair in, curls it, and releases when done. Also, it has automatic shut off, so I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore when I leave the house. Automatic curling, super easy to use, and no more tired hands and arms because it does all the work for you!</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with curling irons because I have thick hair. I spend too much time on my hair and yet my curls barely make it through the day.  An incident where my hair was nearly toasted almost put me off curling irons for good. A good friend recommended the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron. I must say that I purchased it with bated breath.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it immediately I saw it because it was made from ceramic instead of metal making it easy to handle. Moreover, the 3 heat level and 4 timer setting allows me choose how I want to curl my hair without turning it toast. The first time I used it, it took me just 10 minutes to  curl my hair and I wore the hair for 2 days. I cannot remember when last I did this!The Miraqueen Professional Curling has been a time saver to say the least.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best and most versatile hair products I have ever owned. Not only is the product effective, but it is simple and easy to use. I would definitely recommend this to other who like to fix their hair.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy on my pockets. I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive brands and the Miraqueen blows all the others out of the water! It heats up hot and curls my hair in seconds. It doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair when I&#x27;m using it and doesn&#x27;t fry hair since you don&#x27;t have to have it on your hair but for only a few seconds. It&#x27;s great. I don&#x27;t have to sit and curl my hair for hours anymore, I can do it in less than 10 mins. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;And my hair stays curled, before my hair would fall flat within an hour, even with hair spray. Now with Miraqueen it stays curled all day, and I don&#x27;t have to use as much product in my hair. And since you don&#x27;t have to touch the hot part of the iron I no longer burn my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;This iron has changed my view on curling my hair, I use to dread it, now I love to because it&#x27;s so quick and easy. It looks like I spent hours on my hair, but really it only took a few minutes! I recommend this product to anyone who likes the look of curled hair but doesn&#x27;t want to hassle with it.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t bother curling my hair or using more than a hair dryer to curl my hair due to time constraints and having very un-curler-friendly hair. I bought this on the recommendation of a friend whose hair always looks fantastic, and she insisted it was something I could handle myself.    While the contraption looks complicated at first, it&#x27;s actually great for people who are not super experienced with using curling irons. Even for women with thin hair, there&#x27;s little risk of burning your hair because you can select the right temperature for your particular hair type.     The best part:  This curler is practically idiot-proof. Say you want big fluffy curls. Not only do you not need to change out a rod to match the thickness of the curl, but you can also select the timer that coordinates with that kind of curl. And even if you leave the curler on your hair too long, it&#x27;s designed to time itself out after a little bit so you have less of a risk of burning your hair.     Some other nice perks: it&#x27;ll change the rotation of the curler so your curls can point in either direction (relieving the user of the pain of trying to twist their hands backwards to get more natural looking curls). There are multiple features to protect your skin and your countertop from the heat of the curler, and includes an automatic shut-off in case you forget to unplug it when you&#x27;re done. The handle of the curler itself includes an LCD display so you can see what settings you&#x27;re working with, which I think is a really nice feature considering all the bells and whistles that are included.    Overall I think this is a great product! Definitely made a difference with my tough to curl hair!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! I am half African American, so as you can imagine, I have pretty thick hair that gets frizzy and tangled easily. It is very difficult for me to curl my hair (at salons it can take up to an hour and a half and when I ATTEMPT to do it myself, anywhere from 2-3 hours), but the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron works wonders on my hair! I have also used it on my friends and it produces stunning, bouncy curls every time! My favorite thing about the curling iron is that it doesn&#x27;t get insanely hot so it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. It&#x27;s nice not to smell my hair burning every time I try to style it with a flat iron or curling iron!! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron. The curls are not the same as you would see from a barrel curling iron but still beautiful. My curls last much longer and it&#x27;s easy to use. My hair is long and it works well. Small pieces are key. I am lefty so it took awhile to get the hang of it. everyone raves at the curls. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter has tried a few curling products. She is black and her hair is thick so I was skeptical that it would work for her. I was also concerned about breakage. I didn&#x27;t want her to have to use it everyday and  hair styling is time consuming. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It doesn&#x27;t damage her hair. It is perfectly curled and she doesn&#x27;t need to use additional hair products for the curls to hold. I am glad I did not waste my money.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever used. I love all the features. My favorite is the automatic shut off. Now I dont have to panic over whether or not I turned it off. I also love that it protects my hair from damage. Its a grest price as well. The led screen and all the settings and heat levels make it worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> This thing is incredible! At first I was weary because it looked so bulky, I thought it would be too unwieldy to curl hair. I already had a mountain of curling irons that never worked out for me because my hair texture is so thick and slightly wavy. (The curls always fall out of my hair after an hour or two.) I was just about done with trying to curl my hair and I wanted to throw my hairstyle to the wind and hope for the best, but in the end I didn&#x27;t have to! It seemed about a bit much for a hair curler, but the reviews made it seem so tempting, so I bought it anyways to see what the fuss was about. I ended up being SO enthralled by this curling iron! I&#x27;m not much of a hairdresser, I can never get the curls to stay in my hair long enough. But this tool made it look like I had gone to the salon, and it stayed that way! All of my friends were commenting on how good I looked on our night out! Even my boyfriend commented on how nice my hair looked, saying I should style my hair this way more often. The beep it makes when it finished curling your hair is great because I was tired of guessing when it was done, now I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning any of my hair! It even shuts off after the timer goes off, so my hair is safe even if I left it in there. It looks complicated, but is easy enough to understand. (I was all &amp;#34;My hair is going into a chamber? What?&amp;#34;) I&#x27;m not very good with technology to begin with, but figuring this out turned out to be simple. The buttons and controls are a lot easier than they look. I use it almost every day now, and it&#x27;s so much more fun using the Miraqueen to get those devil-may-care loose curls I adore while still looking neat and clean. My days of searching are over, and I&#x27;m definitely getting rid of those other old curling irons for good!</li>
            <li> my wife loves this new curling iron, she was bragging to her friends at church the other day about how great it is. Since she has a back injury regular curling irons take too long, causing too much pain. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
            <li> Amzing! Curls my hair perfect! I could never curl my hair until now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this thing!  I have so many curling irons, from professional to ones I picked up at target, but this thing is amazing. I was totally skeptical about it actually working , but it really does.  You do have to take small sections  of hair at a time, if not it catches your hair and starts beeping at you.  It sounds a little scary, but it hasn&#x27;t pulled my hair once.  Its great for my daughter as well.  P is almost 4 and Ive been hesitant to use an actual curling iron on her, with all the moving about she does whenever I touch her hair, but the heating element is contained in this so she really can&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used for my hair. In all my 65 years, I have never been able to keep a curl in my hair for longer than 10 minutes .... I swear! I have used curling irons, rollers, steam setters, hot curlers etc. and NOTHING worked, This little appliance is easy and quick. I only shampoo once a week and my curls are still there at the end of the week. They go from curly, curly to soft waves, but they are still there ..... all the way to the ends. (I have fairly long hair) I recommend this to everyone. I am thinking about getting one for my 3 daughters-in-law with whom I have 8 granddaughters, so there would be 11 more happy customers.</li>
            <li> My hair has never held a curl. EVER. I have fine hair, but after using this MAGIC iron, my curls literally last for days!!</li>
            <li> This is the best curler in the world!  I have thick hair that is down to my waist.  I was worried that this item would not  curl my long hair but it does!  Not only does it curl well, I DO NOT HAVE TO USE ANY PRODUCT!  The time it saves me is well worth the price of the item.  I wouLd normally spend about and hour curling my hair.  IT TAKES ME 15 MINUTES TO CURL MY WHOLE HEAD OF HAIR WITH THIS!</li>
            <li> OMG - this thing is AWESOME!!&lt;br /&gt;Curled my entire hair in less than 5 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;And the curls stayed in for days!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It takes a lot longer than five minutes to curl 10&amp;#34; - 12&amp;#34; straight hair. The directions are fair, lots of misspellings and poor grammar. I finally figured out how to use it. The directions do say not to use any product on your hair and I agree. The curl held much better without any gel or mousse. It is rather heavy and I just have to be in a festive mood to put all that effort into curling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does work but I would not recommend it to my friends. Too much work.</li>
            <li> Bought for Grandaughter .. She really liked it, worked great.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this curling iron.  It definitely has a learning curve, the key is to place smaller strands in the iron, and to make sure your hair is absolutely tangle free and to also make sure the device is horizontal as any vertical movement causes it to jam (which is not a pleasant feeling, trust me).  But the curls last all day and look so beautiful.  I find it&#x27;s more of a special occasion device, it does take awhile to curl an entire head of hair (I do have quite a lot of hair so maybe that&#x27;s just me), and I wouldn&#x27;t go to the trouble of doing this just for work, but this works so much better than traditional curling irons, and I love the reverse feature so you don&#x27;t have to remember which way you just curled.  The shipping was super fast (with Prime) and the price is very good, compared to the other types of devices similar to this out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.. does the job as shown in the You Tube video. However, it is very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I decided it&#x27;s time to chuck out the old curlers and get a new one. Found this interesting thing and got it for the sake of upgrading. Gotta keep up with the times, hot rollers, bendy foam curlers, and ol&#x27; curling irons are outdated. Automatic is really the new age. Look at the cars, that&#x27;s automatic now, and even the tooth brushes. At first it looked like a vibrator when it popped up on the search until I read it&#x27;s description. I laughed a little inside and wondered how my husband would take it if I showed it to him and said, “this is my new toy.” Well, it really is my new toy. For my hair at least. It&#x27;s pretty light weighted, and I&#x27;m used to a lot heavier ones and I also lift a lot of weights at the gym on occasion so it feels weird. Pops out curls easy enough. Good enough curler to upgrade to if you want something automatic.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair cut into a bob. I thought I could only wear straight hair styles and I was kind of bummed out. This product got my hair to go in nice little waves. Plus it has an LCD screen which I’ve never seen before on a hair tool, so that was nice. I will definitely use this product all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Nancy</li>
            <li> You will see some smoke come out and your hair will get caught in it once in awhile! Hair looks good when your done though.</li>
            <li> I had all but given up on curling irons. I have tried them all; the old fashioned type, the trendy no clip tapered barrel irons, and those in crazy shapes and in many different sizes. I always find that I do not have the skill needed to get the perfect curls I desired without burning myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently learned that the newest type of curling iron is one that will automatically curl my hair with little effort. Needless to say, I was very intrigued! This curling iron has a ceramic curling wand inside of the chamber, which minimizes damage and makes my hair shiny. I pull the trigger and allow my hair to enter the chamber, then release it once the curl is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I am able to curl my hair with one hand; it is very quick and automatic. Since I don&#x27;t need to manually curl my hair around the barrel, it makes my curling time much faster! The screen helps me ensure that the iron is at the right temperature so I don&#x27;t wait around for too long, guessing if it is the right temperature yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls produced are beautiful, and if creates a variety of different curling options from tight, defined curls, to relaxed, beachy curls. I enjoy the mulch-directional setting that lets me change the direction of my curls. I used to forget to do this with manual curling irons, so my curls wouldn&#x27;t turn out quite as natural. Now I can switch back and forth for the best possible look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature I enjoy are they rubber protector and heat insulating base that prevent me from fumbling around and burning myself or my bathroom counter. This stops me from having to go back and forth, checking to make sure it is balanced right and won&#x27;t burn anything or pose a fire hazard. The everyday use of the Miraqueen curling iron is effortless and safe. I will never need to buy another curling iron again!</li>
            <li> ****i did intentionally Rate 4 Stars! If you read review, hopefully you understand better. :-)&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times that i used this, my hair got stuck and i had to yank it out of the curler, however it did not always come out and i did have to cut some of my hair. Plus it felt as if it took so much longer to curl my hair than if i were to use a curling iron!!!&lt;br /&gt;****if your hair does get caught. Instead of trying to just pull your hair right out of curler... Start pulling your hair out of curler while you hold the trigger down as if your curling your hair, so it is trying to curl your hair while you pull. I promise it&#x27;ll work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***And once i realized the curler works a million times better if it is always facing the same way (as in... The pink is always on top; i attempted to hold it upside down a couple of times because it was more comfortable depending on the area of my head i was curling. It wouldn&#x27;t curl well and that&#x27;s when my hair got caught most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;****Also, there is a &#x27;V&#x27; shaped opening for where your hair goes in, it also makes a huge difference if that &#x27;V&#x27; side is closest to your head (opposed to on the far side of curler/away from your head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you you&#x27;re able to get that down, then your knotted/stuck hair days will be over! :-) And you&#x27;ll beable to curl your hair sooo much faster!!!! I love using this curler now!!!</li>
            <li> At last! A curling iron for people with stubborn hair! As someone with persistently straight hair that won&#x27;t even hold a perm for more than a couple of weeks, I was very skeptical when my sister wanted to try this curling iron on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the old-fashioned curling irons before, with no results except burnt hair and exasperation. This product looked overly complicated and heavy. Was it worth it for a few digital controls?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is yes. The Miraqueen curler is much more than just a fancy digital display. It is more like a hybrid cross between a traditional curling iron and actual hot rollers, and in minutes it can replicate the look of a perm--without the stink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most technologically advanced products, it takes a little practice to get used to the design. It does all the work for you though, including automatically shutting off when each curl has reached the maximum time limit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is even better? The curls actually stayed in my hair! For almost 24 hours. That at least makes it worth the time it takes to curl it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My three favorite features of the Miraqueen Curling Iron (besides the fact that it WORKS) would have to be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The easy release (no more hair getting tangled and scorched as you unwind.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The heat and time settings that allow you to adjust the type of curls you want. (Handy for people with different types of hair, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The swivel cord. This is genius. No more having to hold the iron at weird angles to keep the cord from touching the hot barrel, no more getting tangled in the cord yourself. They really should use this design on more electronics!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who likes the idea of shaking up their usual style by wearing curls. It is a safe, efficient alternative to several cheap curling irons that don&#x27;t work or expensive chemical perm treatments that can eventually ruin your hair.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1WGBMB98OKVBW]]Watch my video and you will see just how amazing this is! I recommend to any and every girl!! I have never in my twenty six years of living have EVER experienced doing a hairstyle to myself with such ease, and so quickly! I have stick thin hair that normally does not hold a curl WHATSOEVER. I have tried every barrel size, I have tried high end, low end, every price point you could think of and to no avail! Just a ton of waste d time, money, and effort.&lt;br /&gt;However, the MiraQueen is a godsend! If you watch my video, you see just how incredibly effortlessly I curl every hair! It is AMAZING! It is safe, there is NO possible way to burn yourself. And it even \\&quot;knows\\&quot; somehow if you have too much hair in as it will unwind, and halt the curling pricess. It is so easy to use. It has a guided set of beeps sounds so that you know exactly how long to leave it in your hair to get the desired look shape and tightness of the curl. The longer the setting, the tighter the curl, the less heat and less seconds on the Digital screen, the looser and wavier the curl.&lt;br /&gt;It is really a no brainer. Perfect for girls ages 10 and up to  (in my opinion), perfect for single dads who are clueless as to how to do a little girls hair, really perfect for ANYONE!&lt;br /&gt;With the holidays just around the corner, this item is the perfect gift for any female any age in your life. This is great for the mom on the go, the fashionista (like myself) any length of hair(I mean not bald obviously) and any type of hair, curly, straight, processed, not processed etc.&lt;br /&gt;It is made of tourmaline ceramic so it is not going to add any further heat damage to your locks. The style will last for days!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this highly!&lt;br /&gt;I am not quite sure how I lived in the beauty world without this amazing gadget!&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate for a moment to purchase! You will not regret it at all!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend. She had been needing a curling iron for a while, and this one had several great reviews, and for good reason. She could not be happier with it! Our friends are always asking her how she gets her curls so perfect, and after the first few days using it she has been thanking me at least once a day for it. This is the only time I&#x27;ve posted a review for something I did not buy for myself, but it&#x27;s because the product is deserving of all five stars, if just for the happiness it&#x27;s brought my Megan. :)</li>
            <li> It can be done! With super fine and completely straight hair, I have been through so many curling irons that were never able to produce results. EVER. The most my hair would curl was slightly at the ends &amp; even with product, it would only last about an hour. My friend had the Miraqueen curling device so I gave it a try. Not only was it painless, fast, and easy, my beautiful curls stayed put all day, without product! All you have to do is insert your hair on one side and the iron does all the work for you; you don&#x27;t have to worry about burning yourself. For someone like me with a laid back style, this was THE extra accessory I needed to complete my look.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the MiraQueen curler! Not only has it tamed my thick, unruly mane but produces the most beautiful curls ever! I was a bit leery about using a rotating curler due to back flashes of tangled hair as a child; but there was no reason to panic. The wand is super safe and comes with a quick release trigger to avoid disaster. The LCD monitor keeps track of the temp, timer and direction for convenient adjustments. I have tried all three timers and love how my hair turns out no matter the setting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye uncomfortable foam rollers and forehead burning wands, I now have the one and only curling iron I need…the MiraQueen!</li>
            <li> I have tried curling my hair with curling irons, flat irons, hot rollers and even heatless curls and it never works out or looks the way I want it to, but with this that has all changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair look great when I curl it using the miraqueen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cane right on time, in great condition and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Semi-con: it can be hard to reach in the back to curl properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this if you want beautiful curls without any fuss</li>
            <li> Growing up with my mother being a beautician, you would think I knew how to do hair. Unfortunately, I was not interested in the process at all. Now just in time for the holidays, I can rock my beautiful hairstyle and I can tell my mother I did it myself and not lie!!! It&#x27;s easy to use, I can sit it down anywhere without burning something, I can watch tv and do my hair. I would recommend the Miraqueen Curling Iron to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so I worry a lot about hair being broken by poorly made curling irons. I purchased this one and totally loved it. No breakage of my hair. No damage.  No burning of my skin. As far as I am concerned this is one of the best beauty and health care products that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This gives my life!  My arm no longer is hurting from manually curling it.  I just put it on and the miraqueen sucks it up, curls it, and viola!!!!  I love love LOVE this product.  I now have tighter longer lasting curls.  My hair has more body, and I get compliments everywhere I go! It is one of the best investments I could have ever made.  Please try this out ladies.  You just have to.  It&#x27;s very cool, and affordable.  Trust me, this is no ordinary curling iron off the walmart shelf.  This is the *ish!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is fool proof, I love it! I have tried curling wands but I&#x27;m pretty bad at curling my hair with those, I just couldn&#x27;t get the technique right, so I stuck with just flat ironing it for years. My hair always looked so boring. When I saw this flat iron, I decided to give it a try, and I love the curls it gives me. It&#x27;s so easy to use, and curls come out looking even. It&#x27;s ceramic so the damage to your hair is minimal if any at all. The auto off feature is a huge plus for me because I always forget to turn my appliances off for some reason. I recommend this curling tool over standard curling wands, much easier.</li>
            <li> I have been using Miraqueen curling iron for quiet sometime and knowing its efficiency in achieving the curls and curves that I desire. This curling iron out performs other brands because it is not only cost-effective but also ensures high quality.  It is manufactured using ceramic technology that is essential in protecting my hair from damage due to frequent using.  I enjoy using it because the heat is evenly distributed, thus produces longer lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;Another advantage of using this curling iron is that the curling and heating actions are within the device. That is why I never worry burning my hands while handling the curling iron because it leaves the outside area cool. Likewise, the three timer setting makes it easier to obtain the curls that I want like medium, loose or tight.&lt;br /&gt;I can highly recommend this product to those who are looking for the best professional curling iron.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is the BEST investment I have ever made in my haircare products. I like spending a little more on a purchase knowing that I&#x27;m going to have this product for the long-term, and it&#x27;s going to last, and get the results I want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this iron come with a one year warranty, but it&#x27;s sturdy and well designed, unlike something you would just pick up at your local store. This is a product I would expect to see at a professional and chic salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD Display shows you the temperature, timer, and direction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swivel cord gives it a nice easy and free rotating base so you don&#x27;t have to hassle with a cord getting twisted or interrupting what you&#x27;re doing. This is personally my favorite feature, and a very thoughtful one at that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buttons on the iron are also placed very intuitively so you can easily adjust things as you are holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For safety, I like that it has an auto shut off feature too - less worry and concern in those events that you forget to unplug your iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The features are jam packed, and I could go over all of them, but read for yourself! This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls are also longer lasting than when I&#x27;ve used other irons - It is an amazing product. Plain and simple!! You will not regret your purchase, and I&#x27;ve even recommended this to a veteran hairdresser of mine who plans on trying it out!</li>
            <li> I purchased the curling iron about 4 weeks ago and have had nothing but positive results with it thus far, I enjoy writing reviews about all products I loved after purchasing. I&#x27;m a female in the Navy so I don&#x27;t have as much time as I would hope to use this but on the weekends when I go out with my husband or girlfriends I always curl my hair and get fresh. This specific curling iron really does the trick and never leaves my hair dry or burnt ever. I had a different brand last year and whenever I used it my hair seemed to fall flat after a few hours, this Miraqueen always seems to keep my hair curled and perky. I really love the way it works and the handle, it&#x27;s very comfortable and extremely easy to maneuver, some brands are just heavy and ineffective. I suggest any girls that need a high quality curling iron purchase this because somehow it always manages to get the job done. :) God bless everyone!</li>
            <li> Very cool product!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my wife and she totally loves it. It works better than any other hair curler because it doesn&#x27;t effect her hair in any way. The material it&#x27;s made with makes it feel like a $500 hair curler. It looks and works like a professional curling wand.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Shirley Temple Curls. This Curling iron is amazing. It allows me to achieve the Shirley Temple Curls I want. It heats up quickly and has multiple heat settings to choose from. It curls my hair pretty fast for the length that I have. It has cut my time in half. The curling iron is light weight, which helps with your arm getting tired while using it. The curling iron hit all of my expectations. I love that it is ceramic, which makes it less damaging for my hair than metal curling irons. I always look for ceramic products. It is also very easy to glide your hair through the clasp, while some other curling irons will snag your hair while pulling it through. It came with a protective case, so I can put my curling iron away right after I use instead it of waiting for it to cool down. This curling iron has many great features and I really enjoying it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely straight hair and it is almost impossible to keep in a curl with heat curling. This curling iron is one of the few I have used where the curl actually stays in for more than a couple hours. It is super easy to use and I love that I don&#x27;t end up burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> Avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feedback from my wife for who I ordered this item: I have fine hair, which I&#x27;d have thought would be easy to curl. Until I bought this piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0. Even max temperature (450F) and max time heating didn&#x27;t give me anything more than a limp wave. Even tried curling products. No use.&lt;br /&gt;1. Despite how fine and not big my hair is, the rate at which this goes, it would take me more than an HOUR to go around the full head - leaving me with shocking looking wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. The literature that came with the curler was useless - no diagrams telling you where to put your hair, how much, etc. Trial and error - it&#x27;s only a hot curling iron NEXT to your face, what could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;3. Very difficult to use - my hair got stuck and at one point I thought I&#x27;m going to have to cut it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trashing mine because I waited too long to try it after it arrived.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this device!! I was having an extremely bad hair day on the day of an event my friend and I were supposed to go to. She had this curling iron and made my hair look amazing. I went out and ordered me one the next week. There are multiple settings which can give you 3-4 different curl patterns to achieve. This thing gives your hair a desired look; depending on the level of the setting, you can have beautiful loose curls or really tight curls that LAST. It works on all hair types and makes your hair look incredibly smooth, shiny, and healthy. To be such a high tech iron, it is extremely affordable compared to other models, and is very easy and safe to use. With the way it is constructed and the different levels to ensure no damage is done to your hair. If you can get one, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I absolutely LOVE this curling iron! It’s the only curling iron that has ever gotten my hair truly curly. It has definitely met and exceeded all of my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly long straight hair, but I like to wear it curly.  I&#x27;ve purchased other irons before, but the effects would fall out within hours.  From day 1 I could see that I&#x27;d made the right choice buying this.  This curling iron isn&#x27;t your typical curling iron. You can set the temperature to whatever you&#x27;d like, so if you have more fragile hair, you can set the iron to a lower temperature.  Stronger and more resistant, set it higher. Also, you&#x27;ll notice this iron has a little chamber.  That chamber allows your hair to enter and will then curl it on its own! It does all the work for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this has been the best curler I&#x27;ve ever had and would recommend the Miraqueen Curling Iron to anyone else who is looking for a high-quality, easy to use, and affordable hair curling solution.</li>
            <li> Made cheaply, mine didn&#x27;t even work. 😠 the screen froze up and the unit never even sucked the hair up. Very disappointed. Definitely returning this item pronto.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve bought. The perks to this compared to other irons is it heats to 450 degree F, has the highest heat to give long-lasting curls and waves, there&#x27;s ceramic technology, it protects hair from damage, has 3 heat levels and 4 timer settings, it automatically turns off, and has a LED screen that displays a timer, temperature, and curl direction. Plus, there&#x27;s a one year warranty on it and it tells you when it&#x27;s ready to be used. Since I have long hair, it takes some time to curl, but compared to others, I&#x27;m done with my hair in less than 15 minutes. You don&#x27;t even wrap your hair around the wand; the device allows your hair to enter a chamber and it curls on its own, which is another benefit. Another added benefit of it is the curls don&#x27;t go flat, they stay all day! I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> High quality product! I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of these for my daughters. You can really feel the quality when you use it. It truly is a professional tool of the trade for anyone with hair! Heats up quickly so you don&#x27;t have to wait around. The swivel cord makes it easier to handle and keeps cord from getting tangled. The LCD screen makes it clear what I am using. I really love my Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, Curling Wand, Hair Curler with Ceramic Curling Chamber.</li>
            <li> Love this! It is hard to use on yourself but great for doing other people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this very highly rated flatiron at such a great price. I decided to go ahead and buy one, encouraged by the great reviews but still reserving judgement. Within straightening the first bit of my hair, I fell in love with it. It works so smoothly and straightens it so easily and without snagging my hair. I am able to straighten my hair faster than ever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is PINK! I LOVE PINK! . And how easy it is to use. to use. It arrived on time and beautifully packaged - I have been using this to get curls and it works exceedingly well. Heats up in a minute or two so fast ! Heats up in no time at all (seriously: I plug it in when I begin to brush my teeth and by the time I&#x27;m done with that, I am ready to use it to do my hair!)  - this helps me get the look I want and keep it for days at a time since the curls I create with this really last. I love that the design ensures you don&#x27;t get dents in your hair, whether you are going for a sleek look, flip or bouncy curls. Thanks SO SO SO MUCH for the great service and great product! I already recommended it to a friend who loved my new hairstyle and wanted to see what I used to achieve it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this curling iron! I thought the shape was odd at first, but once I read the reviews and looked up the &#x27;how-to&#x27; instructions for it, I figured I had to give it a try. I found it to be so simple and easy, that someone like me, who is a beginner and has never bothered with curling irons (because of my thick, straight hair) could work it. I love the three different timer settings (that allowing you to adjust your curl from looser and more wavy to tighter, more precise curls), it makes it a snap to to do, so I can focus on something else, like getting my makeup around or checking my phone with my other hand. It beeps and you&#x27;re ready! I&#x27;ve always had trouble trying to figure out the techniques of how to use curling irons --- do I set my hair in this way and clamp or just wrap it around the barrel? How much hair do I curl at once? Which direction? Using this was easy and it took the stress out, especially once I watched the videos and tried it a few different ways. With a little bit of setting spray, my curls lasted all day without unwinding or getting frizzy. Another thing --- the design has rubberize components to prevent you from getting burned, something that has happened with the other curling irons I&#x27;ve tried and even my flat irons (nothing like a good first to second degree burn to start your morning!), so it&#x27;s safe to use, even when you&#x27;re dead tired or in a hurry and nor 100% paying attention to how you&#x27;re holding it or how close you have it to your scalp or hands. Last but not least, can&#x27;t beat the price. I paid $80+ for the other curling iron... which I ended up selling on eBay, because I just couldn&#x27;t get it to work and I couldn&#x27;t return it. You&#x27;re getting excellent quality for a great price. My honest opinion? Get it, you can&#x27;t go wrong and you&#x27;ll love the results!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have this... heard good things about this</li>
            <li> I just received this today delivered to my work. I was so excited that I tried it immediately.  Amazing curls!  My coworkers were in my cubicle watching as I tried it out. They were in awe!!!! At least I know it worked!  Can&#x27;t wait to get home to use it again. :-)</li>
            <li> Great product! Better than I expected !</li>
            <li> I had a drawer filled with curling irons until I bought this product. The MiraQueen Curling Iron allowed me to toss all of the others. I have long, thick hair and this one makes the maintenance so much easier and quicker. First of all, the design is awesome. You can tell that a team of professionals really did their homework to make this product perform so many functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You simply place strands of your hair in the chamber of the iron and SWOOSH—it sucks your hair into a curling motion automatically. That excites me every time I use it! It will beep at three different intervals to signal the length of time and tightness of the curl. Release the handle and it’s done! With all of the irons that I have owned in the past, I never had one with a digital display. So that is a plus for me with MiraQueen. Using the display and applicable buttons, you can monitor the temperature of the iron, rotate the direction of the curling, and determine curl time (8, 10, 12 seconds). With my hectic schedule, I take comfort in the automatic shut-off feature. And how the heat stays on the inside of the iron and not on the outside where my busy fingers are. The price is competitive with other high end ceramic curling irons and wands. If you have an Amazon Prime account, the savings is even better. A top-notch product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. My wife bought it a few weeks ago and really love using it.&lt;br /&gt;She loves the curls and its functioning capabilities,which has help her to spend far less time curling and styling.&lt;br /&gt;We are now able to be out of the house much faster. No more bad hair days for her. A truly great product.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Curling Iron is so refreshing for several reasons!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the TIMER FUNCTION works perfectly!  When the alarm sounds based on how you set it, and my hair is always done perfectly and never burns or cinges my hair (unlike other products I have had in the past)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also had a problem in the past with irons that heated some parts of my hair too much and others not enough.  This would make it take longer to do my hair than it should have.  With the Miraqueen, the heat distribution is pretty even so I have noticed that it takes a lot less time to get ready every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the way the Miraqueen works.  The designers obviously factored in EASE OF USE when designing this and it has paid off!  The cord never gets tangled (which makes me never get tangled with it!) and the way it curls the hair makes it such that I don&#x27;t have to wrap my hair around the iron (helpful because I burn myself wayyy too much)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, the Miraqueen works better, quicker and more efficiently than any other curling iron I have ever had.  And the price is so comparable that I will never use another kind of curling iron again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron for my wife who had really long thick hair and let me tell you, she was not disappointed. The LED display is clear and concise with built in timer, temperature and heat notice when the iron reached 370º. The high 450º temperature that the Miraqueen curling iron achieves allows her hair to stay perfect the entire day and night. This iron works amazing on wet and dry hair with no worry of over drying or burning your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One main feature my wife always battled with on previous curling irons was the pulling  and tugging of her hair. Well not no more with this iron, it features a &amp;#34;curl chamber&amp;#34; , which allows the hair to glide and heat more evenly, rather than pull and tug at her hair. Having the ability to change the direction of the curl is just another positive to add to this great product. You have numerous settings to choose from attributing to the direction you&#x27;re trying to go for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The automatic shutoff is a lifesaver, literally. My wife would forget to turn off her curling iron almost every time she used it. Having the automatic shutoff is a great feature to have. Don&#x27;t wait on this, if you&#x27;re looking for a great gift for you significant other give this a shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> What an awesome hair curler!!!!  My hair is super flat and I never can do anything with it.  I&#x27;ve tried over brands before, but the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is the only one that really has worked for me.  It&#x27;s really easy to use, and my hair comes out perfectly the first time. When every I go out, I always use it to make my hair looks like I jut got out of the salon.  I really can recommend a product more!  Pros:  Easy to use,  safe, high quality, great price, lots of options.  Cons: Can&#x27;t think of any.</li>
            <li> I have VERY straight hair and am always looking for an iron that actually holds the curl at least through the time I finish curling it.  A friend of mine recommended the Miraqueen and I had a special event coming up, so I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I was a little confused how it worked at first but I watched some Youtube videos to figure it and it was worth it.  This curling iron and a little hairspray made my hair look GORGEOUS!  I am not sure what it does exactly that is different than a normal curling iron on my super straight hair but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it regularly since I got it and if you have super straight hair like me, make sure you use a bit if hairspray right after you do each curl.  I have always done this but find with the Miraqueen it really holds up and make my locks bouncy.</li>
            <li> I am posting this for my wife who bought this curling iron about a month ago. She loves it!! The LCD monitor is wonderful for her to be able to see when it ready to use rather than the guess and check method she had to use with her previous curling iron. In terms of the results, she could not be happier. The ease at which she is able to create gorgeous curls is 2nd to none. We have already ordered 3 more to give to family members for Christmas. Would definitely recommend for purchase.</li>
            <li> I know another review had doubt because there was no &amp;#34;verified purchases&amp;#34; for this product....well I bought this!  It is fantastic.  I have thick, normal hair.  It is slightly wavy.  I had NO issues with this at all. It made great looking curls that last all day!  You have to wash them out to get them out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to experiment with it to make it work for you.  I found that with some of my hair I had to keep it in a second or two longer and if I didn&#x27;t like the curl, I put it back in again!  There is a learning curve to it, however I found that by the time I was done with my head (it took me about 20 minutes the first time I used it), I really had a method down that worked for me.  I bet after a tiny bit more practice, I could do my whole head in less than 15 minutes, maybe 10...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT NOT NOT pull your hair out.  The few times I put in too much hair, it let me know and I opened using the lever and boom, no hair pulling, and it didn&#x27;t get stuck! The only time my hair got stuck was my own gosh darn fault....I was holding the machine shut and not opening to release it...duh!  Doing the back of your head is tough but that&#x27;s the case with curling irons too and well, let&#x27;s face it, if we all had someone doing our hair, we wouldn&#x27;t look for products like this to make our lives easier....and this does.  It really does work well!!!  And you&#x27;ll get a good arm workout holding it....I did get &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; by the end and leaned it against my head because it doesn&#x27;t get too hot on the outside to burn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is completely worth the money.  If you are sitting there debating, stop debating and just buy it.  You&#x27;ll be happy.  I am a verified purchase, bought it off of Amazon, have it in my house, and will use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Perfect for me</li>
            <li> Seriously I dont know much about curling irons but my wife swears by this thing! I got it for her on our anniversary (along with other things lol) and she loved it so much. I asked her what was the difference from any other curling iron and she started describing all these features it has and the price for all it does lol. If she&#x27;s happy, IM HAPPY!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for her birthday and she couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. She loves the 3 heat levels and the 4 timer settings. She has been looking for a great curling iron for years and since I found this for her she says she will never buy another brand. The Miraqueen Professional curling iron is a great and amazing gift for any women in your life. This will earn you major brownie points fellas!</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is a sleek, efficient curling iron that fits easily in the hand and has all the features you need to do a beautiful job of curling any type of hair. It allows you to choose different types of curls, but its efficient heating system means the curls will last a long time. Its features include three different heat levels and four timer settings, so you can get exactly the curls you want. There is also a shutoff feature which prevents damage to your hair if you forget how long you’ve had the curling iron on. The handy LCD screen displays the timer setting, temperature, and curl direction.&lt;br /&gt;Curling irons use intense heat, but the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron keeps you safe from skin or hair burns with its foam and rubber protectors. The iron comes equipped with a curling chamber that glides along your hair to prevent unwanted damage and breakage. There’s also a swivel cord so you can move about freely while you’re curling your hair. All in all, the women in my house agree that the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron is the solution for perfect curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> I promise this is the best curling iron on the market.  It&#x27;s not just a curling iron, but a miracle worker.  My daughter has thick curly hair and we have spent so much money on other curling irons in the past, but nothing compares to the miraqueen curling iron.  It protects instead of damage.  Can you say &#x27;no split ends&#x27;!  The curling iron is not heavy but it is heavy duty.  Love the different settings and what a relief to know it has an auto shut off because teenagers can be very absent minded at times.  When my daughter&#x27;s friends come over and they use her curling iron they want to take it home.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on other curling irons, you have found the best.</li>
            <li> I am an African American with naturally kinky hair. I had recently straightened my hair and wanted to add curls. I ordered this iron and received it within a week. It is one of the best curlers I have owned. I love that you only need one hand to operate the iron. I also like the fact that you can set a timer for it to go off, because then the iron doesn&#x27;t over heat. I have now lent the curler to my friend because she loved my results. I would recommend this iron to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing curling wand! Curling my coarse hair is usually really hard, but this one does the trick!</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I was pretty fascinated with all of the features. I have to say that looking at a product is far different then actually using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the LCD monitor. For me it is as the same as when I upgraded to my digital stove. You get the precise information on the heat as well as time you need to curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The protection integrated with this curler was even better than I anticipated. I honestly did not see how important the safety features were until I was using it. I never got burned and my hair was never burned which has happened in the past with other curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tourmaline technology really made a difference. I did not think it would, but I compared my older curling iron with this one and my hair was fizzled and felt dry whereas the Mira Queen felt lively and fresh. I think you would have to experience to compare the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The automatic curling, the beep notification to let you know that the curler is ready as well as the three timer settings were also great features. I cannot write about them all, but the ones I did mention were the most important to me. I really recommend to have you try it out. I know you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron once you figure how to use it. I have really thick hair, but it still looked great just messing around. Hoping to take my time and really see what this thing can do!</li>
            <li> It did not heat up enough to curl hair.</li>
            <li> this was a gift and I was told it worked well and was easy to use</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my Granddaughter for Christmas.  She is completely satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> Nothing curls my hair. NOTHING. Well, most things curl it, it just falls out almost immediately. Both my parents had curly hair, and I was gypped. Hasn&#x27;t mattered whether it was thick, natural and to my waist or its now incarnation of overly bleached pink thin fray, its always handled curls the same way. Many a professional have struggled to get my hair to hold a curl for more than half an hour, and every one has failed. I&#x27;m not much of a girly-girl, so I&#x27;ve never been able to justify the time, attention and frustration to use most curling irons with such terrible results, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try along with the best rated hair spray and curl prep gel I could find. Even without any hairspray or curl prep gel, and on greasy filthy hair, it still held a curl for 6+ hours. I was amazed. When we tried it on freshly clean hair, it was like a magic trick. Poof, curly until bed, no hair spray needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that if this didn&#x27;t function so well once you got used to its quirks, that I&#x27;d probably be giving it three stars for the lack of instructions alone. What you see on this page in their sales ad is just a photo copy of the only paperwork they give you with this sucker, and the only information to be had on their website - a wimpy one sided tri-fold out pamphlet that nowhere actually tells you HOW to use it, simply what the features are, and a few pointers that somehow also do not actually inform you of its quirks. This thing has so little information that it took us a while to figure out that all you had to do was hold the thing wide ways to your head with just the right sized strands of hair laying flat across and it would do the rest. There&#x27;s nothing anywhere to identify what all the beeps mean, or how to fix it once it messes up. As a matter of fact, I can easily see how you&#x27;d end up having to cut your hair out of this thing if you mess it up, but it&#x27;s easy to get the hang of pretty quickly and start to predict when its going to complain and fix it fast enough to save your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do so love the efficiency of this thing though, and my roommate keeps turning us into curly haired disney princesses, so I can&#x27;t complain really. She&#x27;s had so much fun playing with it that I haven&#x27;t actually had to curl my own hair with it most of the time.it fast enough to save your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do so love the efficiency of this thing though, and my roommate keeps turning us into curly haired disney princesses, so I can&#x27;t complain really. She&#x27;s had so much fun playing with it that I haven&#x27;t actually had to curl my own hair with it most of the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter who absolutely loves it.  Pretty easy to use one you get the hand movement down.  Great perfect curls.</li>
            <li> This was everything I was hoping to find. I have been trying for years to get those perfect curls and something to help define my beachy waves. My hair is pretty long, its middle of my back length and it&#x27;s not thin but I wouldn&#x27;t say thick either. When this arrived my hair had air dried from the night before so my hair had its natural frizzy wavy to it, however I didn&#x27;t care it looked a frizzy mess I was way too excited to wait I had to try ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;This curling wand is SUPER EASY to easy. I had no issues, my hair did get tangled twice but I was able to get out no problem no panic attack is my hair gonna burn off lol. I&#x27;m still playing with the time and temperature settings but you will get a few different curl looks with this curling wand. The curls are some and hold. My curls held for 2 days with no product, I used nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 30 minutes to get all my curls done, I&#x27;m sure with a few more uses the time will get a little shorter. You get a comfy hold and good positioning but it is kinda bulky so the size can make awkward at times. Being so bulky and close to the scalp this can be a little scary, especially as it sucks your hair in, I have found if you hold the end, almost giving a little pull as the hair is being pulled in that it does seem to help guide the hair in better and helps cut back on the hair getting tangled in the chamber.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!so easy to use,makes perfect curls!no more burned fingers and hours in the bathroom trying to curl your hair-20 min and you are gorgeous!!!!Thank you Miraqueen! I feel like a Queen now myself!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing this product since it&#x27;s clear that more than half of the reviews are manufactured. However, having read a few reputable reviews, I made the leap and bought this at a great price. Although I don&#x27;t use it as often as I&#x27;d like, I LOVE it! The only change I would make is to be able to decrease the temperature further than is allowed. But honestly, this thing is fool-proof.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend.  I didn&#x27;t know she got her hair cut.  She was unable to use this product.  I think this would work very well with long hair?</li>
            <li> Best curler out there</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--  Works very well on my relatively dry and fine hair and holds all day ( I use a very small amount of hair spray)&lt;br /&gt;--  Can count on some nice curl carryover to the next day&lt;br /&gt;--  This brand/model beats many others because you can make curls spiral left or right to hug your face or sweep back more&lt;br /&gt;--  Easy to use, especially compared to the mainstream curling iron we have had available for years&lt;br /&gt;--  Even with a moderate hearing loss (that has come from my being I am in my late 60s), the timer tone for releasing the curl is easy to hear&lt;br /&gt;--  Really seems to be kinder to my hair than the mainstream style curling iron&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--  None</li>
            <li> got it for my 11 year old daughter- she loves it!! makes beautiful curls in seconds. takes a bit of practice to get it right but works great.</li>
            <li> Nightmare! no joke!  Want something to &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; your hair?  This is it. Sent back.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really create a great curl. For the money it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It did curl my straight hair pretty well. I am a person who likes to get things done quick and this is just the right thing. Very easy to use. However, I am not one to use these things on my hair everyday. I curl my hair only on occassions. So, I cannot comment on what it is going to do to your hair if used frequently.</li>
