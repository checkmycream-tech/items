            <li>This item is really so good, and nice smell i love it, smells so good and cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got many comments that i smell nice from friends and gurlz.</li>
            <li>This twin pack was a very good value, and the Axe  product is  a high end quality product.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this smells.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The online prices are usually great, and the product is good enough that having extras (if you buy a pack of 6 or 8) is no problem.</li>
            <li>One of those items that you know you will be buying more anyway.</li>
            <li>If you love chocolate, you&#x27;ll love this</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I love, love, love the smell of this on my husband.  </li>
            <li>love the product and so do others who compliment me on the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I also like the spray top of this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this was not my favorite scent of Axe spray.</li>
            <li>I normally love the smell of these sprays, and often buy it for my boys and my husband for after he showers.</li>
            <li>This scent to me was just ok.</li>
            <li>My oldest thought it was just ok</li>
            <li>I like the gel better but</li>
            <li>The twist top keeps it from accidentally spraying when in a bag.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get the matching sticks.</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t sure then please ask those around you if you stink.  </li>
            <li>Girls also love the smell of it, trust.</li>
            <li>Anarchy is ok too</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>just asked my sweetheart how many stars he would give this body spray out of five, and he said &amp;#34;definitely five.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>My husband uses this scent all the time and we both love it.</li>
            <li>Really love this spray...</li>
            <li>My husband love&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Seems like most everyone seems to like it too.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good deal on the price as well.</li>
            <li>Nice caramel chocolate sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>This is one  of the Better Body Sprays available.</li>
            <li>love the smell and got recommendations from females to keep wearing it and they enjoy it ..</li>
            <li>Actually I made him get it because it smells so good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to usr</li>
            <li>The spray is very potent for the first five minutes, so make sure to stay away from any fellow guys or family members who are looking to make fun of you.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all the men who want to smell nice for their significant others!</li>
            <li>I kid you not, it must be because this has a distinct chocolatey smell which appeals to women, but every time I apply this stuff I get a incredible amount of female attention!</li>
            <li>Just remember one very important note: don&#x27;t use too much of it!</li>
            <li>and my youngest doesn&#x27;t care what it smells like, as long as he has something that sprays, so he was happy.</li>
            <li>Axe generally makes good (and probably cancer causing) products.  </li>
            <li>I was leery at first about buying a fragrance that others have described as smelling like chocolate, because I couldn&#x27;t imagine that being sexy on a man.  </li>
            <li>I still use it on days when I&#x27;m not going anywhere special.</li>
            <li>All good fast ship recommend highly</li>
            <li>and I am an axe fan, but it didn&#x27;t smell good enough for the 5th star to me.</li>
            <li>Smells good on my sweaty teen grandson.</li>
            <li>But it could have been made a Touch More Intense.</li>
            <li>Can Not Being Full, when you Handle it.</li>
            <li>Fairly cheap and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really strong when it first goes on, and it permeates the area with it&#x27;s scent (drawback of aerosols), but the girlfriend loves it.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li>I was not overly impressed with it and did not prefer it enough to go back and get it again myself.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was not damaged in the process.</li>
            <li>It has kind of got a deep spicy, light sweetness to it</li>
            <li>The scent lasts on the skin and clothing yet is mild.</li>
            <li>The scent is decent but i can imagine it wouldn&#x27;t appeal to many people.</li>
            <li>Dark Temptation is my new favorite Axe Body Spray!!!</li>
            <li>So get two or three packs of it at once, Stock up with the hot summer coming!</li>
            <li>The smell is not too great, compared too few others.</li>
            <li>I liked that it came in a double pack, so I could use them to stock up, or divide them between my two boys.</li>
            <li>this was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>It is a different smell, kind of chocolatey.</li>
            <li>As a 17-year old, this stuff works great for pretty much an social occasion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really popular deodorant, shampoo among teen boys right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of most &amp;#34;axe&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>More than likely you smell and need a spray like this to combat the reek you are spreading.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll want to have more on hand if you run out and don&#x27;t want to wait several days to get another!</li>
            <li>This is to me a light spicy, cinnamon masculine scent.</li>
            <li>The picture on the can show a brown color swirly image that evokes a hot chocolate drink and</li>
            <li>smell is terrific and the ladies will love it on you....</li>
            <li>Try it first in a store before you order this one.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better body sprays that I have found in quite a long time.</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of AXE, but I simply love the fragrance of DARK TEMPTATION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temptation indeed ! :)</li>
            <li>The product arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>He was very fond of this fragrant in comparison to others from Axe.</li>
            <li>I really recommend</li>
            <li>He goes through so much body spray, it beats having to buy cologne at his age.</li>
            <li>Decent value compared to stores.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use this at school when i change from my sweaty clothes to my school clothes.</li>
            <li>Low price smells good last long</li>
            <li>They have tried other Axe products and so far this is their favorite and mine too for them.</li>
            <li>Fit as expected.</li>
            <li>old doesn&#x27;t use anything but AXE products because he absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>It smells great, last for a long time and it arrived 5 days earlier then expected.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>This is a very helpful purchase, especially when i workout or do PT.</li>
            <li>I mentioned to my son that he should stop using AXE because he has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I did some research on the web and found out from the Silent Spring organization that AXE is made by Unilever and is a real toxic soup of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Dark Temptation is an alluring scent - sweet and spicy at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I also spray a little on before going out, to keep that Gucci fresh</li>
            <li>All was complete, however compared to the retail pricing at various store the product was not at a discount.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time trying the Dark Temptation</li>
            <li>Usually after i take off my t-shirt, I give a short spray on my chest and back, then put on my fresh shirt.</li>

            <li> It arrived quickly and was not damaged in the process.</li>
            <li> It has kind of got a deep spicy, light sweetness to it</li>
            <li> The scent lasts on the skin and clothing yet is mild.</li>
            <li> The scent is decent but i can imagine it wouldn&#x27;t appeal to many people.</li>
            <li> Dark Temptation is my new favorite Axe Body Spray!!!</li>
            <li> So get two or three packs of it at once, Stock up with the hot summer coming!</li>
            <li> The smell is not too great, compared too few others.</li>
            <li> I liked that it came in a double pack, so I could use them to stock up, or divide them between my two boys.</li>
            <li> this was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> It is a different smell, kind of chocolatey.</li>
            <li> As a 17-year old, this stuff works great for pretty much an social occasion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really popular deodorant, shampoo among teen boys right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of most &amp;#34;axe&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> More than likely you smell and need a spray like this to combat the reek you are spreading.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll want to have more on hand if you run out and don&#x27;t want to wait several days to get another!</li>
            <li> This is to me a light spicy, cinnamon masculine scent.</li>
            <li> The picture on the can show a brown color swirly image that evokes a hot chocolate drink and</li>
            <li> smell is terrific and the ladies will love it on you....</li>
            <li> Try it first in a store before you order this one.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better body sprays that I have found in quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of AXE, but I simply love the fragrance of DARK TEMPTATION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temptation indeed ! :)</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> He was very fond of this fragrant in comparison to others from Axe.</li>
            <li> I really recommend</li>
            <li> He goes through so much body spray, it beats having to buy cologne at his age.</li>
            <li> Decent value compared to stores.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use this at school when i change from my sweaty clothes to my school clothes.</li>
            <li> Low price smells good last long</li>
            <li> They have tried other Axe products and so far this is their favorite and mine too for them.</li>
            <li> Fit as expected.</li>
            <li> old doesn&#x27;t use anything but AXE products because he absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> It smells great, last for a long time and it arrived 5 days earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> This is a very helpful purchase, especially when i workout or do PT.</li>
            <li> I mentioned to my son that he should stop using AXE because he has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I did some research on the web and found out from the Silent Spring organization that AXE is made by Unilever and is a real toxic soup of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Dark Temptation is an alluring scent - sweet and spicy at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I also spray a little on before going out, to keep that Gucci fresh</li>
            <li> All was complete, however compared to the retail pricing at various store the product was not at a discount.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time trying the Dark Temptation</li>
            <li> Usually after i take off my t-shirt, I give a short spray on my chest and back, then put on my fresh shirt.</li>
            <li> The different scents are clearly personal preference and some might be slightly more casual, as in jeans all the way to power lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only bought one set of this to test it out, but literally every single time I wore it, I got compliments from girls who were hugging me, dancing with me or just within a foot or so of me.</li>
            <li> My son got a sudden, strange, blotchy but not itchy rash all over his body the other night.</li>
            <li> Just remember that a little goes a long long way with any Axe body spray.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> so it all adds up to be slightly expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Hopefully amazon doesnt stop selling this one like they did the other scents.</li>
            <li> Every time I put it on, my wife tries to attack me, and I ain&#x27;t complaining!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way !</li>
            <li> Other guys may like it if you&#x27;re not into the stronger scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People seem to refer to this scent as &#x27;chocolate&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way, so just wait five or ten minutes before going out into the \\&quot;wild\\&quot; if you get</li>
            <li> Use Dark Temptation by Axe</li>
            <li> I also use the dark temptation body wash &amp; the shampoo &amp; deodorant.</li>
            <li> I bought Axe Dark Temptation body spray as a &amp;#34;just</li>
            <li> the name is dark temptation.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is difficult to tell or feel when the can is empty or almost empty and the only way to know is when nothing else comes out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The bulk pricing is unbeatable and the scent is like high quality expensive men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I wish they would be concern about the price to make little lower.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day tough.</li>
            <li> A few months ago a random woman walked up to me while I was standing in a cafeteria line, sniffed up the air and asked politely if that was my natural smell.</li>
            <li> I would use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I could see where someone could run through one can in a few days or a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He immediately got the red, blotchy rash even worse this time.  </li>
            <li> It is a waste of money</li>
            <li> However, the chocolatey aroma is very subtle; it won&#x27;t smack you upside the head or make you suddenly crave a candy</li>
            <li> I feel a little late because a lot of the guy in the gym had been useing it.</li>
            <li> after I purchased the axe body spray and now hardly use the axe...</li>
            <li> it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> She says it has &amp;#34;rich chocolate undertones&amp;#34; that drive her crazy.  </li>
            <li> It can cause violent coughing skin rashes and worse.  </li>
            <li> I have tried evert scent I have found, on Amazon &amp; at brick and mortar - have not been disappointed by any of them.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> smells great, not too strog</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells.  Not overpowering, lasts all day.  Good price when using sub &amp; save.  Hopefully amazon doesnt stop selling this one like they did the other scents.</li>
            <li> I have tried evert scent I have found, on Amazon &amp; at brick and mortar - have not been disappointed by any of them. I might like some more then others, but they are all very, very good to excellent. The different scents are clearly personal preference and some might be slightly more casual, as in jeans all the way to power lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The online prices are usually great, and the product is good enough that having extras (if you buy a pack of 6 or 8) is no problem. One of those items that you know you will be buying more anyway.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and the price was very good compared to retail stores. I only use Axe sprays since they discontinued the TAG sprays. They keep you smelling good.</li>
            <li> Great seller and great item.</li>
            <li> The price was great as well as the smell. I have one in my gym bage and one in my office. I feel a little late because a lot of the guy in the gym had been useing it.</li>
            <li> If you love chocolate, you&#x27;ll love this, I have gone through two cans of this (1oz and 4oz) and have 3 5oz cans remaining. It smells great and attracts the ladies lol.</li>
            <li> this is soooo yummy it smells amazing and so freshing, im a female and i use it !!! BEST body spray everrrrrrrrr</li>
            <li> The product was delivered on time and it smells great.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it. Ipl  - I smell like chocolate!</li>
            <li> All good fast ship recommend highly</li>
            <li> My wife loves chocolate.  She eats the stuff up like an addict.  This stuff smells like chocolate.  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> but only four stars as I found this [[ASIN:B000W66146 B000W66146]] after I purchased the axe body spray and now hardly use the axe...</li>
            <li> When you only have one hand and you want too smell great. Use Dark Temptation by Axe It&#x27;s easy to usr</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of AXE, but I simply love the fragrance of DARK TEMPTATION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temptation indeed ! :)</li>
            <li> been using axe for some time, but temptation is not so great like the clix better. but the taste differs from person to person</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and our 2 boys to try out and they love it! It has a great smell and smells so good i want to wear it too. Its one of those scents that you wish you could eat. They have tried other Axe products and so far this is their favorite and mine too for them. We will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the smell of this on my husband.  Make a great gift for any man in your life.</li>
            <li> Service was great...love the product and so do others who compliment me on the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> The smell is not too great, compared too few others. The smell becomes monotonous and soon feel uninterested using it. .</li>
            <li> I had mixed feelings abut this body spray. I liked that it came in a double pack, so I could use them to stock up, or divide them between my two boys. I also like the spray top of this. It stands up to the harshness of teen boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this was not my favorite scent of Axe spray. I normally love the smell of these sprays, and often buy it for my boys and my husband for after he showers. This scent to me was just ok. I was not overly impressed with it and did not prefer it enough to go back and get it again myself. My oldest thought it was just ok and my youngest doesn&#x27;t care what it smells like, as long as he has something that sprays, so he was happy. I gave it 4 stars because it is a good deal and I am an axe fan, but it didn&#x27;t smell good enough for the 5th star to me.</li>
            <li> Smells good on my sweaty teen grandson.</li>
            <li> I like the gel better but this works as advertised...and smells good!</li>
            <li> This item is really so good, and nice smell i love it, smells so good and cheap too!like i went to Kmart to buy this one i found it like 14.99 it was so expensive. i just try to sell all i have</li>
            <li> This has a great scent; it&#x27;s kinda chocolaty. The twist top keeps it from accidentally spraying when in a bag. Pretty good deal on the price as well. No complaints so far. Be sure to get the matching sticks.</li>
            <li> goood Product! Love the smell</li>
            <li> I saved Money. Items are good.</li>
            <li> Decent value compared to stores.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of most &amp;#34;axe&amp;#34; scents but this one is nice.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells great my girl friend just loves when I put this on. I also use the dark temptation body wash &amp; the shampoo &amp; deodorant. I will be buying this again this was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a really good price for 2 Axe deoderants. Plus it smells really good. I would use this everyday.</li>
            <li> This is one  of the Better Body Sprays available. It has a Nice  Aroma But it could have been made a Touch More Intense. The Only Drawback Seems to be the Feeling of The Can Not Being Full, when you Handle it.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  All was complete, however compared to the retail pricing at various store the product was not at a discount.  The pricing was the same as if I purchased it at a Walgreen or CVS Pharmacy.</li>
            <li> wonderful product and ships successfully with no damages</li>
            <li> Axe generally makes good (and probably cancer causing) products.  This one is smelly in a good way.  I would recommend it for anyone that likes to smell good or needs to smell good.  If you aren&#x27;t sure then please ask those around you if you stink.  Their body language will say it all so don&#x27;t listen to what comes out of their mouth.  More than likely you smell and need a spray like this to combat the reek you are spreading.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because of someone I work with.  Every time he walks in wearing this, everyone comments on how he smells.  Well, it smells just as good on my husband.  When I told my coworker what a great deal I go on line, he was jealous.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying the Dark Temptation and it works great. I&#x27;ve used it regularly with no complaints.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing!  Every time I put it on, my wife tries to attack me, and I ain&#x27;t complaining!  She says it has &amp;#34;rich chocolate undertones&amp;#34; that drive her crazy.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works as expected. The scent is nice - however, any of the Axe product fragrances have been pleasant. Works well for our household; a deoderant/body spray with no Aluminum which is of importance to our family (your family views may vary)</li>
            <li> I workout daily.  Having accidently purchase deoderant vs. antiperspirant I was concerned about body oder and purchased this.  I&#x27;ve since corrected the mistake, but this stuff smells good!  It&#x27;s really strong when it first goes on, and it permeates the area with it&#x27;s scent (drawback of aerosols), but the girlfriend loves it.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and buying it.  It&#x27;s a staple of the gym bag now.</li>
            <li> Good product. Good price. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Niccee!!! This is a very helpful purchase, especially when i workout or do PT. Since deodorant only covers your armpits you still have a sweaty body that will turn stank. That&#x27;s where Axe body spray comes into play. Usually after i take off my t-shirt, I give a short spray on my chest and back, then put on my fresh shirt. I mainly use this at school when i change from my sweaty clothes to my school clothes. I also spray a little on before going out, to keep that Gucci fresh feel.&lt;br /&gt;  Girls also love the smell of it, trust. Just remember that a little goes a long long way with any Axe body spray. I&#x27;ve got many comments that i smell nice from friends and gurlz. This is definitely worth the money and i will buy it again from this seller. It arrived quickly and was not damaged in the process. Buy it now, its definitely worth the purchase!!!</li>
            <li> A few months ago a random woman walked up to me while I was standing in a cafeteria line, sniffed up the air and asked politely if that was my natural smell. Who knew that it is not beer that attracts women.</li>
            <li> Got for boyfriend he luvs it,and great price for two and free shipping can&amp;#34;t beat that</li>
            <li> I \\&quot;helped\\&quot; my husband pick this body spray out. Actually I made him get it because it smells so good! It has kind of got a deep spicy, light sweetness to it but by no means smells like a woman&#x27;s product. It&#x27;s the only Axe spray I&#x27;ll let him buy. Anarchy is ok too but this is my favorite. I highly recommend it to all the men who want to smell nice for their significant others!</li>
            <li> got his for my son, who loves the Axe body products. He was very fond of this fragrant in comparison to others from Axe.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better body sprays that I have found in quite a long time. It is a different smell, kind of chocolatey. My only complaint is that it is difficult to tell or feel when the can is empty or almost empty and the only way to know is when nothing else comes out.&lt;br /&gt;This order came two in a pack and I would recommend that you buy two sets, so you have four cans total at once. I could see where someone could run through one can in a few days or a week.&lt;br /&gt;I did use it on one fairly humid day and it did keep me somewhat dryer. It does its job and you&#x27;ll want to have more on hand if you run out and don&#x27;t want to wait several days to get another! So get two or three packs of it at once, Stock up with the hot summer coming!</li>
            <li> love the smell and got recommendations from females to keep wearing it and they enjoy it .. so they like it so i like it hahhaha</li>
            <li> I bought Axe Dark Temptation body spray as a &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift for my love and he wears it every day!  He likes body sprays that last all day but are not overpowering, and this one exceeds expectations.  Dark Temptation is an alluring scent - sweet and spicy at the same time.  I was leery at first about buying a fragrance that others have described as smelling like chocolate, because I couldn&#x27;t imagine that being sexy on a man.  However, the chocolatey aroma is very subtle; it won&#x27;t smack you upside the head or make you suddenly crave a candy bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just asked my sweetheart how many stars he would give this body spray out of five, and he said &amp;#34;definitely five.&amp;#34;  Enough said!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and it smells delicious. Dark Temptation is my new favorite Axe Body Spray!!!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this scent all the time and we both love it.</li>
            <li> Really love this spray...price was great and delivery time was excellent!</li>
            <li> My son got a sudden, strange, blotchy but not itchy rash all over his body the other night. I had just listened to a  discussion on NPR about the toxic chemicals used to make fragranced products. I mentioned to my son that he should stop using AXE because he has sensitive skin.  He kept using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the rash went away during the day.  That night, my son took a shower and then put on AXE.  He immediately got the red, blotchy rash even worse this time.  He realized it was the AXE deodorant he uses that was causing the rash and we tossed it all out.  I did some research on the web and found out from the Silent Spring organization that AXE is made by Unilever and is a real toxic soup of chemicals. It can cause violent coughing skin rashes and worse.  It&#x27;s suspected to be carcinogenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let your sons, husbands, friends know that they should toss this stuff if they use it, and to let their friends know about it, too.  It&#x27;s a really popular deodorant, shampoo among teen boys right now.</li>
            <li> Fit as expected. Excellent quality</li>
            <li> It smells great, last for a long time and it arrived 5 days earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> This is to me a light spicy, cinnamon masculine scent. The picture on the can show a brown color swirly image that evokes a hot chocolate drink and the name is dark temptation. The scent lasts on the skin and clothing yet is mild.</li>
            <li> Hubby smells good but he doesn&#x27;t use as deodorant.  Fairly cheap and worth the money.  I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Nice caramel chocolate sweet scent.  Protects well when used as a deodorant.  Doesn&#x27;t last all day tough. I do not think this is to be used as a deodorant but as a body spray.</li>
            <li> This is a steal.....two for the price of one literally......smell is terrific and the ladies will love it on you....</li>
            <li> My grandson loved it.  :-)</li>
            <li> Good seller.I really recommend</li>
            <li> This twin pack was a very good value, and the Axe  product is  a high end quality product.  A little goes a long way !</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.  The deodorant does not spray out as it should.  It is a waste of money</li>
            <li> Only bought one set of this to test it out, but literally every single time I wore it, I got compliments from girls who were hugging me, dancing with me or just within a foot or so of me. I kid you not, it must be because this has a distinct chocolatey smell which appeals to women, but every time I apply this stuff I get a incredible amount of female attention!</li>
            <li> My husband love&#x27;s it has one at work and in his truck.</li>
            <li> Low price smells good last long I used it for a week people say I smell good people say what are you wearing and I say AXE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of guy that likes the stronger scents, but this was not one of them. I still use it on days when I&#x27;m not going anywhere special. Other guys may like it if you&#x27;re not into the stronger scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People seem to refer to this scent as &#x27;chocolate&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY Axe spray that I like.  Seems like most everyone seems to like it too.  You do have to use quite a bit of it so it all adds up to be slightly expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Terrific smell.  Bound to attract... OOPS!  Don&#x27;t let my wife see this.</li>
            <li> The bulk pricing is unbeatable and the scent is like high quality expensive men&#x27;s cologne. Very nice My son loves it.</li>
            <li> one of the cans won&#x27;t spray</li>
            <li> As a 17-year old, this stuff works great for pretty much an social occasion. Just remember one very important note: don&#x27;t use too much of it! The spray is very potent for the first five minutes, so make sure to stay away from any fellow guys or family members who are looking to make fun of you. I learned this the hard way, so just wait five or ten minutes before going out into the \\&quot;wild\\&quot; if you get what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this stuff works great. Smells awesome, and the girls love it.</li>
            <li> The scent is decent but i can imagine it wouldn&#x27;t appeal to many people. Try it first in a store before you order this one.</li>
            <li> Well, my 13 yr. old doesn&#x27;t use anything but AXE products because he absolutely loves them. He goes through so much body spray, it beats having to buy cologne at his age. NICE!!!</li>
            <li> NO doubt! I&#x27;d like use this one. I could smell the next day also. I wish they would be concern about the price to make little lower.</li>
