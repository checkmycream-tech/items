            <li>You&#x27;ll get the best shave of your life.</li>
            <li>Paired with a firmer shaving soap (like Col Conk or Williams), it will put a perfect lather on your face every morning.</li>
            <li>I use this along with C.O. Bigelow shave cream, awesome combo.</li>
            <li>Best shaving brush I have used</li>

            <li>In My father&#x27;s day in the 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s Burma Shave made a great product</li>
            <li>Great for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is the best brush I own and the one I go to even over the $90 brush I got for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>, I am proud to display it in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a great brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced NO bristle loss with it.  </li>
            <li>Great brush, great price</li>
            <li>Great quality and a great price around 10 to 20 dollars.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>and I get a great lather.</li>
            <li>Burma Shave stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>great brush for the money.</li>
            <li>The brush is so nice!</li>
            <li>Have been using these for many years and thought they may not be the best made brush, for me there is nothing better!</li>
            <li>Nice brush works great</li>
            <li>This brush is a good deal for the price</li>
            <li>It cleans off just great and creates a nice foam.</li>
            <li>, Falls apart fairly soon.</li>
            <li>This is a boar brush, and a fairly inexpensive one at that.  </li>
            <li>this is a good brush to start as it is cheaper than the badger brushes and it give you a chance to start until you can make up your mind on what brush you would like to use.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Avoid and spend the money on a good boar or badger brush.</li>
            <li>and like I said it looks to be a good product</li>
            <li>Fair price.</li>
            <li>Makes good lather.</li>
            <li>I needed a good shave brush to apply it.</li>
            <li>First off, its not going to be the best brush</li>
            <li>GIVE GREAT LATHER AND IS EASY TO RINSE AND MAINTAIN.</li>
            <li>but as a newbie to wet shaving find this Burma Shave brush to be very good and an excellent value.</li>
            <li>Nothing amazing here, Works for what it costs</li>
            <li>stiffness can be nice.</li>
            <li>but it does get better, because the brush just needs a fairly involved break-in period before it truly blossoms.</li>
            <li>nice product to  use in shaving.</li>
            <li>Plus this brush just has a nice look to it</li>
            <li>Burma Shave is kind of a neeto, retro brand, and I&#x27;d like to see it survive.  </li>
            <li>Loving it with my Williams Shave Soap.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush for the price</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and find really sturdy.</li>
            <li>They do soften some with use, gang, and I find them very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>but all of them seemed pleased.</li>
            <li>Again Thank you:-)</li>
            <li>a brush and soap make I was well pleased with this product</li>
            <li>But I already give you credit for using a more manly soap,</li>
            <li>It does not have as many bristles as another one I used to have</li>
            <li>Father is pleased.</li>
            <li>I apply the lather to my face with the brush and enjoy the invigorating massage that the brush and warm lather provide.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoying it.</li>
            <li>one more time--and hopefully it will hold up better.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this is considered  an OK lifespan for a shaving brush?  </li>
            <li>Shaving just doesn&#x27;t get much better IMHO.</li>
            <li>Purchased one for myself and one for my son, we both use every day and love them.</li>
            <li>Hopefully that will disappear with more use.  </li>
            <li>Works a lot better than my two fingers</li>
            <li>It works, but it sheds more than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>he is well pleased .</li>
            <li>The stiffer brush is very nice, works very well, mark.</li>
            <li>A Burma is a fine brush for gift baskets and and for the shaving aficianado looking to mix things up on the cheap, but there are much better brushes that don&#x27;t cost that much more.</li>
            <li>It works real well and you get a good lather from just about any cake or bar style soap to include bath soaps.</li>
            <li>As always, super great &amp; fast shipping from Pharmapacks.</li>
            <li>Mine has been in use for over 50 years (as I am using my grandfathers) and is still going strong - not losing any bristles.  </li>
            <li>I dropped mine in the shower in 2003 and it broke in half, but I put a heated pin through the two halves where they join and it has been perfect ever since.</li>
            <li>the brush is smooth and easy to maintain</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t make very much or very good lather, and it sheds like a polar bear on the equator.</li>
            <li>looking into buying a good one and willing to pay extra money for good quality</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was a huge difference in quality, practically speaking, this will get you there.</li>
            <li>They do lather slightly better, but this brush is much softer and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Still, the box it came in will bring a smile to the birthday boy, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>It is smooth close shave and</li>
            <li>lathers like a dream and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The box is really cool and the brush looks cool, which is more what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>I have my own Burma Shave brush that i purchased nearly 10 years ago--and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it is Boar.</li>
            <li>The original Burma-Shave shaving cream was BRUSHLESS.</li>
            <li>Completely worth the money!</li>
            <li>The old one lasted many, many years.</li>
            <li>Nicely made nicely priced and I use it for other than shaving, stage makeup and stuff like that for models</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do anything special with or to the brush to maintain it.  </li>
            <li>Thi.s brush works very will love the difference</li>
            <li>The later seems to produce and hold a better lather which yields a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>In summary - not a bad brush.</li>
            <li>Sure, there are better brushes out there, but I can&#x27;t personally justify spending 80 plus dollars on something to spread soap.  </li>
            <li>but it breaks in rather quickly.</li>
            <li>But for $6, this brush is very nice, really comfortable, easy to break in, easy to build a lather with, and I can see this brush lasting a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>Firstly this brush is CHEAPLY made.  </li>
            <li>and oh so soft--not as soft as a more pricey badger hair brush, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a man&#x27;s personal time and the simple pleasure of a good soap and a good blade make for a better attitude later on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A significant amount of bristles came out and stuck to my face the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>This is a fairly nice brush and it is the second one I have had but the bristles start falling out after about a month or so</li>
            <li>I buy homemade shave soap because they are all natural and better for for your skin.</li>
            <li>but price is right</li>
            <li>The products even said right on them:</li>
            <li>The boar bristle used in the Burma is almost prickly, and you can really feel it digging into your pores to help clean your face.</li>
            <li>At first it smelled but for some reason it&#x27;s gone away since I started using it again.</li>
            <li>You are getting a really nice brush for not much money.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Wore the first one out.</li>
            <li>wet my face first with warm water, then run hot water over the brush bristles for about 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Then I run hot water over the soap in the mug for a few seconds and then rub the soap vigorously with the brush for about 15 seconds to work up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>After shaving, I simply leave the brush in the shaving mug on top of the soap.  </li>
            <li>First shaving brush for me.</li>
            <li>The bristle loss may have been my fault for not having a brush holder at first.</li>
            <li>This brush lost about 10 hairs the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>, the bristles started falling out on the first use.  </li>
            <li>This is my first brush.</li>
            <li>However it is not as good as the much more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Wet shaves in the shower with good glycerin shaving soap and a good brush makes for a few minutes of simple pleasure in the beginning of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After all this time, I still loose bristles now and then, but it does get better with age.  </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bristles scatter too much.</li>
            <li>At 5 to 7 dollars, you&#x27;ll get that much use out of it.</li>
            <li>especially how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>If you are on a working class budget like mine, this brush can get the job done at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>that its been used so much</li>
            <li>Brushes seem to hold up very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, goods of an opravd of expectation</li>
            <li>Spread shave soap very well.  </li>
            <li>I have found that it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>and it was nicer, but this one works real well, and while I could see a difference, I don&#x27;t know that I need to spend the money.</li>
            <li>it will fall apart within a few dozen uses at most (And will start to fall apart right away).  </li>
            <li>It lost bristles very quickly although I rinsed it thoroughly and suspended it to dry.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy these as long as they remain available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try a more premium (aka more expensive brush) sometime soon</li>
            <li>Shoot a good amount of Barbasol directly into the brush and whip up a thick creamy lather.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you get one.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s akin to the high quality Semogue</li>
            <li>BUT these bristles don&#x27;t seem to fall out as easily as the ones in the other one.</li>
            <li>I rinse this brush well after every use, hang it properly to dry, and clean it every 6 months with Borax to remove any soap residue.  </li>
            <li>To shave with a real blade, a mug of soap and a brush like this is one of those masculine pleasures in life</li>
            <li>It is soft, maybe a bit softer than I might like, and holds water and lather very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m serving in Afghanistan and wanted to wait to write my review on this shave brush until I used it for a few months, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I find it to be a bit stiff although it does seem to be softening up as I use it more.</li>
            <li>These cost just a little bit more than the brushes I bought last year, but the quality is much higher.  </li>
            <li>This thing looks decent enough at first glance but don&#x27;t wast your time with it.</li>
            <li>I would probably buy another one when I need a new one.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m going to order my son a new Burma Brush--</li>
            <li>, I recommend this brush completely!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty soft and does hold the proper amount of water and lather for me.  </li>
            <li>If you are new at shaving with a straight edge or double edge</li>
            <li>brush has lost a few bristles over the 4 years I&#x27;ve used it, but it still works just fine.  </li>
            <li>what but clearly, they need to invest some R&amp;D into improving it.</li>
            <li>The Burma shaving brush is often handed from old shaving pros to beginners as a starter brush.</li>
            <li>A Tweezerman also doesn&#x27;t need nearly the prep work that the Burma does.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY SOFT -------I</li>
            <li>OLD BRUSH LOOK</li>
            <li>I use it every day with shaving soap in an old ceramic coffee mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles on mine are natural</li>
            <li>The color is old school.</li>
            <li>I really believe it the same quality as his was.</li>
            <li>The 100% natural Bristles are not as soft as badger or boars hair but breaking it in will make it pleasurable.</li>
            <li>From the very beginning, starting in 1926.</li>
            <li>I may try a badger brush someday, once I was at my in-laws and borrowed my father in laws brush which is a 50+ year old badger brush with a ceramic handle</li>
            <li>A Tweezerman doesn&#x27;t cost that much more, is made of much softer baddger hair, and the only negative out of the box is the same wet hair smell (though not nearly as bad as the Burma).</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush in 2011 as part of a little package I threw together to celebrate my son beginning to shave--I hoped to make it one of those little father to son gifts that he can use all the time and hopefully bring back some good memories.  </li>
            <li>Other than finding long stray boar hairs on my face when I shave, this brush is fine.</li>
            <li>Take a chance, it&#x27;s low risk high reward.</li>
            <li>Wet with hot water to build a lather  2.</li>
            <li>I now have a new one and it to is very soft and has no smell like other new brushes.</li>
            <li>What that new shaver doesn&#x27;t know, is that the pros only give out Burmas because they&#x27;re dirt</li>
            <li>Get this as a back up or a travel brush or if you are new to DE shaving.</li>
            <li>I have a few super badger and silver tip badger brushes.  </li>
            <li>Clumps of the bristles started coming out shortly after I began using it, even after I bought a stand in an effort to prevent this very action from happening.</li>
            <li>I have 2 in the cabinet for when this first one fails, but after 16 or 17 years its done a fabulous job.  </li>
            <li>And in doing so, they completely ignored what Burma-Shave actually was and made it into something it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>however I bought one of these brushes and aside from having a nice handle, the brush is useless.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it is certainly inexpensive compared to others.</li>
            <li>Too bad it arrived in less than perfect shape.  </li>
            <li>He had an old one (same brand) which last for years.</li>
            <li>I used it every day with a straight razor for a couple of months straight, and every single day I used it, bristles would come out until half the fullness of the brush was gone!</li>
            <li>i recently went back in time when it comes to shaving and bought an old school double edged razor and decided to go even farther back and convert to shang brush and soap too.</li>
            <li>I am new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I shave old school with a single edge</li>
            <li>It softened with use as it was broken in and was working fine.  </li>
            <li>If you are new to wet shaving and have used this brush, don&#x27;t let it discourage you!</li>

            <li> Burma Shave is kind of a neeto, retro brand, and I&#x27;d like to see it survive.  </li>
            <li> Loving it with my Williams Shave Soap.  </li>
            <li> Nice brush for the price</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and find really sturdy.</li>
            <li> They do soften some with use, gang, and I find them very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> but all of them seemed pleased.</li>
            <li> Again Thank you:-)</li>
            <li> a brush and soap make I was well pleased with this product</li>
            <li> But I already give you credit for using a more manly soap,</li>
            <li> It does not have as many bristles as another one I used to have</li>
            <li> Father is pleased.</li>
            <li> I apply the lather to my face with the brush and enjoy the invigorating massage that the brush and warm lather provide.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> one more time--and hopefully it will hold up better.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this is considered  an OK lifespan for a shaving brush?  </li>
            <li> Shaving just doesn&#x27;t get much better IMHO.</li>
            <li> Purchased one for myself and one for my son, we both use every day and love them.</li>
            <li> Hopefully that will disappear with more use.  </li>
            <li> Works a lot better than my two fingers</li>
            <li> It works, but it sheds more than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> he is well pleased .</li>
            <li> The stiffer brush is very nice, works very well, mark.</li>
            <li> A Burma is a fine brush for gift baskets and and for the shaving aficianado looking to mix things up on the cheap, but there are much better brushes that don&#x27;t cost that much more.</li>
            <li> It works real well and you get a good lather from just about any cake or bar style soap to include bath soaps.</li>
            <li> As always, super great &amp; fast shipping from Pharmapacks.</li>
            <li> Mine has been in use for over 50 years (as I am using my grandfathers) and is still going strong - not losing any bristles.  </li>
            <li> I dropped mine in the shower in 2003 and it broke in half, but I put a heated pin through the two halves where they join and it has been perfect ever since.</li>
            <li> the brush is smooth and easy to maintain</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t make very much or very good lather, and it sheds like a polar bear on the equator.</li>
            <li> looking into buying a good one and willing to pay extra money for good quality</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was a huge difference in quality, practically speaking, this will get you there.</li>
            <li> They do lather slightly better, but this brush is much softer and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Still, the box it came in will bring a smile to the birthday boy, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> It is smooth close shave and</li>
            <li> lathers like a dream and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The box is really cool and the brush looks cool, which is more what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I have my own Burma Shave brush that i purchased nearly 10 years ago--and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it is Boar.</li>
            <li> The original Burma-Shave shaving cream was BRUSHLESS.</li>
            <li> Completely worth the money!</li>
            <li> The old one lasted many, many years.</li>
            <li> Nicely made nicely priced and I use it for other than shaving, stage makeup and stuff like that for models</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do anything special with or to the brush to maintain it.  </li>
            <li> Thi.s brush works very will love the difference</li>
            <li> The later seems to produce and hold a better lather which yields a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> In summary - not a bad brush.</li>
            <li> Sure, there are better brushes out there, but I can&#x27;t personally justify spending 80 plus dollars on something to spread soap.  </li>
            <li> but it breaks in rather quickly.</li>
            <li> But for $6, this brush is very nice, really comfortable, easy to break in, easy to build a lather with, and I can see this brush lasting a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> Firstly this brush is CHEAPLY made.  </li>
            <li> and oh so soft--not as soft as a more pricey badger hair brush, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a man&#x27;s personal time and the simple pleasure of a good soap and a good blade make for a better attitude later on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A significant amount of bristles came out and stuck to my face the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly nice brush and it is the second one I have had but the bristles start falling out after about a month or so</li>
            <li> I buy homemade shave soap because they are all natural and better for for your skin.</li>
            <li> but price is right</li>
            <li> The products even said right on them:</li>
            <li> The boar bristle used in the Burma is almost prickly, and you can really feel it digging into your pores to help clean your face.</li>
            <li> At first it smelled but for some reason it&#x27;s gone away since I started using it again.</li>
            <li> You are getting a really nice brush for not much money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Wore the first one out.</li>
            <li> wet my face first with warm water, then run hot water over the brush bristles for about 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Then I run hot water over the soap in the mug for a few seconds and then rub the soap vigorously with the brush for about 15 seconds to work up a good lather.  </li>
            <li> After shaving, I simply leave the brush in the shaving mug on top of the soap.  </li>
            <li> First shaving brush for me.</li>
            <li> The bristle loss may have been my fault for not having a brush holder at first.</li>
            <li> This brush lost about 10 hairs the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> , the bristles started falling out on the first use.  </li>
            <li> This is my first brush.</li>
            <li> However it is not as good as the much more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Wet shaves in the shower with good glycerin shaving soap and a good brush makes for a few minutes of simple pleasure in the beginning of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After all this time, I still loose bristles now and then, but it does get better with age.  </li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bristles scatter too much.</li>
            <li> At 5 to 7 dollars, you&#x27;ll get that much use out of it.</li>
            <li> especially how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> If you are on a working class budget like mine, this brush can get the job done at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> that its been used so much</li>
            <li> Brushes seem to hold up very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, goods of an opravd of expectation</li>
            <li> Spread shave soap very well.  </li>
            <li> I have found that it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> and it was nicer, but this one works real well, and while I could see a difference, I don&#x27;t know that I need to spend the money.</li>
            <li> it will fall apart within a few dozen uses at most (And will start to fall apart right away).  </li>
            <li> It lost bristles very quickly although I rinsed it thoroughly and suspended it to dry.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy these as long as they remain available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try a more premium (aka more expensive brush) sometime soon</li>
            <li> Shoot a good amount of Barbasol directly into the brush and whip up a thick creamy lather.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend you get one.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s akin to the high quality Semogue</li>
            <li> BUT these bristles don&#x27;t seem to fall out as easily as the ones in the other one.</li>
            <li> I rinse this brush well after every use, hang it properly to dry, and clean it every 6 months with Borax to remove any soap residue.  </li>
            <li> To shave with a real blade, a mug of soap and a brush like this is one of those masculine pleasures in life</li>
            <li> It is soft, maybe a bit softer than I might like, and holds water and lather very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serving in Afghanistan and wanted to wait to write my review on this shave brush until I used it for a few months, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I find it to be a bit stiff although it does seem to be softening up as I use it more.</li>
            <li> These cost just a little bit more than the brushes I bought last year, but the quality is much higher.  </li>
            <li> This thing looks decent enough at first glance but don&#x27;t wast your time with it.</li>
            <li> I would probably buy another one when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m going to order my son a new Burma Brush--</li>
            <li> , I recommend this brush completely!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty soft and does hold the proper amount of water and lather for me.  </li>
            <li> If you are new at shaving with a straight edge or double edge</li>
            <li> brush has lost a few bristles over the 4 years I&#x27;ve used it, but it still works just fine.  </li>
            <li> what but clearly, they need to invest some R&amp;D into improving it.</li>
            <li> The Burma shaving brush is often handed from old shaving pros to beginners as a starter brush.</li>
            <li> A Tweezerman also doesn&#x27;t need nearly the prep work that the Burma does.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY SOFT -------I</li>
            <li> OLD BRUSH LOOK</li>
            <li> I use it every day with shaving soap in an old ceramic coffee mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles on mine are natural</li>
            <li> The color is old school.</li>
            <li> I really believe it the same quality as his was.</li>
            <li> The 100% natural Bristles are not as soft as badger or boars hair but breaking it in will make it pleasurable.</li>
            <li> From the very beginning, starting in 1926.</li>
            <li> I may try a badger brush someday, once I was at my in-laws and borrowed my father in laws brush which is a 50+ year old badger brush with a ceramic handle</li>
            <li> A Tweezerman doesn&#x27;t cost that much more, is made of much softer baddger hair, and the only negative out of the box is the same wet hair smell (though not nearly as bad as the Burma).</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush in 2011 as part of a little package I threw together to celebrate my son beginning to shave--I hoped to make it one of those little father to son gifts that he can use all the time and hopefully bring back some good memories.  </li>
            <li> Other than finding long stray boar hairs on my face when I shave, this brush is fine.</li>
            <li> Take a chance, it&#x27;s low risk high reward.</li>
            <li> Wet with hot water to build a lather  2.</li>
            <li> I now have a new one and it to is very soft and has no smell like other new brushes.</li>
            <li> What that new shaver doesn&#x27;t know, is that the pros only give out Burmas because they&#x27;re dirt</li>
            <li> Get this as a back up or a travel brush or if you are new to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> I have a few super badger and silver tip badger brushes.  </li>
            <li> Clumps of the bristles started coming out shortly after I began using it, even after I bought a stand in an effort to prevent this very action from happening.</li>
            <li> I have 2 in the cabinet for when this first one fails, but after 16 or 17 years its done a fabulous job.  </li>
            <li> And in doing so, they completely ignored what Burma-Shave actually was and made it into something it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> however I bought one of these brushes and aside from having a nice handle, the brush is useless.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it is certainly inexpensive compared to others.</li>
            <li> Too bad it arrived in less than perfect shape.  </li>
            <li> He had an old one (same brand) which last for years.</li>
            <li> I used it every day with a straight razor for a couple of months straight, and every single day I used it, bristles would come out until half the fullness of the brush was gone!</li>
            <li> i recently went back in time when it comes to shaving and bought an old school double edged razor and decided to go even farther back and convert to shang brush and soap too.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I shave old school with a single edge</li>
            <li> It softened with use as it was broken in and was working fine.  </li>
            <li> If you are new to wet shaving and have used this brush, don&#x27;t let it discourage you!</li>
            <li> The bristles on my son&#x27;s brush are a bit on the stiff side, and they haven&#x27;t softened up much with use.  </li>
            <li> When I first used the brush it was very stiff, but worked well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure they appreciated the history of the name Burma Shave</li>
            <li> This brush does its job--and you know when you drag it over your beard that it&#x27;s penetrating your pores and softening up those whiskers while building a great base of lather for your blade.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced much bristle loss at all, and it is still pretty firm after all of these years and shaves.</li>
            <li> final thought of this brush, I did not like it due to the bristles falling off during every use so this brush wont last long.   </li>
            <li> The entire center eventually gave way and it became useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is now hollow in the middle, but still works.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t suffer it long</li>
            <li> The brush comes in a box that says Burma Shave, but the brush itself has no labels, is smaller than expected, and just another brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush is a little stiff when you first get it</li>
            <li> (Warning: it will tear through a mug of fu-fu glycerin soap pretty quickly and you&#x27;ll be disappointed with the bubble water instead of lather.</li>
            <li> It may be due to the fact that I travel a lot for work and only use the brush when I am home.  </li>
            <li> The brush does dry out for 7 to 10 days at a time.</li>
            <li> Let air dry hanging from a shaving stand.</li>
            <li> Frankly I bought it because of the moderate price and some infatuation with the old Burma Shave that was so common as I was growing up in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> for every single use, 5-10 bristles are going away.</li>
            <li> Oh, they&#x27;re not hard, and they won&#x27;t take your hide off, but you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> This little brush will save me a lot of money on shaving cream in the future.</li>
            <li> Its all I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard some reviews talk of them smelling like a wet animal for a while--I never noted that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m watching it carefully--</li>
            <li> Spend a few extra dollars and buy an omega shaving brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previously, I was just using my Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint liquid soap on my face and wet shaving was just another morning chapter.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily, minimal bristle loss after 20+ uses.</li>
            <li> Has worked well enough over the past few months, loosing only a bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles fall out no matter what despite what other reviews say about storing in a hanging position.</li>
            <li> Some people turn their nose up at boar brushes and anything under $40 is not worth trying to them.  </li>
            <li> Not worth returning.</li>
            <li> Over half the bristles fell out within a week.</li>
            <li> Then the American Safety Razor Company (having bought Burma-Shave from Phillip Morris, who had bought the Burma-Vita company in 1963) decided to bring Burma-Shave back as a nostalgic curiosity.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush performs as advertised--although it takes some &#x27;getting used to&#x27; if you&#x27;re not familiar with shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> wish the handle was a little longer.</li>
            <li> After a few shaves clumps of brissels came out.  </li>
            <li> It too has lost a few bristles, and it seems the loss may be increasing somewhat--but the brush is well over 4 yearsold too.  </li>
            <li> What I did was shampoo it a few times.</li>
            <li> If you buy any of the new Burma-Shaving products thinking that you&#x27;re reliving the past, that you&#x27;re shaving with Burma-Shave just like your grampa did, you&#x27;re wrong.</li>
            <li> Pretty bad.</li>
            <li> stinks, above and beyond the wet fur smell of any animal-hair brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I retire them from shaving, I use them in my workshop for brushing dirt and dust from small machine parts that I sometimes work on.  </li>
            <li> Not top of the line but dependable.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; bristles, which appear to be some type of synthetic, although I&#x27;m not sure what.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after I left an expensive model at the hotel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shaving soap for many years and this brush was about the worst I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> I shave with a safety razor and my Burma-Shave brush at least 6 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have reported, it is stiff (though I expect it to soften with use) and it has an unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s a little too stiff, and can be really unpleasant on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is somewhat small compared to the expensive brushes I see in the stores, but that is just not an issue.</li>
            <li> but it is not a great brush.</li>
            <li> This bush is just poor quality.</li>
            <li> The boar knot in the handle is of really poor quality.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to expend some effort shampooing it out of the box, and then going through some lousy shaves.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s silly.  </li>
            <li> I found this to be a very, very poor quality brush.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it came from a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> Again, perhaps it just came from a bad batch and that&#x27;s why the bristles are falling out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick of buying disposable junk.  </li>
            <li> This brush stinks!  </li>
            <li> for the price it looked like a very expensive Shaving Brush!!</li>
            <li> This item turned out to be horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This brush is wonderful !  Does everything that they advertised and then some !!!</li>
            <li> The stiffer brush is very nice, works very well, mark.</li>
            <li> So far so good.Its all I expected</li>
            <li> At first it smelled but for some reason it&#x27;s gone away since I started using it again. Shoot a good amount of Barbasol directly into the brush and whip up a thick creamy lather. You&#x27;ll get the best shave of your life. No need to spend your money on overpriced brushes that do the same job.</li>
            <li> In My father&#x27;s day in the 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s Burma Shave made a great product however I bought one of these brushes and aside from having a nice handle, the brush is useless. I used it every day with a straight razor for a couple of months straight, and every single day I used it, bristles would come out until half the fullness of the brush was gone!</li>
            <li> This shaving brush performs as advertised--although it takes some &#x27;getting used to&#x27; if you&#x27;re not familiar with shaving brushes. Some things to remember are to use enough water, and allow enough time for the correct foam consistency to develop.</li>
            <li> The Burma shaving brush is often handed from old shaving pros to beginners as a starter brush. What that new shaver doesn&#x27;t know, is that the pros only give out Burmas because they&#x27;re dirt cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The stiffness can be nice. The boar bristle used in the Burma is almost prickly, and you can really feel it digging into your pores to help clean your face. I&#x27;d almost consider using the brush for the exfoliation alone.&lt;br /&gt;-CHEAP price, and the build quality is still fairly solid so it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It stinks, above and beyond the wet fur smell of any animal-hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a little too stiff, and can be really unpleasant on your face.&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t hold water or lather very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...but it does get better, because the brush just needs a fairly involved break-in period before it truly blossoms. You&#x27;ll need to expend some effort shampooing it out of the box, and then going through some lousy shaves. When you do finally break it in, it turns into an entirely usable brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d just spend the extra money and get a Tweezerman. A Tweezerman doesn&#x27;t cost that much more, is made of much softer baddger hair, and the only negative out of the box is the same wet hair smell (though not nearly as bad as the Burma). A Tweezerman also doesn&#x27;t need nearly the prep work that the Burma does. A Burma is a fine brush for gift baskets and and for the shaving aficianado looking to mix things up on the cheap, but there are much better brushes that don&#x27;t cost that much more.</li>
            <li> I made shaving cream for my sons and son-in-law for Christmas. I&#x27;m not sure they appreciated the history of the name Burma Shave but all of them seemed pleased.</li>
            <li> Man! for the price it looked like a very expensive Shaving Brush!! And I Will Order These Again Thank you:-)</li>
            <li> Been using a brush and mug for several years now.  The easiest way to describe this is to call it a 3series BMW.  All about the value.  You are getting a really nice brush for not much money. Are there nicer cars,  not at this price</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY SOFT -------I LIKE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. The old one lasted many, many years.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes as gifts with home made shaving soap.  The recipients have no complaints about their brushes, and they are getting lots of use.</li>
            <li> item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serving in Afghanistan and wanted to wait to write my review on this shave brush until I used it for a few months, and I&#x27;m glad I did. This item turned out to be horrible. Clumps of the bristles started coming out shortly after I began using it, even after I bought a stand in an effort to prevent this very action from happening. The entire center eventually gave way and it became useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to throw it away and subsequently purchased a different brand.</li>
            <li> excelente producto...</li>
            <li> Thi.s brush works very will love the difference a brush and soap make I was well pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Nice brush works great wish the handle was a little longer.</li>
            <li> Pretty bad. Over half the bristles fell out within a week.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a very, very poor quality brush. It just didn&#x27;t make very much or very good lather, and it sheds like a polar bear on the equator. It&#x27;s Burma Shave, though. The box is really cool and the brush looks cool, which is more what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 18 YEARS. GIVE GREAT LATHER AND IS EASY TO RINSE AND MAINTAIN.</li>
            <li> Bristles scatter too much.</li>
            <li> Why pay 30 or 40 dollars for the same quality product that&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;been around for over a hundred years, and at a cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced mine that has been in service for 50 years.</li>
            <li> Great for the price.  Bottom line is that there is a difference between this type of synthetic brush and a proper badger brush. The later seems to produce and hold a better lather which yields a more comfortable shave. Get this as a back up or a travel brush or if you are new to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought mine in 2002. I shave with a safety razor and my Burma-Shave brush at least 6 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it doesn&#x27;t blossom like my English badger brush. But that&#x27;s its charm. This brush does its job--and you know when you drag it over your beard that it&#x27;s penetrating your pores and softening up those whiskers while building a great base of lather for your blade. Paired with a firmer shaving soap (like Col Conk or Williams), it will put a perfect lather on your face every morning. (Warning: it will tear through a mug of fu-fu glycerin soap pretty quickly and you&#x27;ll be disappointed with the bubble water instead of lather. But I already give you credit for using a more manly soap, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it rugged? I dropped mine in the shower in 2003 and it broke in half, but I put a heated pin through the two halves where they join and it has been perfect ever since. I have not experienced much bristle loss at all, and it is still pretty firm after all of these years and shaves. I rinse this brush well after every use, hang it properly to dry, and clean it every 6 months with Borax to remove any soap residue.  Take care of it, and it will last you a lifetime. Highly recommend you get one.</li>
            <li> This brush is a good deal for the price but it is not a great brush. I find it to be a bit stiff although it does seem to be softening up as I use it more. It does not have as many bristles as another one I used to have BUT these bristles don&#x27;t seem to fall out as easily as the ones in the other one. In summary - not a bad brush. I would probably buy another one when I need a new one. However it is not as good as the much more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> nice product to  use in shaving.</li>
            <li> When I first used the brush it was very stiff, but worked well.  It softened with use as it was broken in and was working fine.  However, after about a year or so, the bristles started falling out in lumps of 10-25 bristles each time.  The brush is now hollow in the middle, but still works. It may be due to the fact that I travel a lot for work and only use the brush when I am home.  The brush does dry out for 7 to 10 days at a time.</li>
            <li> final thought of this brush, I did not like it due to the bristles falling off during every use so this brush wont last long.   looking into buying a good one and willing to pay extra money for good quality</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do and wasn&#x27;t over-priced.  I use it every day .  It&#x27;s my second one.  Wore the first one out.</li>
            <li> I use this along with C.O. Bigelow shave cream, awesome combo. It cleans off just great and creates a nice foam.</li>
            <li> At 5 to 7 dollars, you&#x27;ll get that much use out of it. Nothing amazing here, Works for what it costs, Falls apart fairly soon. Practically disposable but works for the price.</li>
            <li> for every single use, 5-10 bristles are going away.</li>
            <li> Brissels starting coming out .  After a few shaves clumps of brissels came out.  Not well made.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Merchandise as described.</li>
            <li> Husband swears by it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and find really sturdy.</li>
            <li> Arrived in 3 business days.  Father is pleased.</li>
            <li> HAD TO REPLACE OLD BRUSH LOOK LIKE THIS ONE WILL HOLD UP</li>
            <li> Best shaving brush I have used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shaving brushes for about 40 years.  My current brush is this Burma Shaving Brush and I&#x27;ve had it about 4 years.  I use it every day with shaving soap in an old ceramic coffee mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet my face first with warm water, then run hot water over the brush bristles for about 20 seconds.  This softens up the bristles.  Then I run hot water over the soap in the mug for a few seconds and then rub the soap vigorously with the brush for about 15 seconds to work up a good lather.  I apply the lather to my face with the brush and enjoy the invigorating massage that the brush and warm lather provide.  Then I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has lost a few bristles over the 4 years I&#x27;ve used it, but it still works just fine.  I don&#x27;t do anything special with or to the brush to maintain it.  After shaving, I simply leave the brush in the shaving mug on top of the soap.  I&#x27;ve owned several of these Burma Shave brushes and they typically last me 5 years or longer.  After I retire them from shaving, I use them in my workshop for brushing dirt and dust from small machine parts that I sometimes work on.  When this one wears out, I&#x27;ll buy another one.</li>
            <li> First shaving brush for me. Has worked well enough over the past few months, loosing only a bristles. The bristle loss may have been my fault for not having a brush holder at first. Really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> The bristles fall out no matter what despite what other reviews say about storing in a hanging position. This bush is just poor quality. Buyer beware the return policy period is very short!</li>
            <li> This is a boar brush, and a fairly inexpensive one at that.  Some people turn their nose up at boar brushes and anything under $40 is not worth trying to them.  I have a few super badger and silver tip badger brushes.  They do lather slightly better, but this brush is much softer and more comfortable.  This is the best brush I own and the one I go to even over the $90 brush I got for Christmas.  Plus this brush just has a nice look to it, I am proud to display it in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a great brush.  Mine has been in use for over 50 years (as I am using my grandfathers) and is still going strong - not losing any bristles.  It lathers well and is just firm enough to lift your whiskers yet feel gentle against your skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush in 2011 as part of a little package I threw together to celebrate my son beginning to shave--I hoped to make it one of those little father to son gifts that he can use all the time and hopefully bring back some good memories.  Perhaps it came from a bad batch.  The bristles on my son&#x27;s brush are a bit on the stiff side, and they haven&#x27;t softened up much with use.  Oh, they&#x27;re not hard, and they won&#x27;t take your hide off, but you know what I mean.  However, the bristles have started to fall out. He&#x27;s probably lost 25 to 30% of them now.  Again, perhaps it just came from a bad batch and that&#x27;s why the bristles are falling out--I hope so.  Burma Shave is kind of a neeto, retro brand, and I&#x27;d like to see it survive.  I have my own Burma Shave brush that i purchased nearly 10 years ago--and I love it.  To shave with a real blade, a mug of soap and a brush like this is one of those masculine pleasures in life NO man should miss..  The bristles on mine are natural (boar bristles I think)  and oh so soft--not as soft as a more pricey badger hair brush, but not bad.  I actually want the brush to push back just a bit.  They do soften some with use, gang, and I find them very comfortable to use.  I&#x27;ve heard some reviews talk of them smelling like a wet animal for a while--I never noted that.  My brush is still as perfect as the day I took it out of the box--which is why I chose to purchase another Burma Shave brush for my boy.  I wanted to give him something of quality and value.  Anyway, I&#x27;m going to order my son a new Burma Brush--one more time--and hopefully it will hold up better.  If it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll be back here to update everyone here--and I&#x27;ll see if I can get a message through to the company as well--tell them they may need to re-think things.  Cheers everyone.  Update, 2/5/15:  As noted above, I bought my boy another Burma brush.  It too has lost a few bristles, and it seems the loss may be increasing somewhat--but the brush is well over 4 yearsold too.  Perhaps this is considered  an OK lifespan for a shaving brush?  I&#x27;m watching it carefully--I&#x27;m sick of buying disposable junk.  Time will tell I guess.  Oh, there&#x27;s still a LOT of life left in it and hey, for 8 bucks or so, I didn&#x27;t get hurt but...    My personal Burma brush?  Still soldiering on well over 10 years after I bought it.  I guess this has been my yardstick to measure things against.  I&#x27;ve experienced NO bristle loss with it.  Loving it with my Williams Shave Soap.  Shaving just doesn&#x27;t get much better IMHO.</li>
            <li> Stepson loves it. Couldn&#x27;t find any local. Checked everywhere.</li>
            <li> This a gook shaving brush for the price. If you are new at shaving with a straight edge or double edge this is a good brush to start as it is cheaper than the badger brushes and it give you a chance to start until you can make up your mind on what brush you would like to use.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Great brush, great price</li>
            <li> This thing looks decent enough at first glance but don&#x27;t wast your time with it. It constantly sheds hairs. The boar knot in the handle is of really poor quality. If you are new to wet shaving and have used this brush, don&#x27;t let it discourage you! Spend a few extra dollars and buy an omega shaving brush. Made in Italy. Great quality and a great price around 10 to 20 dollars.</li>
            <li> You can not beat the price of this brush. The color is old school. Reminds me of my fathers brush I really believe it the same quality as his was. He used it for over 40 years and passed it on to me. I now have a new one and it to is very soft and has no smell like other new brushes. I&#x27;m pretty sure it is Boar.</li>
            <li> This brush lost about 10 hairs the first time I used it. Seems like I lose hairs every time I use it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now. I&#x27;m hoping the bristle loss is temporary. Other than finding long stray boar hairs on my face when I shave, this brush is fine.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Purchased one for myself and one for my son, we both use every day and love them. Will purchase another when I wear it out.</li>
            <li> This replaces another Burma shave brush.  Not top of the line but dependable.</li>
            <li> Just wouldn&#x27;t lather up like the boar bristle brushes I used before and since.  I think it&#x27;s the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; bristles, which appear to be some type of synthetic, although I&#x27;m not sure what.  Avoid and spend the money on a good boar or badger brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a year and I have 0 complaints.  It doesn&#x27;t shed or smell and is a medium stiffness.  How I use it:  1. Wet with hot water to build a lather  2. apply lather to face and shave  3. Rinse and wring out with your hand when finished shaving  4. Let air dry hanging from a shaving stand.</li>
            <li> First off, its not going to be the best brush especially how cheap it is. the handle is plastic which means its water proof and solid. The 100% natural Bristles are not as soft as badger or boars hair but breaking it in will make it pleasurable. What I did was shampoo it a few times. And then about the second  or third time of actually using it, it was broke in</li>
            <li> quality seems to be there and time will tell if it holds up over time? but price is right and like I said it looks to be a good product</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have reported, it is stiff (though I expect it to soften with use) and it has an unpleasant odor.  Hopefully that will disappear with more use.  On the other hand, it is certainly inexpensive compared to others.</li>
            <li> Been shaving with with a brush and soap for years. This brush works perfect.</li>
            <li> Have been using these for many years and thought they may not be the best made brush, for me there is nothing better!</li>
            <li> Firstly this brush is CHEAPLY made.  it will fall apart within a few dozen uses at most (And will start to fall apart right away).  And it&#x27;s silly.  Burma Shave never made brushes/soap for shaving.  Their entire marketing campaign was geared towards getting away from \\&quot;Grandpa&#x27;s Brush\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly nice brush and it is the second one I have had but the bristles start falling out after about a month or so and it is quite a bother to stop and pick them off of your face while attempting to shave. I don&#x27;t know if it is the glue they use or what but clearly, they need to invest some R&amp;D into improving it.</li>
            <li> Works great and I get a great lather. i recently went back in time when it comes to shaving and bought an old school double edged razor and decided to go even farther back and convert to shang brush and soap too. It works real well and you get a good lather from just about any cake or bar style soap to include bath soaps. This little brush will save me a lot of money on shaving cream in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the fullness and softness of the bristles.  I buy these to sell with a homemade shaving soap, so I need the cost to be relatively low.  These cost just a little bit more than the brushes I bought last year, but the quality is much higher.  I will continue to buy these as long as they remain available.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He had an old one (same brand) which last for years. He doesn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the price</li>
            <li> Wet shaves in the shower with good glycerin shaving soap and a good brush makes for a few minutes of simple pleasure in the beginning of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I was just using my Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint liquid soap on my face and wet shaving was just another morning chapter. Then I heard about shaving soap and a brush, and decided to try it out. Burma Shave stuff is great. It&#x27;s a man&#x27;s personal time and the simple pleasure of a good soap and a good blade make for a better attitude later on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Feel your face&lt;br /&gt; As you walk by.&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t you think&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s time to try&lt;br /&gt;  Burma Shave.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This brush stinks!  Smells like the south end of a northbound hog.  I won&#x27;t suffer it long, the bristles started falling out on the first use.  A significant amount of bristles came out and stuck to my face the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Works a lot better than my two fingers&lt;br /&gt;which is what I used to use. Fair price.</li>
            <li> My son and I have been using this brush for a year now.  I didn&#x27;t experience the bristle loss that some reviewers had.  Sure, there are better brushes out there, but I can&#x27;t personally justify spending 80 plus dollars on something to spread soap.  If you are on a working class budget like mine, this brush can get the job done at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Now that its been used so much it&#x27;s pretty soft and does hold the proper amount of water and lather for me.  I shave old school with a single edge and so I take about 3 passes - that means I lather up 3 times each shave - and still this brush has lasted.</li>
            <li> Gift for son.  He&#x27;s relocating half-way across country.&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;ll evaluate --- eventually.</li>
            <li> Brushes seem to hold up very well.  I don&#x27;t see pieces of the hair in the shower or the sink.</li>
            <li> Nicely made nicely priced and I use it for other than shaving, stage makeup and stuff like that for models</li>
            <li> Thanks, goods of an opravd of expectation</li>
            <li> Very good inexpensive brush.  Spread shave soap very well.  Cleans easily, minimal bristle loss after 20+ uses.</li>
            <li> Purchased this brush for a grandson who is soon to be a teen.  The brush comes in a box that says Burma Shave, but the brush itself has no labels, is smaller than expected, and just another brush.  Still, the box it came in will bring a smile to the birthday boy, I&#x27;m sure. Too bad it arrived in less than perfect shape.  It was a bit dinged up.  Still, the grandson will know I meant well.  Not worth returning.</li>
            <li> The original Burma-Shave shaving cream was BRUSHLESS. From the very beginning, starting in 1926. No mug, no brush, no soap, no lather. The shaving cream came in jars and tubes. You just spread it on your face with your fingers. The products even said right on them: \\&quot;NO BRUSH - NO LATHER\\&quot;. Then the American Safety Razor Company (having bought Burma-Shave from Phillip Morris, who had bought the Burma-Vita company in 1963) decided to bring Burma-Shave back as a nostalgic curiosity. And in doing so, they completely ignored what Burma-Shave actually was and made it into something it wasn&#x27;t. If you buy any of the new Burma-Shaving products thinking that you&#x27;re reliving the past, that you&#x27;re shaving with Burma-Shave just like your grampa did, you&#x27;re wrong.</li>
            <li> Works great. Makes good lather.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little stiff when you first get it but it breaks in rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It works, but it sheds more than I&#x27;d like.  I bought this after I left an expensive model at the hotel.&lt;br /&gt;There was a huge difference in quality, practically speaking, this will get you there.</li>
            <li> never used a brush to shave. I never will use anything but this. It is smooth close shave and the brush is smooth and easy to maintain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shaving soap for many years and this brush was about the worst I&#x27;ve ever had.  It lost bristles very quickly although I rinsed it thoroughly and suspended it to dry.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving. This is my first brush. Frankly I bought it because of the moderate price and some infatuation with the old Burma Shave that was so common as I was growing up in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s. I have found that it does the job very well. It is somewhat small compared to the expensive brushes I see in the stores, but that is just not an issue. It is soft, maybe a bit softer than I might like, and holds water and lather very well. I&#x27;ll try a more premium (aka more expensive brush) sometime soon but as a newbie to wet shaving find this Burma Shave brush to be very good and an excellent value.</li>
            <li> I buy homemade shave soap because they are all natural and better for for your skin. I needed a good shave brush to apply it.</li>
            <li> great brush for the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Burma-shave brushes since 1997 or 1998 when they started selling Burma-Shave soap and brushes again (the soaps all gone I think, but brushes are still around).  I have 2 in the cabinet for when this first one fails, but after 16 or 17 years its done a fabulous job.  After all this time, I still loose bristles now and then, but it does get better with age.  I may try a badger brush someday, once I was at my in-laws and borrowed my father in laws brush which is a 50+ year old badger brush with a ceramic handle and it was nicer, but this one works real well, and while I could see a difference, I don&#x27;t know that I need to spend the money.</li>
            <li> So after about 12 shaves 40% of the bristles have fallen out.  Unacceptable.  Will be buying from someone else</li>
            <li> As always, super great &amp; fast shipping from Pharmapacks. The brush is so nice! Completely worth the money! But Dont expect the same performance from this brush as you would a $150+ Edwin Jagger Badger-hair brush. But for $6, this brush is very nice, really comfortable, easy to break in, easy to build a lather with, and I can see this brush lasting a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this brush completely!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive quality brush that&#x27;s akin to the high quality Semogue 2,000.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll stand the test of time, but that doesn&#x27;t matter since I only paid $6 for it at my grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers like a dream and is easy to clean. Take a chance, it&#x27;s low risk high reward.</li>
            <li> Just as described, Thank you!</li>
            <li> customer requested i get one of these for him. he is well pleased . shaves as often as necessary. loves to use it</li>
