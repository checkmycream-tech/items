    <ol>
            <li>is, according to my wife, an excellent perfume; I tend to agree with her, it&#x27;s what she likes and she wears it well, so I&#x27;ll continue to buy it for her.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!!!  </li>
            <li>and I love it !!!</li>
            <li>This was a great price.</li>
            <li>Great price for the size bottle.</li>
            <li>It smells great and the box being optional saves me money.</li>
            <li>GREAT price.</li>
            <li>This is the fragrance my wife wears, spells very nice on her.</li>
            <li>Wife smells so good when she wears this.</li>
            <li>What can I say, my wife loved it.</li>
            <li>great price for my mother-in-law&#x27;s favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>love!  </li>
            <li>This fragrance smells wonderful when warmed up to your natural body</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, which is always a nice thing!</li>
            <li>Awesome fragrance, super fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>Was not happy--Not in a box-no top on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I am 100% COMPLETELY satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This was the correct product but it came without a gold top and a label that said not for resale.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li>love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>my favorite</li>
            <li>Almost every time I wear Beautiful, I get compliments on how good it smells &amp; about half of those times, I&#x27;m also asked the name of the perfume by women &amp; men.</li>
            <li>My hubby tries to keep it in the house so I can smell BEAUTIFUL all the time!</li>
            <li>its seems not to be as strong as the one in the box..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes, it aches too much to pay so much for the Beautiful shower gel</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell of this perfume and the price that it was</li>
            <li>I get compliments daily on how good this perfume smells.  </li>
            <li>This was a larger bottle than I thought which was good.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The label has a slight scratch on it, so maybe that&#x27;s why it was such an excellent deal.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I get Beautiful gift sets for my birthday &amp; Christmas and, outside of the shower gel, they last a surprisingly long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead I found the bottle wrapped in gift wrap, packed in a cubical cardboard shipping box packed in with tissue paper; definitely NOT the original packaging for this product.</li>
            <li>It only takes a minute &amp; worth your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re unsure about spending a lot of hard earned money on Beautiful, I&#x27;d advise buying the lotion and either the powder or perfume in a small gift set or smaller sizes.</li>
            <li>Beyond Paradise, Pure White Linen daily to work - compliments always!</li>

            <li> Wife smells so good when she wears this. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s favoriteperfume</li>
            <li> You guys should have record of these when I received that perfume it didn&#x27;t come with a perfume box and it  was a tester bottle even though they refund my money I was not able to give this present out to the person he was going to</li>
            <li> Arrived on time..with all the expectations kayed forthin the initial description page on the AMAZON informatiin page. All expectations fullfilled.</li>
            <li> This was a great price. It comes unboxed, but it was for me so didnt need a box. Arrived quickly, which is always a nice thing!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!!!  My hubby tries to keep it in the house so I can smell BEAUTIFUL all the time!</li>
            <li> Almost every time I wear Beautiful, I get compliments on how good it smells &amp; about half of those times, I&#x27;m also asked the name of the perfume by women &amp; men. To ensure the scent lasts all day, I layer it; use the shower gel, apply lotion before towel drying (lotion will go further this way but the effect is the same), after skin is dry, apply the powder &amp; finally, apply a small amount of the perfume on your way out the door. It only takes a minute &amp; worth your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, it aches too much to pay so much for the Beautiful shower gel but I&#x27;ve found Olay body wash doesn&#x27;t clash with the perfume scent. Luckily, I get Beautiful gift sets for my birthday &amp; Christmas and, outside of the shower gel, they last a surprisingly long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re unsure about spending a lot of hard earned money on Beautiful, I&#x27;d advise buying the lotion and either the powder or perfume in a small gift set or smaller sizes.</li>
            <li> What can I say, my wife loved it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell of this perfume and the price that it was I couldn&#x27;t resist getting out.  Great price for the size bottle.</li>
            <li> great price for my mother-in-law&#x27;s favorite perfume.  she asks for a bottle every year for Christmas and I will definitely order through Amazon again rather than going to the department store.</li>
            <li> For my mother.  Everying is as advertised</li>
            <li> used it in the past and met my expectations.  i would recogmend this product.  a little pricey, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Was not happy--Not in a box-no top on the bottle. Looked like it had been used-alot out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. It smells great and the box being optional saves me money. I buy this every year.</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance, super fast delivery!  I get compliments daily on how good this perfume smells.  I have wanted it for years!</li>
            <li> GREAT price. The label has a slight scratch on it, so maybe that&#x27;s why it was such an excellent deal. I am 100% COMPLETELY satisfied with this purchase. I adore the scent of this perfume &amp;#34;Beautiful&amp;#34;, and to have such a big bottle on my dresser is a simple pleasure of life.</li>
            <li> This was the correct product but it came without a gold top and a label that said not for resale.</li>
            <li> I rather of had the  item ship in the orginal box its seems not to be as strong as the one in the box..</li>
            <li> love!  one of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li> This is the fragrance my wife wears, spells very nice on her. This was a larger bottle than I thought which was good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this perfume for my wife for years from a local retailer. This perfume is always packaged in a tight-fitting salmon/coral colored box at the store - this is what I expected to see when I opened the box this purchase arrived in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead I found the bottle wrapped in gift wrap, packed in a cubical cardboard shipping box packed in with tissue paper; definitely NOT the original packaging for this product. Frankly I&#x27;m uncomfortable with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, according to my wife, an excellent perfume; I tend to agree with her, it&#x27;s what she likes and she wears it well, so I&#x27;ll continue to buy it for her. And, of course, I&#x27;ll continue to shop at Amazon. I have an order being delivered today, however, I will never buy perfume from Amazon again. I simply do not trust that I&#x27;ll receive what I expect.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and I love it !!! Enjoy...great service !!</li>
            <li> I have to buy this for wife on her BD every year....</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells wonderful when warmed up to your natural body heat - I switch wearing this, Pleasures, Beyond Paradise, Pure White Linen daily to work - compliments always!</li>
            <li> love this perfume.  my favorite</li>
