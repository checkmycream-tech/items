            <li>wonderful....</li>
            <li>Alterna is generally very good hair care, I just don&#x27;t think the rapid repair is anything to write home about.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a very good quality product</li>
            <li>It helps me at the cuticle level to keep hair moist, shiny and on the surface, it smells beautiful and is anti-frizz as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I call this my &amp;#34;magic spray&amp;#34; because it gives my hair a beautiful sheen and style.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Also great to use as touch ups.  </li>
            <li>I order this all the time, what a great price on Amazon, because it is twice the price at the salons.</li>
            <li>It is because I know these products before hand (the great majority)</li>
            <li>so this is great for my dyed hair</li>
            <li>What it does: seals in color and provides great shine.  </li>
            <li>I think in some places its a bit over priced, but think I got a great deal on it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product keep my hair in great shape and helps repair the damage done by heat.</li>
            <li>Everything they have is so good and so good for your hair!  </li>

            <li>I find that I use it every day after spraying with hair lacquer,  or just on its own.</li>

            <li>Love, love, love this for my hair.</li>
            <li>What better compliment than for them to notice.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>When i ran out, i thought i&#x27;d try to get a better deal on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s very light,  not too greasy which I liked and again it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I saw this in Sephora and wanted it right then, but took out my handy phone and my Amazon app and saw that I could get it for a much better price....</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF, IT MAKES YOUR HAIR SOFT AND MAKES IT SHINE!!!!!!</li>
            <li>it makes my hair very soft and it smells good.</li>
            <li>Smells awesome and makes my hair shine without weighing it down!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Alterna</li>
            <li>Alterna is one of my favorite brands, and the smell of this product alone is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but don&#x27;t use to much otherwise will leave a film in your hair.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair shiny &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>It works,  leaves your soft and it smells good,  </li>
            <li>I love all of Alternas products, they really know what they are doing!  </li>
            <li>totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I bought this product originally from my hair stylist and reordered it on Amazon when I came close to running out.</li>
            <li>No love lost though, like i said, it smells great!</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel so soft, no frizzing even the next day, brings out my haircolor &amp; smells great!</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair super soft, smells pleasant, and I honestly think it also protects it from the heat (I use a GHD daily, so I need it !).</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and makes my hair unbelievably soft</li>
            <li>nice and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Its not a bad product by any means just not what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li>Great stuff when used with alternas other products in this line</li>
            <li>The product is good but the bottle started leaking at the top a few days after I started using it.  </li>
            <li>anything less is a great deal.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, likely because of the fennel that in the product.  </li>
            <li>but I say it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s nice and silky, soft and much healthier.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for many years and it wasn&#x27;t full proof, actually as soon as it hit my hair</li>
            <li>This product literally transformed my hair from damaged and dry to silky, healthy perfection!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be rebuying,  but it might be great for someone who&#x27;s hair isn&#x27;t thin and fine.</li>
            <li>Very fine mist, so two simple sprizes over the hair will do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for any styling, just a few sprays before you use the flat iron, and it helps to straighten hair better.  </li>
            <li>Seems  like someone replaced the original contents with fake oil.&lt;br /&gt;The Caviar that I&#x27;m used to is much lighter, not greasy and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I like using it after I blow dry my hair when it&#x27;s kind of poofy</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair easy to comb, feel soft, and look shiny.</li>
            <li>Too many spritzes will leave your hair very oily, so less is more.  </li>
            <li>Try this anti-aging repair spray and suddenly your hair is under control, and looks shiny and healthy.    </li>
            <li>so my hair has been pretty fried but an all over spritz of this stuff</li>
            <li>I feel like it makes my hair healthy especially when I use my straightener.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I used in the Caviar line.  </li>
            <li>Smells different (alcohol undertone) and has a more oily/greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>Love the shine and health this put back into my hair.</li>
            <li>Off to the salon to get the real deal!</li>
            <li>Only downside, if over sprayed seems to make hair &#x27;greasy&#x27;, but a light misting is just right.</li>
            <li>I know I know, my reviews tend to be mostly  positive.  </li>
            <li>and it helps to smooth and calm my hair before I curl or flat iron it.</li>
            <li>At such a high cost of the product you would think the packaging would have better quality.</li>
            <li>it comes in a aluminum can, love the stuff spray it on when hair is dry</li>
            <li>If you love your hair and it is sometimes frizzy, if you use straight iron, curling iron or blow dry then</li>
            <li>Plus your hair will feel so soft after the first use!</li>
            <li>The added bonus is finding it for such an amazing low price.  </li>
            <li>this left my hair oily, cheap plastic container, inferior ingredients, i am not convinced it is real alterna</li>
            <li>It was fast shipping no damage to product.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute godsend.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s a sheen or really an anti-aging rapid repair spray.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll purchase again, but it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference on my hair</li>
            <li>However, this is better for the environment so no real complaints!  </li>
            <li>Great on my hair, only thing that really works with my flat iron on my long hair.</li>
            <li>I finally ordered more of the Rapid a Repair spray and almost immediately my hair went back to normal.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good and helps my dry dry curly hair look somewhat human!</li>
            <li>I presently live in Panama</li>
            <li>I lightly mist my dry hair with this before flat ironing and it makes it silky smooth and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because Guy Tang swears by it and so far I&#x27;ve used it as a finishing spritz.</li>
            <li>Offers some shine and makes the hair appear nourished.</li>
            <li>this stuff makes your hair smooth as silk, but be conservative in how much you use, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>bleached hair has been feeling much healthier even after my flat ironing.</li>
            <li>My ends felt fried &amp; looked pretty rough, now they are feeling much more smoother &amp; looking less like dry straw and actual hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blonde who has highlights done occasionally, and this product really handles the dryness that can occur.</li>
            <li>I found this product in 2007 and every time I run out of it for an extended amount of time, I get major split ends.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for nearly 2 weeks &amp; my long (to the waist)</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair, so maybe that&#x27;s why this just didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  </li>
            <li>This product works wonderfully on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have noticed towards the end of the canister, it sprays a little oily, so I just shake it gently to keep mixing the contents.</li>

            <li> so my hair has been pretty fried but an all over spritz of this stuff</li>
            <li> I feel like it makes my hair healthy especially when I use my straightener.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I used in the Caviar line.  </li>
            <li> Smells different (alcohol undertone) and has a more oily/greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> Love the shine and health this put back into my hair.</li>
            <li> Off to the salon to get the real deal!</li>
            <li> Only downside, if over sprayed seems to make hair &#x27;greasy&#x27;, but a light misting is just right.</li>
            <li> I know I know, my reviews tend to be mostly  positive.  </li>
            <li> and it helps to smooth and calm my hair before I curl or flat iron it.</li>
            <li> At such a high cost of the product you would think the packaging would have better quality.</li>
            <li> it comes in a aluminum can, love the stuff spray it on when hair is dry</li>
            <li> If you love your hair and it is sometimes frizzy, if you use straight iron, curling iron or blow dry then</li>
            <li> Plus your hair will feel so soft after the first use!</li>
            <li> The added bonus is finding it for such an amazing low price.  </li>
            <li> this left my hair oily, cheap plastic container, inferior ingredients, i am not convinced it is real alterna</li>
            <li> It was fast shipping no damage to product.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute godsend.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s a sheen or really an anti-aging rapid repair spray.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll purchase again, but it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference on my hair</li>
            <li> However, this is better for the environment so no real complaints!  </li>
            <li> Great on my hair, only thing that really works with my flat iron on my long hair.</li>
            <li> I finally ordered more of the Rapid a Repair spray and almost immediately my hair went back to normal.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good and helps my dry dry curly hair look somewhat human!</li>
            <li> I presently live in Panama</li>
            <li> I lightly mist my dry hair with this before flat ironing and it makes it silky smooth and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because Guy Tang swears by it and so far I&#x27;ve used it as a finishing spritz.</li>
            <li> Offers some shine and makes the hair appear nourished.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes your hair smooth as silk, but be conservative in how much you use, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> bleached hair has been feeling much healthier even after my flat ironing.</li>
            <li> My ends felt fried &amp; looked pretty rough, now they are feeling much more smoother &amp; looking less like dry straw and actual hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde who has highlights done occasionally, and this product really handles the dryness that can occur.</li>
            <li> I found this product in 2007 and every time I run out of it for an extended amount of time, I get major split ends.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for nearly 2 weeks &amp; my long (to the waist)</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair, so maybe that&#x27;s why this just didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  </li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have noticed towards the end of the canister, it sprays a little oily, so I just shake it gently to keep mixing the contents.</li>
            <li> not much done on me but that could be due to really over processed hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like other shine products do.  </li>
            <li> Well, we of a certain age have quite a few!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair sizzle when using it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had used this product quite a long time ago, possibly 5 years.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets a little frizzy with the humidity in the air and this makes it look silky and soft.</li>
            <li> especially if I flat iron my hair).  </li>
            <li> and before I donated my long locks, I used it a lot.  </li>
            <li> Do you have days when your hair flies away and looks dry?</li>
            <li> FYI, my hair and skin tend to be dry.  </li>
            <li> Took a little too long to be delivered,  and I was concerned about reading the I ingredients on amazon vs the ingredients in the actual website.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit harder to control the spray amount with pump spray rather than the old aerosol bottle I had of it in the past.  </li>
            <li> You can use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Be careful when ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I put it on when my hair is wet, before blow-drying, and add a little when my hair is dry, if needed.</li>
            <li> I spray it on both day and night, using this in combination with other hair products</li>
            <li> and I wear a wet look!</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a while (due to money issues) and almost immediately my hair changed and everyone noticed.  </li>
            <li> I have dead ends and its also so dry.</li>
            <li> This is not the same Caviar Rapid repair that I have bought in the salon for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair and use 3-4 sprays, which is plenty.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, it doesnt weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m a little nervous when ordering; what am I going to get?</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays, finger your hair and go.  </li>
            <li> Once you try something you are anxious to try their other things!!</li>
            <li> Received the order in record time, was shocked at how fast it arrived.  </li>
            <li> It got dull and it looked and felt like horse hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled about the price</li>
            <li> No more frizz !</li>
            <li> it was dry and no shine :(  </li>
            <li> This stuff I received is fake.</li>
            <li> Expensive product</li>
            <li> Very expensive with the shipping</li>
            <li> started using this bad boy and its a great/ must have product.</li>
            <li> , I always order it!&lt;br /&gt;You wont be disappointed~</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff ! Smells awesome and makes my hair shine without weighing it down! My ends look a lot better now that I have been using it for while</li>
            <li> It was fast shipping no damage to product. Great stuff when used with alternas other products in this line</li>
            <li> This is a great product for color treated hair.  It&#x27;s great for any styling, just a few sprays before you use the flat iron, and it helps to straighten hair better.  Also great to use as touch ups.  Just a few sprays, finger your hair and go.  I have noticed towards the end of the canister, it sprays a little oily, so I just shake it gently to keep mixing the contents. And it smells sooo good and clean.  I order this all the time, what a great price on Amazon, because it is twice the price at the salons.</li>
            <li> Alterna is generally very good hair care, I just don&#x27;t think the rapid repair is anything to write home about.</li>
            <li> Do you have days when your hair flies away and looks dry? Well, we of a certain age have quite a few! Try this anti-aging repair spray and suddenly your hair is under control, and looks shiny and healthy.    Especially good on vacation after swimming or sunbathing. I find that I use it every day after spraying with hair lacquer,  or just on its own.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute godsend. I bought this product because Guy Tang swears by it and so far I&#x27;ve used it as a finishing spritz. My hair is repairing from overly processed hair from months ago and I heat style daily so my hair has been pretty fried but an all over spritz of this stuff instantly makes it softer, shinier and healthier looking. I&#x27;m not thrilled about the price but I say it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> THis is a great shine spray too!  I love all of Alternas products, they really know what they are doing!  Everything they have is so good and so good for your hair!  Once you try something you are anxious to try their other things!!</li>
            <li> I know I know, my reviews tend to be mostly  positive.  It is because I know these products before hand (the great majority) and I have used them before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorites if not MY FAVORITE hair product.  I use it before and after styling.  It helps me at the cuticle level to keep hair moist, shiny and on the surface, it smells beautiful and is anti-frizz as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  I presently live in Panama they dont have it here, I always order it!&lt;br /&gt;You wont be disappointed~</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year. My hair gets a little frizzy with the humidity in the air and this makes it look silky and soft. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, it doesnt weigh my hair down. The smell is also really nice.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell! My hair was just lightened and it looks so healthy and shiny. This product is my ride or die.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years! My local salon sells it for 30 so anything less is a great deal. Smells amazing and makes my hair unbelievably soft and I do believe it slows the process of split ends with regular use.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel so soft, no frizzing even the next day, brings out my haircolor &amp; smells great! Doesn&#x27;t make my hair sizzle when using it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes your hair smooth as silk, but be conservative in how much you use, a little goes a long way. I like using it after I blow dry my hair when it&#x27;s kind of poofy and it helps to smooth and calm my hair before I curl or flat iron it. nice and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, LOVE this stuff!!!  I have thick, long hair and use 3-4 sprays, which is plenty.  This product makes my hair super soft, smells pleasant, and I honestly think it also protects it from the heat (I use a GHD daily, so I need it !).</li>
            <li> I think it definitely is improving my hair and protecting it from the heat.  the smell is amazing !!!!!</li>
            <li> the packaging that I received is different than pictured but is the same product as what is sold at sephora. Have been using it for nearly 2 weeks &amp; my long (to the waist) bleached hair has been feeling much healthier even after my flat ironing. My ends felt fried &amp; looked pretty rough, now they are feeling much more smoother &amp; looking less like dry straw and actual hair</li>
            <li> I love this product. I always make sure I never run out.  it makes my hair very soft and it smells good.</li>
            <li> bought this product after seeing guy tang use it. I have dead ends and its also so dry. started using this bad boy and its a great/ must have product. i have red ombre so this is great for my dyed hair</li>
            <li> I saw this in Sephora and wanted it right then, but took out my handy phone and my Amazon app and saw that I could get it for a much better price.... yay!!!  This stuff is good and helps my dry dry curly hair look somewhat human!</li>
            <li> Great on my hair, only thing that really works with my flat iron on my long hair. Leaves it smooth and easy to manage and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product!  What it does: seals in color and provides great shine.  It smells amazing, likely because of the fennel that in the product.  Very fine mist, so two simple sprizes over the hair will do.  What is does NOT: This is for color hold and shine only, so do not expect this to give texture or hold like a hairspray.  Too many spritzes will leave your hair very oily, so less is more.  Alterna is one of my favorite brands, and the smell of this product alone is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Received the order in record time, was shocked at how fast it arrived.  I had used this product quite a long time ago, possibly 5 years.  This spray, gives my hair a nice shine and seems to help its health in between uses.  Sometimes I even spray it on my hands and upper arms.  Only downside, if over sprayed seems to make hair &#x27;greasy&#x27;, but a light misting is just right.</li>
            <li> This is the best spray I have ever used on my fine, frizz prone hair! Love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It makes my hair soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like other shine products do.  totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Alterna so I was excited to try this product.  It smells awesome, works great on my long hair.  I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I call this my &amp;#34;magic spray&amp;#34; because it gives my hair a beautiful sheen and style.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair, so maybe that&#x27;s why this just didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  I felt like I could feel it in my hair and I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.  I wanted to love it...someone said it was like food for your hair....and I like that.  But this didn&#x27;t feed my hair, it just kinda sat on top of it.  I won&#x27;t be rebuying,  but it might be great for someone who&#x27;s hair isn&#x27;t thin and fine.</li>
            <li> This is not the same Caviar Rapid repair that I have bought in the salon for the past few years.  It&#x27;s a different consistency (too oily), doesn&#x27;t smell at all like the caviar I&#x27;ve purchased at the salon. Not to mention that the bottle leaks everywhere. Seems  like someone replaced the original contents with fake oil.&lt;br /&gt;The Caviar that I&#x27;m used to is much lighter, not greasy and smells wonderful. This stuff I received is fake. I&#x27;ll go back to buying it at the salon.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I feel like it makes my hair healthy especially when I use my straightener.</li>
            <li> This will bring back the shine to your hair. Plus your hair will feel so soft after the first use! AAAAA++++++++</li>
            <li> Not going to lie, I don&#x27;t have a clue what this product does. I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s a sheen or really an anti-aging rapid repair spray. I only buy it because of the smell. Love that smell!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I used in the Caviar line.  I loved the shine after using it as a leave-in conditioner.  Now I use it after drying my hair.  What a wonderful difference--shiny, controlled, enhancing body.</li>
            <li> Love this  hair product.  Gives a nice smooth finish (especially if I flat iron my hair).  Smells good too.  Best price around. :)</li>
            <li> This product literally transformed my hair from damaged and dry to silky, healthy perfection! Worth every penny! I am not exaggerating!</li>
            <li> Very expensive with the shipping but hey it&#x27;s CAVIAR. Probably won&#x27;t order again too pricy but it&#x27;s a very good quality product and you will love It.</li>
            <li> Expensive product so don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll purchase again, but it doesn&#x27;t take much.  It&#x27;s a bit harder to control the spray amount with pump spray rather than the old aerosol bottle I had of it in the past.  However, this is better for the environment so no real complaints!  Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and before I donated my long locks, I used it a lot.  FYI, my hair and skin tend to be dry.  This product makes my hair easy to comb, feel soft, and look shiny.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for hair and I love it!  The added bonus is finding it for such an amazing low price.  I am telling all of my friends about it and I am stocking up myself!!  If you love your hair and it is sometimes frizzy, if you use straight iron, curling iron or blow dry then try this product. It is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a week ago and It seems to me that it was used in the salon and alcohol was added to fill it up, the front price tag was torn off and the formula was not what it should be.  I have been buying this product for many years and it wasn&#x27;t full proof, actually as soon as it hit my hair it was dry and no shine :(  Won&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but don&#x27;t use to much otherwise will leave a film in your hair. You can use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the bottle started leaking at the top a few days after I started using it.  I have never traveled with it.  At such a high cost of the product you would think the packaging would have better quality.</li>
            <li> the ingredient list is different than the repair spray i purchased from retailer.. this left my hair oily, cheap plastic container, inferior ingredients, i am not convinced it is real alterna</li>
            <li> This spray really makes my hair shine and it smells wonderful! I spray it on both day and night, using this in combination with other hair products has made my hair look great and healthy. I think in some places its a bit over priced, but think I got a great deal on it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product...really smooth as my hairand has a great smell</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair soft and shiny!!! No more frizz !</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in softness.  My hair got frizzy when sprayed.  So I now spray it at night and use a satin scarf, or in the morning with a disposable shower cap.  This softens the frizz and I wear a wet look!</li>
            <li> This is not the same as what you get in salons.  Smells different (alcohol undertone) and has a more oily/greasy feel.  Quit using when my hair started falling out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde who has highlights done occasionally, and this product really handles the dryness that can occur. I put it on when my hair is wet, before blow-drying, and add a little when my hair is dry, if needed. I bought this product originally from my hair stylist and reordered it on Amazon when I came close to running out.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it provides some hold without sticky residue. Offers some shine and makes the hair appear nourished.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I lightly mist my dry hair with this before flat ironing and it makes it silky smooth and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product on the market.  I stopped using it for a while (due to money issues) and almost immediately my hair changed and everyone noticed.  It got dull and it looked and felt like horse hair.  I finally ordered more of the Rapid a Repair spray and almost immediately my hair went back to normal.  Now it&#x27;s nice and silky, soft and much healthier.  I will not ever run out of this product again.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully on my fine, thin hair. It also smells wonderful. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Be careful when ordering this product. I thought I was ordering and the picture showed Caviar anti-aging color hold rapid hair spray it comes in a aluminum can, love the stuff spray it on when hair is dry makes it look healthier. Well I recieved Caviar anti-aging rapid hair spray instant shine and moisture. This is in a plastic bottle and is slimmey, not at all the same product.Its not a bad product by any means just not what I ordered. Now I&#x27;m a little nervous when ordering; what am I going to get?</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this for my hair. Days I forget to spray on my hair, it styles and lays differently. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the shine and health this put back into my hair. Within three days, my girlfriends all said something about my hair. What better compliment than for them to notice. Missed this product in my life. Won&#x27;t go without it anymore!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF, IT MAKES YOUR HAIR SOFT AND MAKES IT SHINE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. Keeps my hair shiny &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> It works,  leaves your soft and it smells good,  not much done on me but that could be due to really over processed hair.  Took a little too long to be delivered,  and I was concerned about reading the I ingredients on amazon vs the ingredients in the actual website.  Other than that it&#x27;s very light,  not too greasy which I liked and again it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference on my hair</li>
            <li> I call this item Liquid Gold, because of the value I hold it in. I found this product in 2007 and every time I run out of it for an extended amount of time, I get major split ends. This product keep my hair in great shape and helps repair the damage done by heat. Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I tried this product in a salon, and fell in love with it! So i bought it. When i ran out, i thought i&#x27;d try to get a better deal on amazon.  When it arrived, the packaging was different. the one i purchased from the salon was in a silver aluminum tin container with a continuous spray. This one came in a plastic clear-ish container with a pump.  It smells sort of the same....wonderful....but it doesn&#x27;t work the same.  I think i got duped on this one.  No love lost though, like i said, it smells great! so i used it as a fragrance spray for my hair, and then kept the bottle to to refill with leave in conditioner.  I won&#x27;t order again.  Off to the salon to get the real deal!</li>
