            <li>Great brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is great when using Mineral Veil.  </li>
            <li>Great quality and the price was very reasonable.  .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush, great with my bare minerals foundation</li>
            <li>So easy to handle, gets the color on target without fumbling with a handle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about as cheap as the ones that come for free with drugstore make-up.</li>
            <li>now i just threw away 12 dollars on this product, whats funny is the cheaper kabuki brushes work better go figure......</li>
            <li>I was replacing my original Kabuki brush and thought I&#x27;d get this one with the turquoise bottom.</li>
            <li>I love the lighter coverage of this brush for the warm weather season compared to the regular kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li>Does not provide full coverage like the original kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>The older brush was made out of a hardier bristles and much more dense.  </li>
            <li>It is a lovely color and the brush is very soft, but I will have to buy a full size kabuki for my foundation.</li>
            <li>Just be certain the brush has Bare Escentuals written on it so that you know you are getting the authentic brush!</li>
            <li>Not such a great product even though it is Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the full coverage brush--instead it is a smaller brush called &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; that is not as dense as the full size kabuki.</li>
            <li>Im actually very disapointed in this brush when i used it all it really did was place the powder on my face</li>
            <li>I really thought I was getting the Kabuki brush, but now I see why it was cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Seems cheap and doesn&#x27;t grab enough powder to apply to your face.</li>
            <li>I needed a replacement for my Bare Minerals full size brush, so I tried this product.</li>
            <li>I will be looking for another, more solid brush shortly.</li>
            <li>Not soft and full</li>
            <li>Brush is just what I wanted, distributes makeup evenly and is very soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on this are very, very soft.  </li>
            <li>This is not a full coverage, full size Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>I have used Bare Escentuals brushes for over 8 years.  </li>

            <li> Sorry to say, this is not nearly the quality of the original Kabuki brush, I purchased from Bare Minerals years ago.  </li>

            <li> I prefer a lighter layer of bareminerals foundation in the summer than I usually wear the rest of the year.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this brush as a small, portable brush to carry in my purse.  </li>

            <li> I have these brushes and there isn&#x27;t the fancy turquoise base which I love. I recommend this persons products to anyone.</li>
            <li> Im actually very disapointed in this brush when i used it all it really did was place the powder on my face it didnt buff it in to my skin like i thought it would now i just threw away 12 dollars on this product, whats funny is the cheaper kabuki brushes work better go figure......</li>

            <li> Fell apart after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Have used these forever.</li>
            <li> I dont recommend.  Too stiff.  Not soft and full</li>
            <li> This brush is not as described and was not &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;; it&#x27;s really small; not a great Kabuki brush at all.</li>
            <li> This is not a full coverage, full size Kabuki brush. I was replacing my original Kabuki brush and thought I&#x27;d get this one with the turquoise bottom. It is a lovely color and the brush is very soft, but I will have to buy a full size kabuki for my foundation. I may use this brush for all over face color or mineral veil but not for my foundation.</li>
            <li> I have used Bare Escentuals brushes for over 8 years.  They are excellent.  This brush is great when using Mineral Veil.  It does NOT shed fibers at all.  Just be certain the brush has Bare Escentuals written on it so that you know you are getting the authentic brush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I really thought I was getting the Kabuki brush, but now I see why it was cheaper.  It does the job but I will be ordering the real thing shortly as this one is smaller and not as firm when using.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my Bare Minerals full size brush, so I tried this product. Very disappointed in the size! Much smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> So easy to handle, gets the color on target without fumbling with a handle.  Bristles are beautifully done and coverage is exaxct.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, great with my bare minerals foundation</li>
            <li> Not such a great product even though it is Bare Escentuals. Seems cheap and doesn&#x27;t grab enough powder to apply to your face. Maybe a cleaning with olive oil will help.</li>
            <li> Does not provide full coverage like the original kabuki brush. Would not recommend this even though it is less expensive than the original.</li>
            <li> This is extremely flimsy.  It&#x27;s about as cheap as the ones that come for free with drugstore make-up. I purchased this brush as a small, portable brush to carry in my purse.  I am extremely disappointed with this brush.  I will be throwing it away.</li>
