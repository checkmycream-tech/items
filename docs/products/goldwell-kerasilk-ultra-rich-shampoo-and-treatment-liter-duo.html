            <li>This is an amazing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;and liked it --I</li>
            <li>Bought this years ago from a salon and loved it, so when I found it on Amazon, I was very excited..</li>
            <li>but I am really happy with the ultra rich.</li>

            <li>love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>it was going to be an awesome product, but frankly it worked very similar to drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li>she can still enjoying this product</li>
            <li>Love the smell too.</li>
            <li>I used to love Goldwell products but stopped using them years ago after my hairdresser told me Goldwell went out of business....</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel so healthy.</li>
            <li>Simply the best!</li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews that commented on the smell.</li>
            <li>NOW he makes sure we don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>I love the pump top.</li>
            <li>Most hair products that say &amp;#34;Ultra Rich&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I do use an added conditioner-as my hair is sometimes out control when the weather is humid (which is most of the time in the south).  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and continue to order it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>We love this product.  </li>
            <li>These are nice products but make sure you take a little break from them once in a while for best results.</li>
            <li>I arrived in good time and this very nice price  accsesible highly recommended thanks</li>
            <li>Pump size is handy and economical.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy the Ultra Rich.</li>
            <li>I feel it does make my hair shinier, stronger, and it allows me to easily brush my hair after showering (practically no tangles after use).  </li>
            <li>I love both of these products and love being able to purchase them in large quantities.</li>
            <li>Super for hair health, it has improved mine to where strangers compliment my hair!</li>
            <li>Product is excellent but the bottles leaked causing quite a mess.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, doesn&#x27;t smell fragrant (good since I am a guy), and makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Using this shampoo and conditioner along with the Kerasilk antifrizz serum has converted my hair to a smooth and frizz free texture.</li>
            <li>If you want silky smooth hair</li>
            <li>really cleans your hair and makes it shine nicely</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I have tried EVERYTHING and NOTHING has lessened the frizziness like Kerasil Ultra Rich.</li>
            <li>I replaced purology with this product and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Kerasilk shampoo and conditioner are great for dry, course or curly hair.</li>
            <li>In the past we had used others but we are now more happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It actually doesn&#x27;t smell that good.</li>
            <li>I actually really like this stuff, but I have noticed that I cannot go more than 1 day between washes or my hair</li>
            <li>Works great, has a very light smell and the large bottles last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Light scent, heavy conditioning, leaves her hair in great shape.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products, and this has been the most effective so far.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny in my book.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, smooth and super shiny.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and product was packaged very well to prevent damage and leakage</li>
            <li>and I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Your hair is shiny, soft and tangle free after using this.</li>
            <li>However, I did notice a difference in the amount of frizz on the first day</li>
            <li>I love that the bottles are so big.</li>
            <li>I might be willing to adjust.</li>
            <li>I CONSISTENTLY BUY THESE PRODUCTS, THEY WORK VERY WELL FOR CURLY, COURSE HAIR.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed it doesnt take that much product to do the job and that impresses me.  </li>
            <li>and they stop selling it in Puerto Rico, thanks to amazon</li>
            <li>I really like the Kerasilk line.</li>
            <li>Although quite a bit more expensive than many others, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Packaging done very well.  </li>
            <li>With Kerasilk Ultra Rich Shampoo and Treatment, my hair is now actually silky and manageable.</li>
            <li>Paying a little extra for hair products that work is worth and keep my super long hair healthy is totally worth it -man :-0</li>
            <li>Makes my hair just as healthy as more expensive salno brands like Unite.</li>
            <li>then i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>- there was the product that makes this thick, wavy, sometimes frizzy hair behave nicely.  </li>
            <li>probably due to my flat iron, but this really makes your hair feel healthy again.</li>
            <li>however it makes my hair very soft and repairs heat damage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first thing I found that actually works.  </li>
            <li>The exact same quaity that I get at the salon.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and when I wash it it becomes a tangly mess.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this set for several years to pamper my dry and overly fine hair.  </li>
            <li>After switching to this, I felt my hair getting silky soft after 3 days.</li>
            <li>I have curly, color treated hair and it leaves my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to smooth my hair like it did in the past-</li>
            <li>I have very dry frizzy hair with too much volumn.</li>
            <li>I also use Kerasilk Instant Silk Fluid right after I towel dry it and leave it in.</li>
            <li>After just one use my hair is back to being shinny and soft.  </li>
            <li>I developed a rash all over my back after using it about 3</li>
            <li>Same shampoo that I remember back in the early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>These are pricey as heck but nothing else keeps my thick, slightly coarse hair looking smooth and shiny, even if I wash my hair the night before and go to bed without blow-drying.  </li>
            <li>Previously I was buying this from various online stores but this price from Amazon ($60) beats everyone else by a wide margin, especially with free shipping.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend these products for black women</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have naturally kinky (not chemically processed) , African American hair, tight curls and all, and very DRY.  </li>
            <li> Quite a long way from the dry, depleted mane of &#x27;back then.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, straight hair, and I purchased this hoping it would help eliminate my split ends.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is not too thick but not thin either.</li>
            <li> The smell was not as intense, and the product was not as thick and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> As I am getting older and my hair is turning grey, it has only gotten worse.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and frizzy...</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit of shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Only trouble is I run out of treatment faster than the shampoo!</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers, there is a difference between the &amp;#34;Rich&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Ultra rich&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair - I usually leave a little of the conditioner in to keep my hair from getting completely frizzy.  </li>
            <li> The price for both is far less expensive than in the salon, and is less than Kerastase with similar results.  </li>
            <li> The sad thing is that I was using Paul Mitchells that cost twice as much as this at the time.</li>
            <li> Only complaint would be that it takes up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this would be the real thing</li>
            <li> husband has extremely oily hair and it dried his out also--</li>
            <li> The price is about half the retail price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little perfumey...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t put the body wash on the same shelf because these were so wide at the base.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that get frizzy with humidity.</li>
            <li> My daughter has wavy, thick, color treated hair that has sustained some damage</li>
            <li> My hair was rough and just felt like crap.</li>
            <li> Yes it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.  </li>
            <li> Expensive lesson.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product but sadly had to throw this expensive duo out!  </li>
            <li> I tried using other products, with horrible results.  </li>
            <li> I guess she was wrong!!</li>

            <li> I have fine hair and when I wash it it becomes a tangly mess.  Using this shampoo and conditioner along with the Kerasilk antifrizz serum has converted my hair to a smooth and frizz free texture. I feel like my hair is thickening up as well. I am amazed and love this. Yes it is a bit expensive. I hide it from the rest of my family.  I have also noticed it doesnt take that much product to do the job and that impresses me.  It is worth every penny in my book.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Stylist used this on my hair 5 years ago and I&#x27;ve continued ever since. Super for hair health, it has improved mine to where strangers compliment my hair! Quite a long way from the dry, depleted mane of &#x27;back then.&#x27; Pump size is handy and economical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set for several years to pamper my dry and overly fine hair.  It&#x27;s the first thing I found that actually works.  Previously I was buying this from various online stores but this price from Amazon ($60) beats everyone else by a wide margin, especially with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this would be the real thing however it makes my hair very soft and repairs heat damage.</li>
            <li> I love both of these products and love being able to purchase them in large quantities. This is a great buy!</li>
            <li> These are nice products but make sure you take a little break from them once in a while for best results.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! smells great and treats damaged hair. I almost lost faith in this product one I bought the smaller size but I am really happy with the ultra rich. Make sure you buy the Ultra Rich. There is a great difference between the two.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing shampoo and conditioner. My hair was rough and just felt like crap. The sad thing is that I was using Paul Mitchells that cost twice as much as this at the time. After switching to this, I felt my hair getting silky soft after 3 days. I will probably stick with this from now on. It is cheap, doesn&#x27;t smell fragrant (good since I am a guy), and makes my hair very soft. Only complaint would be that it takes up a lot of space. I couldn&#x27;t put the body wash on the same shelf because these were so wide at the base.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I had stopped using this product to try that cleansing conditioner you see on tv.  It ruined my hair so I order the Goldwell.  After just one use my hair is back to being shinny and soft.  I will never change aGaIn.  It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product but sadly had to throw this expensive duo out!  I developed a rash all over my back after using it about 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;The rash eventually went away, but I cannot recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have tried.  Smells terrific!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  It works so well on my color treated hair! It is one of the shampoos I just have to keep in stock.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have naturally kinky (not chemically processed) , African American hair, tight curls and all, and very DRY.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried that moisturizes and softens my hair and keeps it that way days after the treatment.  I highly recommend these products for black women and I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Found this product in Greece in 1981 and have never changed brands.  Great product and keeps our hair looking healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> Thought because it was Goldwell it was going to be an awesome product, but frankly it worked very similar to drugstore brands.  Not impressed at all.  Should have saved my money.</li>
            <li> My mother is been using the Shampoo and Conditioner for years and they stop selling it in Puerto Rico, thanks to amazon she can still enjoying this product</li>
            <li> I really like the Kerasilk line. It makes my hair so soft and shiny without weighing it down. This is probably my favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Best hair Shampoo and treatment for anyone. Bought this years ago from a salon and loved it, so when I found it on Amazon, I was very excited.. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, straight hair, and I purchased this hoping it would help eliminate my split ends. I feel it does make my hair shinier, stronger, and it allows me to easily brush my hair after showering (practically no tangles after use).  I like the smell and how this lasts awhile. After about a year of use, it seems like it has lessened the amount of split ends, but I still have a lot. I have tried many other products, and this has been the most effective so far. For now, I will continue to use this product and just deal with the split ends.</li>
            <li> Kerasilk shampoo and conditioner are great for dry, course or curly hair. The price is about half the retail price.</li>
            <li> My wife requested this order and loves it. We will order this product again. Shipping was quick and product was packaged very well to prevent damage and leakage</li>
            <li> These are pricey as heck but nothing else keeps my thick, slightly coarse hair looking smooth and shiny, even if I wash my hair the night before and go to bed without blow-drying.  Love the smell too.</li>
            <li> I used to love Goldwell products but stopped using them years ago after my hairdresser told me Goldwell went out of business....I guess she was wrong!! Having loved this before, I was delighted to find it again. Doesn&#x27;t seem to smooth my hair like it did in the past- has the formula changed? I&#x27;m just not seeing the &#x27;hair like silk&#x27; thing. Expensive lesson.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel so healthy. It is expensive but well worth the money. If you want silky smooth hair then i highly recommend this. My hair was very dry and frizzy...probably due to my flat iron, but this really makes your hair feel healthy again.</li>
            <li> I CONSISTENTLY BUY THESE PRODUCTS, THEY WORK VERY WELL FOR CURLY, COURSE HAIR.  YOU CAN LEAVE IN THE CONDITIONER FOR DAMAGED ENDS.</li>
            <li> This is a the best shampoo and conditioner on the market. Your hair is shiny, soft and tangle free after using this. Simply the best!</li>
            <li> I can get 8oz of this shampoo for $13 at CVS, and the treatment is even more expensive for 5oz.  Buying the duo is a great buy on Amazon!  Only trouble is I run out of treatment faster than the shampoo!</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews that commented on the smell. It actually doesn&#x27;t smell that good. However, I did notice a difference in the amount of frizz on the first day I used it. I love that the bottles are so big. The conditioner is not too thick but not thin either. I actually really like this stuff, but I have noticed that I cannot go more than 1 day between washes or my hair looks oily but without the frizz I might be willing to adjust. I have tried EVERYTHING and NOTHING has lessened the frizziness like Kerasil Ultra Rich.</li>
            <li> really cleans your hair and makes it shine nicely</li>
            <li> I like it because I can now protect my hair I arrived in good time and this very nice price  accsesible highly recommended thanks</li>
            <li> Even my husband likes it and he always said all shampoos and conditioner are the same. NOW he makes sure we don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product.  It makes my hair feel smooth and silky.  I love the pump top. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest shampoo and conditioning treatment in the world--honest!  Most hair products that say &amp;#34;Ultra Rich&amp;#34; -I have found do not differ from the regular line.  With Goldwell Kerisilk the &amp;#34;Ultra Rich&amp;#34; makes all! the difference in the world.  I ordered regular Goldwell Kerisilk, and thought that over the years the formula had been changed.  The smell was not as intense, and the product was not as thick and moisturizing.  I finally decided to order again in the &amp;#34;Ultra Rich&amp;#34; and yeah! - there was the product that makes this thick, wavy, sometimes frizzy hair behave nicely.  I do use an added conditioner-as my hair is sometimes out control when the weather is humid (which is most of the time in the south).  Paying a little extra for hair products that work is worth and keep my super long hair healthy is totally worth it -man :-0</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I replaced purology with this product and I am not disappointed.  I alternate this with Alterna recovery.</li>
            <li> The exact same quaity that I get at the salon. Makes my hair just as healthy as more expensive salno brands like Unite. Excellent price as well!</li>
            <li> I have very dry frizzy hair with too much volumn. As I am getting older and my hair is turning grey, it has only gotten worse. With Kerasilk Ultra Rich Shampoo and Treatment, my hair is now actually silky and manageable. I also use Kerasilk Instant Silk Fluid right after I towel dry it and leave it in. It&#x27;s the added touch of softness that my hair needs. I am very very happy with these hair products.</li>
            <li> We like this product because it takes care our problem with oily hair. In the past we had used others but we are now more happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Same shampoo that I remember back in the early 90&#x27;s.  I have long thick wavy hair - I usually leave a little of the conditioner in to keep my hair from getting completely frizzy.  I like the way it smells.  It&#x27;s a little perfumey...</li>
            <li> Like washing your hair with detergent&lt;br /&gt;I have always used very good shampoos-(all of which are 1/8 the price)&lt;br /&gt;just thought I would try these cause I got a goldwell keratin hair treatment&lt;br /&gt;and liked it --I thought this would maybe enhance the procedure&lt;br /&gt;but tried it twice and both times my hair came out like straw&lt;br /&gt;My husband has extremely oily hair and it dried his out also-- so it may be good&lt;br /&gt;for oily hair</li>
            <li> I love this product and continue to order it.  The price for both is far less expensive than in the salon, and is less than Kerastase with similar results.  I can always tell the difference in my hair when I am not using the Kerasilk.</li>
            <li> I have curly, color treated hair and it leaves my hair soft and silky.  I tried using other products, with horrible results.  This shampoo and cream rinse is the best.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo and conditioner I have used in over 8 years and will never switch. Works great, has a very light smell and the large bottles last a decent amount of time. Although quite a bit more expensive than many others, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that get frizzy with humidity. This products works. It makes my hair soft, smooth and super shiny. Love it.</li>
            <li> Packaging done very well.  Items perfect.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent but the bottles leaked causing quite a mess.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers, there is a difference between the &amp;#34;Rich&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Ultra rich&amp;#34;.  We love this product.  My daughter has wavy, thick, color treated hair that has sustained some damage and this product has been awesome.  Light scent, heavy conditioning, leaves her hair in great shape.  Highly recommend.  We have ordered this over and over.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair nice and full - Love this product!! You only need a little bit of shampoo. Totally recommend it</li>
