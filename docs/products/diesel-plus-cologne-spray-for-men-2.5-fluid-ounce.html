            <li>Bought this for my husband, didn&#x27;t know he could be even MORE irresistible.</li>
            <li>This product was ok for the price.</li>
            <li>Ok shipping, but originated across the country.  </li>
            <li>this is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>its more of a spring/ summer scent.</li>
            <li>but Diesel is okay in my book.</li>
            <li>I am more than please with a product I loved from the first sniff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>Its fragrance is very good, I enjoy this, I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;ve been able to solve the problem of the missing perfume.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the same great fragrance.</li>
            <li>I liked so much</li>
            <li>I can tell it is an original Diesel Fragrance</li>
            <li>This fragrance is definitely worth buying over and over again!</li>
            <li>excelente calidad 100% original muy buen aroma y precio se</li>
            <li>its light and sweet</li>
            <li>And it got to my house fast :).</li>
            <li>I am a mechanic, so I laugh and tell people when asked what it is and say...  &amp;#34;Its</li>
            <li>Not too powerful.</li>
            <li>but it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Diesel did well on this scent having a soft and sweet vibe but still kickin it with a strong mens aftertouch.</li>
            <li>I even had a few girls who even sniffed my jacket because they loved the unique smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;) I would recommend this fragrance, hot chick approved!</li>
            <li>Had this when i was in middle school and as soon as i opened it, it brought so many memories.</li>
            <li>A few sprays and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>This was my favorite cologne a few years ago so i was surprised to be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real head turner because most people can agree some of the most common colognes people wear are Armani,212,Curve, Eternity and</li>
            <li>I first bought this when I was in high school and since then, the ladies keep sticking to me like magnets</li>
            <li>My wife really like it.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this cologne to any guy who likes a reasonably priced and clean smelling product.</li>
            <li>The smell is really nice but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Nice everyday cologne!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for your services, no doubt I will use it again in the future as they are very responsible.</li>
            <li>Single guys will be married.. married guys will be divorced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that this cologne is not one of my favorite scents and is doesn&#x27;t last long but like I said for the price it is a steal!!</li>
            <li>I bought 2 for now but will hopefully purchase more before there is no more.</li>
            <li>Unlike many of the colognes I&#x27;ve seen lately.</li>
            <li>smells super smooth and fresh too bad is too small and scent faiths away to fast, is well worth it though</li>

            <li> Ive been looking for this at my local mall and other stores that carry fragrances. Diesel Plus Plus is a great smell at a bargain. Ive always received compliments when wearing it from both men and women. its very unfortunate that this line has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> love this scent on a man! also a really good price and therefor a good buy! i will defiantly order more.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if i got a bad bottle or if this is what the product smells like but is opens with the smell of rubbing alcohol. It dries down to a very sweet floral smell but its hard to get past the rubbing alcohol note. Also it doesn&#x27;t last long. Cant argue with the price but not worth it.</li>

            <li> excelente calidad 100% original muy buen aroma y precio se recomienda el vendedor precio acceible totalente nuevo sin usar se recomienda</li>
            <li> Diesel Plus Plus is one of my favorite colognes in my collection. Many have described as a milky scent not the spoiled kind. Diesel Plus Plus does last for an entire work/school day. I have received many compliments from friends at school who loved the cologne. I even had a few girls who even sniffed my jacket because they loved the unique smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this cologne to anyone. It&#x27;s a real head turner because most people can agree some of the most common colognes people wear are Armani,212,Curve, Eternity and it gets to the point in which you already can distinguish them apart when someone passes by you at the mall. However Diesel Plus Plus will make people dazzled</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, didn&#x27;t know he could be even MORE irresistible. ;) I would recommend this fragrance, hot chick approved!</li>
            <li> This product was ok for the price. The smell is really nice but doesn&#x27;t last very long. I do like the bottle design but very disappointed with how horrible it sprays which annoys the s*** out of me but it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love it one of a kind perfume very recommended and the service of fragrance zone is excellent defenitally recommended please ignore my first review</li>
            <li> bad product one came defective seal permufe dispenser is pushed sideways and out like embers not well sealed with no way to return will not believe me that the seal is defective happens perfumes amazon lords are coming I already have 2 bad bad experience with you perfume products going bad. I would like you to contact me or email evien of explanation of this problem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> This is a nice, clean scent, great for day time and night time. It&#x27;s not too strong. My wife really like it. I was nervous about buying fragrances online, but it turned out great. I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> smells super smooth and fresh too bad is too small and scent faiths away to fast, is well worth it though</li>
            <li> Ok shipping, but originated across the country.  Great packaging!  It took some time getting to the spray bottle lol.  Smelled great, not as good as the original but a scent of it&#x27;s own.  After some studying the bottle appears to be made out of some sort of ceramic, feels nice in the hand.</li>
            <li> Not a good smelling cologne. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Amazing as always on time and always a pleasure to deal with fast and always on time thank you for your great job</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite colognes. its light and sweet and it lasts all day. its more of a spring/ summer scent.</li>
