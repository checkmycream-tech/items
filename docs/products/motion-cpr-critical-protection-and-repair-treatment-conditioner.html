            <li>If mineral oil is so effective in such products, then why not just buy mineral oil and add your favorite fragrances; that is what most popular brands do.  </li>
            <li>I will order it again now that it is available from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve gone back to basics.</li>
            <li>The product left bits in my hair and it did not smell good.</li>
            <li>Since using this product my hair has grown tremendously.</li>
            <li>when i first started using this product my hair was going through breakage, it totally disappeared with CPR, it made my hair strong and full of life, this is really effective, i recommend people to use it monthly though,</li>
            <li>I suggest finding more natural products that will work FOR your hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>2 products that I love right now are the Pantene Pro-V medium-thick intensive restoration treatment and Neutrogena triple moisture deep recovery mask.</li>

            <li>It really conditions the hair and take away the dryness.</li>
            <li>Also one star off for the shipping costing as much as the product.  </li>
            <li>I remember reading my jars&#x27; label many times for the 15 herbs that were suppose to be in the product, but it never added to fifteen but less.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it if you are experiencing dryness and breakage.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use until it is all gone but return to the products I normally use.</li>
            <li>It soften new growth.</li>
            <li>I purchased some no name brand repair packet in the beauty supply store and it stopped my breakage completely</li>
            <li>My jars of this product had the old label, and I don&#x27;t think that the ingredient list has changed.  </li>
            <li>the ground seeds fall out and get in the sink and on everything near.</li>
            <li>My natural hair didn&#x27;t like this product.  </li>
            <li>so I completely lost track of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While using it, my hair does not dry out, it is manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>Actually I am WEN user and that makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>When I noticed breakage a few years back I started using it and the breakage stopped and my hair grew quickly.  </li>
            <li>but i used the whole tub over about a month and a half period and didn&#x27;t notice any change in my hair.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair plus the little beads/grit in it took multiple rinses to get out.</li>

            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy Asian hair, which is unusual for Asian hair, so I might need something else.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stop my breakage completely but it has slowed down.</li>
            <li> but it does contain quite a few seeds which end up taking extra time to rinse completely out.</li>
            <li> BUT I had to take off one star because when I use it, my hair seems sticky so when it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> This product contains what look like coarse ground black pepper or some type of ground up seeds.</li>
            <li> To me, this product and the entire Motions product line will not benefit hair or scalp but will make you waste both your time and money.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure for external purposes.  </li>
            <li> and I often do conditioner washes with it when my hair is especially dry (usually during the winter months).  </li>
            <li> Yes there are seed like things in it and it does take a few washes to come out.  </li>
            <li> It does leave almost a slick grease on it</li>
            <li> THIS INGREDIENT MEANS \\&quot;SUGAR FUNGUS\\&quot; AND ITS COMMON NAME IS BREWER&#x27;S YEAST.  </li>
            <li> My experience with this product was not effective in terms of providing moisture and improving the hair.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I haven&#x27;t bought another Motions item since returning the Motions marula oil product, which is not good at all.</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair that gets terribly tangled!  </li>
            <li> so when I straighten my hair it smokes really really bad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for awhile and my hair is growing. It really conditions the hair and take away the dryness.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after seeing it on some hair care forums.It didn&#x27;t stop my breakage completely but it has slowed down.I purchased some no name brand repair packet in the beauty supply store and it stopped my breakage completely so I will use that and this to control my breakage.It did leave my hair silky though.</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t changed at all with this treatment, I also dislike the herb flakes that get stuck in my hair. Smells good but wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. 2 products that I love right now are the Pantene Pro-V medium-thick intensive restoration treatment and Neutrogena triple moisture deep recovery mask. They make my hair super soft and glossy.</li>
            <li> when i first started using this product my hair was going through breakage, it totally disappeared with CPR, it made my hair strong and full of life, this is really effective, i recommend people to use it monthly though, cause it can leave you hair greasy as it is a deep treatment. Anytime you need to streghten your hair, use this, its great!</li>
            <li> hey i used to use this years ago. Just giving some free advice! I always used it as a PRE conditioner. To avoid being left with seeds in the hair u need to shampoo After. Then use a rinse. Hope this helps!  For more free hair tips subscribe to &lt;...&gt;</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair plus the little beads/grit in it took multiple rinses to get out. I could overlook the grit if i felt it did something for my hair but i used the whole tub over about a month and a half period and didn&#x27;t notice any change in my hair.</li>
            <li> Best corrective protection hair care system especially for extra deep conditioning when sitting under the hair dryer for an additional 20 mins with a shower cap on.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work when I use it once a week.  My hair doesn&#x27;t break, no split ends, and it seems shiny when I style it.  BUT I had to take off one star because when I use it, my hair seems sticky so when it&#x27;s dry and I run my fingers through, there&#x27;s a film of stuff on my hands.  I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s not meant for my hair type?  I have thick, coarse, wavy Asian hair, which is unusual for Asian hair, so I might need something else.  I will keep using it and see what happens.  Also one star off for the shipping costing as much as the product.  What&#x27;s up with that???</li>
            <li> Been using this product now for over 10-12 years and I always endorse it to my friends and people I meet. Since using this product my hair has grown tremendously. I  have always had growing hair but now my hair is in the middle of my back. People sometimes would ask me if I am wearing a weave. Try it! It should work for you.</li>
            <li> The product left bits in my hair and it did not smell good. It was okay for conditioning.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase from this seller but from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply store.  My jars of this product had the old label, and I don&#x27;t think that the ingredient list has changed.  Do you know that mineral oil is in this product?  I remember reading my jars&#x27; label many times for the 15 herbs that were suppose to be in the product, but it never added to fifteen but less.  There is also Saccharomyces yeast as an ingredient, and I assume this is one of the \\&quot;herbs\\&quot; listed.  THIS INGREDIENT MEANS \\&quot;SUGAR FUNGUS\\&quot; AND ITS COMMON NAME IS BREWER&#x27;S YEAST.  I know brewer&#x27;s yeast is eaten but I am not sure for external purposes.  My experience with this product was not effective in terms of providing moisture and improving the hair. Instead my scalp became red and irritated mid-way applying the product, and it took a while for the Motions&#x27; company to assist me with my experience.  To me, this product and the entire Motions product line will not benefit hair or scalp but will make you waste both your time and money.  If mineral oil is so effective in such products, then why not just buy mineral oil and add your favorite fragrances; that is what most popular brands do.  I suggest finding more natural products that will work FOR your hair and scalp.  Needless to say, I haven&#x27;t bought another Motions item since returning the Motions marula oil product, which is not good at all. Don&#x27;t believe the hype.</li>
            <li> This product contains what look like coarse ground black pepper or some type of ground up seeds. I can&#x27;t determine which of the ingredients this is. Anyway, after rinsing the conditioner out of my hair, I still have those ground seeds in my hair. I go to the vanity to comb out my hair and the ground seeds fall out and get in the sink and on everything near. It&#x27;s a day later and I am still combing out ground seeds.</li>
            <li> My natural hair didn&#x27;t like this product.  It worked better on my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Motion CPR Conditioner............would I buy it again - no, now let me explain. I think it is a nice conditioner but it does contain quite a few seeds which end up taking extra time to rinse completely out. I will continue to use until it is all gone but return to the products I normally use. Actually I am WEN user and that makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair conditioner. The product was delivered on time. I will order it again now that it is available from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing on my hair! I have mixed hair that gets terribly tangled!  It&#x27;s the only thing that gets it all cleaned out and not so frizzy! It does leave almost a slick grease on it so when I straighten my hair it smokes really really bad! Yes there are seed like things in it and it does take a few washes to come out.  That doesnt bother me as I just want my hair manageable.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner off and on for years and I often do conditioner washes with it when my hair is especially dry (usually during the winter months).  When I noticed breakage a few years back I started using it and the breakage stopped and my hair grew quickly.  While using it, my hair does not dry out, it is manageable and soft.  Highly recommend it if you are experiencing dryness and breakage.</li>
            <li> Another product that works magic on relaxed hair. It soften new growth. I sat under the dryer for 1 hour as I was reading so I completely lost track of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motions CPR will safe your hair from its damage. I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve gone back to basics. This product never disappoints. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and what it does for my relaxed hair and new growth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Supplier shipped in a timely manner.</li>
