            <li>I will purchase it in more colors!</li>
            <li>Lasts for more than a week!</li>
            <li>I love this CND Vinylux nail Polish lacquer,  </li>
            <li>the pic on Amazon makes it seems like a nice pinky-mauve color, great for just a natural but polished look.  </li>
            <li>My own fault for not looking and ordering the right shade!</li>
            <li>Great professional look that lasts more than a week.  </li>
            <li>Comes off easily with fingernail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>Easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>Very nice as a second coat on the lighter colors.</li>
            <li>Lovely soft color.  </li>
            <li>Love this polish, since it lasts for at least a week, make sure to buy the top coat, otherwise, it will chip</li>
            <li>should have checked it out at a store first, I guess.</li>
            <li>It has a nice pink tint and a bit of shimmer.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pleased overall.</li>
            <li>The color was much lighter and iridescent.</li>
            <li>I have received this Nail coat Manicure a time ago and it really don&#x27;t have scratches for a period of a 1 week.</li>
            <li>For this color I had her apply three coats, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t have shown much of a color at all.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t another polish claim to last a week - it is the real deal!!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a shiny saturated light pink and this didn&#x27;t do it at all</li>
            <li>I love the Vinylux polishes; they really do last two weeks, and I type all day long</li>
            <li>but I expected a light color to last longer.  </li>
            <li>I used the clear coat as instructed over the polish.</li>
            <li>This polish really does last a week!  </li>
            <li>So far, the polish has stayed on for three days and no chipping.</li>
            <li>and I think it helps to have it done professionally</li>
            <li>This is a pretty, soft pink with a frosted look.</li>
            <li>Not totally foolproof, but let&#x27;s manicure stay &amp;#34;whole&amp;#34; for full week to week and a half.</li>

            <li> Long lasting fingernail polish.  </li>
            <li> Polish dry in second</li>
            <li> Polish is actually a pearly sheer baby pink.  </li>
            <li> Coverage color shine and dry time</li>
            <li> too shear pink for me...</li>
            <li> I got this because it&#x27;s suppost to stay on nails longer than other polish.</li>
            <li> I was thinking pale pink...</li>
            <li> (and I had a lot) of my other fingernail polishes away!!  </li>
            <li> wears well but dried out my nails!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essentially a CLEAR polish - very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this color did not last a week.  </li>
            <li> Have eliminated expensive manicures.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have difficult nails?</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> wears well but dried out my nails!</li>
            <li> Great find for my splitting nails. Not totally foolproof, but let&#x27;s manicure stay &amp;#34;whole&amp;#34; for full week to week and a half.</li>
            <li> This polish really does last a week!  It arrived in perfect condition and very quickly!  I will purchase it in more colors!</li>
            <li> I love this CND Vinylux nail Polish lacquer,  This nail Polish dry in second and you can have a beautiful  nice nail for 7 days for sure.</li>
            <li> The color was much lighter and iridescent. Not what I thought it would be.  I would purchase again, but would choose a darker color.</li>
            <li> Great polish, was dissapointed in the color was all.  I purchased Strawberry Smoothie, the pic on Amazon makes it seems like a nice pinky-mauve color, great for just a natural but polished look.  Polish is actually a pearly sheer baby pink.  This picture of the polish here is the same from the CND site, but I found this that is a lot truer to the colors they actually come in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty shade, but wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.  My own fault for not looking and ordering the right shade!</li>
            <li> Long lasting fingernail polish.  Have eliminated expensive manicures. Comes off easily with fingernail polish remover.  Will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> Coverage color shine and dry time is great I would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I got this because it&#x27;s suppost to stay on nails longer than other polish. However, not on my nails. Maybe I just have difficult nails?</li>
            <li> unless you want a penalized polish this would not be for you I was looking for a shiny saturated light pink and this didn&#x27;t do it at all</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this color did not last a week.  Maybe I had my hands in water a lot but I expected a light color to last longer.  Will give another try.</li>
            <li> Gel will ruin your nails this will help you move forward and will last 6-7 days and simply remove with regular remover is seconds and start again- Waiting for the salons in my area to start using!</li>
            <li> too shear pink for me...</li>
            <li> Great professional look that lasts more than a week.  Lovely soft color.  Easy to remove.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product!! I gave all (and I had a lot) of my other fingernail polishes away!!  This isn&#x27;t another polish claim to last a week - it is the real deal!!  I used the clear coat as instructed over the polish. It came off using my regular remover too!  I LOVE it!!  Won&#x27;t use anything else!!</li>
            <li> CND vinylux strawberry smoothe nail polish. I like the color a lot but it seems like regular nail polish. It only lasts a couple of days on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essentially a CLEAR polish - very disappointing. I was thinking pale pink... should have checked it out at a store first, I guess.</li>
            <li> I have four colors from this line.  Strawberry Smoothe is sheer.  It has a nice pink tint and a bit of shimmer.  Very nice as a second coat on the lighter colors.</li>
            <li> I have been pleaseed with all vinylux products... They are great!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty, soft pink with a frosted look. It does last about a week, but you should wear gloves when cleaning or it will chip.</li>
            <li> Love this polish, since it lasts for at least a week, make sure to buy the top coat, otherwise, it will chip</li>
            <li> I have received this Nail coat Manicure a time ago and it really don&#x27;t have scratches for a period of a 1 week.</li>
            <li> Read the review of the product and decided to try this brand.  So far, the polish has stayed on for three days and no chipping.</li>
            <li> I love the Vinylux polishes; they really do last two weeks, and I type all day long (I&#x27;m a technical writer). I have my manicurist apply the polish and I think it helps to have it done professionally (don&#x27;t ask me why). For this color I had her apply three coats, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t have shown much of a color at all. But I&#x27;m pleased overall.</li>
            <li> Lasts for more than a week!</li>
