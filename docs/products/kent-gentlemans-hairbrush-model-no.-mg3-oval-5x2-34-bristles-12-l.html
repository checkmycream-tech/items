            <li>Great hair brush, worth the money</li>
            <li>Replaces my old favorite brush perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two for more than thirty years.</li>
            <li>Congratulations on  producing such excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will get better as the bristles soften some.  </li>
            <li>Who can do without the fancy packaging, just to bring the more favorable PF22.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely murder on bedhead, and it feels great on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I bought one from the Kent website a couple of years ago and it was much more than I paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this.</li>
            <li>It works for me when I&#x27;m wolfin/letting my hair grow for deeper more refined waves.</li>
            <li>finally wore out this is identical to the one that he had excellent brush!!!</li>
            <li>Outstanding quality.</li>
            <li>Top Quality.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves this brush, instant waves and gorgeous packaging!!</li>
            <li>but I can honestly say that the MG3 is worth the money if ur about grooming .</li>
            <li>It fits the hand well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, light brush, easily handled and the bristles have just the right level of stiffness.</li>
            <li>An excellent waste of money.</li>
            <li>The bristles of the brush Kent made from 100% genuine boar bristles treated.</li>
            <li>Great for my short hair.</li>
            <li>Massages and invigorates the scalp, gets rid of dandruff and feels great overall.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have the natural bore bristles I had in a Kent as a kid but its good.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about the brush.</li>
            <li>Kent is the oldest manufacturer and is therefore a symbol of the original, the premium product.</li>
            <li>for the care of recently and intended for the care of the scalp and massing and very suitable.</li>
            <li>Great military style gentleman&#x27;s hairbrush.</li>
            <li>If you look at the handsome catalog, which is already the practical difference between the many similar models consists wonders.</li>
            <li>I love my new brush.</li>
            <li>takes a little getting used to bristles but once you do makes your hair look great.</li>
            <li>Also, I bought it because everyone spoke of the high quality and they were not wrong, but now that I think about it, how much better can a $40 brush be compared to a $10 one?</li>
            <li>In the U.S., resourceful businessmen have the amazing care effect in the development of the related &#x27;wave brushes&#x27; umgem√ºnzt, eg The popular among African-Americans Caesar Brushes from CQP Crown Quality Products or the unbelievably low Diane Beauty brushes, made in China, sold by Fromm International, USA.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is the highest quality brush I have ever owned and is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>There are cheaper brushes that will keep your beard in fine shape, but with the levelm of prestige this brush imparts, I would expect it to be priced twice as high.</li>
            <li>The main difference lies in the price, which is controlled primarily on the size and type of wood.</li>
            <li>Just a good brush at a reasonable price, easy less than Bloomies but at least as good.  </li>
            <li>Searched for exactly this style and like it very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple nicer and better than the brushes I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li>I have used these brushed most of my life.</li>
            <li>The quality is evident.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with my purchase, my beard especially feels a lot softer.</li>
            <li>Comparable English brushes cost quite a bit more.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Classic, quality product made to last for years, worth the price many times over</li>
            <li>Who wants cheap bestseller buy the MG3 5  hail shop voucher on their website or paid in Pound directly on the manufacturer&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a brush for people who care about long term purchases and getting the most out of your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m keeping my (very cheap) old Phillips brush of the same style for finishing: the Phillips&#x27; soft bristles aren&#x27;t sufficient to reach the scalp or straighten out a mess but work great for smoothing.</li>
            <li>Who we are honest, not a special one.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s classy, very functional, and very, very well made!</li>
            <li>As you can see, there are no technological differences between all these similar models, and no model is better for a particular hair type better than the other.</li>
            <li>Very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>would b appreciated.</li>
            <li>What is the real difference between bucatini and macaroni?</li>
            <li>Since MG2 reminds me too much of shoe brushes, I opted for the MG3.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush.  </li>
            <li>#34;why would I/should I pay so much for a brush</li>
            <li>The brush is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Delivery was prompt and brush was better than expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the few vintage products I own and it was well worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li>Just felt it was time for a new one!</li>
            <li>MG2 is a classic, just as MG3.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t quite reach the scalp on the top of your head if you have thick, long hair on top, but it massages the scalp well otherwise.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying it it, and I suggest playing with it for a week if you are used to using whatever brush you found in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.....</li>
            <li>What a tradition in Solingen in Germany with worldwide reputation, the cutlery, which is in the UK including the production of high quality hair brushes.</li>
            <li>Not for styling, but for the care of hair and scalp, the Kent Men&#x27;s Finest are highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but this brush is definitely high quality.</li>
            <li>The brush is definitely a high quality brush.</li>
            <li>-not too short, firm bristles really combs through the hair nicely.</li>
            <li>While the handle has indentations to provide a finger hold, I found the indentations a bit too narrow for a really secure grip (I do not have particularly large hands).</li>
            <li>This brush seemed at first to be the same high quality Kent brush I&#x27;ve ordered over the years.  </li>
            <li>As I have never had this problem before, I wonder if there is some new process or element that has been added to the wood that is causing it to blacken.  </li>
            <li>Even tho this is new and I am just getting used to it</li>
            <li>, they now have a new customer for life.</li>
            <li>The brush is exactly what I wanted I bought the same brush for my husband probably 10 years ago</li>
            <li>The wood is solid and the bristles are very strong but not too stiff.</li>
            <li>This replaced my old Kent brush that was 27 years old.</li>
            <li>With my processed refund I decided to pay the extra $30 to try a real brush.</li>
            <li>When my 91 year old father asked for a brush like this for Christmas</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, all natural, unblemished, and quite comfortable even for thin hair and sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>After seeing one for as much as $90, I purchased this one, after all how long does a ninety-one year old&#x27;s hairbrush really have to last?!  </li>
            <li>CQP, Diane, or even cricket are entirely unknown, for this country, the traditional luxury brands from the UK more known, especially Denman on the European market (Northern Ireland, est.</li>
            <li>Although other models of Kent or Mason Pearson are again in a completely different price category, but I admit, it is unusual for the man to pay so much for a \\&quot;comb-replacement\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have pretty short hair (about 1 inch long) and the hairs get completely tangled in there and its really hard to clean.</li>
            <li>The brush is a little pricey but worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit in my travel bag.</li>
            <li>The rest is the aura and prestige to history, family tradition, brand image and specific direct service from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>That being said, a lot of the bristles come out after each use and this thing is really hard to clean.</li>
            <li>This brush can go deep and it massages your scalp at the same time bringing out the natural oils in your hair.  </li>
            <li>My army comrades have their copies ordered directly from the Kent website, because the international shipping fee is only 2 pounds.</li>
            <li>The same look as the MG2 and offers the same performance.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few days it settled down and now looks and feels fantastic.</li>

            <li> What a tradition in Solingen in Germany with worldwide reputation, the cutlery, which is in the UK including the production of high quality hair brushes.</li>
            <li> Not for styling, but for the care of hair and scalp, the Kent Men&#x27;s Finest are highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but this brush is definitely high quality.</li>
            <li> The brush is definitely a high quality brush.</li>
            <li> -not too short, firm bristles really combs through the hair nicely.</li>
            <li> While the handle has indentations to provide a finger hold, I found the indentations a bit too narrow for a really secure grip (I do not have particularly large hands).</li>
            <li> This brush seemed at first to be the same high quality Kent brush I&#x27;ve ordered over the years.  </li>
            <li> As I have never had this problem before, I wonder if there is some new process or element that has been added to the wood that is causing it to blacken.  </li>
            <li> Even tho this is new and I am just getting used to it</li>
            <li> , they now have a new customer for life.</li>
            <li> The brush is exactly what I wanted I bought the same brush for my husband probably 10 years ago</li>
            <li> The wood is solid and the bristles are very strong but not too stiff.</li>
            <li> This replaced my old Kent brush that was 27 years old.</li>
            <li> With my processed refund I decided to pay the extra $30 to try a real brush.</li>
            <li> When my 91 year old father asked for a brush like this for Christmas</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, all natural, unblemished, and quite comfortable even for thin hair and sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> After seeing one for as much as $90, I purchased this one, after all how long does a ninety-one year old&#x27;s hairbrush really have to last?!  </li>
            <li> CQP, Diane, or even cricket are entirely unknown, for this country, the traditional luxury brands from the UK more known, especially Denman on the European market (Northern Ireland, est.</li>
            <li> Although other models of Kent or Mason Pearson are again in a completely different price category, but I admit, it is unusual for the man to pay so much for a \\&quot;comb-replacement\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have pretty short hair (about 1 inch long) and the hairs get completely tangled in there and its really hard to clean.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little pricey but worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> The rest is the aura and prestige to history, family tradition, brand image and specific direct service from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> That being said, a lot of the bristles come out after each use and this thing is really hard to clean.</li>
            <li> This brush can go deep and it massages your scalp at the same time bringing out the natural oils in your hair.  </li>
            <li> My army comrades have their copies ordered directly from the Kent website, because the international shipping fee is only 2 pounds.</li>
            <li> The same look as the MG2 and offers the same performance.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>

            <li> so it covers a large area.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are tough and strong, and they don&#x27;t mash together when brushing my thick beard.</li>
            <li> Throughout Germany there is perhaps only next to hail Store 1-2 other distributors of the Kent men&#x27;s hair brush.</li>
            <li> PF22 comes along in a cheap plastic packaging, MG2/MG3 in these unnecessarily expensive exclusive gift boxes.</li>

            <li> No force needed to get my beard under control after a long sleep.&lt;br /&gt;The brush has weight.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it turns my short curly hair into a frizzball.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, totally overpriced.</li>
            <li> Unless I put off a haircut too long and not much can save me then anyway.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s difficult to justify spending so much on a hair brush, I bought this under the assumption that it will be the last brush I&#x27;ll need to buy for decades.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re waving you&#x27;d want a harder brush for when you&#x27;re wolfing.</li>
            <li> Here you have to delude myself, a military hairbrush is basically just a piece of wood</li>
            <li> All men with short hair or medium hair cut should know what they&#x27;re missing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush head minus the handle</li>
            <li> Harder bristles than I had expected, based on other Kent brushes I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> For me, a piece of white paper, a white sheet of paper and a finely sharpened ALDI pocket knife just as functional as an expensive SPYDERCO-knife and a flashlight ALDI just as functional as an expensive EagleTac flashlight.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great brush just as described</li>
            <li> I love my new brush. I had a Kent hair brush which, after about 40 years of daily use, was beginning to get a bit tired. The solid construction of this brush makes me think that it will outlast me.</li>
            <li> Just a good brush at a reasonable price, easy less than Bloomies but at least as good.  I&#x27;ve had two for more than thirty years.</li>
            <li> Kent is a maker of some of the world&#x27;s finest brushes since 1777. The brushes are still handmade in England. It is pricey, but these are natural bristles and a beechwood base, and once you get used to brushing with this shape, you will wonder why you ever used a long handled plastic brush. I found out it also comes in black bristles.</li>
            <li> Nice brush. Like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Replaces my old favorite brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> An excellent waste of money. There are cheaper brushes that will keep your beard in fine shape, but with the levelm of prestige this brush imparts, I would expect it to be priced twice as high.</li>
            <li> Mixture of bristles and some are too stiff for my head.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered. Very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This brush can go deep and it massages your scalp at the same time bringing out the natural oils in your hair.  Lost a few bristles, not complaining.  Yeah it costs a grip, but I haven&#x27;t found another brush that matches it.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about the brush. It is packaged wonderfully and feels \\&quot;quality\\&quot;, but my hair didn&#x27;t take to it at first. It didn&#x27;t look much different than any regular brush. (I have thick hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days it settled down and now looks and feels fantastic. I&#x27;ve also learned how to use it. Highly recommend buying it it, and I suggest playing with it for a week if you are used to using whatever brush you found in the bathroom.  I&#x27;ve stopped using hair holding products with this brush...Unless I put off a haircut too long and not much can save me then anyway.</li>
            <li> good quality brush,fine craftsmenship. takes a little getting used to bristles but once you do makes your hair look great.</li>
            <li> This brush seemed at first to be the same high quality Kent brush I&#x27;ve ordered over the years.  However when exposed to just a little moisture, the wood turned an ugly black !  As I have never had this problem before, I wonder if there is some new process or element that has been added to the wood that is causing it to blacken.  Any information would b appreciated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush. But it&#x27;s classy, very functional, and very, very well made! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I bought it for 360 waves and it works like a charm. I use it everyday. I&#x27;d consider this a medium brush. If you&#x27;re waving you&#x27;d want a harder brush for when you&#x27;re wolfing.</li>
            <li> Good brush in quality and wholeness of materials, bristles are a good length -not too short, firm bristles really combs through the hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Giving as a gift. One of several I have purchased over time.</li>
            <li> This replaced my old Kent brush that was 27 years old. Just felt it was time for a new one! A terrific mens brush for hair and beard.</li>
            <li> This brush is no better than a $3 walmart brush.  Not worth the money, totally overpriced.</li>
            <li> Beautiful quality with finger grips, attractive wood and  excellent quality bristles. Would highly recommend. My husband was very pleased with his Christmas gift. The best hair brush he has ever owned. Congratulations on  producing such excellent quality. Quality always appeals and sells. Would highly recommend.....</li>
            <li> The brush does not lay the hair down.  It actual acts like a comb, and raises the hair up.  Maybe it will get better as the bristles soften some.  Even if that happens, the brush is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> These gentlemen Kent hair brushes, also &#x27;military brushes&#x27; are called, to medium length hair of the head as well as side hair, facial hair, etc. for the care of recently and intended for the care of the scalp and massing and very suitable. In the U.S., resourceful businessmen have the amazing care effect in the development of the related &#x27;wave brushes&#x27; umgem√ºnzt, eg The popular among African-Americans Caesar Brushes from CQP Crown Quality Products or the unbelievably low Diane Beauty brushes, made in China, sold by Fromm International, USA. CQP, Diane, or even cricket are entirely unknown, for this country, the traditional luxury brands from the UK more known, especially Denman on the European market (Northern Ireland, est. in 1938.) Mason Pearson (est. 1885) and Kent ( England, est. 1777). Denman and Kent specializing in hair brushes are companies with centuries of tradition and experience and are among the world&#x27;s finest and Frisierprofis best on the market. The bristles of the brush Kent made from 100% genuine boar bristles treated. This workmanship has since been copied many times on all sides, boar bristle hair brush on base there&#x27;s even no-name factories from China at bargain prices. Kent is the oldest manufacturer and is therefore a symbol of the original, the premium product. If you look at the handsome catalog, which is already the practical difference between the many similar models consists wonders. The main difference lies in the price, which is controlled primarily on the size and type of wood. Bristle length and bristle softness is only marginally different. What is the real difference between bucatini and macaroni? Who we are honest, not a special one. A matter of taste, if at all. What is the difference between Kent and MG2, MG3? The bristle color, and that&#x27;s it. The difference between MG3 and Kent MC4? The size of the timber. The difference between Kent and MG2 MS23? The shape of the timber. The difference between Kent and MG2 PF22? The sales package. The difference between MG2 and Kent MN11? The type of wood. Etc. As you can see, there are no technological differences between all these similar models, and no model is better for a particular hair type better than the other. In the end it is a matter of taste Bzgl wood shape, wood, timber size, bristle color packaging. For me, a piece of white paper, a white sheet of paper and a finely sharpened ALDI pocket knife just as functional as an expensive SPYDERCO-knife and a flashlight ALDI just as functional as an expensive EagleTac flashlight. Here you have to delude myself, a military hairbrush is basically just a piece of wood the woman versions have a nice handle in the boar bristles have been machined. The rest is the aura and prestige to history, family tradition, brand image and specific direct service from the manufacturer. What a tradition in Solingen in Germany with worldwide reputation, the cutlery, which is in the UK including the production of high quality hair brushes. The best wine comes from France, the best pasta from Italy, the best cheese from Holland, the best chocolate from Switzerland, the best frit from Belgium, the best beer in Germany, the best beaches of Spain, and the best hair brushes precisely from England. Since the models are fairly equal in their performance, I taste no difference between Radeberger and Warsteiner, anyone can go to his personal criteria unimportant. Kent MG2 and MG3 have become classics, bestseller, probably because of the low price. More expensive types of wood are unnecessary luxury as I think it should not be for me. The official retail price for MG2 and MG3 Euronen is 32 or 20 pounds. My army comrades have their copies ordered directly from the Kent website, because the international shipping fee is only 2 pounds. My copy is from the hail shop, which also occurs on Amazon Marketplace as a seller. Throughout Germany there is perhaps only next to hail Store 1-2 other distributors of the Kent men&#x27;s hair brush. This already shows that in Germany this type is not used by Mr. brushes. On amazon uk and amazon usa thing already looks very different, which could also be related to the multiple nationalities of the Lord hair. Where in this country often a simple comb or bald enough, there must be bred to the different chiefs hold out just a brush. Not for styling, but for the care of hair and scalp, the Kent Men&#x27;s Finest are highly recommended. A treat, a delight. MG2 is a classic, just as MG3. Since MG2 reminds me too much of shoe brushes, I opted for the MG3. A Kent PF22 I have also risen because of the price difference. A noticeable difference between MG3 and PF22? No, no noteworthy. PF22 comes along in a cheap plastic packaging, MG2/MG3 in these unnecessarily expensive exclusive gift boxes. All men with short hair or medium hair cut should know what they&#x27;re missing. Of course, there&#x27;s also on amazon [[ASIN:B000EVGQ0S noname products D8114, D8167, D8157]], which offer a similar B√ºrstperformance, but they are not that much cheaper and caught it on the way, let the impossible portability, like a embarrassment. The Kent can be neatly stored, pocket, briefcase, gym bag, backpack, drawer box, car, and makes the test a magnificent flagship character. Since envy is on the opposite, no embarrassment. Who wants cheap bestseller buy the MG3 5  hail shop voucher on their website or paid in Pound directly on the manufacturer&#x27;s website. Great as a gift. Who can do without the fancy packaging, just to bring the more favorable PF22. The same look as the MG2 and offers the same performance.&lt;br /&gt;One point deduction for the then yet stately price. Although other models of Kent or Mason Pearson are again in a completely different price category, but I admit, it is unusual for the man to pay so much for a \\&quot;comb-replacement\\&quot;. Not for the Unbetuchten!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely murder on bedhead, and it feels great on my scalp. On the other hand, it turns my short curly hair into a frizzball. So, I&#x27;m keeping my (very cheap) old Phillips brush of the same style for finishing: the Phillips&#x27; soft bristles aren&#x27;t sufficient to reach the scalp or straighten out a mess but work great for smoothing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush as a replacement for one I received as a gift years ago and left in a hotel room. The brush is a little pricey but worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Just the best quality.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The entire Kent line is for those that are looking for the finest grooming products around.</li>
            <li> Even tho this is new and I am just getting used to it I really like the brush.  It fits the hand well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with mine. It&#x27;s a nice, light brush, easily handled and the bristles have just the right level of stiffness. It&#x27;s one of the few vintage products I own and it was well worth the extra expense. It&#x27;s simple nicer and better than the brushes I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> I have used these brushed most of my life. It is just what I prefer. I bought one from the Kent website a couple of years ago and it was much more than I paid on Amazon. I am really pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I know some people are looking at the price of this brush and asking &amp;#34;why would I/should I pay so much for a brush but I can honestly say that the MG3 is worth the money if ur about grooming . It works for me when I&#x27;m wolfin/letting my hair grow for deeper more refined waves.</li>
            <li> Great military style gentleman&#x27;s hairbrush. Travels well.</li>
            <li> within a month, the wooden base has already started to crack and turn black;  fits well in the hand and not too harsh on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;m 80.</li>
            <li> Nice feel in the hand, good quality wood handle, nice bristle, and works well in the mane.  Searched for exactly this style and like it very much.</li>
            <li> The quality is evident. Although it&#x27;s difficult to justify spending so much on a hair brush, I bought this under the assumption that it will be the last brush I&#x27;ll need to buy for decades. It won&#x27;t quite reach the scalp on the top of your head if you have thick, long hair on top, but it massages the scalp well otherwise. The bristles are firm, but they don&#x27;t feel like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> Highest quality. Been buying Kent products for 50 years...always the best!</li>
            <li> Great for my short hair. Massages and invigorates the scalp, gets rid of dandruff and feels great overall. Small enough to fit in my travel bag. Quality is typical Kent. Their shaving brush is the best in my collection and I have quite a few shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and keep this brush in my toiletry kit. It is the highest quality brush I have ever owned and is worth the price.  Solidly made it should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Very tough bristles but this brush is definitely high quality. Satisfied with my purchase, my beard especially feels a lot softer.</li>
            <li> The brush is exactly what I wanted I bought the same brush for my husband probably 10 years ago finally wore out this is identical to the one that he had excellent brush!!!</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold.  Outstanding quality. Very effective.  My wife - who has extremely thick hair - keeps borrowing it.  I may buy her one!</li>
            <li> The brush is the real deal. Was a birthday gift and he was very pleased with it. Does a great job on his hair &amp; is very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Top Quality. Exactly as described, all natural, unblemished, and quite comfortable even for thin hair and sensitive scalp. Would buy again good value. Comparable English brushes cost quite a bit more.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and brush was better than expected. Bristle don&#x27;t fall out and brush has a nice heft it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have the natural bore bristles I had in a Kent as a kid but its good.</li>
            <li> The brush is definitely a high quality brush. The wood is solid and the bristles are very strong but not too stiff. That being said, a lot of the bristles come out after each use and this thing is really hard to clean. I have pretty short hair (about 1 inch long) and the hairs get completely tangled in there and its really hard to clean. Also, I bought it because everyone spoke of the high quality and they were not wrong, but now that I think about it, how much better can a $40 brush be compared to a $10 one?</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap brush for beard grooming a month ago and ended up getting a refund because the quality was laughable and the bristles were plastic. With my processed refund I decided to pay the extra $30 to try a real brush. The difference in quality is obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is larger than expected. It&#x27;s a brush head minus the handle so it covers a large area.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are tough and strong, and they don&#x27;t mash together when brushing my thick beard. No force needed to get my beard under control after a long sleep.&lt;br /&gt;The brush has weight. You can feel this brush in your hand unlike like cheaper alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a brush for people who care about long term purchases and getting the most out of your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the moustache comb I&#x27;ve recently purchased from Kent and this brush, they now have a new customer for life.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush. It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It fell apart way too soon.</li>
            <li> Well built product with excellent bristles and sturdy wood handle. I subtracted one star because of the grip. While the handle has indentations to provide a finger hold, I found the indentations a bit too narrow for a really secure grip (I do not have particularly large hands).</li>
            <li> When my 91 year old father asked for a brush like this for Christmas I headed to Amazon.  I found that this type of hairbrush (no handle)  is sort of high-end...who knew?  After seeing one for as much as $90, I purchased this one, after all how long does a ninety-one year old&#x27;s hairbrush really have to last?!  The last one has lasted at least 40 years!  Dad was thrilled, and when I told him the price range of these type of brushes (yes, tacky. I know)  he joked that he&#x27;d have to leave it to someone in his will. Guess our family&#x27;s sense of humor is a bit irreverent, but our taste in quality hairbrushes is matchless!  Both Dad and I are very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used two Kent brushed, one for each hand, and just assumed they came as a pair, so was disappointed when only one arrived. I&#x27;ve had two previous sets over 60 years that were used daliy so I suspect this will be my last Kent purchase.</li>
            <li> Reliable quality in a hairbrush!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this brush, instant waves and gorgeous packaging!!</li>
            <li> Classic, quality product made to last for years, worth the price many times over</li>
            <li> Great hair brush, worth the money</li>
            <li> Kent brushes are the best I have found.  I have been buying them for over 30 years.  This was an extra brush I purchased for a travel kit.</li>
            <li> Unquestionably the best of its class.</li>
            <li> Harder bristles than I had expected, based on other Kent brushes I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> This hair brush is just what I was expecting. It is a very good quality brush and does the job well.</li>
