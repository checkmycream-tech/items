            <li>I&#x27;m  enjoying it, that&#x27;s  all I can  say.</li>
            <li>good price, doesnt tangle much, but it does frizz.</li>
            <li>which is why i rated this hair with only 3 stars, still beautiful hair, but the shedding bugs the heck out of me.</li>
            <li>Its Fine</li>
            <li>When I first received it, it was soft and beautiful, but after installation it was not.</li>
            <li>First when i got this hair, i fell in love..</li>
            <li>I really just love this hair</li>
            <li>If you cut it into a bob style it&#x27;s good but to wear it long</li>
            <li>i love is i was surprised.</li>
            <li>i love the way the natural curls looked.</li>
            <li>I think I may have liked the overall style/quality.</li>
            <li>The hair is great doesn&#x27;t tangle much and has very minimal</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 4 weeks and this hair is still soft and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>your better off with 10 synthetic hair from your local beauty supply store</li>
            <li>So the first couple days were ok but after a week ago it got really coarse and frizzy</li>
            <li>im pretty sure this isnt human hair...</li>
            <li>or so get nappy,wash it frequently silk and smooth</li>
            <li>was sooo messy, the 22inch looked amazing</li>
            <li>It tangles too much &amp; it sheds wayyyy too much.</li>
            <li>As much as u washed &amp; conditioned it Just like they said to do..</li>
            <li>this Is Really Upsetting</li>
            <li>Hair get nappy to much.</li>
            <li>Hair came right on time soo soft can&#x27;t wait to install it</li>
            <li>The hair doesnt hold any curl, it barely curls &amp; the hair shrinks tremendously.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good other than different colors and textures... for the price.</li>
            <li>Tangle way too much and the hair dry out to quickly..</li>
            <li>Washed it and didn&#x27;t comeback to its normal curl pattern.</li>
            <li>The hair sheds entirely too much, and the tangling is out of this world.</li>
            <li>The hair tangles, sheds, and gets very frizzy and is extremely coarse.</li>
            <li>I am going to cowash the hair and condition it to see if it returns to its natural pattern.</li>
            <li>The product really suck is not worth my money at all.</li>

The hair was shedding, matting, and burned while using heat up to 400F  I will never purchase this hair weave again. Worse experience ever in 16 doing hair in the beauty industry. No good refund policy on hair unless you return it. Return what I threw that nasty hair in the trash can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great hair. It tangles too much &amp; it sheds wayyyy too much. As much as u washed &amp; conditioned it Just like they said to do..</li>

            <li> still have the hair in...if you wash it let it air dry and use a leave in conditioner with some frizz control</li>
            <li> Hair came right on time soo soft can&#x27;t wait to install it I&#x27;m inloveeeee</li>

            <li> This couldn&#x27;t have been virgin hair!!! It matted up so badly! I wore it for like 3 or 4 weeks, I spent the last 2 weeks trying to oil and condition it so it would stop matting up</li>
            <li> Received the hair. Feels great. I am going to cowash the hair and condition it to see if it returns to its natural pattern. I will come back and do a 3 week review once I have installed the hair,</li>
            <li> Order the hair for my wedding day back in April 2014 by the week after my wedding I had to remove the hair! Tangle way too much and the hair dry out to quickly..never will order from them again!</li>

            <li> Bought the hair got it put in and from day one the shedding is so bad the hair gets real frizzy.or should say when I flat.ironed the hair it started burning the ends of the hair waste of my.money all the conditioners and leave in treatments and the hair doesn&#x27;t dye at all number one rule fake!!!be careful</li>
            <li> This hair is extremely frizzy and it sheds ALOT! Horrible! I would never purchase this hair again. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I Ordered my Hair 2weeks Ago &amp; I Still Don&#x27;t Have It ... this Is Really Upsetting BC Im Still Waiting After 2weeks</li>
            <li> I Love my hair . You just have to take real good care of it . Ive had my hair in a month now I washed it yesterday and its better than ever ! No sheding no tangling . Its real good hair for the price .</li>
            <li> It was terrible ! WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> Hair get nappy to much. After one week. Washed it and didn&#x27;t comeback to its normal curl pattern. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I done had this hair in my head for about 3 weeks now, and it&#x27;s some great hair. It still looks great, it curls and not a lot of shedding......</li>
            <li> I really just love this hair</li>
            <li> its some ok hair! good price, doesnt tangle much, but it does frizz. Not much shedding and it also has a beautiful texture. i like it.</li>
            <li> The worst hair I tryed don&#x27;t waste your money on it suck the quality and all I hate it it sheds n it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> This hair shed from the beginning. Had I sealed the wefts I think I may have liked the overall style/quality. That being said I did not seal the wefts and ended up with about 12 inches of hair. Too expensive for the quality.</li>
            <li> The hair is okay but it sheds a lot and gets dry . The bundles are not full and the ends are very thin.  If you cut it into a bob style it&#x27;s good but to wear it long it is a mess . You get what you paid off I guess</li>
            <li> ummmmm. ok what to say, ordered nov 9 at 2am recieved hair nov 10 around 10 am... got all three bundles however hair seems to be 3 different hair types the short one (20 inch) was sooo messy, the 22inch looked amazing and so did the 24 inch but the hair bundles were all 3 different colors and hair does not take same pattern after wash. but it&#x27;s good other than different colors and textures... for the price.</li>
            <li> I order the hair love it and after i put the hair in  my head i am so disappointed . the next day morning I started combing the hair it was coming out like crazy all over my bathroom now i am so sad because paying so much money for the and now this .</li>
            <li> So the first couple days were ok but after a week ago it got really coarse and frizzy im pretty sure this isnt human hair... But i guess its my fault for being cheap!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This hair did not come as described  in the description  it was four bundles  all the same length but was supposed  to be a 20.22.24inch it was very short and I will never buy this hair again</li>
            <li> with this type of hair,it depends on how you take care of it. Dont wash it for week or so get nappy,wash it frequently silk and smooth</li>
            <li> Ordered 3 bundles and received one. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Its Fine But It Tends To Get Thick And Shed Too Much</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve installed the hair , iv&#x27;e actually had it in for about 3 weeks . .  it sheds alot . I&#x27;ve also flat ironed it !! it the hair is great hair with the exception of the shedding !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  enjoying it, that&#x27;s  all I can  say. And,got it on time.</li>
