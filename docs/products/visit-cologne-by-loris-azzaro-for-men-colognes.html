            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The scent itself is great, which is why it&#x27;s even more of a bummer it doesn&#x27;t seem to stick for me.</li>
            <li>Personally, i love it!</li>
            <li>It surely lifts the confidence!</li>
            <li>I liked it at that time, I would advise to use in the winter</li>
            <li>Better than abercrombie and hollister and waaaaay better priced!</li>
            <li>Very light.</li>
            <li>My husband has been wearing Visit for over 5 years now and we both love it.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite man cologne.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years; makes head turn: too many hugs :).</li>
            <li>From the top, the bottle looks like a rounded wedge and the fragrance sprays from the rounded \\&quot;point\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Many may not smell that like I</li>
            <li>Many may not smell that like I</li>
            <li>Btoh my brother and husband love this.</li>
            <li>and we love how it smells on him....</li>
            <li>It got better and better as days passed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a better mood</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my brother and he was pleased with the scent of this cologne.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne a lot and also I got a pretty good deal on it</li>
            <li>Some people who have tried it say it is too strong</li>
            <li>$30.00 for a large bottle - and free shipping..!!</li>
            <li>at $20 I figured it wasn&#x27;t a huge risk.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a cheap thrill)</li>
            <li>therefore what might cause one inviduals nostrils to curl up in the fetal position and begin to sob uncontrollably might smell fantastic to someone else.</li>
            <li>arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li>this one, I honestly there is no thing I can complain about it, I really like it</li>
            <li>give Visit 4.43 stars, out of 5.It is under-rated in the cologne arena, a great value, and I definitely recommend adding it to your collection.</li>
            <li>I finally found it here and the price was great and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>but with the addition of \\&quot;pepper\\&quot;, is unique to Visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time i smelled this cologne, i don&#x27;t like it too much, but with the time i change my mind, and now is one of my favorite, for this price</li>
            <li>and it is a bit powerful at first</li>
            <li>This is strange for me as my first copy lasts more than 24 hours!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see it based on the picture, but the push button, which is more like a lever, for the bottle presses on the right, spraying the cologne out the left.</li>
            <li>A high class woods fragrance with a bit of a sweet note.</li>
            <li>Very similar to Gucci Rush for Men, a scent they&#x27;ve discontinued many years ago.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells even the next morning after he has been wearing it all day and night.  </li>
            <li>The first night I looked online</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously body chemistry may have something to do with it, but it&#x27;s something to be aware of.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, Azzaro Visit comes in a pretty nifty bottle.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered one for my BF</li>
            <li>first tried this cologne in a sample vile years ago.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume from Singapore and this was the first one i bought.</li>
            <li>First i didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>reviews generally consider the following areas that are important to me: appeal and uniqueness of the scent (i.e. easy on the nose); \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; (compliments), projection/sillage, longevity, appropriate season and event for fragrance; quality and/or uniqueness of bottle and packaging (i.e. easy on the eyes); and, the price/value of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not totally inclusive, my evaluation of Visit is as follows</li>
            <li>Yes, there are plenty of spicy fragrances out there, but Visit offers a blend of spice and woods that is cologne unique, yet not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a mild musk or spicy fragrance, with a unique back note of pepper, Azzaro&#x27;s Visit may be for you.  </li>
            <li>Cedar fresh and classic.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for more intimate and romantic encounters.</li>
            <li>so giving it a very high rating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always conservative when applying cologne because I don&#x27;t want to be &amp;#34;that guy&amp;#34; who is giving people headaches because of using too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for this one as much as the Pour Homme Night Time</li>
            <li>Visit is spicy; very spicy.</li>
            <li>The top notes are cardamom, nutmeg, pink pepper, ginger.</li>
            <li>:The real beauty of Visit is the price/value.</li>
            <li>Turned to be a pretty good replacement scent, but  I&#x27;ve encountered the same problem as a previous reviewer.</li>
            <li>Decent smell.  </li>
            <li>Now, some might not mind this, heck some may even like it, but for a fragrance that&#x27;s not marketed as a Gourmand (fragrance that is highly comprised of food based ingredients)</li>
            <li>, this was my first azzaro cologne but not the last.</li>
            <li>It has a smokey, woodsy, sexy smell to it, at least it does on him.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a mature smell.</li>
            <li>I used one spray directly onto my forearms about 20 minutes before my girlfriend came over.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s surely a long lasting fragrance, Bold and Masculine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a sharp woody scent when you first spray it, and a powdery finish that stays on you a while.</li>
            <li>But in general?</li>
            <li>A French man was near to me while i was on look out for perfume.</li>
            <li>I have used this perfume before and I loved it, but there is something wrong with the one I bought online!</li>
            <li>So now my boyfriend wears it everyday and still gets creeped out every time I smell his shirt and say \\&quot;Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!\\&quot; HAHA!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not expecting 24hrs from a $20 cologne, but tapping out in less than an hour seems very short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Initially I thought I may have used too much, but a little later I realized I could no longer smell it at all; I assumed I had just gotten used to the scent.</li>

            <li> He bought some a few years ago but it must have become too popular for stores which made me angry!</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s a little out of the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s tough with colognes as everyone&#x27;s nose and skin are different</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe there are genuinely bad colognes; just colognes that aren&#x27;t right for me.</li>

            <li> This cologne, unfortunately, had an effect closer to the former.</li>
            <li> Visit comes out of the bottle with notes of pepper and spice then settles into that amber, musky, and woodsy fragrance that is common -</li>
            <li> Secondary to the price, is the uniqueness of the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> but I did buy it blind in Marshalls, like all my colognes (probably not smart</li>
            <li> When I received a parcel from the bottle was half collapsed, I do not recommend !!!</li>
            <li> The middle notes of Visit are lebanese cedar, guaiac tree, incense and the base notes are gray amber and musk.</li>
            <li> When my girlfriend arrived she couldn&#x27;t smell it either, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> , it was merely to drive the point</li>
            <li> , it was merely to drive the point home.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I am disappointed.</li>

            <li> I have used this perfume before and I loved it, but there is something wrong with the one I bought online! I am not saying it is not genuine but it might be old, expired .... It smells like it should but it does not last at all. In 10 minutes it is gone. This is strange for me as my first copy lasts more than 24 hours! I will buy this anymore....</li>
            <li> Not quite cedar, but still smells great. Very light.</li>
            <li> I had this cologne when it came out in 2004 I liked it at that time, I would advise to use in the winter, I do not think it is for summer.</li>
            <li> El producto llego en las condiciones estipuladas por el vendedor, estoy muy satisfecho con la compra.</li>
            <li> Great woodsy scent. Very similar to Gucci Rush for Men, a scent they&#x27;ve discontinued many years ago. I&#x27;ve been searching for a replacement ever since! This is not exactly the same, but it will get you through the day. It&#x27;s got a sharp woody scent when you first spray it, and a powdery finish that stays on you a while. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good price, great product</li>
            <li> A high class woods fragrance with a bit of a sweet note. Definitely not for the younger crowd and certainly not for a more casual setting. I recommend this for more intimate and romantic encounters.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing Visit for over 5 years now and we both love it.  It has a smokey, woodsy, sexy smell to it, at least it does on him.  He says women compliment him on the scent often.  I love the way it smells even the next morning after he has been wearing it all day and night.  The problem is I don&#x27;t think Azzaro makes it anymore so I have to search for it online and buy up as much as possible when I do find it.  I wish they would start making it again.  Some people who have tried it say it is too strong and it is a bit powerful at first but it lingers for a long time. It is my favorite man cologne.</li>
            <li> I ordered visit cologne for my boyfriend for Christmas. He bought some a few years ago but it must have become too popular for stores which made me angry! It&#x27;s the best scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled ever. Better than abercrombie and hollister and waaaaay better priced! The first night I looked online it was sold out on every site but I finally found it on amazon a week later. Thank God it was the best price, too! Even if it was $50 I probably would have forked out the money. It&#x27;s amazing! So now my boyfriend wears it everyday and still gets creeped out every time I smell his shirt and say \\&quot;Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!\\&quot; HAHA!</li>
            <li> Great Great fragance!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years; makes head turn: too many hugs :). keep up the good work azzaro.</li>
            <li> When I received a parcel from the bottle was half collapsed, I do not recommend !!!</li>
            <li> I have had problems finding this product locally. I finally found it here and the price was great and shipping was quick. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is a nice fragrance, smells wonderfully and got many compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a mature smell. Personally, i love it!</li>
            <li> I believe this product has been discontinued but my fiancé loves it. So I was happy to have found it at this price.</li>
            <li> I was hunting for a replacement for Gucci&#x27;s Pour Homme I and heard this was a prime choice with a pronounced cedar scent. I was worried about buying a cologne I&#x27;d never smelled before but at $20 I figured it wasn&#x27;t a huge risk. Turned to be a pretty good replacement scent, but  I&#x27;ve encountered the same problem as a previous reviewer. The longevity of the cologne is a bit suspect. I&#x27;m always conservative when applying cologne because I don&#x27;t want to be &amp;#34;that guy&amp;#34; who is giving people headaches because of using too much. I used one spray directly onto my forearms about 20 minutes before my girlfriend came over. Initially I thought I may have used too much, but a little later I realized I could no longer smell it at all; I assumed I had just gotten used to the scent. When my girlfriend arrived she couldn&#x27;t smell it either, unfortunately. I&#x27;m not expecting 24hrs from a $20 cologne, but tapping out in less than an hour seems very short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously body chemistry may have something to do with it, but it&#x27;s something to be aware of. The scent itself is great, which is why it&#x27;s even more of a bummer it doesn&#x27;t seem to stick for me. Based on the other reviews it seems like your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Decent smell.  I don&#x27;t care for this one as much as the Pour Homme Night Time but I still get compliments from the ladies and the men ( which I prefer).</li>
            <li> How&#x27;s it going fellow Amazon Cologne connisuers? Now, I didn&#x27;t purchase this product through Amazon but I did buy it blind in Marshalls, like all my colognes (probably not smart but it&#x27;s a cheap thrill) and I have to say I am disappointed. This fragrance was not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s tough with colognes as everyone&#x27;s nose and skin are different therefore what might cause one inviduals nostrils to curl up in the fetal position and begin to sob uncontrollably might smell fantastic to someone else. This cologne, unfortunately, had an effect closer to the former. So am I outright going to say this is a \\&quot;Bad\\&quot; cologne? For me, yes. But in general? No probably not look at all the five star reviews. Keep that in mind while reading this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, Azzaro Visit comes in a pretty nifty bottle. The bottle has a blue tint and the sprayer is actually on the \\&quot;side\\&quot; so to speak. You can&#x27;t see it based on the picture, but the push button, which is more like a lever, for the bottle presses on the right, spraying the cologne out the left. From the top, the bottle looks like a rounded wedge and the fragrance sprays from the rounded \\&quot;point\\&quot;. It&#x27;s not the flashiest I&#x27;ve seen but it gets some points there. The sprayer mechamism works well and it&#x27;s a little out of the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the fragrance itself. Visit is spicy; very spicy. The top notes are cardamom, nutmeg, pink pepper, ginger. The middle notes of Visit are lebanese cedar, guaiac tree, incense and the base notes are gray amber and musk. What this note combination does, and I saw this on another fragrance website, is generate a smell virtually identical to that of Indian curry. When I read this my mind was blown because I then smelled the cologne again and it was spot on. This smells like curry. Now, some might not mind this, heck some may even like it, but for a fragrance that&#x27;s not marketed as a Gourmand (fragrance that is highly comprised of food based ingredients) you&#x27;d think someone dumped some soup from an Eastern restaurant into a cologne bottle. I just wasn&#x27;t a big fan of that smell. Again, that&#x27;s just what my nose detected. Many may not smell that like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit, when all was said and done, just wasn&#x27;t for me. I don&#x27;t believe there are genuinely bad colognes; just colognes that aren&#x27;t right for me. This one was not right for me. You may enjoy it who knows, but I do not recommend a blind buy unless it&#x27;s cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I do hope my fourth paragraph did not offend anyone. I had no intention of singling our certain cultures or tastes nor implying anything instrinsically negative about them, it was merely to drive the point home.p from an Eastern restaurant into a cologne bottle.

            <li> Btoh my brother and husband love this.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered one for my BF and we love how it smells on him....this one was for my brother.....and let me tell you...My brother LOVES it...he wants to wear this fragrance everyday and says that he is being complimented on the way he smells almost every day....  :-D</li>
            <li> I like it but the smell does not last that long on you</li>
            <li> first tried this cologne in a sample vile years ago. loved the smell. A great value for a 3.4 ounce bottle. very long lasting effect from just 2 sprays.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne a lot and also I got a pretty good deal on it so giving it a very high rating.</li>
            <li> arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li> Quick ship for an awesome Vday gift for the husband!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The first time i smelled this cologne, i don&#x27;t like it too much, but with the time i change my mind, and now is one of my favorite, for this price is a excelent choise, this was my first azzaro cologne but not the last.</li>
            <li> this one, I honestly there is no thing I can complain about it, I really like it</li>
            <li> Cedar fresh and classic.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume from Singapore and this was the first one i bought. A French man was near to me while i was on look out for perfume. He guided me to buy azzaro brand and told me about Visit. I tried it, it smelled good, so i purchased it. First i didn&#x27;t like it. It got better and better as days passed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s surely a long lasting fragrance, Bold and Masculine. It surely lifts the confidence! a better mood changer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my best buys!</li>
            <li> PERFECT... EVERYTHING..</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a mild musk or spicy fragrance, with a unique back note of pepper, Azzaro&#x27;s Visit may be for you.  Visit comes out of the bottle with notes of pepper and spice then settles into that amber, musky, and woodsy fragrance that is common - but with the addition of \\&quot;pepper\\&quot;, is unique to Visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reviews generally consider the following areas that are important to me: appeal and uniqueness of the scent (i.e. easy on the nose); \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; (compliments), projection/sillage, longevity, appropriate season and event for fragrance; quality and/or uniqueness of bottle and packaging (i.e. easy on the eyes); and, the price/value of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not totally inclusive, my evaluation of Visit is as follows (scoring is out of 5 stars - 1 star is low, 3 is average, and 5 stars is best):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appeal/Uniqueness of Scent: 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow Factor:  4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Projection: 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appropriate season/event for fragrance: 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality/design of bottle and packaging: 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price/Value: 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total Points:31 points&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Average Score: 4.43&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments:The real beauty of Visit is the price/value. For the money, it cannot be passed-up to add to your collection. $30.00 for a large bottle - and free shipping..!! Secondary to the price, is the uniqueness of the fragrance.  Yes, there are plenty of spicy fragrances out there, but Visit offers a blend of spice and woods that is cologne unique, yet not overbearing.  Visit also scores well with longevity.I am especially fond of applying a moderate amount of any fragrance in the morning prior to work and it lasting the day without reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Visit 4.43 stars, out of 5.It is under-rated in the cologne arena, a great value, and I definitely recommend adding it to your collection.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my brother and he was pleased with the scent of this cologne.</li>
