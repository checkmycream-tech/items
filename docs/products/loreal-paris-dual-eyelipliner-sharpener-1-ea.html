            <li>This sharpener is very good love it</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I purchased Benefit Eye Bright Pencil and knew I would need to sharpen it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since used it on eyeliners and my Eye Bright</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try with bright eyeshadow soon.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good quality sharpener and found this one at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Good condition.</li>
            <li>Good Quality.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>sharpens evenly, good job</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good quality sharpener and found this one at Amazon.</li>
            <li>This sharpener is good for the softer eye, lip and art pencils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy.  </li>
            <li>But I still can&#x27;t get a good point going.</li>
            <li>Great sharpener with a nice cover.</li>
            <li>Good value and it works as it should.  </li>
            <li>This one is not that good.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>

            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>This one is fantastic!!</li>
            <li>Love this sharpener!</li>
            <li>works amazing and</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing spectacular about it.</li>
            <li>well priced, sharpens nice.</li>
            <li>I feel so neat and tidy.</li>
            <li>Good price and love the cover that catches the shavings.</li>
            <li>Nice to have both sizes in one tool.</li>
            <li>Worth Buying it!!!</li>
            <li>- they are great tools and priced more cheaply than you will find in any cosmetic section of a store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with this one.</li>
            <li>It does a good job, but just not as fine as a point that</li>
            <li>I have many eye pencil sharpeners and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I would have to say very cheap.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I waited to buy this one.</li>
            <li>It is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the cover.</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this and will share with others..</li>
            <li>i love that is contains the shavings</li>
            <li>i am very happy with my order and will be buying again from you in the future.</li>
            <li>I purchased this not realizing I already had  this identical sharpener, but it does not  cause you to  over or under sharpen, and I have tried a multitude of pencils, with various circumference, so I would say it is a very good buy!</li>
            <li>A great sharpener with a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so glad with that purches.</li>
            <li>The sharpener contains a toothpick like cleaning tool to get out stubborn product tips that break off inside the sharpener - ingenious.  </li>
            <li>so much better then the pencil sharpener i was using</li>
            <li>Hopefully, it is better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SHARPENER</li>
            <li>:)))  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE the cover.</li>
            <li>Well made, and will transfer this to my makeup kit :)</li>
            <li>The big side is perfect for my NYX Jumbo eye Pencils and lip pencils.  </li>
            <li>This sharpener was ok.</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>Great price and shipped out so fast.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it has a cover which helps me get it out of my cosmetic case safely without worrying about scraping along the blades.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>If you love kohl this sharper is a must have.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again if I had to :)</li>
            <li>Sharpens quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>There is a better one that is cylinder and dual sharpened also since the eyeliner casings can fall out easily.</li>
            <li>This comes with a stick to clean it!</li>
            <li>if it wears off i will buy some more, they are really cheap.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit most sizes of my eye pencils.  </li>
            <li>good quality, really like it</li>
            <li>I was excited that I would be able to sharpen my pencils, but my thrill is waned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fits in my makeup bag and empties easily</li>
            <li>clogs up too easily resulting in the pencil head breaking</li>
            <li>Cover is easy to remove to dump the shavings.</li>
            <li>My most recent sharpener (made for no.2 pencils) just broke and I took a chance on this one - I&#x27;m happy to say it grips</li>
            <li>Does not plug up with pencil gel easily.</li>
            <li>Fits 2 sizes of pencils easily.  </li>
            <li>This sharpener easily sharpens the eye pencil to a fine tip without breaking.  </li>
            <li>This did the trick -- and perfectly (the pencils wouldn&#x27;t fit in other sharpeners).  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a cosmetic sharpener and this works fine with everything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, sharpens like it should, and it&#x27;s easy to empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it was super cheap!</li>
            <li>what a huge waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon had a fantastic price on this as well.</li>
            <li>I sharpened my pencils and it did a smooth job.</li>
            <li>Functional and cheap for the price paid.</li>
            <li>feels smooth when sharpening.</li>
            <li>I threw this in as a filler item to get free shipping</li>
            <li>This is my second sharpener, it works great to keep my eye pencils</li>
            <li>rivals sharpeners from chanel:) I would recomend it to anyone looking for an economical quality sharpener</li>
            <li>I currently am using it to sharpen fabric marking pencils and they are working great for this.</li>
            <li>fantastic pencil sharpener.</li>
            <li>I have tried many sharpeners for eyeliners from different makes and this is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li>don;t know why I did not get this earlier - it sharpens my pencil very effectively.</li>
            <li>So simple, so useful, works beautifully.</li>
            <li>AND, As if this creation needed to be more awesome, it even traps the shavings until I am ready to empty them into the trash!!!</li>
            <li>The shavings stay inside the sharpener, which is nice and not messy, and it&#x27;s easy to get the sharpener lid off to clean out the shavings.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s just me though</li>
            <li>but I bought this one for my husbands art pencils, the sharpener has a pick to clean it in case you have residue from the breakage if that happens.  </li>
            <li>Tried it the first time with some wide pencils,  very good sharpener.  </li>
            <li>It is super sharp and gets the pencils to a great point and doesn&#x27;t chew up the eyeliner like some of the cheap versions.</li>
            <li>It sharpens my pencils to a nice points and so far, I have not noticed any dulling of the blade.</li>
            <li>Thanks. :)</li>
            <li>In this modern age, no woman should be carrying around more than one sharpener.  </li>
            <li>Smaller than the picture (which is a good thing)</li>
            <li>and yet it does the job for two common size pencils perfectly.</li>
            <li>Left wood on pencil, didn&#x27;t make a good point.  </li>
            <li>Pencils didn&#x27;t fit right.  </li>
            <li>Great sharpener I have not had one pencil tip break off and it sharpens to a sharp point</li>
            <li>Happy it is equipped with a sharp blade.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sharpen my makeup pencils to a point, the tip is more rounded and dull, which isn&#x27;t all that great when I&#x27;m trying to do my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Works great, sharp, fast, easy to clean</li>
            <li>Adequate.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased that it fits the big pencil</li>
            <li>Every other pencil I own, is much better sharpened, though.</li>
            <li>this is super easy to clean (soak in water for a bit and scrub with old toothbrush) and it holds everything inside!</li>
            <li>I put my very soft eyeliner in the freezer first and got a nice point  for the first time.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best little sharpener I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using.</li>
            <li>This sharpener is good for either small(regular sized)pencils or larger pencils BUT does not put much of a point on the pencil once sharpened.</li>
            <li>I love the clear coverings over both that allows you to see what you are sharpening and you don&#x27;t over do it and breaking off the pencil.</li>
            <li>the price was well worth it.</li>
            <li>The tool falls out all the time, but I don&#x27;t want to lose it because it&#x27;s useful.</li>
            <li>This is as good as any sharpener I have found, however  I don&#x27;t think any of them sharpen as sharp as I would like.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a cover, which I somehow missed even though it&#x27;s right there in the title.</li>
            <li>And when I&#x27;m in a hurry don&#x27;t have to worry about finding a place for the sharpening bits right away.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected, good quality sharpener.  </li>
            <li>I think the blade may wear more quickly than my former sharpener.  </li>
            <li>and it wasnt very pricey ($3 not bad).</li>
            <li>It works great for the bigger eye shadow pencils and it&#x27;s convenient to have the smaller one as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, they shipped this product SUPER fast.</li>
            <li>At 2.50 this is a GREAT deal, considering Urban Decay charges ten bucks for the sharpener they produce</li>
            <li>LoVe it,super dhart and smooth and for a cheaper price than other brands.</li>
            <li>This is a good replacement; only good because some other sharpeners have an adapter that allows regular, large and JUMBO makeup pencils to be sharpened using ONE sharpener!</li>
            <li>but it fits most of my larger pencils, which is definetly a plus.  </li>
            <li>I saw this one after I had order a different dual sharpener from another company for $2 more than I paid for this one</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>One of the better sharpeners I have tried, and I must have about 8 different sharpeners.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it if this is the (maximum) price you&#x27;re willing to pay.</li>
            <li>Which I really like!</li>
            <li>This broke after first use.  </li>
            <li>I love how it has two different sizes</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a sharpener with an extra-extra large opening, and this one is just a normal large and small opening, so it didn&#x27;t quite fit the bill, but it&#x27;s still a good sharpener.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>The clear cover creates a clean sharpening experience that you can view through</li>
            <li>The sharpening process went much smoother with this&amp;it really saves your pencils!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that could rally Sharp my eyeliner venci√≥ and this is the right sharpener love it</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to easily sharpen my NYX Push Up Bra (chubby) eye pencil (and I have a collection of sharpeners that LOOK large enough but aren&#x27;t).</li>
            <li>Love that it not only holds the shavings but also the clear covers can be removed from both sides for ease in removing the shavings!</li>
            <li>It works great for the big or the little one.</li>
            <li>Keeps my make-up drawer clean and stays sharp to keep my eye liner clean and &#x27;on point&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Could be cheaper.</li>
            <li>does not sharpen my pencils very well.</li>
            <li>Really like this sharpener.  </li>
            <li>It sharpens really well.  </li>
            <li>Ironically, I bought it to sharpen the intense liner by loreal</li>
            <li>Does its job very well.</li>
            <li>And modern.</li>
            <li>It sharpens and Amazon wants a tome.</li>
            <li>Shared my pencils really well.  </li>
            <li>I dont use it very often but it works well..</li>
            <li>It came fast like i had planned</li>
            <li>It is exactly that, nothing more and nothing less.</li>
            <li>So much better than any other eye pencil brand I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a sharpener for my urban decay eyeliner pencils (when you shell out $18 for eyeliner you want to have the right sharpener!)</li>
            <li>Nice product; hold the shavings well - but does not fit my jumbo eye pencil!</li>
            <li>I soon had to throw this out and get something different and better (which was actually cheaper), that I like much</li>
            <li>Thanks to this ingenious little invention</li>
            <li>/&gt;Holds the shavings well, and easy to empty.</li>
            <li>Easy to empty.  </li>
            <li>Considering that I use different brands, everything so far has fit in the holes</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S WAYYY BETTER THAN THE WET N WILD SHARPENER</li>
            <li>Overall, good product for just a few dollars.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i expected -- love the two different sizes..</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp, and it&#x27;s clearly well made, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but I wish the sizing had been better thought out...</li>
            <li>Works well with more narrow pencil liners and wider too.</li>
            <li>Order a few of these to have around wherever you find yourself applying makeup :).</li>
            <li>The two sizes fit most pencils, and the angle of the sharpener does mot waste your pencil, but produces a sharp point.</li>
            <li>The size fits my pencils just right unlike the one I got at the local store.</li>
            <li>and I do miss the little protective covers that went over the pencil holes on the old model, they kept everything self contained so you could throw it in your makeup bag with no worries :)</li>
            <li>i wanted something i could keep in my new makeup bag that wouldn&#x27;t get eyeliner everywhere.</li>
            <li>Nothing new.</li>
            <li>Got this new sharpener a couple of days ago</li>
            <li>It sharpens the smaller pencils kind of jagged and uneven</li>
            <li>i just can&#x27;t seem to get the top open to empty it.  </li>
            <li>the vast majority of my pencils fall right in between these 2 sizes, unexpectedly.</li>
            <li>They are exactly a like just have different company logo.</li>
            <li>This cleaning tool stores in a little slot and can be pulled out easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;and was super excited to find that this sharpener works so well to sharpen those as well, which apparently people complain about how hard they are to sharpen but this sharpener worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>This sharpener has a cover and keeps the shavings inside, no mess!</li>
            <li>Sharpens my urban decay large lip pencils well.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a sharpener large enough for Sandra Kashuk chunky lip crayon</li>
            <li>These use the same blades as high end sharpeners from high end cosmetic counters like NARS....</li>
            <li>Right now it is sitting in my dressing table with a gold eyeliner and pink lip liner smeared together on the inside creating a huge mess.  </li>
            <li>It also has a clear cover so the shavings don&#x27;t get everywhere.  </li>
            <li>It is very convenient, I can empty it when I am ready to.</li>
            <li>I bought the Dual Sharpener with Clear Cover in order to have a sharpener for both my pencils and crayons that didn&#x27;t get shavings everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made a mistake not getting this sooner for my loreal pencils, it makes a difference in sharpening as opposed to using any old cosmetic sharpener you already have.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so soft, even this sharpener causes it to break off.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace the sharpener I had for nearly a decade.</li>
            <li>The plastic cover on the sharpener was completely shattered.</li>
            <li>This sharpener will bring all your old pencils to life again.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work really well</li>
            <li>Also, you really shouldn&#x27;t be using the same product to sharpen both eye and lip products.</li>
            <li>No more shavings in my makeup drawer! :)</li>
            <li>The blades were sharp, didn&#x27;t keep breaking the lead as it was sharpening, love the fact that there&#x27;s two different sizes, and the cover to catch the shavings was an extra bonus.</li>
            <li>It event has a little tool attachment to clean out excess liner from the blade.</li>
            <li>The small sharpener is too small for most of my cosmetic pencils, and the large one is bordering on too large...</li>
            <li>Hard to clean!</li>
            <li>I have been using an old L&#x27;Oreal sharpener for way too long (10+ years) and should have changed it out MUCH sooner.</li>
            <li>but it also has two different size pencil sharperners that provide a clean sharp pencil after use.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it has a smaller and a bigger sharpener, but after a few uses it mostly breaks the pencils wood, instead of sharpening them.</li>
            <li>The cover is cool, it grabs the shavings and minimizes mess!</li>
            <li>I have a tiny little wand that came with another sharpener I had to clean that one out</li>
            <li>I think the MAC eyeliners have changed since I bought them last, because my old sharpener (Beautique 711011) no longer works with it.  </li>
            <li>Another plus, cap actually stays in place &#x3D; no messy shavings.</li>
            <li>For the first time in 2 weeks I&#x27;ve finally found a sharpener that really works, I didn&#x27;t think something on Amazon would be any different from the drugstore sharpeners I&#x27;ve tried, but this one is very sharp and works on my big pencils, which is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Love the sharpener, but was hoping that the larger sharpening opening would accommodate a lip pencil I had, alas...</li>
            <li>Put it back together for the most part, but the little pick wouldn&#x27;t stay in its little tunnel pocket thing.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well, but within a few weeks, the sharpener fell apart.</li>
            <li>It has no real fancy features, besides the hinged clear lid that trips your trimmings.</li>

            <li> I purchased this because I purchased Benefit Eye Bright Pencil and knew I would need to sharpen it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since used it on eyeliners and my Eye Bright</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try with bright eyeshadow soon.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good quality sharpener and found this one at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good condition.</li>
            <li> Good Quality.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> sharpens evenly, good job</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good quality sharpener and found this one at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This sharpener is good for the softer eye, lip and art pencils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good buy.  </li>
            <li> But I still can&#x27;t get a good point going.</li>
            <li> Great sharpener with a nice cover.</li>
            <li> Good value and it works as it should.  </li>
            <li> This one is not that good.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal dual sharpener is perfect for sharpening jumbo &amp; slim liner pencils and the price was right.</li>
            <li> love this sharpener!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> This one is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Love this sharpener!</li>
            <li> works amazing and</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing spectacular about it.</li>
            <li> well priced, sharpens nice.</li>
            <li> I feel so neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> Good price and love the cover that catches the shavings.</li>
            <li> Nice to have both sizes in one tool.</li>
            <li> Worth Buying it!!!</li>
            <li> - they are great tools and priced more cheaply than you will find in any cosmetic section of a store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy with this one.</li>
            <li> It does a good job, but just not as fine as a point that</li>
            <li> I have many eye pencil sharpeners and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I would have to say very cheap.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I waited to buy this one.</li>
            <li> It is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the cover.</li>
            <li> It is okay.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this and will share with others..</li>
            <li> i love that is contains the shavings</li>
            <li> i am very happy with my order and will be buying again from you in the future.</li>
            <li> I purchased this not realizing I already had  this identical sharpener, but it does not  cause you to  over or under sharpen, and I have tried a multitude of pencils, with various circumference, so I would say it is a very good buy!</li>
            <li> A great sharpener with a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so glad with that purches.</li>
            <li> The sharpener contains a toothpick like cleaning tool to get out stubborn product tips that break off inside the sharpener - ingenious.  </li>
            <li> so much better then the pencil sharpener i was using</li>
            <li> Hopefully, it is better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SHARPENER</li>
            <li> :)))  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE the cover.</li>
            <li> Well made, and will transfer this to my makeup kit :)</li>
            <li> The big side is perfect for my NYX Jumbo eye Pencils and lip pencils.  </li>
            <li> This sharpener was ok.</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> Great price and shipped out so fast.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has a cover which helps me get it out of my cosmetic case safely without worrying about scraping along the blades.</li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> If you love kohl this sharper is a must have.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again if I had to :)</li>
            <li> Sharpens quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> There is a better one that is cylinder and dual sharpened also since the eyeliner casings can fall out easily.</li>
            <li> This comes with a stick to clean it!</li>
            <li> if it wears off i will buy some more, they are really cheap.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit most sizes of my eye pencils.  </li>
            <li> good quality, really like it</li>
            <li> I was excited that I would be able to sharpen my pencils, but my thrill is waned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fits in my makeup bag and empties easily</li>
            <li> clogs up too easily resulting in the pencil head breaking</li>
            <li> Cover is easy to remove to dump the shavings.</li>
            <li> My most recent sharpener (made for no.2 pencils) just broke and I took a chance on this one - I&#x27;m happy to say it grips</li>
            <li> Does not plug up with pencil gel easily.</li>
            <li> Fits 2 sizes of pencils easily.  </li>
            <li> This sharpener easily sharpens the eye pencil to a fine tip without breaking.  </li>
            <li> This did the trick -- and perfectly (the pencils wouldn&#x27;t fit in other sharpeners).  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for a cosmetic sharpener and this works fine with everything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, sharpens like it should, and it&#x27;s easy to empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it was super cheap!</li>
            <li> what a huge waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon had a fantastic price on this as well.</li>
            <li> I sharpened my pencils and it did a smooth job.</li>
            <li> Functional and cheap for the price paid.</li>
            <li> feels smooth when sharpening.</li>
            <li> I threw this in as a filler item to get free shipping</li>
            <li> This is my second sharpener, it works great to keep my eye pencils</li>
            <li> rivals sharpeners from chanel:) I would recomend it to anyone looking for an economical quality sharpener</li>
            <li> I currently am using it to sharpen fabric marking pencils and they are working great for this.</li>
            <li> fantastic pencil sharpener.</li>
            <li> I have tried many sharpeners for eyeliners from different makes and this is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li> don;t know why I did not get this earlier - it sharpens my pencil very effectively.</li>
            <li> So simple, so useful, works beautifully.</li>
            <li> AND, As if this creation needed to be more awesome, it even traps the shavings until I am ready to empty them into the trash!!!</li>
            <li> The shavings stay inside the sharpener, which is nice and not messy, and it&#x27;s easy to get the sharpener lid off to clean out the shavings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s just me though</li>
            <li> but I bought this one for my husbands art pencils, the sharpener has a pick to clean it in case you have residue from the breakage if that happens.  </li>
            <li> Tried it the first time with some wide pencils,  very good sharpener.  </li>
            <li> It is super sharp and gets the pencils to a great point and doesn&#x27;t chew up the eyeliner like some of the cheap versions.</li>
            <li> It sharpens my pencils to a nice points and so far, I have not noticed any dulling of the blade.</li>
            <li> Thanks. :)</li>
            <li> In this modern age, no woman should be carrying around more than one sharpener.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than the picture (which is a good thing)</li>
            <li> and yet it does the job for two common size pencils perfectly.</li>
            <li> Left wood on pencil, didn&#x27;t make a good point.  </li>
            <li> Pencils didn&#x27;t fit right.  </li>
            <li> Great sharpener I have not had one pencil tip break off and it sharpens to a sharp point</li>
            <li> Happy it is equipped with a sharp blade.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sharpen my makeup pencils to a point, the tip is more rounded and dull, which isn&#x27;t all that great when I&#x27;m trying to do my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Works great, sharp, fast, easy to clean</li>
            <li> Adequate.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased that it fits the big pencil</li>
            <li> Every other pencil I own, is much better sharpened, though.</li>
            <li> this is super easy to clean (soak in water for a bit and scrub with old toothbrush) and it holds everything inside!</li>
            <li> I put my very soft eyeliner in the freezer first and got a nice point  for the first time.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best little sharpener I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using.</li>
            <li> This sharpener is good for either small(regular sized)pencils or larger pencils BUT does not put much of a point on the pencil once sharpened.</li>
            <li> I love the clear coverings over both that allows you to see what you are sharpening and you don&#x27;t over do it and breaking off the pencil.</li>
            <li> the price was well worth it.</li>
            <li> The tool falls out all the time, but I don&#x27;t want to lose it because it&#x27;s useful.</li>
            <li> This is as good as any sharpener I have found, however  I don&#x27;t think any of them sharpen as sharp as I would like.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a cover, which I somehow missed even though it&#x27;s right there in the title.</li>
            <li> And when I&#x27;m in a hurry don&#x27;t have to worry about finding a place for the sharpening bits right away.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected, good quality sharpener.  </li>
            <li> I think the blade may wear more quickly than my former sharpener.  </li>
            <li> and it wasnt very pricey ($3 not bad).</li>
            <li> It works great for the bigger eye shadow pencils and it&#x27;s convenient to have the smaller one as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, they shipped this product SUPER fast.</li>
            <li> At 2.50 this is a GREAT deal, considering Urban Decay charges ten bucks for the sharpener they produce</li>
            <li> LoVe it,super dhart and smooth and for a cheaper price than other brands.</li>
            <li> This is a good replacement; only good because some other sharpeners have an adapter that allows regular, large and JUMBO makeup pencils to be sharpened using ONE sharpener!</li>
            <li> but it fits most of my larger pencils, which is definetly a plus.  </li>
            <li> I saw this one after I had order a different dual sharpener from another company for $2 more than I paid for this one</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> One of the better sharpeners I have tried, and I must have about 8 different sharpeners.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it if this is the (maximum) price you&#x27;re willing to pay.</li>
            <li> Which I really like!</li>
            <li> This broke after first use.  </li>
            <li> I love how it has two different sizes</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a sharpener with an extra-extra large opening, and this one is just a normal large and small opening, so it didn&#x27;t quite fit the bill, but it&#x27;s still a good sharpener.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> The clear cover creates a clean sharpening experience that you can view through</li>
            <li> The sharpening process went much smoother with this&amp;it really saves your pencils!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that could rally Sharp my eyeliner venci√≥ and this is the right sharpener love it</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to easily sharpen my NYX Push Up Bra (chubby) eye pencil (and I have a collection of sharpeners that LOOK large enough but aren&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> Love that it not only holds the shavings but also the clear covers can be removed from both sides for ease in removing the shavings!</li>
            <li> It works great for the big or the little one.</li>
            <li> Keeps my make-up drawer clean and stays sharp to keep my eye liner clean and &#x27;on point&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Could be cheaper.</li>
            <li> does not sharpen my pencils very well.</li>
            <li> Really like this sharpener.  </li>
            <li> It sharpens really well.  </li>
            <li> Ironically, I bought it to sharpen the intense liner by loreal</li>
            <li> Does its job very well.</li>
            <li> And modern.</li>
            <li> It sharpens and Amazon wants a tome.</li>
            <li> Shared my pencils really well.  </li>
            <li> I dont use it very often but it works well..</li>
            <li> It came fast like i had planned</li>
            <li> It is exactly that, nothing more and nothing less.</li>
            <li> So much better than any other eye pencil brand I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a sharpener for my urban decay eyeliner pencils (when you shell out $18 for eyeliner you want to have the right sharpener!)</li>
            <li> Nice product; hold the shavings well - but does not fit my jumbo eye pencil!</li>
            <li> I soon had to throw this out and get something different and better (which was actually cheaper), that I like much</li>
            <li> Thanks to this ingenious little invention</li>
            <li> /&gt;Holds the shavings well, and easy to empty.</li>
            <li> Easy to empty.  </li>
            <li> Considering that I use different brands, everything so far has fit in the holes</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S WAYYY BETTER THAN THE WET N WILD SHARPENER</li>
            <li> Overall, good product for just a few dollars.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i expected -- love the two different sizes..</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, and it&#x27;s clearly well made, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but I wish the sizing had been better thought out...</li>
            <li> Works well with more narrow pencil liners and wider too.</li>
            <li> Order a few of these to have around wherever you find yourself applying makeup :).</li>
            <li> The two sizes fit most pencils, and the angle of the sharpener does mot waste your pencil, but produces a sharp point.</li>
            <li> The size fits my pencils just right unlike the one I got at the local store.</li>
            <li> and I do miss the little protective covers that went over the pencil holes on the old model, they kept everything self contained so you could throw it in your makeup bag with no worries :)</li>
            <li> i wanted something i could keep in my new makeup bag that wouldn&#x27;t get eyeliner everywhere.</li>
            <li> Nothing new.</li>
            <li> Got this new sharpener a couple of days ago</li>
            <li> It sharpens the smaller pencils kind of jagged and uneven</li>
            <li> i just can&#x27;t seem to get the top open to empty it.  </li>
            <li> the vast majority of my pencils fall right in between these 2 sizes, unexpectedly.</li>
            <li> They are exactly a like just have different company logo.</li>
            <li> This cleaning tool stores in a little slot and can be pulled out easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;and was super excited to find that this sharpener works so well to sharpen those as well, which apparently people complain about how hard they are to sharpen but this sharpener worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> This sharpener has a cover and keeps the shavings inside, no mess!</li>
            <li> Sharpens my urban decay large lip pencils well.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a sharpener large enough for Sandra Kashuk chunky lip crayon</li>
            <li> These use the same blades as high end sharpeners from high end cosmetic counters like NARS....</li>
            <li> Right now it is sitting in my dressing table with a gold eyeliner and pink lip liner smeared together on the inside creating a huge mess.  </li>
            <li> It also has a clear cover so the shavings don&#x27;t get everywhere.  </li>
            <li> It is very convenient, I can empty it when I am ready to.</li>
            <li> I bought the Dual Sharpener with Clear Cover in order to have a sharpener for both my pencils and crayons that didn&#x27;t get shavings everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made a mistake not getting this sooner for my loreal pencils, it makes a difference in sharpening as opposed to using any old cosmetic sharpener you already have.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so soft, even this sharpener causes it to break off.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the sharpener I had for nearly a decade.</li>
            <li> The plastic cover on the sharpener was completely shattered.</li>
            <li> This sharpener will bring all your old pencils to life again.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work really well</li>
            <li> Also, you really shouldn&#x27;t be using the same product to sharpen both eye and lip products.</li>
            <li> No more shavings in my makeup drawer! :)</li>
            <li> The blades were sharp, didn&#x27;t keep breaking the lead as it was sharpening, love the fact that there&#x27;s two different sizes, and the cover to catch the shavings was an extra bonus.</li>
            <li> It event has a little tool attachment to clean out excess liner from the blade.</li>
            <li> The small sharpener is too small for most of my cosmetic pencils, and the large one is bordering on too large...</li>
            <li> Hard to clean!</li>
            <li> I have been using an old L&#x27;Oreal sharpener for way too long (10+ years) and should have changed it out MUCH sooner.</li>
            <li> but it also has two different size pencil sharperners that provide a clean sharp pencil after use.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it has a smaller and a bigger sharpener, but after a few uses it mostly breaks the pencils wood, instead of sharpening them.</li>
            <li> The cover is cool, it grabs the shavings and minimizes mess!</li>
            <li> I have a tiny little wand that came with another sharpener I had to clean that one out</li>
            <li> I think the MAC eyeliners have changed since I bought them last, because my old sharpener (Beautique 711011) no longer works with it.  </li>
            <li> Another plus, cap actually stays in place &#x3D; no messy shavings.</li>
            <li> For the first time in 2 weeks I&#x27;ve finally found a sharpener that really works, I didn&#x27;t think something on Amazon would be any different from the drugstore sharpeners I&#x27;ve tried, but this one is very sharp and works on my big pencils, which is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Love the sharpener, but was hoping that the larger sharpening opening would accommodate a lip pencil I had, alas...</li>
            <li> Put it back together for the most part, but the little pick wouldn&#x27;t stay in its little tunnel pocket thing.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well, but within a few weeks, the sharpener fell apart.</li>
            <li> It has no real fancy features, besides the hinged clear lid that trips your trimmings.</li>
            <li> i needed a sharpener that i can twist my pencil in slowly and it gives me the right tip.</li>
            <li> This sharpener works for large and small liners.</li>
            <li> Sharpens small and large eye liners, eye shadow sticks, etc.</li>
            <li> Easily accommodates thin and wide pencils.</li>
            <li> I thought eyeliner pencils were just hard to sharpen and a large amount of tip breakage was inevitable.</li>
            <li> it also came two days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I had already tried THREE others that were not large enough.</li>
            <li> I mean fast.</li>
            <li> Works like a dream, why did I wait so long?!?</li>
            <li> it is sharp and does not break the pencil unlike using a regular pencil</li>
            <li> I am surprised that it was so hard to find an eye liner sharpener in local stores &amp; had to go online in order to buy one.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to worry about wasting tons of your pencil liner because the blades are so sharp it takes off super thin amounts extending the life of your makeup product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this one very long.  </li>
            <li> This clear cover fits on with a &amp;#34;snap on&amp;#34; tightness so that an overload won&#x27;t cause a messy explosion of sharpening waste in your white sink.</li>
            <li> the only difference is the housing is made from slightly cheaper materials, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all</li>
            <li> Came with other items way, way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Also, you won&#x27;t be making a mess at the same time.</li>
            <li> The cover collects the sharpenings and minimizes a potential mess.</li>
            <li> but it just seems to hold onto the little bit of the actual pencil that gets sharpened and jams it into the sharpener.  </li>
            <li> Does what she expected.</li>
            <li> This one is reliable; it doesn&#x27;t come apart in your makeup bag and spill crud everywhere, and sharpener works well as expected.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> I also like that it holds a lot of pencil shavings before I have to empty it.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> She was having trouble finding a quality replacement locally for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> But all in all, it&#x27;s a sharpener, it works, and there&#x27;s not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> Plain &amp; simple.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and not worth the postage to send it back.</li>
            <li> had other sharpeners that broke my makeup pencils all the time.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal sharpener sharp</li>
            <li> , is sharp and works well.</li>
            <li> I had a similar item in the past that worked well until</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S SOOO SHARP..  </li>
            <li> The small side works with all my standard lip and eye pencils.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, sharp, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other sharpeners before &amp; none come close to this one.  </li>
            <li> I recommend you just get another one for other colors or make up types.</li>
            <li> Can sharpen my small and big pencils.</li>
            <li> That prevented the cover from tightly closing resulting in loose shavings falling into my make-up drawer.  </li>
            <li> But my other pencils are sharp sharp sharp!</li>
            <li> I already lost this stupid thing but it didn&#x27;t fit my big concealer crayon anyway.</li>
            <li> Now my black liner I just sharpened has pink and gold on it.  </li>
            <li> Lid stays closed so mess doesn&#x27;t dump out.</li>
            <li> but it seems almost impossible to clean this.  </li>
            <li> REALLY SHARP BLADES!</li>
            <li> The blades seem like they would hold up for at least 6 months so once they dull out and start to waste product ill be sure to order another one.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a very sharp one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cool color, but none of them are.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money!</li>
            <li> Average!...</li>
            <li> the little blade cleaning pin fell out.  </li>
            <li> This is a handly little sharpener that works well on all eye and lip pencils.</li>
            <li> I didnt realize it had a little pick</li>
            <li> but it drives me CRAZY when I don&#x27;t have a makeup pencil sharpener around (and a regular pencil sharpener will NOT be the same, trust me</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste your product by over sharpening.  </li>
            <li> Not a cheap sharpener.</li>
            <li> Compact and has two sizes and a waste containment compartment.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t expect this sharpener to travel well, because the front part that holds the sharpened bits falls off and the sharpened bits will explode everywhere and be messy.</li>
            <li> Unlike some sharpeners, it has a plastic cap that catches the shavings, so I don&#x27;t need to hold it over a waste basket every time I want to sharpen.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure why anyone would give less than five stars on a sharpener?</li>
            <li> wastes the lip pencil, is a little too small for the lip pencil</li>
            <li> Not very effective.</li>
            <li> This sharpener is universal for all thick and thin pencils.</li>
            <li> From day one, this thing destroyed my pencils -- not really shapening, just cutting back the wood and leaving a dull tip.</li>
            <li> waste a lot of my eye liner!</li>

            <li> the blade is dull and often breaks my eyeliner pencil tips</li>
            <li> My mother always complained about pencil sharpeners how they never worked well or broke.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the pencils come out a bit wonky though.</li>
            <li> For some silly reason I&#x27;ve had continual trouble with eyeliner sharpeners in the past - on some of them the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to catch the fibers and</li>
            <li> No more short-lived broken eye pencils.</li>
            <li> How ridiculous...  </li>
            <li> The only reason I have been using liquid liner for the past 10 years is because I had the wrong sharpener!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to get trimmings out of it.</li>
            <li> No more broken pencils!</li>
            <li> It has two sizes for sharpening thin liners and the chubbier pencils.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner doesn&#x27;t get broken off inside the sharpener like the others did.  </li>
            <li> Two stars and not one because it does whittle the pencil; it&#x27;s not just useless.  </li>
            <li> not impressed.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a rather expensive sharpener from MAC for my eyeliner pencils.</li>
            <li> It is useless for eye liner, but use for pencil...</li>
            <li> This almost seems like a silly thing to order</li>
            <li> and I was desperate to get another before I went on vacation.  </li>
            <li> so if you need it desperately then it will suffice.</li>

            <li> My wife loves it. Does what she expected.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a sharpener with an extra-extra large opening, and this one is just a normal large and small opening, so it didn&#x27;t quite fit the bill, but it&#x27;s still a good sharpener.</li>
            <li> It does its job. Works great.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best little sharpener I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using. Fits in my makeup bag and empties easily</li>
            <li> I am surprised that it was so hard to find an eye liner sharpener in local stores &amp; had to go online in order to buy one.This sharpener is good for either small(regular sized)pencils or larger pencils BUT does not put much of a point on the pencil once sharpened.</li>
            <li> This is as good as any sharpener I have found, however  I don&#x27;t think any of them sharpen as sharp as I would like.</li>
            <li> does not sharpen my pencils very well. the blade is dull and often breaks my eyeliner pencil tips so I have to keep sharpening and wasting product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is but it seems almost impossible to clean this.  I have tried everything.  I have a tiny little wand that came with another sharpener I had to clean that one out and that doesn&#x27;t even work at all.  I have tried everything but it just seems to hold onto the little bit of the actual pencil that gets sharpened and jams it into the sharpener.  It sharpens the smaller pencils kind of jagged and uneven but it fits most of my larger pencils, which is definetly a plus.  Right now it is sitting in my dressing table with a gold eyeliner and pink lip liner smeared together on the inside creating a huge mess.  Now my black liner I just sharpened has pink and gold on it.  Kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> clogs up too easily resulting in the pencil head breaking</li>
            <li> this sharpened my eyeliner pencil perfectly!</li>
            <li> REALLY SHARP BLADES! You don&#x27;t need to worry about wasting tons of your pencil liner because the blades are so sharp it takes off super thin amounts extending the life of your makeup product. Amazon had a fantastic price on this as well. The blades seem like they would hold up for at least 6 months so once they dull out and start to waste product ill be sure to order another one.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal dual sharpener is perfect for sharpening jumbo &amp; slim liner pencils and the price was right. I saw this one after I had order a different dual sharpener from another company for $2 more than I paid for this one (I bought both on Amazon.com). They are exactly a like just have different company logo. I would recommend L&#x27;Oreal Dual Sharpener to anyone looking for this type of sharpener. I did keep both (one for home and one for travel).</li>
            <li> I have been using an old L&#x27;Oreal sharpener for way too long (10+ years) and should have changed it out MUCH sooner. I decided to buy this one because it&#x27;s what I have been using, but needed an overdue upgrade. I love the clear coverings over both that allows you to see what you are sharpening and you don&#x27;t over do it and breaking off the pencil. Also, you won&#x27;t be making a mess at the same time. I am glad that I waited to buy this one.</li>
            <li> Great product very nice price, does the job really nice.</li>
            <li> Love the sharpener, but was hoping that the larger sharpening opening would accommodate a lip pencil I had, alas...üòû But my other pencils are sharp sharp sharp!</li>
            <li> wastes the lip pencil, is a little too small for the lip pencil and I have to force it.  It sharpens jaggedly, leaving shards of wood to jab and scratch my lips as I apply the stuff.  I think it&#x27;s a bad product.  Two stars and not one because it does whittle the pencil; it&#x27;s not just useless.  It is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> This comes with a stick to clean it! I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. There&#x27;s also a cover, which I somehow missed even though it&#x27;s right there in the title. For $3, it&#x27;s really a great deal. I sharpened my pencils and it did a smooth job.</li>
            <li> Where&#x27;s there to say. It&#x27;s a sharpener that sharpens well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I needed the larger-sized sharpener.  It works great for the bigger eye shadow pencils and it&#x27;s convenient to have the smaller one as well.  It also has a clear cover so the shavings don&#x27;t get everywhere.  Also, it was super cheap!</li>
            <li> Really like this sharpener.  Works well with more narrow pencil liners and wider too.</li>
            <li> The sharpeners work, but the two compartments that hold the shavings constantly break open without and jiggling involved.  Not worth your money!</li>
            <li> I already lost this stupid thing but it didn&#x27;t fit my big concealer crayon anyway. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an eyeliner pencil sharpener. It is exactly that, nothing more and nothing less. It will not make the man of your dreams marry you or make you look 15 years younger. It will, however, sharpen your eyeliner pencils.</li>
            <li> Works great, sharp, fast, easy to clean</li>
            <li> Functional and cheap for the price paid. The size fits my pencils just right unlike the one I got at the local store.</li>
            <li> excellent make up pencil sharpener. works great on fat eye/ lip pencils and skinny eye/lip liners. feels smooth when sharpening.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good quality sharpener and found this one at Amazon. I am very happy with this product. also  to say it grips/sharpens well and I LOVE the cover. Worth Buying it!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely buy a sharpener like this with a cover.  This one is reliable; it doesn&#x27;t come apart in your makeup bag and spill crud everywhere, and sharpener works well as expected.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> No matter what L&#x27;Oreal says, this does NOT sharpen their Silkissime eyeliners.  Actually, nothing does.</li>
            <li> It is okay. Good condition.</li>
            <li> This sharpener is universal for all thick and thin pencils. I have Italia eye liner pencils which I bought from Amazon and this sharpener work for it!</li>
            <li> Works great on my L&#x27;Oreal eye pencil! Love that it not only holds the shavings but also the clear covers can be removed from both sides for ease in removing the shavings! ;) Made in Germany.</li>
            <li> My Dual Sharpeners tend to vanish. This is a good replacement; only good because some other sharpeners have an adapter that allows regular, large and JUMBO makeup pencils to be sharpened using ONE sharpener! The cover collects the sharpenings and minimizes a potential mess.</li>
            <li> love this sharpener! works amazing and the price was well worth it. I am so glad I found this and will share with others..</li>
            <li> Great sharpener I have not had one pencil tip break off and it sharpens to a sharp point</li>
            <li> Best use for me is lip liners</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother. She uses it to sharpen her Revlon eyeliner pencils. She likes it.</li>
            <li> i love that is contains the shavings</li>
            <li> Wasnt impressed, the lid fell off after using it so the shavings were all over my make up bag and it got eyeliner everywhere. not impressed.</li>
            <li> works great sharpens freat!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure why anyone would give less than five stars on a sharpener? but it does it&#x27;s job! i wanted something i could keep in my new makeup bag that wouldn&#x27;t get eyeliner everywhere. this is super easy to clean (soak in water for a bit and scrub with old toothbrush) and it holds everything inside! it also came two days earlier than expected. i am very happy with my order and will be buying again from you in the future.</li>
            <li> It works. It sharpened my eyeliner pencil. There&#x27;s nothing spectacular about it.</li>
            <li> Average!... Nothing new. Good Quality.</li>
            <li> Great product, as advertised.</li>
            <li> These use the same blades as high end sharpeners from high end cosmetic counters like NARS....works with almost all my eye pencils, lip-liner, and lipstick pencils.  I still have the one I purchased 20 years ago, but wanted a back up....the only difference is the housing is made from slightly cheaper materials, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all and I do miss the little protective covers that went over the pencil holes on the old model, they kept everything self contained so you could throw it in your makeup bag with no worries :)</li>
            <li> One of the better sharpeners I have tried, and I must have about 8 different sharpeners. I purchased this not realizing I already had  this identical sharpener, but it does not  cause you to  over or under sharpen, and I have tried a multitude of pencils, with various circumference, so I would say it is a very good buy!</li>
            <li> It sharpens really well.  Cover is easy to remove to dump the shavings.</li>
            <li> Good value. It has two sizes for sharpening thin liners and the chubbier pencils. It event has a little tool attachment to clean out excess liner from the blade. The tool falls out all the time, but I don&#x27;t want to lose it because it&#x27;s useful.</li>
            <li> Best sharpener I&#x27;ve ever used. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price either.</li>
            <li> A great sharpener with a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I had other sharpeners that broke my makeup pencils all the time. The L&#x27;Oreal sharpener sharp perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad with that purches. No more broken pencils!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for a sharpener that would work with my Sonia Kashuk lip pencil from Target.  Others have not been big enough.  I threw this in as a filler item to get free shipping and I am very pleased that it fits the big pencil, is sharp and works well.</li>
            <li> This is a must for any cosmetic bag. The two sizes fit most pencils, and the angle of the sharpener does mot waste your pencil, but produces a sharp point. The sharpener contains a toothpick like cleaning tool to get out stubborn product tips that break off inside the sharpener - ingenious.  This cleaning tool stores in a little slot and can be pulled out easily. The clear cover creates a clean sharpening experience that you can view through so you don&#x27;t waste your product by over sharpening.  This clear cover fits on with a &amp;#34;snap on&amp;#34; tightness so that an overload won&#x27;t cause a messy explosion of sharpening waste in your white sink. ;) Buy two  - they are great tools and priced more cheaply than you will find in any cosmetic section of a store.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a cosmetic sharpener and this works fine with everything. Considering that I use different brands, everything so far has fit in the holes and I have no problem. I&#x27;d recommend it if this is the (maximum) price you&#x27;re willing to pay.</li>
            <li> so much better then the pencil sharpener i was using</li>
            <li> Inexpensive item gets the job done.  Easily accommodates thin and wide pencils. I had a similar item in the past that worked well until the little blade cleaning pin fell out.  That prevented the cover from tightly closing resulting in loose shavings falling into my make-up drawer.  Haven&#x27;t used this one very long.  Hopefully, it is better.</li>
            <li> Made a mistake not getting this sooner for my loreal pencils, it makes a difference in sharpening as opposed to using any old cosmetic sharpener you already have. The sharpening process went much smoother with this&amp;it really saves your pencils!</li>
            <li> sharpens evenly, good job</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good quality sharpener and found this one at Amazon. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I think the MAC eyeliners have changed since I bought them last, because my old sharpener (Beautique 711011) no longer works with it.  I recently purchased this one and it does work well.</li>
            <li> This is a handly little sharpener that works well on all eye and lip pencils. The shavings stay inside the sharpener, which is nice and not messy, and it&#x27;s easy to get the sharpener lid off to clean out the shavings.</li>
            <li> So much better than any other eye pencil brand I&#x27;ve used.  The blade is strong and perfectly aligned.  Ironically, I bought it to sharpen the intense liner by loreal and it&#x27;s so soft, even this sharpener causes it to break off.  Every other pencil I own, is much better sharpened, though.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SHARPENER IT&#x27;S SOOO SHARP..  THIS IS THE BEST SHARPENER I HAVE EVER PURCHASED IT&#x27;S WAYYY BETTER THAN THE WET N WILD SHARPENER..  :)))  I would DEF RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> This is my second sharpener, it works great to keep my eye pencils but I bought this one for my husbands art pencils, the sharpener has a pick to clean it in case you have residue from the breakage if that happens.  This sharpener is good for the softer eye, lip and art pencils.</li>
            <li> well priced, sharpens nice. would buy again.</li>
            <li> Before I got this sharpener I thought eyeliner pencils were just hard to sharpen and a large amount of tip breakage was inevitable. Not so! What a difference! I just started using Rimmel&#x27;s jumbo eyeshadow sticks [[ASIN:B00B2GSPM6 Rimmel Scandal Eyes Eye Shadow Stick ~ Guilty Grey 004]]&lt;br /&gt;and was super excited to find that this sharpener works so well to sharpen those as well, which apparently people complain about how hard they are to sharpen but this sharpener worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> My former sharpener broke and I was desperate to get another before I went on vacation.  I had my former sharpener for over eight years. I can&#x27;t rave about this L&#x27;Oreal sharpener, but I can&#x27;t complain about the sharpener either.  It&#x27;s a good buy.  I think the blade may wear more quickly than my former sharpener.  It will do...for now.</li>
            <li> For some silly reason I&#x27;ve had continual trouble with eyeliner sharpeners in the past - on some of them the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to catch the fibers and the pencil just spins. Not very effective. My most recent sharpener (made for no.2 pencils) just broke and I took a chance on this one - I&#x27;m happy to say it grips/sharpens well and I LOVE the cover. No more shavings in my makeup drawer! :)</li>
            <li> For the first time in 2 weeks I&#x27;ve finally found a sharpener that really works, I didn&#x27;t think something on Amazon would be any different from the drugstore sharpeners I&#x27;ve tried, but this one is very sharp and works on my big pencils, which is what I was looking for.  I&#x27;ve very impressed and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a very sharp one.  I&#x27;ve tried over 5 from CVS and Walmart and they all ended up in the garbage.  I&#x27;m super happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it has a smaller and a bigger sharpener, but after a few uses it mostly breaks the pencils wood, instead of sharpening them.</li>
            <li> This was recommended for colored art pencils to me. It does a good job, but just not as fine as a point that I need.&lt;br /&gt;Holds the shavings well, and easy to empty. Well made, and will transfer this to my makeup kit :)</li>
            <li> It works and it is convenient to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> But I still can&#x27;t get a good point going. The best I&#x27;ve tried anyway! I&#x27;ll probably hang on to this one!</li>
            <li> Came with other items way, way earlier than expected! Which I really like! Not a cheap sharpener. Thumbs up! ^_^ Plain &amp; simple.</li>
            <li> Love this! The cover is cool, it grabs the shavings and minimizes mess!</li>
            <li> Finally! I had purchased a rather expensive sharpener from MAC for my eyeliner pencils. From day one, this thing destroyed my pencils -- not really shapening, just cutting back the wood and leaving a dull tip. It often broke the makeup portion off too, what a huge waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless I continued to use that thing for about 6 years. Got this new sharpener a couple of days ago and I&#x27;m in heaven. Works like a dream, why did I wait so long?!?</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i expected -- love the two different sizes.. i just can&#x27;t seem to get the top open to empty it.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s just me though</li>
            <li> Hard to clean! Adequate.</li>
            <li> good quality, really like it</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the sharpener I had for nearly a decade. Should&#x27;ve done it years ago. As a matter of fact, if you use your sharpener regularly, this is inexpensive enough to replace regularly. The blades were sharp, didn&#x27;t keep breaking the lead as it was sharpening, love the fact that there&#x27;s two different sizes, and the cover to catch the shavings was an extra bonus. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s a sharpener. It catches the filings in the plastic thing. It has two sizes of holes. Hasn&#x27;t fallen apart.</li>
            <li> Use it for makeup for our daughter&#x27;s dance performance makeups. Does its job very well. For the price and the brand, cannot complain at all. Compact and sturdy. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> excellent price great quality- rivals sharpeners from chanel:) I would recomend it to anyone looking for an economical quality sharpener</li>
            <li> So simple, so useful, works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Happy it is equipped with a sharp blade.</li>
            <li> Best sharpener I&#x27;ve used. Lid stays closed so mess doesn&#x27;t dump out. Sharpens quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent sharpener. I have many eye pencil sharpeners and this is by far the best.  The big side is perfect for my NYX Jumbo eye Pencils and lip pencils.  The small side works with all my standard lip and eye pencils.  I also like that it holds a lot of pencil shavings before I have to empty it.  It sharpens my pencils to a nice points and so far, I have not noticed any dulling of the blade.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that could rally Sharp my eyeliner venci√≥ and this is the right sharpener love it</li>
            <li> I have these well-loved Nars velvet matte lip pencils that needed to be sharpened. I can&#x27;t find anything in stored that worked but this did. What a relief!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Works great!</li>
            <li> Compact and has two sizes and a waste containment compartment.</li>
            <li> So-so. The small sharpener is too small for most of my cosmetic pencils, and the large one is bordering on too large... the vast majority of my pencils fall right in between these 2 sizes, unexpectedly. The blades are sharp, and it&#x27;s clearly well made, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but I wish the sizing had been better thought out...</li>
            <li> Works perfectly!  (Can&#x27;t say that for all sharpeners.....especially budget ones.)  Does NOT tear your make-up pencils apart!</li>
            <li> The price of this  eye/ lip sharpener is very fair and it can used with any eye pencil or lip pencil.</li>
            <li> Sharpens my urban decay large lip pencils well. The only con is that the lip color shavings get trapped in the sharpener (as I&#x27;d imagine with any sharpener) so use a tissue to gently remove the remaining color shavings.</li>
            <li> It does what I need it to do, sharpen my eyeliner and brow pencils.</li>
            <li> great price and quality üëç</li>
            <li> it is sharp and does not break the pencil unlike using a regular pencil sharpener.&lt;br /&gt;worth the purchase. a must have in one&#x27;s make up kit.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  It works fine.</li>
            <li> Tried it the first time with some wide pencils,  very good sharpener.  It doesn&#x27;t leave chips on it. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice product; hold the shavings well - but does not fit my jumbo eye pencil! I bought this for that reason only.&lt;br /&gt; My jumbo pencil is...well, jumbo! Paid just $2.50 for this sharpener so I will keep it, or give away. I was excited that I would be able to sharpen my pencils, but my thrill is waned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they shipped this product SUPER fast. I mean fast. Got it in two days. Whoa!!! Thanks. :)</li>
            <li> This sharpener is very good love it</li>
            <li> Works great and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This sharpener was ok. It worked pretty well, but within a few weeks, the sharpener fell apart. Also, don&#x27;t expect this sharpener to travel well, because the front part that holds the sharpened bits falls off and the sharpened bits will explode everywhere and be messy. I soon had to throw this out and get something different and better (which was actually cheaper), that I like much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would get something different and cheaper in the future.</li>
            <li> Size is perfect, and was made with good quality material.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I don;t know why I did not get this earlier - it sharpens my pencil very effectively.</li>
            <li> This is a great sharpener.  I currently am using it to sharpen fabric marking pencils and they are working great for this. Unlike some sharpeners, it has a plastic cap that catches the shavings, so I don&#x27;t need to hold it over a waste basket every time I want to sharpen.  It is very convenient, I can empty it when I am ready to.</li>
            <li> Great price for a quality product.  I like the 2 different sizes for smaller or larger pencils.</li>
            <li> Great value, reliable brand, gets the job done!</li>
            <li> My wife has tried several store bought sharpeners, none to her liking. I saw this one and added it to an order. She LOVES it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my NYX jumbo sticks and it works like a charm! I exspecially like the fact that it saves the shavings inside until you dump it....</li>
            <li> Perfect for all my eyeliner and eyebrow and lipstick pencils. Does not plug up with pencil gel easily.</li>
            <li> I wanted a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; sized sharpener for my Urban Decay eyeliners, but what was sent to me is only for jumbo and SLIM pencils (specifically lipliners), not for medium eye pencils. The description said it had holes that were for &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; pencils. Waste of money and not worth the postage to send it back.</li>
            <li> Great sharpener with a nice cover. I put my very soft eyeliner in the freezer first and got a nice point  for the first time.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sharpener for my urban decay eyeliner pencils (when you shell out $18 for eyeliner you want to have the right sharpener!) This one works like a dream - the point didn&#x27;t break and the pencil was sharpened evenly.  At 2.50 this is a GREAT deal, considering Urban Decay charges ten bucks for the sharpener they produce</li>
            <li> It is useless for eye liner, but use for pencil... I hate it, it sharps my eye liner really really short! waste a lot of my eye liner!</li>
            <li> Great for those fat pencils</li>
            <li> Broke after just 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I had searched everywhere for a good sharpener that wouldn&#x27;t chew my pencils up, this one does it! So happy I purchased.</li>
            <li> I needed a device that could sharpen my makeup pencils - but I also wanted it to sharpen TWO different sizes.  Thanks to this ingenious little invention, I can have one machine to handle both my needs. What a wonder! In this modern age, no woman should be carrying around more than one sharpener.  How ridiculous...  AND, As if this creation needed to be more awesome, it even traps the shavings until I am ready to empty them into the trash!!! I feel so neat and tidy. And modern. And sassy.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a sharpener large enough for Sandra Kashuk chunky lip crayon and this was a winner! I had already tried THREE others that were not large enough. I went based off another review and am happy with my purchase. Another plus, cap actually stays in place &#x3D; no messy shavings.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sharpen my makeup pencils to a point, the tip is more rounded and dull, which isn&#x27;t all that great when I&#x27;m trying to do my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Good value and it works as it should.  What else can I say?  It&#x27;s a sharpener.  It sharpens and Amazon wants a tome.</li>
            <li> Shared my pencils really well.  What more can I say. Does what it&#x27;s supposed. I like that it catches the shaving, too.</li>
            <li> Dropped it once and it broke. Put it back together for the most part, but the little pick wouldn&#x27;t stay in its little tunnel pocket thing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to easily sharpen my NYX Push Up Bra (chubby) eye pencil (and I have a collection of sharpeners that LOOK large enough but aren&#x27;t). This did the trick -- and perfectly (the pencils wouldn&#x27;t fit in other sharpeners).  This sharpener has a plastic \\&quot;cover\\&quot; on it to catch shavings -- another bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected, good quality sharpener.  L&#x27;oreal always provides quality products and a great value.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Smaller than the picture (which is a good thing) and yet it does the job for two common size pencils perfectly.Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> fantastic pencil sharpener. i tried it and it was very good with my makeup crayons. i needed a sharpener that i can twist my pencil in slowly and it gives me the right tip. i hope it lasts in time and if it wears off i will buy some more, they are really cheap. excellent choice</li>
            <li> Keeps my make-up drawer clean and stays sharp to keep my eye liner clean and &#x27;on point&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Could be cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is actually my first pencil sharpener as I usually use liquid eyeliners. I purchased this because I purchased Benefit Eye Bright Pencil and knew I would need to sharpen it. My mother always complained about pencil sharpeners how they never worked well or broke. This one is fantastic!! I&#x27;ve since used it on eyeliners and my Eye Bright and it fits both and works amazing!</li>
            <li> Pencils didn&#x27;t fit right.  Left wood on pencil, didn&#x27;t make a good point.  Too big for eye and brow pencils.</li>
            <li> I just received this sharpener a couple of days ago.  Whenever I have used a regular pencil sharpener on an eye pencil, the lead would break repeatedly.  This sharpener easily sharpens the eye pencil to a fine tip without breaking.  Yay!  No more short-lived broken eye pencils.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my sharpener.  Works well.</li>
            <li> This sharpener sharpens well and does not break pencils. It is also a great price so I would not hesitate to recommend this. I also like the compact size and blade cover.</li>
            <li> Great price and shipped out so fast. Gets all my lip liners and eyeliners perfectly sharpened.</li>
            <li> Works very well - doesn&#x27;t destroy the make-up pencils.  Fits 2 sizes of pencils easily.  Easy to empty.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> Works well for me. And when I&#x27;m in a hurry don&#x27;t have to worry about finding a place for the sharpening bits right away.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife. She was having trouble finding a quality replacement locally for whatever reason. She does not have any complaints about this at all. It&#x27;s sturdy, sharp, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a year and I like it. I dont use it very often but it works well..</li>
            <li> The product arrived damaged, and the packaging was also torn on the side. The plastic cover on the sharpener was completely shattered.</li>
            <li> This one is not that good. There is a better one that is cylinder and dual sharpened also since the eyeliner casings can fall out easily. I only needed this for a short while so if you need it desperately then it will suffice.</li>
            <li> I have tried many sharpeners for eyeliners from different makes and this is by far the best one.  Eyeliner doesn&#x27;t get broken off inside the sharpener like the others did.  I would definitely recomend this product.  I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> This sharpener has a cover and keeps the shavings inside, no mess! Simple tool, works well. This sharpener works for large and small liners.</li>
            <li> The only reason I have been using liquid liner for the past 10 years is because I had the wrong sharpener!! This sharpener will bring all your old pencils to life again.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has a cover which helps me get it out of my cosmetic case safely without worrying about scraping along the blades.</li>
            <li> Was given as part of a makeup pack I put together, receiver was happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sharpener! It sharpens makeup pencils! Rather well I might add. I like that the cappy bit keeps the shavings in. Lovely.</li>
            <li> I bought the Dual Sharpener with Clear Cover in order to have a sharpener for both my pencils and crayons that didn&#x27;t get shavings everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like:&lt;br /&gt;*it fits both my pencils and crayons&lt;br /&gt;*the case cover stays on and snaps in place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike:&lt;br /&gt;nothing</li>
            <li> Nice Cosmetic Sharpener!</li>
            <li> If you love kohl this sharper is a must have. Still in perfect condition after 2 years</li>
            <li> LoVe it,super dhart and smooth and for a cheaper price than other brands. Totally recomment it,i use it to sharpen lipstick</li>
            <li> This broke after first use.  Didn&#x27;t fit most sizes of my eye pencils.  I would have to say very cheap.  Pass</li>
            <li> This is the best eye liner sharpener I have ever bought and for an awesome cost.  It is super sharp and gets the pencils to a great point and doesn&#x27;t chew up the eyeliner like some of the cheap versions.</li>
            <li> Use this will all of my pencils, excellent</li>
            <li> Sharpens small and large eye liners, eye shadow sticks, etc. Holds the shavings so they don&#x27;t get everywhere. Sometimes the pencils come out a bit wonky though. Overall, good product for just a few dollars.</li>
            <li> Love this sharpener! I&#x27;ve used other sharpeners before &amp; none come close to this one.  It works great for the big or the little one.</li>
            <li> Very nice sharpener, doesn&#x27;t chew up my pencils!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Not only does it work really well but it also has two different size pencil sharperners that provide a clean sharp pencil after use.</li>
            <li> Good price and love the cover that catches the shavings. This almost seems like a silly thing to order but it drives me CRAZY when I don&#x27;t have a makeup pencil sharpener around (and a regular pencil sharpener will NOT be the same, trust me, it will just ruin your makeup pencils). Order a few of these to have around wherever you find yourself applying makeup :).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a makeup pencil sharpener. It has no real fancy features, besides the hinged clear lid that trips your trimmings. It&#x27;s not a cool color, but none of them are. It&#x27;s a little difficult to get trimmings out of it. But all in all, it&#x27;s a sharpener, it works, and there&#x27;s not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> Great sharpener!  Excellent price. Sharpens my makeup pencils without tearing them up. Nice to have both sizes in one tool.</li>
            <li> I use this for sharpening eyeliner only. It&#x27;s cheap, sharpens like it should, and it&#x27;s easy to empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seeing that people are having issues with cross contamination across different products. I recommend you just get another one for other colors or make up types. Also, you really shouldn&#x27;t be using the same product to sharpen both eye and lip products. You run the risk of getting an eye infection.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Cover keeps shavings from falling out.</li>
            <li> Looks great alone. I&#x27;ll try with bright eyeshadow soon.</li>
            <li> I didnt realize it had a little pick the helps you remove any products that may be blocking the hole. This automatically reminded me of the urban decay grindhouse that also has a pick as well. I love how it has two different sizes and it wasnt very pricey ($3 not bad). It came fast like i had planned and i cant wait to start using it :D</li>
            <li> Had no issues with this sharpener. Can sharpen my small and big pencils. I would buy this again if I had to :)</li>
