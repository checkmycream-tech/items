    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The size is perfect for tucking in a purse or for traveling.  </li>
            <li>so this works great for me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s not for everyone.  </li>
            <li>Great for a gift for girlfriends.</li>
            <li>Great summer scent, goes well with vanilla for summer and cocoa for fall.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells great, but there&#x27;s a problem with the roller ball.</li>
            <li>But to roll on some great scents is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>What a GREAT summer scent.</li>
            <li>This scent is very nice and done well, but I just don&#x27;t care to smell coconuts for prolonged periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the perfect size, and the roll-on tip makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Good roller ball for on the go.</li>
            <li>but it smells really good.</li>
            <li>love the smell!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These scents are all really nice</li>
            <li>I own both the roll-on and spray versions, and I have to say I prefer the spray.  </li>
            <li>Nice summery scent.</li>
            <li>If you love coconut, you will love the scent!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful all natural perfume.</li>
            <li>The blood orange is too strong for me, and floral smells like gardenia are nice, but I apply those *</li>
            <li>I love the roll on version!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Most perfumes make me sneeze and this one does not.</li>
            <li>If you like a light coconut smell that you can feel great about because it&#x27;s cruelty free and vegan, and also enjoy the convenience of compact size, get this perfume roller for sure.</li>
            <li>If you love coconut</li>
            <li>I would order from Friki Tiki again:)</li>
            <li>I love the sent of this.</li>
            <li>the scent is ok.</li>
            <li>Scent is ok.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve purchased the blood orange one from Target, and it works much better.)</li>
            <li>I LOVE Pacifica</li>
            <li>I love the scent of coconut</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li>The idea of a tropical, Hawaiian fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>Pacifica could keep trying to improve on it, unless anyone else knows of another brand that does it better?</li>
            <li>It is just ok.</li>
            <li>What a nice touch and fun surprise!  </li>
            <li>It has a lovely, sweet, warm, vanilla-y, coconut-y scent.</li>
            <li>very* lightly as they are strong.  </li>
            <li>The perfume feels lovely and light on the skin and the scent lasts for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Great perfume - all natural and a lovely smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower you or anyone else.  </li>
            <li>&gt; Smells great but is not overwhelmingly strong, great every day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not out-of-the-world amazing, but for being vegan, cruelty-free, gluten-free, it definitely is worth the price.</li>
            <li>on is portable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very nice but doesn&#x27;t last more than 20 min.  </li>
            <li>I love the beachy, sweet scent of this perfume.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind reaplying throughout the day you will be fine with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a cruelty free perfume that was not tested on animals, as I am an animal lover and activist.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure anyone could wear the right one for them.  </li>
            <li>The entire Pacifica line is available with samples at Whole Foods, so it was great to be able to smell them all before buying.  </li>
            <li>The seller even wrapped the box that the perfume came in with fun leopard print tissue paper!</li>
            <li>I first tried this on at Whole Foods and really liked it, but didn&#x27;t purchase.  </li>
            <li>If you like citrus the orange and lemon are true to smell.  </li>
            <li>You can go pretty strong on the coconut and vanilla</li>
            <li>Coconutty and mild.  </li>
            <li>I take it everywhere for a quick touch up.  </li>
            <li>As others mentioned, it is a bit short-lasting, but I find that if I apply it right after showering in the morning it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a little more punch of coconut, but still and enjoyable scent.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy, the Sandalwood is a nice, clean everyday scent and my wife likes it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite scent for her is the Mexican Cocoa...</li>
            <li>Job very well done, Pacifica!</li>
            <li>3.5 stars to be exact</li>
            <li>Glad to find this on Amazon local Target</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite go to scent and my second rollerball from Pacifica.</li>
            <li>I do not like strong smelling perfumes, but this was quite the opposite!</li>
            <li>Pacifica Perfume doesn&#x27;t post any even remotely negative results on their website so be aware you won&#x27;t get a fair review analysis from their site.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with how small it was, which is actually nice since I can fit it into my purse without compromising any space at all.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the better natural perfumes I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I bought several Pacifica roll on perfumes in floral scents a few years ago and loved them.  </li>
            <li>My personal top scents are: Indian Coconut, Mexican Cocoa, Island Vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I get mild allergies some times and spraying perfume definitely is nose aggravating.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Almost* puts me in mind of the old body shop original 1990&#x27;s vanilla oil highly coveted in the essential oil/perfume oil world.</li>
            <li>but its a cute little roll on perfume thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked for natural perfumes all over, everywhere from Whole Foods to Etsy.  </li>
            <li>I found this little roll-on here on Amazon and since it was fairly cheap for something that doesn&#x27;t have strange ingredients and is cruelty free, I went ahead and bought it.</li>
            <li>So overall a very smart purchase in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The first was purchased from the mall and the second from here</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, as it fades a little after putting it on, but it&#x27;s slightly sweet and very tropical.</li>
            <li>Like the other Pacifica products though it seems to wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>I love coconut scented stuff, but for some reason it&#x27;s hard to find cologne in that fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is made of natural ingredients and fits well into my purse.</li>
            <li>This has a really soft scent, not very heavy coconut smell.</li>
            <li>But then again, it&#x27;s small enough to be portable, so just reach in your pocket and throw some more on.</li>
            <li>In general the scents have to be reapplied every couple of hours, they are not longlasting, though natural scents tend to be that way anyway.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients: natural grain alcohol, essential oils, natural oils, water</li>
            <li>I would buy it again and I am interested in some of the other fragrances they have.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in a decent amount of time, I don&#x27;t remember having to wait excruciatingly long or anything.</li>
            <li>There was barely a hint of coconut smell lingering after using 1/4 of the roll-on bottle.</li>
            <li>I just wish that it was purely coconut scented, and without other notes.  </li>
            <li>Too bad this isn&#x27;t available through Amazon with free shipping...</li>
            <li>Pacifica pulls this scent off wonderfully - not too intense, wears well through the day, and does not change much when it mixes with your natural body oils.  </li>

            <li> Pacifica pulls this scent off wonderfully - not too intense, wears well through the day, and does not change much when it mixes with your natural body oils.  </li>
            <li> I have given three stars only because this product used to last me all day long.  </li>
            <li> It could be coincidence, but I feel like they&#x27;ve decided to go big market and cheapen ingredients so that the product are no longer as costly and obviously do not last as long.  </li>
            <li> the scent didn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> Coconut scents are not easy to pull off because coconut (like other fruit-based scents) is an alluring scent in the right concentration that can be nauseating if too intense or mixed with certain artificial ingredients/chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I like this perfume, but it is not very strong and does not last nearly long enough.  </li>
            <li> Recently I have bought all the other scents: vanilla, coconut, mango etc.  </li>
            <li> I like the coconut scent mixed with the vanilla , and other scents.</li>
            <li> I was personally not too crazy about the scent as it was on the sweeter side--almost too sweet that it seemed unnatural of a scent.</li>
            <li> but it is sweeter than expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it&#x27;s not strong at all.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong, really.</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed because the coconut scent disappears fairly quickly Also, unless I have a very poor sense of smell, the entire fragrance does not seem to last long on my body.</li>
            <li> The solid tin scents are subtle and have the advantage of not having the immediate alcohol smell as the roll on, but that smell fades in a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a slight plastic component.  </li>
            <li> The scent seems to stick around a little longer.  </li>
            <li> so you can just add a little perfume at a time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll wear off after a few hours.</li>
            <li> But the reality of this particular one is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely like coconut, but not in a sick candy fake way.</li>
            <li> just not sure if its for me.</li>
            <li> just not sure if the scent was for me.</li>
            <li> Lasts a medium amount of time, very subtle.</li>
            <li> So sad!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed and frustrated.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with the product.</li>

            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; loves it.</li>
            <li> Coconut scents are not easy to pull off because coconut (like other fruit-based scents) is an alluring scent in the right concentration that can be nauseating if too intense or mixed with certain artificial ingredients/chemicals.  Pacifica pulls this scent off wonderfully - not too intense, wears well through the day, and does not change much when it mixes with your natural body oils.  This scent is very nice and done well, but I just don&#x27;t care to smell coconuts for prolonged periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these (Pacifica) scents and they are the only scents my wife will wears seeing as though she will only put 100% organic/kosher products on/in her body.  My favorite scent for her is the Mexican Cocoa...it&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s not for everyone.  If I had to recommend a scent to a woman that I did not know, I&#x27;d say the Mediterranean Fig.  If you&#x27;re a guy, the Sandalwood is a nice, clean everyday scent and my wife likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These scents are all really nice and I&#x27;m sure anyone could wear the right one for them.  Job very well done, Pacifica!</li>
            <li> I love the roll on version!&lt;br /&gt; Smells great but is not overwhelmingly strong, great every day wear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would like to try the spray next time.</li>
            <li> Coconutty and mild.  Lasts a medium amount of time, very subtle.</li>

            <li> I bought several Pacifica roll on perfumes in floral scents a few years ago and loved them.  I left a rave review.  I have given three stars only because this product used to last me all day long.  Recently I have bought all the other scents: vanilla, coconut, mango etc.  These only last a couple hours.  So sad!  I also now see them being sold in markets.  It could be coincidence, but I feel like they&#x27;ve decided to go big market and cheapen ingredients so that the product are no longer as costly and obviously do not last as long.  At the same time, I&#x27;m grateful they offer a phthalate-free fragrance.  And they are purse size, so you can reapply.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful all natural perfume. Most perfumes make me sneeze and this one does not. I like the roll on so you can just add a little perfume at a time. Great for a gift for girlfriends.</li>
            <li> This has a really soft scent, not very heavy coconut smell. Like the other Pacifica products though it seems to wear off quickly.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cruelty free perfume that was not tested on animals, as I am an animal lover and activist. I found this little roll-on here on Amazon and since it was fairly cheap for something that doesn&#x27;t have strange ingredients and is cruelty free, I went ahead and bought it. It arrived in a decent amount of time, I don&#x27;t remember having to wait excruciatingly long or anything. I was surprised with how small it was, which is actually nice since I can fit it into my purse without compromising any space at all. It smells lovely like coconut, but not in a sick candy fake way. The only thing is that it&#x27;s not strong at all. It&#x27;ll wear off after a few hours. But then again, it&#x27;s small enough to be portable, so just reach in your pocket and throw some more on. So overall a very smart purchase in my opinion. If you like a light coconut smell that you can feel great about because it&#x27;s cruelty free and vegan, and also enjoy the convenience of compact size, get this perfume roller for sure. You can&#x27;t go wrong, really.</li>
            <li> I love coconut scented stuff, but for some reason it&#x27;s hard to find cologne in that fragrance.  I first tried this on at Whole Foods and really liked it, but didn&#x27;t purchase.  The size is perfect for tucking in a purse or for traveling.  I just wish that it was purely coconut scented, and without other notes.  If you love coconut like I do, you will like this roll on perfume!  The seller even wrapped the box that the perfume came in with fun leopard print tissue paper! What a nice touch and fun surprise!  I would order from Friki Tiki again:)</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the better natural perfumes I have purchased. As others mentioned, it is a bit short-lasting, but I find that if I apply it right after showering in the morning it lasts longer. It&#x27;s not out-of-the-world amazing, but for being vegan, cruelty-free, gluten-free, it definitely is worth the price. I ordered this last year and finished the bottle in 6 months... will probably reorder soon.</li>
            <li> Like it but it is sweeter than expected.</li>
            <li> 3.5 stars to be exact I love the sent of this. Almost* puts me in mind of the old body shop original 1990&#x27;s vanilla oil highly coveted in the essential oil/perfume oil world. Someday someone will figure out how to make the discontinued product and be a zillionare.  One thing that I noticed the scent didn&#x27;t last that long.  I would suggest layering it on.  I would buy it again and I am interested in some of the other fragrances they have.  Again I just wished the product lasted longer. I purchased it at the local Freddies.</li>
            <li> i bought this not knowing how it would smell. the scent is ok. not over powering at all. just not sure if its for me. i havent worn it. but its a cute little roll on perfume thing. just not sure if the scent was for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for natural perfumes all over, everywhere from Whole Foods to Etsy.  Everything is either too chemical smelling or to patchouli or woodsy smelling for me.  I&#x27;ve tried Pacifica in the roll on, solid and spray.  I have the perfume spray in cocoa, it seems to hold scent longer than the solid or roll on.  In general the scents have to be reapplied every couple of hours, they are not longlasting, though natural scents tend to be that way anyway.  The solid tin scents are subtle and have the advantage of not having the immediate alcohol smell as the roll on, but that smell fades in a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roll on is portable and easy to use.  My personal top scents are: Indian Coconut, Mexican Cocoa, Island Vanilla.  The blood orange is too strong for me, and floral smells like gardenia are nice, but I apply those *very* lightly as they are strong.  If you like citrus the orange and lemon are true to smell.  You can go pretty strong on the coconut and vanilla and it&#x27;s not too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to mix scents.  Coconut mixes with everything.  Great summer scent, goes well with vanilla for summer and cocoa for fall.</li>
            <li> Scent is ok.  I would not buy again</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great, but there&#x27;s a problem with the roller ball. Upon attempted application, almost nothing comes out. Defective. (I&#x27;ve purchased the blood orange one from Target, and it works much better.)</li>
            <li> I get mild allergies some times and spraying perfume definitely is nose aggravating.  But to roll on some great scents is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> If you love coconut, you will love the scent! It&#x27;s not overpowering, as it fades a little after putting it on, but it&#x27;s slightly sweet and very tropical. My teenage girls keep stealing it from me!</li>
            <li> love the smell! Coconut and vanilla Reminds me of the beach. Glad to find this on Amazon local Target quit carrying it.!</li>
            <li> Got this for my friend&#x27;s birthday without knowing what it smelled like before purchasing. She was looking for a portable, travel-size, emergency perfume to keep in her bag. This is the perfect size, and the roll-on tip makes it easy to apply. I was personally not too crazy about the scent as it was on the sweeter side--almost too sweet that it seemed unnatural of a scent. The coconut definitely triumphs the nectar.</li>
            <li> Smells like a trip to the beach</li>
            <li> I LOVE Pacifica Indian Coconut Nectar Roll-On Perfume! It has a lovely, sweet, warm, vanilla-y, coconut-y scent. The perfume feels lovely and light on the skin and the scent lasts for most of the day. I&#x27;ll buy the Pacifica Indian Coconut Nectar Spray Perfume (1 oz) in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: natural grain alcohol, essential oils, natural oils, water</li>
            <li> Great perfume - all natural and a lovely smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower you or anyone else.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume, but it is not very strong and does not last nearly long enough.  Nice summery scent.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I take it everywhere for a quick touch up.  I love the scent of coconut so this works great for me!</li>
            <li> Good roller ball for on the go. I was hoping for a little more punch of coconut, but still and enjoyable scent.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume. I like that it is made of natural ingredients and fits well into my purse.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with the product. I do not like strong smelling perfumes, but this was quite the opposite! There was barely a hint of coconut smell lingering after using 1/4 of the roll-on bottle.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no staying power but it smells really good.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice but doesn&#x27;t last more than 20 min.  If you don&#x27;t mind reaplying throughout the day you will be fine with this purchase.  It has a slight plastic component.  Pacifica Perfume doesn&#x27;t post any even remotely negative results on their website so be aware you won&#x27;t get a fair review analysis from their site. You can try it for yourself, if you don&#x27;t rate a 4 or 5 out of five your review will never appear on pacificaperfume.com. not all products areade in USA eye pencils are one example.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite go to scent and my second rollerball from Pacifica. The first was purchased from the mall and the second from here and I cannot get the roller to work properly! I have tried everything. I&#x27;m so disappointed and frustrated.</li>
            <li> What a GREAT summer scent. I feel like I am on a tropical island every time I put it on.  I keep it in my purse and roll it on during the day for a &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li> Too lite.  Smell what?</li>
            <li> I like the coconut scent mixed with the vanilla , and other scents. However, I was disappointed because the coconut scent disappears fairly quickly Also, unless I have a very poor sense of smell, the entire fragrance does not seem to last long on my body. Maybe other&lt;br /&gt;people can smell it? I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;  The idea of a tropical, Hawaiian fragrance is lovely. But the reality of this particular one is a disappointment. Pacifica could keep trying to improve on it, unless anyone else knows of another brand that does it better? Please let us know, if you can.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you! Linda P.</li>
            <li> It is just ok. Not quite the coconut smell I was hoping for. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be noticed by others when I am wearing it.</li>
