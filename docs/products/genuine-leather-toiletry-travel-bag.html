            <li>I decided this year to buy each of my Grandson&#x27;s one of these wonderful leather toiletry travel bags and fill it full of useful  items like deordorant, body washes etc.  </li>
            <li>Sleek, professional and perfect for my husband when he travels.  </li>

            <li>I am tempted to buy a couple more for friends.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to use it.</li>
            <li>My husband is more than pleased with the quality and functionality of this toiletry bag.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So this bag is able to hold everything.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful soft leather bag which will be used for my husbands shaving products when we travel.</li>
            <li>The best part was that after the initial flurry of opening gifts, one of my sons picked up his bag and really looked at it and commented on how nice it was and where did I get it?  </li>
            <li>It is soft leather, very nice looking.  </li>
            <li>It is a perfect size and holds a lot more items than canvas bags which tend to be really stiff.  </li>
            <li>I picked this particular bag because the picture looked good and it fit my price range.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly soft travel bag and high quality construction make this the perfect bag to take with you on your journeys.</li>
            <li>It is sturdy and well made and will do him just fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>and this one is leather and works just fine.</li>
            <li>The leather was soft and supple and had that awesome new leather smell.  </li>
            <li>The leather is super soft and the quality is great.  </li>
            <li>The bag is a high quality leather bag that is perfect for traveling or just general storage of items.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care a huge bottle of shampoo or what not in a bag like this.</li>
            <li>This bag looks cheap.</li>
            <li>it was practically free it as so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This does not look genuine leather.</li>
            <li>I purchased a cheap plastic travel bag from Walmart rigt befoe I saw this one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this toiletry bag is genuine leather as named.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, roomy, and</li>
            <li>I got it free using my Discover Card bonus points.</li>
            <li>Overall great value for what you get.</li>
            <li>These Toiletries bags are fantastic.</li>
            <li>For the price it is very reasonable and I&#x27;m glad I got this bag.</li>
            <li>and he was so excited.</li>
            <li>The size was also unique.</li>
            <li>so we will see if it holds up very long but seems like it is great.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, product very good for low cost and very roomy; holds quite a number of toiletries with room to spare.</li>
            <li>It is, however, a most functional carrier for travel situations, having a large capacity.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the cheap price</li>
            <li>But it will work and feels good and is bigger than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>This is a good quality leather bag, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>He loved it and especially that it was leather!</li>
            <li>Very well made, soft leather and good zippers with plenty of room to hold everything you could want in a traveling bag.</li>
            <li>The quality of this bag was exceptional, especially at this price.</li>
            <li>so I had my glasses in one and road miscellaneous in the other and this works just fine and looks really good.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>This is a real lather travel bag for the cost of a cheap plastic one.</li>
            <li>It is priced well below what I think it is worth.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked a divider in the middle.  </li>
            <li>It was kind of a last minute purchase</li>
            <li>The bags were bigger than I had anticipated, nice and roomy on the inside.  </li>
            <li>and this is his favorite by far.</li>
            <li>Leather soft; would have preferred a smooth finish but the sewn design give it a unique look.</li>
            <li>As advertised, just what I was looking for at the right price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any issues with getting this item to work right out of the box.</li>
            <li>just the right amount of room</li>
            <li>It is very nice, big enough to fit a full-sized shampoo bottle if traveling by car/bus/train (remember that airport security will not let you take large liquid containers).    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much nicer than my old one that I paid  more money for.</li>
            <li>Gave it to my husband for Christmas, and he likes it very much.</li>
            <li>The bag was as advertised and the purchase price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>FOR ME.I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IT, WELL WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>It is slightly bigger than most bags sold for this purpose.  </li>
            <li>I am able to fit 8 1/2 x 11 paper folded in half.</li>
            <li>Seems to be very durable and is just the right size.</li>
            <li>Soft rich leather</li>
            <li>Very roomy to hold many of your personal belongings.</li>
            <li>Very high quality bag.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s held up very well.</li>
            <li>, Thanks</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t appear to be real leather</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is real leather (it smelled like it as soon as we opened the box), and it wears well.</li>
            <li>It is of a reasonable size to get the Items you need to take with you on a trip.</li>
            <li>and I hadn&#x27;t done much comparison shopping.  </li>
            <li>Very roomy.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My son really likes it.  </li>
            <li>When I saw the price, I thought it couldn&#x27;t be much, but I&#x27;ll try it.</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>It is durable with reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The pockets are extra roomy and the kit will be very useful.</li>
            <li>Has a nice side pocket I keep small items like toe nail clippers and tweezers at.</li>
            <li>There was a tiny scratch in the leather near the handle but other than that, a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>Classic look.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to anyone who need a decent leather toiletry bag.</li>
            <li>I like this bag a lot, it is very roomy and has been durable so far for me.</li>
            <li>but it is real leather and glove soft.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot but for me I could be just a bit larger, then it would be just right.</li>
            <li>This bag was large enough and seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new travel bag for my shaving stuff and found this.  </li>
            <li>the leather is very soft.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I opened the box.</li>
            <li>They have held up their first test with a tour of Europe, Middle East, then</li>
            <li>It is plenty large enough to hold all my bathroom stuff (electric razor, charger, toothpaste, toothbrush, hair cream, comb, mirror, eye drops, soap dish, shampoo, fingernail brush, misc OTC meds, bandaids, etc.)</li>
            <li>For about the same price this one is real (patched) leather, soft and is made well.</li>
            <li>We bought this for our 10 year old son was vacation trips along with his school nature overnight outing.</li>
            <li>Leather was soft and supple, and well made.</li>
            <li>soft leather.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised when the bags arrived.  </li>
            <li>old son</li>
            <li>My friend was going into the hospital and his shaving kit was so old.</li>
            <li>We needed a professional bag for our blood pressure cuff and stethoscope.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of the smell but so far nothing works.</li>
            <li>Spacious, classy, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made well and the leather is supple and soft.</li>
            <li>My previous shaving kit was the same size and shape, but opened on the flat side where this one opens on the top edge.  </li>
            <li>Every toiletry item fits neatly into the large inner pocket or in the outside pocket.  </li>
            <li>Large enough to hold all necessary items that were need.</li>
            <li>I find myself always having to dig through everything to find what I want, whereas my old one was much easier to get things since it opened on the flat side instead of the deep edge.  </li>
            <li>Was a Christmas present for my new son-in-law that my daughter bought in surprise for him.  </li>
            <li>The one I received is too large and is not compact as I had expected.</li>
            <li>The toiletry bag was larger than I thought, and soft leather.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my husband to replace a toiletry bag that was several years old.  </li>

            <li> But it will work and feels good and is bigger than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> This is a good quality leather bag, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> He loved it and especially that it was leather!</li>
            <li> Very well made, soft leather and good zippers with plenty of room to hold everything you could want in a traveling bag.</li>
            <li> The quality of this bag was exceptional, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> so I had my glasses in one and road miscellaneous in the other and this works just fine and looks really good.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This is a real lather travel bag for the cost of a cheap plastic one.</li>
            <li> It is priced well below what I think it is worth.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked a divider in the middle.  </li>
            <li> It was kind of a last minute purchase</li>
            <li> The bags were bigger than I had anticipated, nice and roomy on the inside.  </li>
            <li> and this is his favorite by far.</li>
            <li> Leather soft; would have preferred a smooth finish but the sewn design give it a unique look.</li>
            <li> As advertised, just what I was looking for at the right price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with getting this item to work right out of the box.</li>
            <li> just the right amount of room</li>
            <li> It is very nice, big enough to fit a full-sized shampoo bottle if traveling by car/bus/train (remember that airport security will not let you take large liquid containers).    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much nicer than my old one that I paid  more money for.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my husband for Christmas, and he likes it very much.</li>
            <li> The bag was as advertised and the purchase price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> FOR ME.I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IT, WELL WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> It is slightly bigger than most bags sold for this purpose.  </li>
            <li> I am able to fit 8 1/2 x 11 paper folded in half.</li>
            <li> Seems to be very durable and is just the right size.</li>
            <li> Soft rich leather</li>
            <li> Very roomy to hold many of your personal belongings.</li>
            <li> Very high quality bag.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s held up very well.</li>
            <li> , Thanks</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t appear to be real leather</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It is real leather (it smelled like it as soon as we opened the box), and it wears well.</li>
            <li> It is of a reasonable size to get the Items you need to take with you on a trip.</li>
            <li> and I hadn&#x27;t done much comparison shopping.  </li>
            <li> Very roomy.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My son really likes it.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the price, I thought it couldn&#x27;t be much, but I&#x27;ll try it.</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> It is durable with reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The pockets are extra roomy and the kit will be very useful.</li>
            <li> Has a nice side pocket I keep small items like toe nail clippers and tweezers at.</li>
            <li> There was a tiny scratch in the leather near the handle but other than that, a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Classic look.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone who need a decent leather toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> I like this bag a lot, it is very roomy and has been durable so far for me.</li>
            <li> but it is real leather and glove soft.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot but for me I could be just a bit larger, then it would be just right.</li>
            <li> This bag was large enough and seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new travel bag for my shaving stuff and found this.  </li>
            <li> the leather is very soft.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I opened the box.</li>
            <li> They have held up their first test with a tour of Europe, Middle East, then</li>
            <li> It is plenty large enough to hold all my bathroom stuff (electric razor, charger, toothpaste, toothbrush, hair cream, comb, mirror, eye drops, soap dish, shampoo, fingernail brush, misc OTC meds, bandaids, etc.)</li>
            <li> For about the same price this one is real (patched) leather, soft and is made well.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 10 year old son was vacation trips along with his school nature overnight outing.</li>
            <li> Leather was soft and supple, and well made.</li>
            <li> soft leather.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised when the bags arrived.  </li>
            <li> old son</li>
            <li> My friend was going into the hospital and his shaving kit was so old.</li>
            <li> We needed a professional bag for our blood pressure cuff and stethoscope.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of the smell but so far nothing works.</li>
            <li> Spacious, classy, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made well and the leather is supple and soft.</li>
            <li> My previous shaving kit was the same size and shape, but opened on the flat side where this one opens on the top edge.  </li>
            <li> Every toiletry item fits neatly into the large inner pocket or in the outside pocket.  </li>
            <li> Large enough to hold all necessary items that were need.</li>
            <li> I find myself always having to dig through everything to find what I want, whereas my old one was much easier to get things since it opened on the flat side instead of the deep edge.  </li>
            <li> Was a Christmas present for my new son-in-law that my daughter bought in surprise for him.  </li>
            <li> The one I received is too large and is not compact as I had expected.</li>
            <li> The toiletry bag was larger than I thought, and soft leather.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband to replace a toiletry bag that was several years old.  </li>
            <li> My only advice for future buyers, the leather is not real thick, so heavy duty users hard on their things should be aware.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s leather, it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Also there is a slight tear near the zipper.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed for those long weekend trips.</li>
            <li> Bag has been soaking wet on the outside and dry as a bone on the inside.</li>
            <li> When you travel i think it&#x27;s silly to carry full size things if you have the option not to.</li>
            <li> After a very short time (few hours), you will not smell anything from them, unless you put your nose to them, then it&#x27;s only slight.</li>
            <li> A little bigger than I expected but provides lots of room for all my toiletry items.</li>
            <li> This item worked like expected.  </li>
            <li> It was just what I had expected to get.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted for small personal items.</li>
            <li> Leather is a little thin, but it holds up very well.  </li>
            <li> From the pic, I thought it was a dark brown color</li>
            <li> Frankly it looks like the day I bought it, at least on the outside.</li>
            <li> only negative is where they put the zipper.  </li>
            <li> Would like to have some hold down starps or pockets in the inside of the bag for toiletries.</li>
            <li> but it is actually black.  </li>
            <li> I bought it less than a month now and the leather is already beginning to flake/peel.</li>
            <li> They are leather, so they will offload some SLIGHT; smell.</li>
            <li> I got it for my teenage son for a trip, I was not happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been airing out in the garage for a few weeks so maybe by spring</li>
            <li> use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I also keep a small bottle of RL Black cologne in it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, because they were the right size and price.</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight and fits in a backpack.  </li>
            <li> Also, if they didn&#x27;t have some very small smell of leather, then you would demand your money back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have had no issues, but it feels thin and unsubstantial.</li>
            <li> Does not look like leather poor quality</li>
            <li> Use it daily as a carry bag for my crap!</li>
            <li> Thought it would be fake leather</li>
            <li> What some others have written about with their horrible smell, is utter rubbish.</li>
            <li> I had to return these bags because they were musty and sent off an unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> BUT...it has a horrible musty odor that won&#x27;t quit.</li>

            <li> I like this bag a lot, it is very roomy and has been durable so far for me. I would recommend it to someone who is looking for a quality bag at a low price!</li>
            <li> so glad I found this bag at Amazon. My husband has needed a toiletry bag for quite some time. This is perfect. Nice and roomy amd because it&#x27;s leather, it will last a long time. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t appear to be real leather but it&#x27;s worth the cheap price</li>
            <li> Bags work great except the smell of mildew which I canceled by spraying mildew killer on them.....Thanks</li>
            <li> I decided this year to buy each of my Grandson&#x27;s one of these wonderful leather toiletry travel bags and fill it full of useful  items like deordorant, body washes etc.  This is a great Christmas gift and something very useful!</li>
            <li> I just received this bag today.  From the pic, I thought it was a dark brown color but it is actually black.  I still do not see a color noted on the site.  But it will work and feels good and is bigger than I thought it would be.  It&#x27;s a part of the Christmas gift I&#x27;m giving my hubs.  From the feel and the look I think it&#x27;s great for the price!</li>
            <li> I got this bag for a trip to the Bay Area. It is very nice, big enough to fit a full-sized shampoo bottle if traveling by car/bus/train (remember that airport security will not let you take large liquid containers).    Leather is not of the greatest quality but strong. For the price it is very reasonable and I&#x27;m glad I got this bag. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 10 year old son was vacation trips along with his school nature overnight outing. It is sturdy and well made and will do him just fine. He was pleased with it for it&#x27;s simplicity and won&#x27;t be embarrassed bringing it along with him.</li>
            <li> Very well made, soft leather and good zippers with plenty of room to hold everything you could want in a traveling bag.</li>
            <li> Sleek, professional and perfect for my husband when he travels.  Every toiletry item fits neatly into the large inner pocket or in the outside pocket.  He was delighted with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It works fine and I have had no issues, but it feels thin and unsubstantial. I would not recommend it, but it&#x27;s a close call.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new travel bag for my shaving stuff and found this.  It is priced well below what I think it is worth.  It is a quality product with lots of room for my travel stuff.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> All that was needed for the job. Large enough to hold all necessary items that were need. Soft rich leather</li>
            <li> More than I had hoped for!!!! Love the product!! Would recommend to anyone who needs a travel or toiletry bag!!!</li>
            <li> This bag looks cheap. I got it for my teenage son for a trip, I was not happy. Does not look like leather poor quality</li>
            <li> Very high quality bag.  Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> We got this as a Christmas gift for my father-in-law because my husband has had the same one for years.  It is real leather (it smelled like it as soon as we opened the box), and it wears well.</li>
            <li> This is a great bag.  Nice looking, beautiful leather, and I am very happy with it; and the price was good, too.</li>
            <li> Wanted a nice bag with two departments so I had my glasses in one and road miscellaneous in the other and this works just fine and looks really good.</li>
            <li> I had to return these bags because they were musty and sent off an unpleasant odor. Disappointed, because they were the right size and price.</li>
            <li> The item I received is not the same as the product depicted. I received an item which resembles a purse instead of a travel bag. The one I received is too large and is not compact as I had expected. Do not purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Leather is a little thin, but it holds up very well.  Since I&#x27;m a truck driver, it goes with me into a lot of truck stop restrooms.  It&#x27;s big enough to hold everything I have to bring on the road.  Glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> Incredibly soft travel bag and high quality construction make this the perfect bag to take with you on your journeys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toiletry bag for a couple years now and it has worn quite well. Frankly it looks like the day I bought it, at least on the outside. Very satisfied....</li>
            <li> Got this for a gift and they loved it.  I would recommend this to buy for anyone wanting a nice bag for travel.</li>
            <li> It is of a reasonable size to get the Items you need to take with you on a trip. Leather was soft and supple, and well made. Has a zippered side pocket. It was just what I needed for those long weekend trips.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my father and he was pleased with it. All his sundries were able to fit and it has a good appearance.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful soft leather bag which will be used for my husbands shaving products when we travel. It is a wonderful bag and the price is even better.</li>
            <li> As advertised, just what I was looking for at the right price. Use it daily as a carry bag for my crap!</li>
            <li> This item worked like expected.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with getting this item to work right out of the box.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect bag for what I needed...but...it smelled of mildew and I couldn&#x27;t figure out at way to get rid of the smell.  Had to return the bag.</li>
            <li> great bag at a great price.  will make a wonderful gift.  soft leather.  as described.  I would have liked a divider in the middle.  otherwise....perfect.</li>
            <li> Very good value for the price. Seems to be very durable and is just the right size. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot but for me I could be just a bit larger, then it would be just right.</li>
            <li> WELL CONSTRUCTED,ROOMY,SOFT LEATHER,ZIPPERS SEEM DURABLE. SIDE POCKET IS LARGER THAN EXPECTED,THAT IS A PLUS FOR ME.I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IT, WELL WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> great carry-all. well made. I had purchased one befor, then bought another fot my spouse</li>
            <li> Its nice; I paid practically nothing for it so I have to keep that in mind on my review.  Was I blown away? No but, again.... it was practically free it as so inexpensive. Bottom line is I use it.</li>
            <li> This does not look genuine leather. Also there is a slight tear near the zipper. I would recommend NOT buying this product.</li>
            <li> A good travel bag. There was a tiny scratch in the leather near the handle but other than that, a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a real lather travel bag for the cost of a cheap plastic one. I purchased a cheap plastic travel bag from Walmart rigt befoe I saw this one. For about the same price this one is real (patched) leather, soft and is made well. Walmart&#x27;s plastic bag went back to the store.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, product very good for low cost and very roomy; holds quite a number of toiletries with room to spare. Leather soft; would have preferred a smooth finish but the sewn design give it a unique look.</li>
            <li> This bag is not meant to be a top-of-the-line leather item.  It is, however, a most functional carrier for travel situations, having a large capacity.  I believe that it will hold up well, and it does the job for me. A good value for the money!</li>
            <li> I bought three of these travel bags for my sons for Christmas to go in a vacation-themed gift basket.  It was kind of a last minute purchase and I hadn&#x27;t done much comparison shopping.  I picked this particular bag because the picture looked good and it fit my price range.  I was very pleasantly surprised when the bags arrived.  The leather was soft and supple and had that awesome new leather smell.  The bags were bigger than I had anticipated, nice and roomy on the inside.  The best part was that after the initial flurry of opening gifts, one of my sons picked up his bag and really looked at it and commented on how nice it was and where did I get it?  Nice!</li>
            <li> This is really a great deal and a great bag. The leather is super soft and the quality is great.  It is a perfect size and holds a lot more items than canvas bags which tend to be really stiff.  My husband travels every week for work and has tried several bags and this is his favorite by far. Has a nice leather smell and looks great too.  I am tempted to buy a couple more for friends.</li>
            <li> This toiletry bag is very nice.  It is soft leather, very nice looking.  It holds a lot.  Gave it to my husband for Christmas, and he likes it very much.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality leather bag, especially for the price.  It is plenty large enough to hold all my bathroom stuff (electric razor, charger, toothpaste, toothbrush, hair cream, comb, mirror, eye drops, soap dish, shampoo, fingernail brush, misc OTC meds, bandaids, etc.) The zipper works good, and the carrying handle is handy.  The outside zippered compartment is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is where they put the zipper.  My previous shaving kit was the same size and shape, but opened on the flat side where this one opens on the top edge.  I find myself always having to dig through everything to find what I want, whereas my old one was much easier to get things since it opened on the flat side instead of the deep edge.  That said, it is a good shaving kit and I like it okay.</li>
            <li> beautiful and cheap. Two compartments.</li>
            <li> This bag was large enough and seems very sturdy. I bought it for my 22 yr. old son so we will see if it holds up very long but seems like it is great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this toiletry bag is genuine leather as named. I bought it less than a month now and the leather is already beginning to flake/peel.</li>
            <li> My friend was going into the hospital and his shaving kit was so old. I got him this one and he was so excited. He loved it and especially that it was leather! Very roomy.</li>
            <li> My son really liked this bag and used it immediately.  Since I had no idea of the dimensions I was equally pleased.</li>
            <li> It is a nice leather product.  Lots of space inside.  Classic look.  It was just what I had expected to get.</li>
            <li> Awesome and versatile!!! We needed a professional bag for our blood pressure cuff and stethoscope. This has worked out perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> A little bigger than I expected but provides lots of room for all my toiletry items. Like the outside zipper.  Great for women too.</li>
            <li> This is just what I ordered.  Arrived in 2 days.  Would like to have some hold down starps or pockets in the inside of the bag for toiletries.</li>
            <li> The bag was as advertised and the purchase price was very reasonable. My only advice for future buyers, the leather is not real thick, so heavy duty users hard on their things should be aware. It doesn&#x27;t affect my rating at all obviously, it&#x27;s just a heads up.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and it&#x27;s just what I needed BUT...it has a horrible musty odor that won&#x27;t quit. I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of the smell but so far nothing works. It&#x27;s been airing out in the garage for a few weeks so maybe by spring I&#x27;ll be able to use it.</li>
            <li> My husband is more than pleased with the quality and functionality of this toiletry bag.  It is light weight, roomy, and the leather is very soft.</li>
            <li> My expectations were exceeded. The bag is a high quality leather bag that is perfect for traveling or just general storage of items.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my use. Thought it would be fake leather but it is real leather and glove soft. Fits all my needs and will travel perfectly. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The quality of this bag was exceptional, especially at this price. The size was also unique. I plan to purchase a second bag.</li>
            <li> The kit arrived on time and was just as described.  The pockets are extra roomy and the kit will be very useful.</li>
            <li> perfect size.  use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight and fits in a backpack.  Love it.</li>
            <li> My son really likes it.  He used it for camp and it&#x27;s held up and just the right amount of room</li>
            <li> When I saw the price, I thought it couldn&#x27;t be much, but I&#x27;ll try it. I was very surprised when I opened the box. The toiletry bag was larger than I thought, and soft leather. It&#x27;s much nicer than my old one that I paid  more money for. A great buy.</li>
            <li> Nice bag that has held up well in 4 months of travel including a month in China and 4-6 trips to LA. Bag has been soaking wet on the outside and dry as a bone on the inside. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> This is quality leather toiletry bag.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Was a Christmas present for my new son-in-law that my daughter bought in surprise for him.  Came with a bunch of included items like razor and brush.  Looked great!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted for small personal items. Really fast shipping.  Got here way before I thought it would. Can&#x27;t wait for my next trip. Looks well made. For the price how can you complain.  I would buy another or buy one for a gift.</li>
            <li> Travel bag was exactly as described and a great buy!  I got it free using my Discover Card bonus points.</li>
            <li> Nice item. Spacious, classy, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband to replace a toiletry bag that was several years old.  This one is roomy and flexible; he reports that he loves it.</li>
            <li> Well, it smells like leather. It probably is. This bag is perfect for me. I don&#x27;t care a huge bottle of shampoo or what not in a bag like this. When you travel i think it&#x27;s silly to carry full size things if you have the option not to. So this bag is able to hold everything. My razor, box of q tips, toothbrush, etc. Has a nice side pocket I keep small items like toe nail clippers and tweezers at. I also keep a small bottle of RL Black cologne in it. All sorts of stuff this holds. Overall great value for what you get. I was thinking of getting the kenneth cole bag, but why? it&#x27;s a toiletry bag...and this one is leather and works just fine.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Shaving Bag for my husband. He loves it. It&#x27;s made well and the leather is supple and soft. Very roomy to hold many of your personal belongings. Women could even use this as a cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after a thorough search everywhere...It is durable with reasonable price. Would recommend this product to anyone who need a decent leather toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> These Toiletries bags are fantastic. They are leather, so they will offload some SLIGHT; smell. What some others have written about with their horrible smell, is utter rubbish. After a very short time (few hours), you will not smell anything from them, unless you put your nose to them, then it&#x27;s only slight. Also, if they didn&#x27;t have some very small smell of leather, then you would demand your money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 bags for myself. They are great. They have held up their first test with a tour of Europe, Middle East, then Australia.&lt;br /&gt;You could not pick a fault with their quality. I&#x27;ll be looking at buying my brothers and parents one each for Xmas 2013.</li>
            <li> I am a volleyball referee and I am using this to carry my supplies... rule book, whistles, etc.  It is slightly bigger than most bags sold for this purpose.  I am able to fit 8 1/2 x 11 paper folded in half.</li>
