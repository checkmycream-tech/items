    <ol>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and have used it for about 5 years now.  </li>
            <li>Nioxin is a great product.   </li>
            <li>great buy for the hair and my wife loves it..</li>
            <li>Nioxin Research Laboratories sold the business and now the great product is ruined.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with the results I have had from this product.</li>
            <li>good stuff, been using Nioxin products(systems) for years.</li>
            <li>I have used dandruff shampoos before and they didn&#x27;t work as good as the Nioxin duo.  </li>
            <li>An exceptional product, great price, and efficient and quick service from seller.</li>
            <li>Great price quick delivery</li>
            <li>I have my hair highlighted and is thinning and very fine.  </li>
            <li>Even if you are not experiencing thinning hair, I have found that this product works well for just creating more volume and bounce.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found it through Amazon</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have the strong menthol smell and there is no tingling on my scalp during application.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, I just didn&#x27;t receive it.  </li>
            <li>it is such a great deal.</li>
            <li>The Nioxin products arrived very quickly and I have been very please with the Nioxin System 3 Cleanser and scalp therapy.</li>
            <li>it makes hair feel light, airy not to mention very shiny.  </li>
            <li>B000ZICQ36 Nioxin System 1 Cleanser &amp; Scalp Therapy DUO Set (33.8oz) each]] issues right now</li>
            <li>ALso I have learned that although this USED to help grow hair, it is filled with the SAME chemicals as the regular cheap shampoos that contain so many harmful chemicals they make your hair fall out.</li>
            <li>I compared the list of ingredients on the new, Made in Mexico, bottle to the original formula on the Made in USA product, and they&lt;br /&gt;are</li>
            <li>Still loyal fan of Nioxin, but will most likley chose a different supplier next time...</li>
            <li>Shampoo and Conditioner that you can use everyday, but hair looks great the next day without washing.  </li>
            <li>not see a whole lot of change with this</li>
            <li>Product worked very well for regrowth.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>So glad to find this on Amazon and for much less than at my hair salon.</li>
            <li>They work, better than harsh chemical shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>The actual product seems to be okay, but the shipper chose to use electrical tape to ensure that the caps remained closed.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other shampoos, but this one is tops for the reasons mentioned and because it leaves my hair feeling clean - no residue.</li>
            <li>The tape must have melted enroute and I was not able to remove it cleanly from the bottle.   </li>
            <li>My hair stylist began using this on me when I began fighting a very flaky scalp due to stress.  </li>
            <li>I compared my old bottle to the new one and discovered the former says Made in the USA, while the other was Made in Mexico.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any thing else.  I have my hair highlighted and is thinning and very fine.  Have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 10 years now.  My hair was thinning when I started using it - it was thinning because it had been over-processed.  I continue using Nioxin because it worked so well at getting my hair shape; it continues to work well with my color-treated hair; and I like the minty fragrance.  I have tried other shampoos, but this one is tops for the reasons mentioned and because it leaves my hair feeling clean - no residue.</li>
            <li> They are marketing the 33oz duo but after they delivered it they say that it is a mistake and sent you a 10.9 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Never really did much for my hair... :-(</li>
            <li> Shampoo and Conditioner that you can use everyday, but hair looks great the next day without washing.  I have medium length hair it makes hair feel light, airy not to mention very shiny.  An exceptional product, great price, and efficient and quick service from seller.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin products arrived very quickly and I have been very please with the Nioxin System 3 Cleanser and scalp therapy.</li>
            <li> this product did not really promote any long growth to my hair, it just made it thicker. i&lt;br /&gt;did not see a whole lot of change with this, i think its just another overpriced shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am still waiting for my order that was placed over a month ago.  The product is fine, I just didn&#x27;t receive it.  I am wondering why the company is not following up on this.  They should at least send me another shipment.  What&#x27;s the matter with this company----the amount of the order has been deducted from my credit card.  Please help me.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Recently had hair thinning due to medication.   Product worked very well for regrowth.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month.  My hair feels and looks fuller and has stopped falling out.  I am delighted with the results I have had from this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased the set of 2 but realized they are not the usual cleanser and conditioner I have been using for years. They don&#x27;t have the strong menthol smell and there is no tingling on my scalp during application. My hair does not feel improved after washing. I compared my old bottle to the new one and discovered the former says Made in the USA, while the other was Made in Mexico. I would not buy from this site again.</li>
            <li> The actual product seems to be okay, but the shipper chose to use electrical tape to ensure that the caps remained closed.  The tape must have melted enroute and I was not able to remove it cleanly from the bottle.   Not ideal, but the product appears to be the real Nioxin.    I had a duo of the System 4 before this and System 3, although less expensive, seems to work just as well for me.   Nioxin is a great product.   It does have the Menthol smell, but it does not remain with you during the day.   Even if you are not experiencing thinning hair, I have found that this product works well for just creating more volume and bounce.  Still loyal fan of Nioxin, but will most likley chose a different supplier next time...</li>
            <li> great buy for the hair and my wife loves it.. she even talks to all the family to buy this product ..</li>
            <li> Great price quick delivery</li>
            <li> I am going through some health[[ASIN:B000ZICQ36 Nioxin System 1 Cleanser &amp; Scalp Therapy DUO Set (33.8oz) each]] issues right now and it was suggessted I use this shampoo to avoid hair loss. I have been using it for three months now and it seems to be helping a lot!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My hair dresser gave me a sample, so that is why I bought the larger size for my daughter and myself.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with my thyroid and had started to loose my hair.  I was devastated.  After using this product for three short months my hair is all back and thicker than before.</li>
            <li> good stuff, been using Nioxin products(systems) for years. They work, better than harsh chemical shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a completely different product now and it doesn&#x27;t work.  I compared the list of ingredients on the new, Made in Mexico, bottle to the original formula on the Made in USA product, and they&lt;br /&gt;are completely different!  They should not call it Nioxin at all.  Nioxin Research Laboratories sold the business and now the great product is ruined.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist began using this on me when I began fighting a very flaky scalp due to stress.  I couldn&#x27;t beleive the difference this product made.  I have used dandruff shampoos before and they didn&#x27;t work as good as the Nioxin duo.  So glad to find this on Amazon and for much less than at my hair salon.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the same product. They changed it, it is completely different. ALso I have learned that although this USED to help grow hair, it is filled with the SAME chemicals as the regular cheap shampoos that contain so many harmful chemicals they make your hair fall out. So whats the point, besides paying an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> i have used nioxin in the past and i like it.i dont lose as much hair with this product. i need to get the booster too.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and have used it for about 5 years now.  So glad I found it through Amazon it is such a great deal.</li>
