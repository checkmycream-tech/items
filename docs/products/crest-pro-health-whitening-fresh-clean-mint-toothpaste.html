    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best whitening toothpaste I have ever found anywhere.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Best on the market in my opinion</li>
            <li>I have excellent oral hygiene and take very good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is not watery and does a great job freshening breath.</li>
            <li>Great deal on this bulk item.</li>
            <li>Did not have to brave the crowds to get it.</li>
            <li>He stopped using it because he wasn&#x27;t happy about the possibility of stained teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price was fair and shipping terms were great.  </li>
            <li>Colgate does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest does a good job, and I have no difficulties of the sort others have described.</li>
            <li>Crest has been coming out with a lot of good toothpaste.</li>
            <li>We both loved it.</li>
            <li>Crest&#x27;s \\&quot;Pro-Health\\&quot; line of teeth care products imply without any  explanation that they are superior to run of the mill toothpastes and mouth washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for Crest.</li>
            <li>I have had good results from their 3D Whitening Rinse and its 1 minute of contact time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If all goes well, this toothpaste may be a good whitening option for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either way, I wasn&#x27;t very happy having to clean it up.</li>
            <li>Like most of them, this toothpaste works great.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m one of many others who&#x27;ve been harmed by this product, shame on you Crest toothpaste, the consumer has spoken!</li>
            <li>Crest has better options!</li>
            <li>cause it sounded good, but turned out it was too good to be true!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how they can keep coming up with a variety of types of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>But it at your own risk but buy a back-up tooth paste just in case.</li>
            <li>Though it had a nice taste that I liked, during the day my mouth burned and peeled after one brushing with it.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t honestly say that my teeth are getting any whiter, but they do seem like they are shinier.</li>
            <li>It creates more room in my medicine cabinet and it looks good when it stands around the bathroom</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a sample of this toothpaste for review, opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this is a nice toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The cap does NOT attach very easily.  </li>
            <li>The taste is very strong (and stronger than Sensodyne).  </li>
            <li>think for many people, this is either way too strong or contains an ingredient that we are allergic to---which can&#x27;t ge good</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase, very happy with the product, exactly as expected from a Crest brand name, and at a very, very reasonable price to boot.  </li>
            <li>My wife tested this product and found that it is good, but nothing really special.</li>
            <li>To us, this was just toothpaste, good, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>For the first three weeks or so of using it, i experienced sensitivity in some of my teeth during use because of the fluoride they put in for the whitening.  </li>
            <li>More is better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff a lot, love the grit and the flavor.  </li>
            <li>I tried brushing more and more.</li>
            <li>I started to think the toothpaste may not be safe.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has kept my teeth looking OK in fact they look better than when I started using it.  </li>
            <li>I have never had more than one canker sore in my mouth at a time in my life.</li>
            <li>as many others have</li>
            <li>I think they should change that because there seem to be too many reactions, not just some fluke here and there.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product and I like the taste and</li>
            <li>/&gt;We also love [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>but this gel version is better than their paste version.</li>
            <li>I love the Crest Pro Health Whitening-there is no tartar buildup and my gums are healthy after using it for 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Crest toothpaste in my opinion is one of the best toothpastes for oral hygiene that is currently on the market.</li>
            <li>Thus, I am not so sure about this</li>
            <li>The engineers at PROCTER AND GAMBLE need to design a better cap.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>And had my traditional PERFECT cleaning.</li>
            <li>and we love it, and we have since purchased it ourselves....</li>
            <li>I like the top that allows it to stand up.</li>
            <li>Pro-health has a bit more of a fluoride flavor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, the toothpaste works well, but admittedly, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working better than non-Pro-Health line toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a winning combo for me along with the Rinse.</li>
            <li>But I can confidently say this is now my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the mint flavor and the texture.</li>
            <li>However, I like the Crest flip cap better - easier access.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Eh, better to vote with my money...</li>
            <li>The minty taste is OK.</li>
            <li>The flavor of the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is milder and more refreshing.  </li>
            <li>The best way to describe it is that it is somewhat stringy, and does not clear the tip well after putting it on your toothbrush.</li>
            <li>toothpaste is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I guess all I can really say is that if you see Crest you know its going to be good.  </li>
            <li>Makes it EASY to apply paste to the brush</li>
            <li>I like the ease of extracting the toothpaste from the tube and the fact that is stands on the counter for easy reach.</li>
            <li>It lasts on the brush for a sustained, vigorous brushing, and yet cleans off quite easily.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this toothpaste is a strong contender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the strong mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>paste itself is fine.  </li>
            <li>Everything worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>Although I liked the Rinse, this toothpaste is my new favorite paste of choice.</li>
            <li>No unpleasant taste and my teeth feel very clean after using this.  </li>
            <li>Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free]]</li>
            <li>mouthwash, which genuinely protects and rebuilds enamel, fights decay and plaque and protects gums.</li>
            <li>It has a nice minty flavor that I really like.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much,</li>
            <li>Got a free sample of this.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product, though the opinions in this review are all</li>
            <li>Maybe it is a luck-of-the-draw kind of thing, but I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much.</li>
            <li>A step in the right direction for sure.</li>
            <li>The minty flavor is rather light, and my teeth and gums feel really clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; If this new product makes my teeth whiter as well, I&#x27;ll be even more pleased.</li>
            <li>so I think people need to be aware of what is in this or any toothpaste and check with their dentists to see if it is okay for them to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was never a big fan of the taste of Crest - always liked the taste of Colgate better -</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste 7.8 Oz</li>
            <li>Got this Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste along with the Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse (reviewed there, 4 out of 5).</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste 7.8 Oz (Pack of 4)]]at all.</li>
            <li>Mint flavor was just right and not to strong.</li>
            <li>I find it to be a good toothpaste, but nothing better than average.</li>
            <li>Works better than all the high dollar ones!</li>
            <li>Your mouth is full of bacteria.  </li>
            <li>The one thing that did stand out about this toothpaste was how sweet it was, cloyingly so.  </li>
            <li>When I made the switch, however, I was happy to discover that not only has the old pasty paste been changed to a more gel-like formula, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with tooth or gum sensitivity.</li>
            <li>After I rinsed, I didn&#x27;t feel there was anything left in my mouth, which was good.  </li>
            <li>Cool flavor</li>
            <li>so fresh and so clean, clean.</li>
            <li>The mint wasn&#x27;t too strong or hot, as I find can be the case with some mint flavors in oral care products.  </li>
            <li>Make my mouth feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth just feel clean, and my breath fresh, after using this</li>
            <li>review is from: Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste 6 Oz</li>
            <li>Clean and Fresh.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to eat anything more than vanilla ice cream, milk, and white bread for 4 days now.</li>
            <li>maybe you&#x27;ll be one of the lucky ones who don&#x27;t experience any of these symptoms, but why take the chance?</li>
            <li>I could see kids liking this for that reason, but the super sweetness coupled with the lack of whitening means I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li>Be careful, if your mouth is sensitive it might not be the best option.</li>
            <li>It has polishers--feels like \\&quot;grit\\&quot; but they dissolve quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is like those, but with a mild minty taste.</li>
            <li>Products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of the teeth, adequate toothbrushing may prevent these stains which are not harmful or permanent and may be removed by a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste, I was brushing with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>and I know there are other people out there loving the idea of having many choices.</li>
            <li>I love the new flip-top covers on Crest products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no peeling, sores or anything else described by some people, it may be that some people are more sensitive to these things than others, if you are use something else, the market is full of whitening toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s still true after using this one (though I highly recommend the 2 hour whitening strips which are fantastic).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a longtime Crest user but the ProHealth and Crest flavored with cinnamon (the Fresh Burst?)</li>
            <li>and you will see there are more negative experiences than good.  </li>
            <li>Youcannot have the same kind of confidence in the cap, as you can have with the lids of TUPPERWARE containers.  </li>
            <li>The crest whitening products boast a whiter smile in seven days.</li>
            <li>The idea of doing something I do every day anyway to whiten my smile seemed like a winner to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>taste of this toothpaste is pretty good, but the texture is really strange.</li>
            <li>so I would go ahead and finish the tube, unlike the mouthwash, which is kind of gross.</li>
            <li>This is Crest plus, with some kind of tingly-feeling bursts (think pop-rocks candy) as you brush, along with somewhat gritty paste.</li>
            <li>It has two powerful ingredients: Therapeutic Stannous Fluoride to protect against gingivitis, plaque, cavities and tooth sensitivity; and Sodium Hexametaphospahte, which is a stain-fighting ingredient.</li>
            <li>You would think after so many people having their skin PEEL off that some action would be taken.</li>
            <li>My teeth have had a nice yellow tint for decades, and no amount of \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; tooth pastes ever seem to help.  </li>
            <li>We tested two different Crest products, this and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Invigorating Clean Mint Toothpaste, and we both agreed that the Crest Pro-Health is much better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from this \\&quot;Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint</li>
            <li>My teeth may not be much whiter after I use this, but boy, they feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Sure, this may be some new and improved variety of Crest, but all that I really care about is that its Crest.  </li>
            <li>I think its a good paste, but it depends on whether you want something that is strong and thick or not.</li>
            <li>I received this for free because I am a member of Smiley360, which is a (WOM) Word of Mouth company, where you get to try things for free, and give your honest review, even if that review is negative..</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a week, which may not be long enough to fairly judge this product, but so far all I can say is that it effectively cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I loved the gritty texture that helped scrub my teeth clean and left my mouth feeling fresh and the minty taste lingered until I drank my first cup of coffee.</li>
            <li>very very white.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro-health has minty crystals (not sure exactly what the correct term is) and it is very refreshing and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is all right as far as how it feels and how clean it makes my teeth.</li>
            <li>We liked this toothpaste before buying this, but this was a bigger tube than what we normally get.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Crest toothpaste and have been using it, in combination with Sonicare toothbrushes, for many years.</li>
            <li>The result has been that I&#x27;ve been able to curtail regular dental checkups, since time after time I was hearing,</li>
            <li>This is striking contrast to SILICONE, which does contain silicon atoms, but in a structure that is totally different from that of SILICA.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought that it was growing fungus, because of the bluish color.  </li>
            <li>It is a cut and paste of the first review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That might be the fact that I&#x27;m paying more attention to my brushing, or it might actually be a change in my teeth, who knows.</li>
            <li>After telling my dentist that nothing was different except for the paste, he just reiterated that I needed to do better.  </li>
            <li>However it has a nice flip-top cap which snaps closed.</li>
            <li>how exactly is it different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It seems more minty than the Crest Pro Health clean mint flavor which I also reviewed but other</li>
            <li>my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste left my mouth with a cool, clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have tried free samples of other toothpastes, and they just don&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling as clean or my breath as fresh as Crest.  </li>
            <li>I liked its consistency, was surprised it had no gritty texture, considering it is advertised as a \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; paste.</li>
            <li>Colgate Total Advanced Fresh Whitening Gel Toothpaste, 5.8-Ounce</li>
            <li>ey360, which is a (WOM) Word of Mouth company, where you get to try things for free, and give your honest review, even if that review is negative..</li>
            <li>being said I saw a lot of positive things about this fluoride when I searched the web.</li>
            <li>Anyway, if you have less severe problems then this is probably just as good as anything, though I&#x27;m sure other kinds are cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I have used rest all my life and pretty much intend to continue using it.</li>
            <li>The paste is very minty, and you don&#x27;t need much to get the job done!  </li>
            <li>This is one of the rare toothpastes that actually leaves your mouth feeling clean after you use it.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste to me is just a middle of the road toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I prefer, just the plain crest toothpaste without any whitening or mouthwash bill into it, I like to know my mouth is clean and healthy</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s purchase price certainly beats any competitor, brick and mortat or otherwise.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and smooth after brushing, and while the flavor isn&#x27;t quite as minty as some other varieties, it is still pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve experienced no irritation from using the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste, and over the last few weeks have shown a reduction of surface stains.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price at my local stores and free shipping is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s far from rare.</li>
            <li>The real deal, without health-endangering alcohol.</li>
            <li>The reason is that the cap is flimsy and needs extra care to attach securely.  </li>
            <li>My whole life I have always used Crest.  </li>
            <li>Not so much the distribution method.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve changed absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>(my mom really got it stuck in my head</li>
            <li>She really didn&#x27;t see any difference in the color of her teeth after using this for a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>B001OOLF82 Sensodyne Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste, Alpine Breeze, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my mouth feel, and my teeth seem whiter after using it for two weeks.  </li>
            <li>There are many I like better, but I&#x27;ve used worse.</li>
            <li>The product under review is unusual, in that the tube is bulky and fat, somewhat like the new breed of ketchup bottles that first appeared, perhaps, in the 1980s.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say if it helps whiten your teeth more than any other toothpaste, but it certainty doesn&#x27;t hurt  </li>
            <li>My mouth definitely felt clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Because of the runny toothpaste, a better cap would have been a conventional screw-on cap.</li>
            <li>They work pretty well so far.  </li>
            <li>With so many products available I&#x27;d suggest another toothpaste, or at the very least getting your dentists opinion on Crest Pro Health before using.</li>
            <li>It has caused severe reactions for many people, myself and a previous commenter included.</li>
            <li>But he agreed it was odd that so many people had reactions to it.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my regular toothpaste and my mouth is okay.  </li>
            <li>&quot; The information further states that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have since switched back to my Aqua fresh extreme clean which I&#x27;ve used for years with no ill side-effects.</li>
            <li>This is a duplicate review as amazonvine apparently has no record of the first review.</li>
            <li>In fairness, they are pretty white to begin with, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting to see a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though there is definite grit included, the high level of mint leaves me with a very fresh, sparkling clean feeling, though it is a little sugary for my taste.</li>
            <li>You may be fine, however with all the other choices out there why take a chance?</li>
            <li>, some have more sensitive mouths, but for me - this toothpaste has completely maintained my mouth for the last 3 years while saving for dental work that was deemed &#x27;crucial&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each 6 oz tube of Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is promoted to help reveal your natural white smile while fighting cavities, gingivitis, plaque, and tartar plus relieve sensitivity in otherwise normal teeth.  </li>
            <li>My dentist said it could have been an a reaction to a new toothpaste, and bingo</li>
            <li>Decades of abuse can not be undone by a fancy new formula</li>
            <li>The particular formulation used for the toothpaste under review is more watery than a conventional white toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>SILICONE is a very soft compound, and it is sometimes known as synthetic rubber.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like I&#x27;ve just gotten a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest Pro-Health is the first and only leading toothpaste that protects against sensitivity and</li>
            <li>Nothing else about it stands out other than it is gritty like most Crest Pro-Health Toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say my teeth are white, but an improvement is evident.  </li>
            <li>I was a little leery trying Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste because I did not like a similar Crest product  </li>
            <li>I had more plaque build-up, some swollen gum tissue, and was told to get back to my previous brushing habits.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to carefully wipe it after each use, or clean the lid every other day or so, the product is worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Colegate didn&#x27;t work as well for me, maybe it will work better for you, hard to say?  </li>
            <li>see a lot of reviews here talking about teeth staining and damaged gums, I&#x27;ve been using this for a week or so now and haven&#x27;t had any issues other than super minty breath.  </li>
            <li>The last dental visit, the dentist said \\&quot;you must not drink much coffee or tea since your teeth aren&#x27;t stained.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Just sensitive teeth stuff, I think.</li>
            <li>My brother wanted to try it, and so far he has not had any issues.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is marketed for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>And it happened to save this 28 year old from needing teeth pulled and root canals after being homeless for some time.</li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive teeth and gums and this toothpaste helps with that.</li>
            <li>My teeth have gotten sensitive with age</li>
            <li>The composition of the toothpaste had been developed by Drs.</li>
            <li>Instead of the old screw-on variety, the cap is a fold up type, which might work well except for:&lt;br /&gt;Two  - the consistency.</li>
            <li>short, I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>B001WAKI2W Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect Toothpaste, 6.0-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)]].  </li>
            <li>Seems to get the job done as far as cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>since my teeth are sensitive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest is a brand I frequently purchase and trust for my oral care needs.</li>
            <li>on sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It is an intense toothpaste that not only cleans your teeth, but vigorously uses chemicals to whiten them.  </li>
            <li>I only have one complaint and mass that they have brought out a mass variety that does various things to keep your oral hygiene in Optimum health.</li>
            <li>I mean it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to magically solve all the problems in my mouth with just one tube.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various whitening toothpastes over the years and have never really noticed any significant whitening.  </li>
            <li>you have allergies, sensitive teeth and gums, or have had reactions to other products, you may want to steer clear of this as it contains something that isn&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li>Several cups a day, strong coffee black.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I had one major problem with this product.  </li>
            <li>I take pride in having clean teeth and needing very little scraping/picking/etc during a cleaning</li>
            <li>At first it used stannous fluoride, as the active ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I was very concerned when I noticed after brushing that the inside of my mouth felt shriveled and very dry.</li>
            <li>For the longest time in my adult life I avoided Crest toothpaste because I remembered that literally pasty consistency that just felt gross in my mouth.</li>
            <li>but the information makes me wonder if I really should be using this and the information is under an \\&quot;Other information\\&quot; section rather than a \\&quot;warning\\&quot; section.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only, minor, complaint - the flip top on the tube broke almost immediately.</li>
            <li>After the first night I used it, I woke up to a big mess of toothpaste all over the lid and leaking out onto the shelf it was sitting on.  </li>
            <li>It does make my mouth a little dry, as most toothpastes do, but I drink a little water afterwards and it goes away.</li>

            <li> Great toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Best on the market in my opinion</li>
            <li> I have excellent oral hygiene and take very good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is not watery and does a great job freshening breath.</li>
            <li> Great deal on this bulk item.</li>
            <li> Did not have to brave the crowds to get it.</li>
            <li> He stopped using it because he wasn&#x27;t happy about the possibility of stained teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price was fair and shipping terms were great.  </li>
            <li> Colgate does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest does a good job, and I have no difficulties of the sort others have described.</li>
            <li> Crest has been coming out with a lot of good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> We both loved it.</li>
            <li> Crest&#x27;s \\&quot;Pro-Health\\&quot; line of teeth care products imply without any  explanation that they are superior to run of the mill toothpastes and mouth washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for Crest.</li>
            <li> I have had good results from their 3D Whitening Rinse and its 1 minute of contact time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If all goes well, this toothpaste may be a good whitening option for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either way, I wasn&#x27;t very happy having to clean it up.</li>
            <li> Like most of them, this toothpaste works great.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m one of many others who&#x27;ve been harmed by this product, shame on you Crest toothpaste, the consumer has spoken!</li>
            <li> Crest has better options!</li>
            <li> cause it sounded good, but turned out it was too good to be true!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how they can keep coming up with a variety of types of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> But it at your own risk but buy a back-up tooth paste just in case.</li>
            <li> Though it had a nice taste that I liked, during the day my mouth burned and peeled after one brushing with it.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t honestly say that my teeth are getting any whiter, but they do seem like they are shinier.</li>
            <li> It creates more room in my medicine cabinet and it looks good when it stands around the bathroom</li>
            <li> /&gt;**I received a sample of this toothpaste for review, opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this is a nice toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The cap does NOT attach very easily.  </li>
            <li> The taste is very strong (and stronger than Sensodyne).  </li>
            <li> think for many people, this is either way too strong or contains an ingredient that we are allergic to---which can&#x27;t ge good</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase, very happy with the product, exactly as expected from a Crest brand name, and at a very, very reasonable price to boot.  </li>
            <li> My wife tested this product and found that it is good, but nothing really special.</li>
            <li> To us, this was just toothpaste, good, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> For the first three weeks or so of using it, i experienced sensitivity in some of my teeth during use because of the fluoride they put in for the whitening.  </li>
            <li> More is better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff a lot, love the grit and the flavor.  </li>
            <li> I tried brushing more and more.</li>
            <li> I started to think the toothpaste may not be safe.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has kept my teeth looking OK in fact they look better than when I started using it.  </li>
            <li> I have never had more than one canker sore in my mouth at a time in my life.</li>
            <li> as many others have</li>
            <li> I think they should change that because there seem to be too many reactions, not just some fluke here and there.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product and I like the taste and</li>
            <li> /&gt;We also love [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but this gel version is better than their paste version.</li>
            <li> I love the Crest Pro Health Whitening-there is no tartar buildup and my gums are healthy after using it for 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Crest toothpaste in my opinion is one of the best toothpastes for oral hygiene that is currently on the market.</li>
            <li> Thus, I am not so sure about this</li>
            <li> The engineers at PROCTER AND GAMBLE need to design a better cap.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> And had my traditional PERFECT cleaning.</li>
            <li> and we love it, and we have since purchased it ourselves....</li>
            <li> I like the top that allows it to stand up.</li>
            <li> Pro-health has a bit more of a fluoride flavor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, the toothpaste works well, but admittedly, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working better than non-Pro-Health line toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a winning combo for me along with the Rinse.</li>
            <li> But I can confidently say this is now my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the mint flavor and the texture.</li>
            <li> However, I like the Crest flip cap better - easier access.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Eh, better to vote with my money...</li>
            <li> The minty taste is OK.</li>
            <li> The flavor of the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is milder and more refreshing.  </li>
            <li> The best way to describe it is that it is somewhat stringy, and does not clear the tip well after putting it on your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> toothpaste is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I guess all I can really say is that if you see Crest you know its going to be good.  </li>
            <li> Makes it EASY to apply paste to the brush</li>
            <li> I like the ease of extracting the toothpaste from the tube and the fact that is stands on the counter for easy reach.</li>
            <li> It lasts on the brush for a sustained, vigorous brushing, and yet cleans off quite easily.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this toothpaste is a strong contender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the strong mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> paste itself is fine.  </li>
            <li> Everything worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> Although I liked the Rinse, this toothpaste is my new favorite paste of choice.</li>
            <li> No unpleasant taste and my teeth feel very clean after using this.  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free]]</li>
            <li> mouthwash, which genuinely protects and rebuilds enamel, fights decay and plaque and protects gums.</li>
            <li> It has a nice minty flavor that I really like.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much,</li>
            <li> Got a free sample of this.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product, though the opinions in this review are all</li>
            <li> Maybe it is a luck-of-the-draw kind of thing, but I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much.</li>
            <li> A step in the right direction for sure.</li>
            <li> The minty flavor is rather light, and my teeth and gums feel really clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; If this new product makes my teeth whiter as well, I&#x27;ll be even more pleased.</li>
            <li> so I think people need to be aware of what is in this or any toothpaste and check with their dentists to see if it is okay for them to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was never a big fan of the taste of Crest - always liked the taste of Colgate better -</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste 7.8 Oz</li>
            <li> Got this Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste along with the Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse (reviewed there, 4 out of 5).</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste 7.8 Oz (Pack of 4)]]at all.</li>
            <li> Mint flavor was just right and not to strong.</li>
            <li> I find it to be a good toothpaste, but nothing better than average.</li>
            <li> Works better than all the high dollar ones!</li>
            <li> Your mouth is full of bacteria.  </li>
            <li> The one thing that did stand out about this toothpaste was how sweet it was, cloyingly so.  </li>
            <li> When I made the switch, however, I was happy to discover that not only has the old pasty paste been changed to a more gel-like formula, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with tooth or gum sensitivity.</li>
            <li> After I rinsed, I didn&#x27;t feel there was anything left in my mouth, which was good.  </li>
            <li> Cool flavor</li>
            <li> so fresh and so clean, clean.</li>
            <li> The mint wasn&#x27;t too strong or hot, as I find can be the case with some mint flavors in oral care products.  </li>
            <li> Make my mouth feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth just feel clean, and my breath fresh, after using this</li>
            <li> review is from: Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste 6 Oz</li>
            <li> Clean and Fresh.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to eat anything more than vanilla ice cream, milk, and white bread for 4 days now.</li>
            <li> maybe you&#x27;ll be one of the lucky ones who don&#x27;t experience any of these symptoms, but why take the chance?</li>
            <li> I could see kids liking this for that reason, but the super sweetness coupled with the lack of whitening means I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Be careful, if your mouth is sensitive it might not be the best option.</li>
            <li> It has polishers--feels like \\&quot;grit\\&quot; but they dissolve quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is like those, but with a mild minty taste.</li>
            <li> Products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of the teeth, adequate toothbrushing may prevent these stains which are not harmful or permanent and may be removed by a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste, I was brushing with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and I know there are other people out there loving the idea of having many choices.</li>
            <li> I love the new flip-top covers on Crest products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no peeling, sores or anything else described by some people, it may be that some people are more sensitive to these things than others, if you are use something else, the market is full of whitening toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s still true after using this one (though I highly recommend the 2 hour whitening strips which are fantastic).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime Crest user but the ProHealth and Crest flavored with cinnamon (the Fresh Burst?)</li>
            <li> and you will see there are more negative experiences than good.  </li>
            <li> Youcannot have the same kind of confidence in the cap, as you can have with the lids of TUPPERWARE containers.  </li>
            <li> The crest whitening products boast a whiter smile in seven days.</li>
            <li> The idea of doing something I do every day anyway to whiten my smile seemed like a winner to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> taste of this toothpaste is pretty good, but the texture is really strange.</li>
            <li> so I would go ahead and finish the tube, unlike the mouthwash, which is kind of gross.</li>
            <li> This is Crest plus, with some kind of tingly-feeling bursts (think pop-rocks candy) as you brush, along with somewhat gritty paste.</li>
            <li> It has two powerful ingredients: Therapeutic Stannous Fluoride to protect against gingivitis, plaque, cavities and tooth sensitivity; and Sodium Hexametaphospahte, which is a stain-fighting ingredient.</li>
            <li> You would think after so many people having their skin PEEL off that some action would be taken.</li>
            <li> My teeth have had a nice yellow tint for decades, and no amount of \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; tooth pastes ever seem to help.  </li>
            <li> We tested two different Crest products, this and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Invigorating Clean Mint Toothpaste, and we both agreed that the Crest Pro-Health is much better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this \\&quot;Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint</li>
            <li> My teeth may not be much whiter after I use this, but boy, they feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Sure, this may be some new and improved variety of Crest, but all that I really care about is that its Crest.  </li>
            <li> I think its a good paste, but it depends on whether you want something that is strong and thick or not.</li>
            <li> I received this for free because I am a member of Smiley360, which is a (WOM) Word of Mouth company, where you get to try things for free, and give your honest review, even if that review is negative..</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week, which may not be long enough to fairly judge this product, but so far all I can say is that it effectively cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I loved the gritty texture that helped scrub my teeth clean and left my mouth feeling fresh and the minty taste lingered until I drank my first cup of coffee.</li>
            <li> very very white.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-health has minty crystals (not sure exactly what the correct term is) and it is very refreshing and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is all right as far as how it feels and how clean it makes my teeth.</li>
            <li> We liked this toothpaste before buying this, but this was a bigger tube than what we normally get.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Crest toothpaste and have been using it, in combination with Sonicare toothbrushes, for many years.</li>
            <li> The result has been that I&#x27;ve been able to curtail regular dental checkups, since time after time I was hearing,</li>
            <li> This is striking contrast to SILICONE, which does contain silicon atoms, but in a structure that is totally different from that of SILICA.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought that it was growing fungus, because of the bluish color.  </li>
            <li> It is a cut and paste of the first review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That might be the fact that I&#x27;m paying more attention to my brushing, or it might actually be a change in my teeth, who knows.</li>
            <li> After telling my dentist that nothing was different except for the paste, he just reiterated that I needed to do better.  </li>
            <li> However it has a nice flip-top cap which snaps closed.</li>
            <li> how exactly is it different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It seems more minty than the Crest Pro Health clean mint flavor which I also reviewed but other</li>
            <li> my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste left my mouth with a cool, clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have tried free samples of other toothpastes, and they just don&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling as clean or my breath as fresh as Crest.  </li>
            <li> I liked its consistency, was surprised it had no gritty texture, considering it is advertised as a \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; paste.</li>
            <li> Colgate Total Advanced Fresh Whitening Gel Toothpaste, 5.8-Ounce</li>
            <li> ey360, which is a (WOM) Word of Mouth company, where you get to try things for free, and give your honest review, even if that review is negative..</li>
            <li> being said I saw a lot of positive things about this fluoride when I searched the web.</li>
            <li> Anyway, if you have less severe problems then this is probably just as good as anything, though I&#x27;m sure other kinds are cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I have used rest all my life and pretty much intend to continue using it.</li>
            <li> The paste is very minty, and you don&#x27;t need much to get the job done!  </li>
            <li> This is one of the rare toothpastes that actually leaves your mouth feeling clean after you use it.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste to me is just a middle of the road toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I prefer, just the plain crest toothpaste without any whitening or mouthwash bill into it, I like to know my mouth is clean and healthy</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s purchase price certainly beats any competitor, brick and mortat or otherwise.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and smooth after brushing, and while the flavor isn&#x27;t quite as minty as some other varieties, it is still pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve experienced no irritation from using the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste, and over the last few weeks have shown a reduction of surface stains.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price at my local stores and free shipping is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s far from rare.</li>
            <li> The real deal, without health-endangering alcohol.</li>
            <li> The reason is that the cap is flimsy and needs extra care to attach securely.  </li>
            <li> My whole life I have always used Crest.  </li>
            <li> Not so much the distribution method.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve changed absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> (my mom really got it stuck in my head</li>
            <li> She really didn&#x27;t see any difference in the color of her teeth after using this for a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> B001OOLF82 Sensodyne Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste, Alpine Breeze, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my mouth feel, and my teeth seem whiter after using it for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> There are many I like better, but I&#x27;ve used worse.</li>
            <li> The product under review is unusual, in that the tube is bulky and fat, somewhat like the new breed of ketchup bottles that first appeared, perhaps, in the 1980s.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say if it helps whiten your teeth more than any other toothpaste, but it certainty doesn&#x27;t hurt  </li>
            <li> My mouth definitely felt clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Because of the runny toothpaste, a better cap would have been a conventional screw-on cap.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well so far.  </li>
            <li> With so many products available I&#x27;d suggest another toothpaste, or at the very least getting your dentists opinion on Crest Pro Health before using.</li>
            <li> It has caused severe reactions for many people, myself and a previous commenter included.</li>
            <li> But he agreed it was odd that so many people had reactions to it.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my regular toothpaste and my mouth is okay.  </li>
            <li> &quot; The information further states that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have since switched back to my Aqua fresh extreme clean which I&#x27;ve used for years with no ill side-effects.</li>
            <li> This is a duplicate review as amazonvine apparently has no record of the first review.</li>
            <li> In fairness, they are pretty white to begin with, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting to see a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though there is definite grit included, the high level of mint leaves me with a very fresh, sparkling clean feeling, though it is a little sugary for my taste.</li>
            <li> You may be fine, however with all the other choices out there why take a chance?</li>
            <li> , some have more sensitive mouths, but for me - this toothpaste has completely maintained my mouth for the last 3 years while saving for dental work that was deemed &#x27;crucial&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each 6 oz tube of Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is promoted to help reveal your natural white smile while fighting cavities, gingivitis, plaque, and tartar plus relieve sensitivity in otherwise normal teeth.  </li>
            <li> My dentist said it could have been an a reaction to a new toothpaste, and bingo</li>
            <li> Decades of abuse can not be undone by a fancy new formula</li>
            <li> The particular formulation used for the toothpaste under review is more watery than a conventional white toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> SILICONE is a very soft compound, and it is sometimes known as synthetic rubber.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like I&#x27;ve just gotten a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest Pro-Health is the first and only leading toothpaste that protects against sensitivity and</li>
            <li> Nothing else about it stands out other than it is gritty like most Crest Pro-Health Toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say my teeth are white, but an improvement is evident.  </li>
            <li> I was a little leery trying Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste because I did not like a similar Crest product  </li>
            <li> I had more plaque build-up, some swollen gum tissue, and was told to get back to my previous brushing habits.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to carefully wipe it after each use, or clean the lid every other day or so, the product is worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Colegate didn&#x27;t work as well for me, maybe it will work better for you, hard to say?  </li>
            <li> see a lot of reviews here talking about teeth staining and damaged gums, I&#x27;ve been using this for a week or so now and haven&#x27;t had any issues other than super minty breath.  </li>
            <li> The last dental visit, the dentist said \\&quot;you must not drink much coffee or tea since your teeth aren&#x27;t stained.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Just sensitive teeth stuff, I think.</li>
            <li> My brother wanted to try it, and so far he has not had any issues.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is marketed for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> And it happened to save this 28 year old from needing teeth pulled and root canals after being homeless for some time.</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive teeth and gums and this toothpaste helps with that.</li>
            <li> My teeth have gotten sensitive with age</li>
            <li> The composition of the toothpaste had been developed by Drs.</li>
            <li> Instead of the old screw-on variety, the cap is a fold up type, which might work well except for:&lt;br /&gt;Two  - the consistency.</li>
            <li> short, I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> B001WAKI2W Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect Toothpaste, 6.0-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)]].  </li>
            <li> Seems to get the job done as far as cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> since my teeth are sensitive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest is a brand I frequently purchase and trust for my oral care needs.</li>
            <li> on sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It is an intense toothpaste that not only cleans your teeth, but vigorously uses chemicals to whiten them.  </li>
            <li> I only have one complaint and mass that they have brought out a mass variety that does various things to keep your oral hygiene in Optimum health.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to magically solve all the problems in my mouth with just one tube.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various whitening toothpastes over the years and have never really noticed any significant whitening.  </li>
            <li> you have allergies, sensitive teeth and gums, or have had reactions to other products, you may want to steer clear of this as it contains something that isn&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li> Several cups a day, strong coffee black.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I had one major problem with this product.  </li>
            <li> I take pride in having clean teeth and needing very little scraping/picking/etc during a cleaning</li>
            <li> At first it used stannous fluoride, as the active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I was very concerned when I noticed after brushing that the inside of my mouth felt shriveled and very dry.</li>
            <li> For the longest time in my adult life I avoided Crest toothpaste because I remembered that literally pasty consistency that just felt gross in my mouth.</li>
            <li> but the information makes me wonder if I really should be using this and the information is under an \\&quot;Other information\\&quot; section rather than a \\&quot;warning\\&quot; section.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only, minor, complaint - the flip top on the tube broke almost immediately.</li>
            <li> After the first night I used it, I woke up to a big mess of toothpaste all over the lid and leaking out onto the shelf it was sitting on.  </li>
            <li> It does make my mouth a little dry, as most toothpastes do, but I drink a little water afterwards and it goes away.</li>
            <li> And definitely try a small spot of toothpaste on the inside of your mouth before committing to the whole thing.</li>
            <li> We have used Crest for decades, and only recently switched to Colgate due to the latter&#x27;s lesser cost.</li>
            <li> So far I see myself sticking with my typical brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving the whitening behind - doesn&#x27;t really whiten, anyway - as far as I can tell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am normally not sensitive to toothpaste, nor do I have any mouth issues.</li>
            <li> After using this product for two weeks by cheeks and inside of lower lip became red and rough.</li>
            <li> You have to either wipe off the tip of the tube after each use or face gobs of toothpaste drizzling out and filling the flip cap, eventually running down the outside like blue lava.</li>
            <li> than that I am can&#x27;t see any differences other than this box has Whitening on it in big letters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I choose a different brand it is because the price has increased on crest and the other \\&quot;Colgate\\</li>
            <li> In other word, the present toothpaste is runny, which causes it to leak out of the cap.  </li>
            <li> I actually prefer the consistency of this paste to any other.</li>
            <li> I drink coffee and eat acidic foods daily, and I have other mouth hygiene routines even before using this product that help prevent gum disease and tarter build up that I can&#x27;t say that this product is doing those things.  </li>
            <li> went to the drug store and looked at the ingredients in the Crest&#x27;s other toothpaste lines, such as \\&quot;Crest Complete\\&quot; and \\&quot;Crest with an Extra Advantage.\\&quot; The active ingredient in all of them is 0.243% sodium</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health for a very long time now.</li>
            <li> My dentist put me on RX toothpaste for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> However, the \\&quot;active ingredient\\&quot; is the same as it always was, namely, \\&quot;fluoride.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I usually use natural products, but have been having some increased sensitivity so I decided to get this for the fluoride.</li>
            <li> Irritated skin tissue in mouth both along cheek and gums, my skin was shedding after every use which is not normal and should not happen.</li>
            <li> The flavor is the typical mint, and the paste has a vaguely gritty texture.  </li>
            <li> As noted in the previous update, things were not what I was hoping, and immediately switched back to [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> That is, the artificial flavoring is not as strong as the other Crest</li>
            <li> The funny thing is that if you search the product on Crest&#x27;s website, it has very poor ratings, but only due to packaging complaints.</li>
            <li> A few days later, I noticed a blob of toothpaste on the carpet at work.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the whitening as I never really pay attn to that, but I like this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this specific one was defective, or if all these tubes of toothpaste will make such a mess.  </li>
            <li> Red, raw lips, gums, and cheeks, ulcers, blisters, skin \\&quot;sloughing\\&quot; off...</li>
            <li> I thought it was just me not brushing well, but since reading reviews of other people having that problem, I have stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I quit using it because of that reason, there are other products to whiten your teeth.  </li>
            <li> This product should not be allowed to be sold since I&#x27;ve been to other message boards</li>
            <li> The mouth heals faster than any other part of your body.  </li>
            <li> box states under \\&quot;Other information\\</li>
            <li> The other stuff it does, like whitening, preventing gum disease....</li>
            <li> But am I believer in the other benefits of this toothpaste?</li>
            <li> all these other areas dentists check most.&lt;br /&gt;Fights</li>
            <li> Based on other&#x27;s reactions, you may want to try a tube from the grocery before purchasing a four pack.  </li>
            <li> My gingivitis is 100% healed and gone without a periodontal RX, I have not had a single abscess or cold sore since I began using it, I have not had a single infected salivary gland since I began using it, my gum recession has completely stopped despite having deep pocket plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The active ingredient of Crest was changed in 1981 to sodium monofluorophosphate.  </li>
            <li> my breath was not fresh.</li>
            <li> My plaque is stained DARK.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it contains fluoride (which our teeth do NOT need, despite the common belief).</li>
            <li> This is not your average whitening toothpaste that you see on the shelf at the supermarket.  </li>
            <li> The biggest thing I noticed is the texture - it seemed thick and a little gritty.  </li>
            <li> &quot; is on sale at a price that is less</li>
            <li> - I like that they stand up taking up less room on the counter.  </li>
            <li> I switched back to a sodium fluoride toothpaste and the stains are disappearing very rapidly (within a few days my teeth were noticeably brighter and the really bad staining between my teeth is coming off as well).</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve never had an issue with a mess all over my counters.  </li>
            <li> Toothpaste seems to ooze out and makes a mess.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those toothpastes that tastes a little bit medicinal.  </li>
            <li> Rubbing the toothpaste between my fingers, the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is a little grittier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest Pro-Health has several benefits including: preventing cavities, preventing gingivitis, preventing plaque, modest whitening, helping with sensitivity, and eliminating bad breath.</li>
            <li> Worse, slimy white mucus-like stuff collects on teeth and tongue after use.</li>
            <li> Just like your skin on your hands, the skin in your mouth sheds when dead, damaged, or infected.  </li>
            <li> dead, infected skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I work in a law firm.)  </li>
            <li> The problem arises not only from the poor cap, but also from the viscosity of the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> visited my dentist after using this brand for a few months.  </li>
            <li> Saw a difference within a few times of trying it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Also, I felt a few flecks of dead skin hanging out inside my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Crest products for just about half my life, and I am pushing past sixty these days.  </li>
            <li> I developed extreme sensitivity to cold and heat.</li>
            <li> have to admit, I was a little shocked by the fact that my teeth actually did look whiter after ten days of use.</li>
            <li> It seems to work pretty well and doesn&#x27;t taste too bad either.</li>
            <li> After a couple days&#x27; use, I&#x27;d find my teeth were a little sensitive to cold and pressure.  </li>
            <li> Be careful!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure I want a whitening toothpaste that causes staining on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> but I am troubled by information on the box which references possible staining of teeth because of the fluoride used.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a different viscosity from &#x27;ordinary&#x27; Crest toothpastes that places it somewhere between a gel, silly putty, and melted cheese.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker, regular coffee drinker, and probably a bunch of other things that are bad for me teeth.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately it takes a long time for my mouth to heal after this happens.</li>
            <li> It comes in the type of tube that has a big, flat flip-up lid serving as a base.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not such a bad thing, but the aftertaste does remind you a little bit of after you&#x27;ve rinsed with hydrogen peroxide.  </li>
            <li> And it seems, this is a common problem with whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Personally I think it is dangerous and will never use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging is quite glitzy, at least, in terms of the amount of health-related information that is printed on it.  </li>
            <li> Silica, as we know, is sand, which is one of the hardest of all of the compounds that are commonly encountered.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste tries to cover everything that can go wrong.</li>
            <li> , I took her seriously).</li>
            <li> It would take some serious orthodontic surgery to fix all the problems in MY mouth.  </li>
            <li> A few days later, I noticed terrible dark brown stains all over the bases and contacts of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Tartar and plaque are tough to counteract so at least this toothpaste provides some help.</li>
            <li> And the product left a bad tasted in my mouth -</li>
            <li> Horrible aftertaste that leaves mouth feeling not-so-clean and fresh as if I want to brush again with something else.</li>
            <li> Also, a few hours after brushing my teeth, I felt a terrible film all over my teeth - as if I hadn&#x27;t brushed at all.</li>
            <li> It got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> So, the effect is unappealing.</li>
            <li> And while I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic change in whiteness, my husband has started using the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This Crest toothpaste is by far the worst!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s weird.  </li>
            <li> did not try it again because it would be foolish to continue using it when something was clearly wrong.  </li>
            <li> Usually when I buy that type of toothpaste, I keep it upright, sitting on the base.  </li>
            <li> and the difference is visible and dramatic!</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is dangerous.</li>
            <li> For example, we read that the uses include the indications of gingivitis, plaque, bacteria, painful sensitivity, cold sensitivity, and acid sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I find the after taste minorly unpleasant in terms of the mintyness.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to let the cap roll</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; version isn&#x27;t as bad though.</li>
            <li> I was shocked - and yet vindicated -</li>
            <li> Painful peeling of the skin inside the mouth, swelling, burning...</li>
            <li> So disappointed in Crest.</li>
            <li> I would hate to have to pay my dentist to remove stains caused by stannous fluoride</li>
            <li> but her sister has the staining issue which while not permanent can be annoying.</li>
            <li> I used this toothpaste for a year and started to have very bad brown staining on my teeth.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> The pain is horrible and unrelenting.</li>
            <li> I will also note that the prices Amazon charges for these types of products are usually outrageous.  </li>
            <li> It was my worst appointment in years.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We liked this toothpaste before buying this, but this was a bigger tube than what we normally get.  More is better.</li>
            <li> Horrible aftertaste that leaves mouth feeling not-so-clean and fresh as if I want to brush again with something else. Worse, slimy white mucus-like stuff collects on teeth and tongue after use. I&#x27;m a longtime Crest user but the ProHealth and Crest flavored with cinnamon (the Fresh Burst?) both cause unfavorable reactions, and Internet searches show I&#x27;m not alone. (I am allergic to the cinnamon oil, which causes a burning sensation on my tongue.) Will never buy/try the ProHealth again.</li>
            <li> I used this toothpaste for a year and started to have very bad brown staining on my teeth. I thought it was just me not brushing well, but since reading reviews of other people having that problem, I have stopped using it. I switched back to a sodium fluoride toothpaste and the stains are disappearing very rapidly (within a few days my teeth were noticeably brighter and the really bad staining between my teeth is coming off as well). However, my boyfriend was recommended to use this by his dentist and has been using it for years with no problems. It just depends on who you are if you will react to it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff a lot, love the grit and the flavor.  Make my mouth feel fresh and clean.  Keep it coming.</li>
            <li> This is one of the rare toothpastes that actually leaves your mouth feeling clean after you use it. It is not watery and does a great job freshening breath. It may not be made with scope but I feel my mouth is cleaner after using this than I do with using different toothpaste and using mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I got my teeth cleaned two weeks ago, after which I purchased this product. I usually use natural products, but have been having some increased sensitivity so I decided to get this for the fluoride. I have excellent oral hygiene and take very good care of my teeth. I was very concerned when I noticed after brushing that the inside of my mouth felt shriveled and very dry. A few days later, I noticed terrible dark brown stains all over the bases and contacts of my teeth. I tried brushing more and more. It got worse and worse. And the product left a bad tasted in my mouth - my breath was not fresh. Also, a few hours after brushing my teeth, I felt a terrible film all over my teeth - as if I hadn&#x27;t brushed at all. I started to think the toothpaste may not be safe. So I google \\&quot;brown stains on teeth\\&quot; and this product flooded my search results as the culprit. I was shocked - and yet vindicated - I knew it. So disappointed in Crest. Had been using them since I was a kid - now never again. Now I&#x27;m going to have to spend $200 to get my teeth cleaned. And I see now the warnings all over the tube for staining. Why in the hell would I buy a whitening tooth paste that turns my teeth brown??!! The funny thing is that if you search the product on Crest&#x27;s website, it has very poor ratings, but only due to packaging complaints. It seems Crest must have deleted every comment regarding staining. So disappointing. Shame on Crest.</li>
            <li> Got a pack of 4 for $9 at costco.  They work pretty well so far.  For the first three weeks or so of using it, i experienced sensitivity in some of my teeth during use because of the fluoride they put in for the whitening.  It seems to work pretty well and doesn&#x27;t taste too bad either.</li>
            <li> Only toothpaste I use.  My dentist recommended it and she gives samples of it to her patients.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If your like me you&#x27;ll try it anyway.  I can tell you what my dentist told me.  The whitening ingredient of this toothpaste is causing the peeling inside your mouth.  I quit using it because of that reason, there are other products to whiten your teeth.  But it at your own risk but buy a back-up tooth paste just in case.</li>
            <li> tried it...now use nothing else.  Price was fair and shipping terms were great.  Will remember to look on Amazon when we run low</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back, and just started using it. 2 days into using it, my gums are inflamed and bleeding. I will never buy this again, and I am going to throw out the 5 unopened tubes I have in my cupboard. I am normally not sensitive to toothpaste, nor do I have any mouth issues. There is something about this toothpaste that is affecting people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every day for two years.  I am a coffee drinker.  Several cups a day, strong coffee black.  This toothpaste has kept my teeth looking OK in fact they look better than when I started using it.  The last dental visit, the dentist said \\&quot;you must not drink much coffee or tea since your teeth aren&#x27;t stained.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve had no peeling, sores or anything else described by some people, it may be that some people are more sensitive to these things than others, if you are use something else, the market is full of whitening toothpastes.  Colegate didn&#x27;t work as well for me, maybe it will work better for you, hard to say?  In any case, my only concern is I wonder if using whitening toothpaste daily will weaken tooth enamel over time?  I don&#x27;t know either way.</li>
            <li> Painful peeling of the skin inside the mouth, swelling, burning... THAT is what happens when my husband or I use this toothpaste. And it seems, this is a common problem with whitening toothpaste. So - back to regular ol&#x27; toothpaste for us. Just sensitive teeth stuff, I think. I&#x27;m leaving the whitening behind - doesn&#x27;t really whiten, anyway - as far as I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUCH!</li>
            <li> Great deal on this bulk item. Can&#x27;t beat the price at my local stores and free shipping is just what I wanted. Did not have to brave the crowds to get it. Best whitening toothpaste I have ever found anywhere. Works better than all the high dollar ones!</li>
            <li> After using this product for two weeks by cheeks and inside of lower lip became red and rough. The next day white \\&quot;canker sore\\&quot; eruptions occurred throughout my mouth. I have never had more than one canker sore in my mouth at a time in my life. My dentist said it could have been an a reaction to a new toothpaste, and bingo, I knew it was this stuff. HORRIBLE! I haven&#x27;t been able to eat anything more than vanilla ice cream, milk, and white bread for 4 days now. The pain is horrible and unrelenting. No over the counter remedies are helping, and I&#x27;ve purchased them all. Similar reports are all over the internet. Be careful!!!!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is dangerous. It has caused severe reactions for many people, myself and a previous commenter included. Red, raw lips, gums, and cheeks, ulcers, blisters, skin \\&quot;sloughing\\&quot; off... maybe you&#x27;ll be one of the lucky ones who don&#x27;t experience any of these symptoms, but why take the chance? This isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;one-in-ten-thousand\\&quot; reaction. Just go to consumer affairs and search \\&quot;crest,\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s far from rare.</li>
            <li> Got this as an impulse buy while shopping, not bothering to read the package (should read everything these days).  Though it had a nice taste that I liked, during the day my mouth burned and peeled after one brushing with it.  There was some sort of mucus/gloppy stuff in my mouth, skin peeling.  I finally read the box, and it states it could cause staining on your teeth that is not permanent but can be removed by your dentist.  That&#x27;s weird.  Not sure I want a whitening toothpaste that causes staining on my teeth.  I noticed that some of the pro-health mouthwashes have also been reported as causing staining on teeth.  I&#x27;ll stick to Listerine.  But a bigger concern was the burning and peeling.  I looked it up online, and realized I had a reaction to it as many others have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not try it again because it would be foolish to continue using it when something was clearly wrong.  I went back to my regular toothpaste and my mouth is okay.  I wish I&#x27;d read the box in the store as well as the reviews online before purchasing it.  My brother wanted to try it, and so far he has not had any issues.  But he agreed it was odd that so many people had reactions to it.  He stopped using it because he wasn&#x27;t happy about the possibility of stained teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for many people, this is either way too strong or contains an ingredient that we are allergic to---which can&#x27;t ge good seeing that it happens so often.  Also, it is marketed for sensitive teeth.  I think they should change that because there seem to be too many reactions, not just some fluke here and there.  Research it online and you will see there are more negative experiences than good.  Personally I think it is dangerous and will never use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have allergies, sensitive teeth and gums, or have had reactions to other products, you may want to steer clear of this as it contains something that isn&#x27;t right.  Allergies or not, there is still the potential of getting stained teeth.</li>
            <li> Irritated skin tissue in mouth both along cheek and gums, my skin was shedding after every use which is not normal and should not happen. I have since switched back to my Aqua fresh extreme clean which I&#x27;ve used for years with no ill side-effects. I bought into the Crest pro-health craze cause it sounded good, but turned out it was too good to be true! This product should not be allowed to be sold since I&#x27;ve been to other message boards and I&#x27;m one of many others who&#x27;ve been harmed by this product, shame on you Crest toothpaste, the consumer has spoken!</li>
            <li> so fresh and so clean, clean. This is my choice for toothpaste. It is a bit harsher than some and can cause some cheek cell luffing. I like it because it is strong.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste. I&#x27;ve used several others from different brands but none get my teeth quite as white as this type does. I have not had any reactions after a year of use. It does make my mouth a little dry, as most toothpastes do, but I drink a little water afterwards and it goes away. Great toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Your mouth is full of bacteria.  Just like your skin on your hands, the skin in your mouth sheds when dead, damaged, or infected.  The mouth heals faster than any other part of your body.  That sloughing?  dead, infected skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, some have more sensitive mouths, but for me - this toothpaste has completely maintained my mouth for the last 3 years while saving for dental work that was deemed &#x27;crucial&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cavity has not become decayed.  My gingivitis is 100% healed and gone without a periodontal RX, I have not had a single abscess or cold sore since I began using it, I have not had a single infected salivary gland since I began using it, my gum recession has completely stopped despite having deep pocket plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staining?  yeah.  My plaque is stained DARK.  but my teeth are white, very very white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s toothpaste.  It&#x27;s an abrasive detergent.  And it happened to save this 28 year old from needing teeth pulled and root canals after being homeless for some time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various whitening toothpastes over the years and have never really noticed any significant whitening.  That&#x27;s still true after using this one (though I highly recommend the 2 hour whitening strips which are fantastic).  The one thing that did stand out about this toothpaste was how sweet it was, cloyingly so.  It tasted like a peppermint candy.  I could see kids liking this for that reason, but the super sweetness coupled with the lack of whitening means I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Crest toothpaste and have been using it, in combination with Sonicare toothbrushes, for many years. The result has been that I&#x27;ve been able to curtail regular dental checkups, since time after time I was hearing, \\&quot;No plaque, no tartar. Keep on doing what you&#x27;re doing. That will be ninety dollars please.\\&quot; If this new product makes my teeth whiter as well, I&#x27;ll be even more pleased.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product and I like the taste and how it makes my mouth feel after brushing but I am troubled by information on the box which references possible staining of teeth because of the fluoride used. I gave it four stars because it seems to work well but the information makes me wonder if I really should be using this and the information is under an \\&quot;Other information\\&quot; section rather than a \\&quot;warning\\&quot; section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box states under \\&quot;Other information\\&quot;  that \\&quot;products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of teeth.\\&quot; The information further states that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist.  The box then states \\&quot;this Crest is especially formulated to help prevent staining.\\&quot;  This troubles me. I would hate to have to pay my dentist to remove stains caused by stannous fluoride and I will be talking to my dentist about this product when I see him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being said I saw a lot of positive things about this fluoride when I searched the web. I know nothing about fluoride. I assumed before I tried this that all toothpaste was the same so I think people need to be aware of what is in this or any toothpaste and check with their dentists to see if it is okay for them to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product I like the taste and the way it makes my mouth feel. It seems more minty than the Crest Pro Health clean mint flavor which I also reviewed but other than that I am can&#x27;t see any differences other than this box has Whitening on it in big letters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was not for the information I referenced above and how it was listed on the box I would give this five stars.</li>
            <li> We have used Crest for decades, and only recently switched to Colgate due to the latter&#x27;s lesser cost. Colgate does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this toothpaste is a strong contender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest does a good job, and I have no difficulties of the sort others have described. My teeth just feel clean, and my breath fresh, after using this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also love [[ASIN:B003CP12O8 Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free]] mouthwash, which genuinely protects and rebuilds enamel, fights decay and plaque and protects gums. The real deal, without health-endangering alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health for a very long time now. It has a nice minty flavor that I really like.  I tend to have sensitive teeth and gums and this toothpaste helps with that. I like that this toothpaste has whitening properties to it. After all the coffee and tea that I drink, I could use all the whitening help I can get.</li>
            <li> My teeth have gotten sensitive with age but since Sensodyne gives me sticker shock, I look around for cheaper alternatives. This toothpaste is all right as far as how it feels and how clean it makes my teeth. I was never a big fan of the taste of Crest - always liked the taste of Colgate better - but this gel version is better than their paste version.</li>
            <li> I love the new flip-top covers on Crest products.  Makes it EASY to apply paste to the brush and it&#x27;s impossible to let the cap roll anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paste itself is fine.  No unpleasant taste and my teeth feel very clean after using this.  The ONLY reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it contains fluoride (which our teeth do NOT need, despite the common belief).</li>
            <li> I love the Crest Pro Health Whitening-there is no tartar buildup and my gums are healthy after using it for 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentists probably do not like it because it destroys germs and there are no cavities.</li>
            <li> This Crest toothpaste is by far the worst! I actually like the flavor, its that about two days after using it my mouth has about 5 canker sores and  feels like it has been cut up. I have made this mistake with this toothpaste before because it is similar to the Crest that I actually like and unfortunately it takes a long time for my mouth to heal after this happens. I once bought a three pack of this at Costco and as soon as I realized what I had purchased I gave it to my friends, but with warning! Be careful, if your mouth is sensitive it might not be the best option. Crest has better options!</li>
            <li> Crest toothpaste in my opinion is one of the best toothpastes for oral hygiene that is currently on the market. I have used rest all my life and pretty much intend to continue using it. I only have one complaint and mass that they have brought out a mass variety that does various things to keep your oral hygiene in Optimum health. I prefer, just the plain crest toothpaste without any whitening or mouthwash bill into it, I like to know my mouth is clean and healthy and I shall go to the dentist for any whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just my opinion and I know there are other people out there loving the idea of having many choices. If I choose a different brand it is because the price has increased on crest and the other \\&quot;Colgate\\&quot; is on sale at a price that is less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this recommendation is helpful to you!</li>
            <li> CREST is a legacy brand of toothpaste, having been around since almost forever.  Crest was introduced in the United States in 1955. At first it used stannous fluoride, as the active ingredient.  The composition of the toothpaste had been developed by Drs. Muhler, Harry Day, and William H. Nebergall at Indiana University, and was patented by Nebergall. Procter &amp; Gamble paid royalties from use of the patent and thus financed a dental research institute at this university.  The active ingredient of Crest was changed in 1981 to sodium monofluorophosphate.  The product under review is unusual, in that the tube is bulky and fat, somewhat like the new breed of ketchup bottles that first appeared, perhaps, in the 1980s.  The packaging is quite glitzy, at least, in terms of the amount of health-related information that is printed on it.  For example, we read that the uses include the indications of gingivitis, plaque, bacteria, painful sensitivity, cold sensitivity, and acid sensitivity.  However, the \\&quot;active ingredient\\&quot; is the same as it always was, namely, \\&quot;fluoride.\\&quot;  In looking to the \\&quot;inactive ingredients,\\&quot; we find silica.  Silica, as we know, is sand, which is one of the hardest of all of the compounds that are commonly encountered.  This is striking contrast to SILICONE, which does contain silicon atoms, but in a structure that is totally different from that of SILICA.  SILICONE is a very soft compound, and it is sometimes known as synthetic rubber.  As I used this product, I could feel the gritty silica particles between my teeth.  Although it is likely that these were scouring my teeth and removing the decades of Peet&#x27;s coffee stains, I was worried that the grits of silica were damaging my enamel.  Thus, I am not so sure about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOWNGRADED.  Initially, I gave this product THREE STARS.  But now, I downgrade it to TWO STARS.  The reason is that the cap is flimsy and needs extra care to attach securely.  The cap does NOT attach very easily.  Youcannot have the same kind of confidence in the cap, as you can have with the lids of TUPPERWARE containers.  Anyway, I was keeping CREST product in my \\&quot;food drawer\\&quot; at work, and the toothpaste leaked on my bagels.  At first, I thought that it was growing fungus, because of the bluish color.  But then, I realized that it was the leaking toothpaste.  A few days later, I noticed a blob of toothpaste on the carpet at work.  (I work in a law firm.)  Obviously, the CREST product had leaked out of the tube on one of my trips to the men&#x27;s room to brush my teeth.  The engineers at PROCTER AND GAMBLE need to design a better cap.  The present cap is way below standard.  The problem arises not only from the poor cap, but also from the viscosity of the toothpaste.  The particular formulation used for the toothpaste under review is more watery than a conventional white toothpaste.  In other word, the present toothpaste is runny, which causes it to leak out of the cap.  Because of the runny toothpaste, a better cap would have been a conventional screw-on cap.</li>
            <li> My whole life I have always used Crest.  I doubt that will ever change.  I have tried free samples of other toothpastes, and they just don&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling as clean or my breath as fresh as Crest.  Sure, this may be some new and improved variety of Crest, but all that I really care about is that its Crest.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now, and it is not a letdown.  The paste is very minty, and you don&#x27;t need much to get the job done!  I can&#x27;t really say if it helps whiten your teeth more than any other toothpaste, but it certainty doesn&#x27;t hurt  I guess all I can really say is that if you see Crest you know its going to be good.  I will also note that the prices Amazon charges for these types of products are usually outrageous.  Drive to Target and buy them there!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest products for just about half my life, and I am pushing past sixty these days.  Very happy with my purchase, very happy with the product, exactly as expected from a Crest brand name, and at a very, very reasonable price to boot.  Amazon&#x27;s purchase price certainly beats any competitor, brick and mortat or otherwise.  Recommend the product to anyone out there - again, I have used Crest for years and my twice a year dental exam comes out smelling like roses each and every time.</li>
            <li> This is a duplicate review as amazonvine apparently has no record of the first review. It is a cut and paste of the first review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.0 out of 5 stars Crest Pro Health - Use With Caution, January 31, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is from: Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste 6 Oz (Pack of 4) (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;After reading some of the reviews on this product I asked my dentist if the product caused staining of the teeth. She said it does in some people and that her office no longer gives out samples of the toothpaste or the mouth rinse. It is not possible to know which people will be affected by the stannous floride in this product: she can use it but her sister has the staining issue which while not permanent can be annoying. One would wonder why Crest hasn&#x27;t changed the formula of this toothpaste. I have used Crest products for years but would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This has a lot of grit which gets that yellow and plaque off your teeth. Best on the market in my opinion</li>
            <li> This is one of those toothpastes that tastes a little bit medicinal.  That&#x27;s not such a bad thing, but the aftertaste does remind you a little bit of after you&#x27;ve rinsed with hydrogen peroxide.  The texture is somewhere between a paste and a gel.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this toothpaste I tried it. I liked its consistency, was surprised it had no gritty texture, considering it is advertised as a \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; paste. I liked it so much, after I finished it, I bought three tubes at my local pharmacy</li>
            <li> For the longest time in my adult life I avoided Crest toothpaste because I remembered that literally pasty consistency that just felt gross in my mouth. My product of choice for years and years was Colgate, but when I started using the [[ASIN:B004NH2YLO Colgate Total Advanced Fresh Whitening Gel Toothpaste, 5.8-Ounce (Pack of 2)]] I developed extreme sensitivity to cold and heat. This became a problem, not just while brushing, but when eating and drinking as well. As my husband preferred it anyway, we switched to Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been using the [[ASIN:B001F51Q8Y Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste 7.8 Oz (Pack of 4)]]but had been leery of trying a whitening paste again because of the potential sensitivity issue. When I made the switch, however, I was happy to discover that not only has the old pasty paste been changed to a more gel-like formula, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with tooth or gum sensitivity. I actually prefer the consistency of this paste to any other. It&#x27;s gel-like but with \\&quot;crystals\\&quot; in it that provide some friction while brushing. The minty flavor is rather light, and my teeth and gums feel really clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t honestly say that my teeth are getting any whiter, but they do seem like they are shinier. That might be the fact that I&#x27;m paying more attention to my brushing, or it might actually be a change in my teeth, who knows. In any case, I&#x27;m sticking with the Pro-Health line of dental products. I like the variety that allows me to switch it up once in a while but that also gives me consistency. And while I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic change in whiteness, my husband has started using the [[ASIN:B009PIJLMQ Crest 3d White Luxe Glamorous White Toothpaste Twin Pack 2 X 4.1 Oz]] and the difference is visible and dramatic!</li>
            <li> The crest whitening products boast a whiter smile in seven days. I decided to use [[ASIN:B003CP12MU Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste]] in conjunction with the[[ASIN:B00336EUTA Crest Whitening Mouthwash]]. The idea of doing something I do every day anyway to whiten my smile seemed like a winner to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste of this toothpaste is pretty good, but the texture is really strange. It&#x27;s VERY gritty. I felt like I was sandblasting my way to a whiter smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I was a little shocked by the fact that my teeth actually did look whiter after ten days of use. (see photo) Even if it didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth, it tastes okay so I would go ahead and finish the tube, unlike the mouthwash, which is kind of gross.</li>
            <li> This is Crest plus, with some kind of tingly-feeling bursts (think pop-rocks candy) as you brush, along with somewhat gritty paste. I&#x27;ve used Crest for years almost exclusively, and this one seems to have extra whitening properties. Though there is definite grit included, the high level of mint leaves me with a very fresh, sparkling clean feeling, though it is a little sugary for my taste. The mint is monumental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for not giving it five stars is two-fold.&lt;br /&gt;One - the cap. Instead of the old screw-on variety, the cap is a fold up type, which might work well except for:&lt;br /&gt;Two  - the consistency. This toothpaste has a different viscosity from &#x27;ordinary&#x27; Crest toothpastes that places it somewhere between a gel, silly putty, and melted cheese. The best way to describe it is that it is somewhat stringy, and does not clear the tip well after putting it on your toothbrush. You have to either wipe off the tip of the tube after each use or face gobs of toothpaste drizzling out and filling the flip cap, eventually running down the outside like blue lava. So, the effect is unappealing. If you&#x27;re not sharing a tube and don&#x27;t care or if you&#x27;re a middle of the tube squeezer sort of person, this may not bother you. For me sharing a tube of toothpaste with a spouse, when it has dripped and gooed up the dispenser part is kinda yucky. If you&#x27;re going to carefully wipe it after each use, or clean the lid every other day or so, the product is worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I really like this toothpaste. Not so much the distribution method.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week, which may not be long enough to fairly judge this product, but so far all I can say is that it effectively cleans my teeth.  The other stuff it does, like whitening, preventing gum disease....well, who knows?  I drink coffee and eat acidic foods daily, and I have other mouth hygiene routines even before using this product that help prevent gum disease and tarter build up that I can&#x27;t say that this product is doing those things.  The flavor is the typical mint, and the paste has a vaguely gritty texture.  I find the after taste minorly unpleasant in terms of the mintyness.  But it cleans my teeth, and I suppose that is what you want when you brush your teeth.  But am I believer in the other benefits of this toothpaste? Not yet.  So far I see myself sticking with my typical brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/18/2013&lt;br /&gt;Just visited my dentist after using this brand for a few months.  It was my worst appointment in years.  I&#x27;ve changed absolutely nothing BUT my toothpaste.  I had more plaque build-up, some swollen gum tissue, and was told to get back to my previous brushing habits.  After telling my dentist that nothing was different except for the paste, he just reiterated that I needed to do better.  I take pride in having clean teeth and needing very little scraping/picking/etc during a cleaning (my mom really got it stuck in my head that I wanted to die with my teeth in my head, I took her seriously). It was definitely a WTH moment.  Changing my star rating from a 3 to a 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/15/14&lt;br /&gt;Had another dentist visit just 2 weeks ago for routine cleaning. As noted in the previous update, things were not what I was hoping, and immediately switched back to [[ASIN:B001WAKI2W Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect Toothpaste, 6.0-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)]].  And had my traditional PERFECT cleaning. No warnings to \\&quot;do better\\&quot; with brushing and flossing.  Again, the only difference was the toothpaste. I&#x27;ve not changed my floss brand or toothbrush type.  I can only conclude that the Crest was the culprit!brand or toothbrush type.  I can only conclude that the Crest was the culprit!</li>
            <li> With so many products available I&#x27;d suggest another toothpaste, or at the very least getting your dentists opinion on Crest Pro Health before using. I had peeling inside my cheeks but never made the connection to CPH. My dentist put me on RX toothpaste for dry mouth. Today I was out and had to use CPH. Immediate burning and peeling again. It was then I realized the culprit. Obviously I&#x27;m not an isolated case. You&#x27;ll find a lot of information online about this and the darkening of teeth. You may be fine, however with all the other choices out there why take a chance?</li>
            <li> Got a free sample of this. Saw a difference within a few times of trying it. Mint flavor was just right and not to strong. Will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Crest Pro Health Whitening Toothpaste with my Sonicare and I feel like I&#x27;ve just gotten a professional cleaning! It has polishers--feels like \\&quot;grit\\&quot; but they dissolve quickly.  However it has a nice flip-top cap which snaps closed. So I&#x27;ve never had an issue with a mess all over my counters.  My wife and I have been using this for a few weeks and we love it, and we have since purchased it ourselves....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health has several benefits including: preventing cavities, preventing gingivitis, preventing plaque, modest whitening, helping with sensitivity, and eliminating bad breath. It has two powerful ingredients: Therapeutic Stannous Fluoride to protect against gingivitis, plaque, cavities and tooth sensitivity; and Sodium Hexametaphospahte, which is a stain-fighting ingredient. I loved the gritty texture that helped scrub my teeth clean and left my mouth feeling fresh and the minty taste lingered until I drank my first cup of coffee. I like the ease of extracting the toothpaste from the tube and the fact that is stands on the counter for easy reach. I would buy this again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health is the first and only leading toothpaste that protects against sensitivity and all these other areas dentists check most.&lt;br /&gt;Fights cavities.&lt;br /&gt;Fights tartar.&lt;br /&gt;Whitens teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Freshens breath.&lt;br /&gt;Fights gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;Fights plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste is pretty good. I would definitely buy this from a store. Crest has been coming out with a lot of good toothpaste. It&#x27;s amazing how they can keep coming up with a variety of types of toothpaste. My mouth definitely felt clean after using it. I like the top that allows it to stand up. It creates more room in my medicine cabinet and it looks good when it stands around the bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.

            <li> Seems to get the job done as far as cleaning my teeth. I can&#x27;t speak to the whitening as I never really pay attn to that, but I like this product overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a sample of this toothpaste for review, opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> My wife tested this product and found that it is good, but nothing really special. She really didn&#x27;t see any difference in the color of her teeth after using this for a couple of weeks.  We tested two different Crest products, this and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Invigorating Clean Mint Toothpaste, and we both agreed that the Crest Pro-Health is much better. We both loved it. To us, this was just toothpaste, good, but nothing special. I would recommend the Crest Pro-Health instead.</li>
            <li> I only use Crest toothpaste, but I don&#x27;t have any preference for a specific type.  As a result, I have tried a lot of different Crest varieties.  Like most of them, this toothpaste works great.  My teeth feel clean and smooth after brushing, and while the flavor isn&#x27;t quite as minty as some other varieties, it is still pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I had one major problem with this product.  It comes in the type of tube that has a big, flat flip-up lid serving as a base.  Usually when I buy that type of toothpaste, I keep it upright, sitting on the base.  When I do that with this container, the toothpaste flows out.  After the first night I used it, I woke up to a big mess of toothpaste all over the lid and leaking out onto the shelf it was sitting on.  I&#x27;m not sure if this specific one was defective, or if all these tubes of toothpaste will make such a mess.  Either way, I wasn&#x27;t very happy having to clean it up.</li>
            <li> As with similar products like vitamins, there&#x27;s not a ton I can tell you from just one tube of toothpaste.  I mean it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to magically solve all the problems in my mouth with just one tube.  It would take some serious orthodontic surgery to fix all the problems in MY mouth.  Anyway, if you have less severe problems then this is probably just as good as anything, though I&#x27;m sure other kinds are cheaper.  I&#x27;m just saying.</li>
            <li> Crest&#x27;s \\&quot;Pro-Health\\&quot; line of teeth care products imply without any  explanation that they are superior to run of the mill toothpastes and mouth washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how exactly is it different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the drug store and looked at the ingredients in the Crest&#x27;s other toothpaste lines, such as \\&quot;Crest Complete\\&quot; and \\&quot;Crest with an Extra Advantage.\\&quot; The active ingredient in all of them is 0.243% sodium fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro-Health toothpaste, instead, has 0.454% stannous fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no explanation about the benefits of stannous vs. sodium fluoride -- either there is none, or Crest doesn&#x27;t want to dwell on this, making all of its sodium fluoride toothpastes out to be inferior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can detect a difference in the taste. Pro-health has a bit more of a fluoride flavor. That is, the artificial flavoring is not as strong as the other Crest lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, the toothpaste works well, but admittedly, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working better than non-Pro-Health line toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Got this Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste along with the Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse (reviewed there, 4 out of 5). Although I liked the Rinse, this toothpaste is my new favorite paste of choice. I&#x27;ve always like baking soda style toothpastes for the texture, but was never fond of the taste. This is like those, but with a mild minty taste. Seems to be a winning combo for me along with the Rinse.</li>
            <li> Crest purportedly \\&quot;reduces surface stains by 80%.\\&quot; Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve used one tube of the pro-health whitening gel toothpaste and my teeth do appear a bit whiter. But it&#x27;s obviously such a subjective judgment at this point, I may also be mistaken. But I can confidently say this is now my favorite toothpaste. I absolutely love the mint flavor and the texture. It lasts on the brush for a sustained, vigorous brushing, and yet cleans off quite easily. And no toothpaste sediment left on the sink, under my brush like with its competitor. My only, minor, complaint - the flip top on the tube broke almost immediately.</li>
            <li> My dentist says that its not the toothpaste but the act of brushing that cleans teeth. But the ingredients can have a beneficial effect. This toothpaste tries to cover everything that can go wrong. Good for Crest. I think their directions to brush for 1 minute is to get you to leave the toothpaste in contact with your teeth to have time to do its chemical whitening. I have had good results from their 3D Whitening Rinse and its 1 minute of contact time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to whiten with a toothpaste over the peroxide strips. Tartar and plaque are tough to counteract so at least this toothpaste provides some help. I floss and brush my gums so that helps toughen them and I&#x27;ve had no decay problems at the gum line.</li>
            <li> I had been using [[ASIN:B001OOLF82 Sensodyne Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste, Alpine Breeze, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]] since my teeth are sensitive.  I decided to try this Crest toothpaste since it seems similar.  Both have similar tubes/caps - I like that they stand up taking up less room on the counter.  However, I like the Crest flip cap better - easier access.  Since I&#x27;ve been using Crest - I have not had any sensitivity coming back, so I think that part works.  I&#x27;ve not noticed any difference in whitening.  The taste is very strong (and stronger than Sensodyne).  The biggest thing I noticed is the texture - it seemed thick and a little gritty.  After I rinsed, I didn&#x27;t feel there was anything left in my mouth, which was good.  I did not experience any irritations like some people have mentioned.  I think its a good paste, but it depends on whether you want something that is strong and thick or not.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Like the freshness that it leaves my mouth feeling. Clean and Fresh.</li>
            <li> SO I&#x27;m not the only one? You would think after so many people having their skin PEEL off that some action would be taken. Eh, better to vote with my money...off to go buy Tom&#x27;s. A step in the right direction for sure. I</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product, though the opinions in this review are all my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste left my mouth with a cool, clean feeling.  The mint wasn&#x27;t too strong or hot, as I find can be the case with some mint flavors in oral care products.  Although this product was touting it&#x27;s whitening capabilities, I did not notice a difference in the color of my teeth.  In fairness, they are pretty white to begin with, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting to see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest is a brand I frequently purchase and trust for my oral care needs.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-health has minty crystals (not sure exactly what the correct term is) and it is very refreshing and clean feeling.  I really like the way it makes my mouth feel, and my teeth seem whiter after using it for two weeks.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is the cap....maybe it&#x27;s just \\&quot;user error\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t like the flip cap. Toothpaste seems to ooze out and makes a mess.  I like the screw tops on toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using the toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I was a little leery trying Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste because I did not like a similar Crest product  [[ASIN:B001F51Q8Y Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste 7.8 Oz (Pack of 4)]]at all. This \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; version isn&#x27;t as bad though. I find it to be a good toothpaste, but nothing better than average. The minty taste is OK. Nothing else about it stands out other than it is gritty like most Crest Pro-Health Toothpastes. I have not seen any whitening benefits after using for a couple of weeks. Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste to me is just a middle of the road toothpaste. There are many I like better, but I&#x27;ve used worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker, regular coffee drinker, and probably a bunch of other things that are bad for me teeth.  My teeth have had a nice yellow tint for decades, and no amount of \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; tooth pastes ever seem to help.  I didn&#x27;t expect much from this \\&quot;Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste\\&quot; and that&#x27;s just what I got. Decades of abuse can not be undone by a fancy new formula name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is a nice toothpaste. I like the sort of gritty texture. I like the strong mint flavor.  My teeth may not be much whiter after I use this, but boy, they feel clean.  For toothpaste power alone, I recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of reviews here talking about teeth staining and damaged gums, I&#x27;ve been using this for a week or so now and haven&#x27;t had any issues other than super minty breath.  Maybe it is a luck-of-the-draw kind of thing, but I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much. Everything worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> Each 6 oz tube of Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is promoted to help reveal your natural white smile while fighting cavities, gingivitis, plaque, and tartar plus relieve sensitivity in otherwise normal teeth.  The tooth whitening capabilities of the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is to remove surface stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warnings include not using this product for sensitivity for longer than four weeks unless recommended by a dentist.  Products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of the teeth, adequate toothbrushing may prevent these stains which are not harmful or permanent and may be removed by a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste, I was brushing with [[ASIN:B003CP12NE Crest baking soda and peroxide toothpaste]].  The flavor of the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is milder and more refreshing.  Rubbing the toothpaste between my fingers, the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is a little grittier.  However when using with our [[ASIN:B0085RZLU4 Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus toothbrush]], I don&#x27;t notice any additional grittiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experienced no irritation from using the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste, and over the last few weeks have shown a reduction of surface stains.  I wouldn&#x27;t say my teeth are white, but an improvement is evident.  Based on other&#x27;s reactions, you may want to try a tube from the grocery before purchasing a four pack.  If all goes well, this toothpaste may be a good whitening option for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Aids in removing surface stains&lt;br /&gt;Fights cavities, gingivitis, plaque, and tartar&lt;br /&gt;Use on sensitive teeth&lt;br /&gt;Mild Cool flavor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;May cause irritation in some</li>
            <li> This is not your average whitening toothpaste that you see on the shelf at the supermarket.  It is an intense toothpaste that not only cleans your teeth, but vigorously uses chemicals to whiten them.  After a couple days&#x27; use, I&#x27;d find my teeth were a little sensitive to cold and pressure.  Also, I felt a few flecks of dead skin hanging out inside my mouth.  My thinking is that you should not use this toothpaste every day, maybe just once a week.  And definitely try a small spot of toothpaste on the inside of your mouth before committing to the whole thing.</li>
