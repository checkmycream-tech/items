            <li>This is a good oil folks, if you haven&#x27;t ,try it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>Very light and moisturizing!</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair feel healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li>I warm up the oil before each use, so it stimulates the hair follicles</li>
            <li>I would honestly use it just for the scent.</li>
            <li>I gave this product four stars because it works best with the Wild Growth Oil rather than using it alone.  </li>
            <li>and I put majority of the oil on my roots, massage it in, and I put some more on the roots.</li>
            <li>I currently have my hair in braids and this product works wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li>Wild Growth Light Oil Moisturizer is one of the best moisturizers I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Hair never looked better.  </li>
            <li>The scalp is receiving nutritients it needs to remain healthy.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I also really love the scent.</li>
            <li>Bottom line: Smells great and is very well-priced.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because I wish there was more in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I mix this with more castor oil</li>
            <li>and I love the strong smell.</li>
            <li>Overall, very good product</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell but it keeps my hair moisturized, i like it</li>
            <li>If they stop making them, as they stop making a lot of excellent things for no reason, that will be a real pity.</li>
            <li>The smell is a very strong pine smell when you first put it on</li>
            <li>Before this bottle I purchased the white bottle, and I experienced a lot of itching...</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply just spead hair in evenly sections and apply straight from bottle.</li>
            <li>It is very light and much better than the white bottle..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s petty good, makes your hair thinker, keeps it moisturized for long, not smelly and helps hair grow faster.</li>
            <li>I will be back to purchase some more!</li>
            <li>This oil is really light, and moisturizes my hair really well.  </li>
            <li>I wear braids and has kept my braids fresh and moisturized</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Loud smell, very slick, use trace amounts, make scalp and hair feel good , a good oil for damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this product Friday night, which was three nights ago, and I got the results I wanted the after the first use.</li>
            <li>I tried it when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>This product is a bit smelly but it has made my hair grow incredibly fast within three months including my nails!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone who wants longer hair faster!</li>
            <li>[...]I am white, so it makes my hair really greasy, but it&#x27;s okay because it is soaking into your hair and revives it throughout the night.</li>
            <li>SO DO IF YOUR GOING NATURAL TRY IT OUT SPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE DREADS</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>When it comes to hair growth, I really don&#x27;t know if it worked.</li>
            <li>But after a day or two, your hair has a very foul odor.  </li>
            <li>And it has definitely made my hair soft, which I love.</li>
            <li>I only started using this product two days ago, but I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>the product clearly states it is NON hypoallergenic and</li>
            <li>To get it completely out though, you need to use shampoo twice.</li>
            <li>I am an African-American woman trying to transition from permed hair to natural hair, and this moisturizer makes my hair soft and managable.  </li>
            <li>Its practically natural.  </li>
            <li>i have natural hair and wanted a boost.  </li>
            <li>I  have been using wild growth treatment and wild growth moisture for four weeks now.</li>
            <li>When I run a dime sized amount through my hair instead,  it makes it so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It did make my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get this stuff out my hair fast enough.  </li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin as well)</li>
            <li>I NEVER BOUGHT WILD GROW ON</li>
            <li>I try not to flat iron my hair too much (once every 3 months)</li>
            <li>I add a few drops with both my shampoo and conditioner to help protect it and keep it strong since my workouts make me have to wash my hair daily.</li>
            <li>and when I washed my hair 3x in the shower to get it to the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; straw-like state, it was still soft and totally manageable.  </li>
            <li>Makes my scalp extremely itchy and my new growth grow faster.</li>

            <li> Makes my scalp extremely itchy and my new growth grow faster.</li>
            <li> Just like the other wild growth oil this one made my scalp itch and blister.</li>
            <li> i usually put it in my hair at night so it wears off by the morning as far as wild growth?</li>
            <li> have black natural hair, 4a type.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I use just a few drops and massage my roots, my hair feels really soft all day and my scalp stops itching.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY CORSE AND THICK DRY HAIR</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE DRY KINKY HAIR LIKE ME</li>
            <li> THEY GET DRY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a thickening after only two and half weeks.</li>
            <li> the ingredients have essential oils along with evening primrose, which can be irritating to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick or as heaviliy scented as the other Wild Growth Hair Oil, which I will continue to use, but wanted to give this a try.</li>
            <li> But it has not made my hair grow in any way, as it was also advertised it would do, along with other benefits.</li>
            <li> I think it smells exactly like a really expensive Aveda shampoo I used to use for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Couple hours later my whole scalp began to itch like crazy and would not stop itching</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s now an inch and a half longer.</li>
            <li> When I was using castor oil and grape seed it grew a little, but now that I think about it since using this product it has grown out a bit faster.</li>
            <li> It stinks because I really wanted to use this product.</li>
            <li> I also use aphogee pro-vitamin leave in treatment, aphogee keratin and green tea reconstructerizer, and scalp scrub.</li>
            <li> its just been a few weeks</li>
            <li> After the first two days the bad odor came, so I washed and clarified my hair.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using it for a few weeks and usually apply twice a week.</li>
            <li> is pointless</li>
            <li> I like using this oil, but I&#x27;m not sure if it has made my hair thicker.</li>
            <li> NOT SURE</li>
            <li> I used to dye my hair at least three times a week and now all of the damage is unnoticable.</li>
            <li> Before I got this product, I worried about the smell because a lot of people had complained a lot about that.</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair that I&#x27;m trying to grow out after a pixie cut.</li>
            <li> I have two thin spots in the front of my hair line.</li>
            <li> Not a good purchase!</li>
            <li> all the expensive nonesense and get this one.</li>
            <li> The oil has a weird medicine smell, but it goes away when you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Product got here in time and to my surprise, there&#x27;s nothing wrong about its scent.</li>
            <li> Use this like hair medicine, taste bad but does the job in about three months</li>
            <li> it doesnt smell as bad as people made it seem.</li>
            <li> There is nothing in the list that would give  cause a bad smell.  </li>
            <li> I have bad hair habits (like using a clarifying shampoo and not conditioning)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for me, I will not walk around stinking. :(</li>
            <li> Hate the smell</li>
            <li> Ugh, smells awful</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> The smell is very bad!!!  </li>
            <li> Some reviews stated that it smells awful!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li> Ugh, smells awful and so you never want to use it. Not a good purchase! threw it out.</li>
            <li> If they stop making them, as they stop making a lot of excellent things for no reason, that will be a real pity. This is a good oil folks, if you haven&#x27;t ,try it!&lt;br /&gt;I have black natural hair, 4a type.&lt;br /&gt;It adds moisture, shine, smells good, my hair just loves it,&lt;br /&gt;skip all the expensive nonesense and get this one.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell but it keeps my hair moisturized, i like it</li>
            <li> Loud smell, very slick, use trace amounts, make scalp and hair feel good , a good oil for damaged hair. Has everything damaged hair need in one bottle. Use this like hair medicine, taste bad but does the job in about three months</li>
            <li> I bought this product Friday night, which was three nights ago, and I got the results I wanted the after the first use. [...]I am white, so it makes my hair really greasy, but it&#x27;s okay because it is soaking into your hair and revives it throughout the night. I warm up the oil before each use, so it stimulates the hair follicles and I put majority of the oil on my roots, massage it in, and I put some more on the roots. I used to dye my hair at least three times a week and now all of the damage is unnoticable. I can&#x27;t see any split ends anymore and my hair has already gained some length. I sleep with it in and wash it out in the morning. To get it completely out though, you need to use shampoo twice. Only on the roots though, keep the oil on the ends. I also use aphogee pro-vitamin leave in treatment, aphogee keratin and green tea reconstructerizer, and scalp scrub. The oil has a weird medicine smell, but it goes away when you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell but it work</li>
            <li> it doesnt smell as bad as people made it seem. i have been told that it smells minty or I smell minty when i have it in my hair. i usually put it in my hair at night so it wears off by the morning as far as wild growth? Ive seen some change in my hair but not drastic yet. Ive been using it for a few weeks and usually apply twice a week.</li>
            <li> So whenever I apply it do I have to heat up the Bootle everytime ? can someone tell me please I just bought this at Sally&#x27;s and I  want to know. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from my local beauty store.. Before this bottle I purchased the white bottle, and I experienced a lot of itching... Switch to this bottle, and it definitely stop the itching..It is very light and much better than the white bottle.. I also did compared this bottle with the white bottle(wild growth) &amp; this one has castrol in it which is a plus..</li>
            <li> I currently have my hair in braids and this product works wonderful!!!! I will be back to purchase some more!</li>
            <li> Wild Growth Light Oil Moisturizer is one of the best moisturizers I have tried.  I am an African-American woman trying to transition from permed hair to natural hair, and this moisturizer makes my hair soft and managable.  I gave this product four stars because it works best with the Wild Growth Oil rather than using it alone.  When these two products are used together, you get the best results. I have yet to see any growth to my hair, but with continued use, I think I will see the growth eventually. Overall, very good product and I definitely plan to purchase this product before my currect supply runs out.</li>
            <li> Very light and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Before I got this product, I worried about the smell because a lot of people had complained a lot about that. Product got here in time and to my surprise, there&#x27;s nothing wrong about its scent. Its practically natural.  Can&#x27;t testify about the product itself..its just been a few weeks so I still cna&#x27;t tell of any changes in hair length.</li>
            <li> Hair never looked better.  i have natural hair and wanted a boost.  This did the job.</li>
            <li> Just like the other wild growth oil this one made my scalp itch and blister. It was horrible. It stinks because I really wanted to use this product.</li>
            <li> The scalp is receiving nutritients it needs to remain healthy. I&#x27;ve noticed a thickening after only two and half weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and feel by now I should see a difference and I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It really works. I shave my hair in July and it&#x27;s now an inch and a half longer.</li>
            <li> Its anice smell but pricey.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. I add a few drops with both my shampoo and conditioner to help protect it and keep it strong since my workouts make me have to wash my hair daily.</li>
            <li> Hello, this is Deborah Williams.  I  have been using wild growth treatment and wild growth moisture for four weeks now. And it has definitely made my hair soft, which I love. But it has not made my hair grow in any way, as it was also advertised it would do, along with other benefits. My time with this product is over for me. I will send this item back and requested a refun from place of purchased.  Deborah Williams</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of putting this all over my hair after I showered and it made it so greasy I had to shower again. When I run a dime sized amount through my hair instead,  it makes it so shiny and soft. When it comes to hair growth, I really don&#x27;t know if it worked.</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair that I&#x27;m trying to grow out after a pixie cut. I only started using this product two days ago, but I really like it so far. If I use just a few drops and massage my roots, my hair feels really soft all day and my scalp stops itching. I also really love the scent. I think it smells exactly like a really expensive Aveda shampoo I used to use for curly hair. I would honestly use it just for the scent. I hope it helps me grow out my hair faster!</li>
            <li> This oil is really light, and moisturizes my hair really well.  It&#x27;s not as thick or as heaviliy scented as the other Wild Growth Hair Oil, which I will continue to use, but wanted to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Great product and will purchase again. I wear braids and has kept my braids fresh and moisturized</li>
            <li> The smell is a very strong pine smell when you first put it on (I could have dealt with that).  But after a day or two, your hair has a very foul odor.  Like you have not washed it in about 3 or 4 months (maybe longer).  The smell is very bad!!!  I can&#x27;t walk around like that! It did make my hair soft and manageable.  but that still was not enough to keep me using it.  I tried it when I first got it.  After the first two days the bad odor came, so I washed and clarified my hair.  Waited a week and try it again.  SAME THING HAPPEN!!! I couldn&#x27;t get this stuff out my hair fast enough.  It&#x27;s not for me, I will not walk around stinking. :(</li>
            <li> Some reviews stated that it smells awful!  Well I have no idea why someone would say that.  There is nothing in the list that would give  cause a bad smell.  Bottom line: Smells great and is very well-priced.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for months now and it&#x27;s petty good, makes your hair thinker, keeps it moisturized for long, not smelly and helps hair grow faster.</li>
            <li> I used it for almost 2 months and my hair doesn&#x27;t shed like it used to. My hair appears fuller and softer despite my color damage. This product is awesome and I love the strong smell. I have 4a hair. I only use it on my scalp once per week. I gave 4 stars because I wish there was more in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This product DOES work! It has thickened my edges and my scalp itches constantly.  Excellent!  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after watching YouTube videos about it. I received this item last Thursday after working that night when I got home I place the item onto my scalp. Couple hours later my whole scalp began to itch like crazy and would not stop itching and this is after 1 use of this.</li>
            <li> Makes my scalp extremely itchy and my new growth grow faster.</li>
            <li> This is helping me recover my hairline.</li>
            <li> This product works WONDERS for my damaged, bleached hair.  I have bad hair habits (like using a clarifying shampoo and not conditioning) and when I washed my hair 3x in the shower to get it to the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; straw-like state, it was still soft and totally manageable.  HOWEVER, I do not recommend for the scalp... the product clearly states it is NON hypoallergenic and the ingredients have essential oils along with evening primrose, which can be irritating to sensitive skin.  I use this oil on my hair and face for nourishment, but stay away from the scalp as it causes itching. (I have sensitive skin as well)</li>
            <li> This product is a bit smelly but it has made my hair grow incredibly fast within three months including my nails! It also makes my hair feel healthy and shiny! I would recommend this product to everyone who wants longer hair faster! It is very easy to apply just spead hair in evenly sections and apply straight from bottle. I find heating up the product is pointless it makes my scalp itchy so I don&#x27;t recommend heating the product if you don&#x27;t want an itchy scalp! Otherwise this product is a must!!!</li>
            <li> I like using this oil, but I&#x27;m not sure if it has made my hair thicker. I mix this with more castor oil so the combination of both could be doing the job! My hair is thicker. I have two thin spots in the front of my hair line. The hair has grown back! When I was using castor oil and grape seed it grew a little, but now that I think about it since using this product it has grown out a bit faster. I try not to flat iron my hair too much (once every 3 months) so I can&#x27;t wait to do another length check in April! Since my last flatiron my hair has evened out also!</li>
            <li> I NEVER BOUGHT WILD GROW ON HERE BUT THIS PRODUCT IS A MUST!!! IF YOU HAVE DRY KINKY HAIR LIKE ME MUST TRY IM NOT SURE INGREDIENTS BUT I KNOW THERES TEA TREE OIL  MY SISTER INTRODUCE ME TO THIS WHEN MY EDGEDS GOT DESTROYED FROM MICRO BRAIDS 2-3 WEEK THE HAIR STARTED TO GROW BACK . I HAVE VERY CORSE AND THICK DRY HAIR MY HAIRS DRINKS THIS S*** LIKE WATER LOL IT ENJOYS IT N SO DO IF YOUR GOING NATURAL TRY IT OUT SPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE DREADS THEY GET DRY HAD THEM COMB THEM OUT LOL</li>
