            <li>I seriously love this headband sooo much!</li>
            <li>But I figured with it being super cheap and all, why not?</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>Also a quick way to polish up your look when you haven&#x27;t had a chance to wash your hair.</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>very pretty headband</li>
            <li>Very pretty and looks just like it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a flimsy cheap metal, and the crystals in it are really pretty and sparkly.</li>
            <li>It was very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty though.</li>
            <li>But overall super cute and received lots of complements!</li>
            <li>It broke after first 5 minutes on my head!</li>
            <li>Very blingy for a person who doesn&#x27;t want to look like a kid, but at the same time wants to have something beautiful in my hair.</li>
            <li>Its so pretty!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a nice hair accessory if worn for a short period of time.</li>
            <li>It looks much more expensive than it actually was, and was great for a budget friendly bride to be!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice not what I expected based on the picture</li>
            <li>So pretty and fits well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>Good as new, but for that I take it down a star.</li>
            <li>Perfect headband for adding a little bit of a classier look to your outfit whether in a ponytail or hair down.</li>
            <li>I have a large head, but even this headband is large for me.</li>
            <li>Very pretty from far away.</li>
            <li>Great quality, slightly too big for me though</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice a tight</li>
            <li>Stays on well and adds so much sparkle.</li>
            <li>The front part if worn for a few hours, kind of irritates the scalp a bit.</li>
            <li>I wore it today, it&#x27;s pretty cute, but probably won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>Better than expected!!</li>
            <li>It was very inexpensive, and actually arrive really fast!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% sure if I were to wear it out a few times</li>
            <li>but quality is great, not tight or uncomfortable</li>
            <li>Good, but obviously not perfect.</li>
            <li>The elastic part that holds the headband together was very cheaply made and simply pulling on it too hard breaks it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it two stars is because the seller shipped 2 weeks faster than when I was expecting the product and for once someone made a product large enough for my head to not feel like it was being choked out.</li>
            <li>but unless I replace the extension part of the head band it will never be large enough to actually use.</li>
            <li>cute other than missing a stone.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the little bit that they charged.</li>
            <li>Left scars on my skin not too comfortable :/ broke after I wore it 3 times from the bands</li>
            <li>it also came with a free gift but was not good</li>
            <li>Underside not flat...</li>

            <li> it also came with a free gift but was not good</li>
            <li> Underside not flat...</li>
            <li> I usually wear it down but with the summer it becomes harder to manage, so I wanted a headband that was functional and pretty, but doesn&#x27;t make me look like a 5 year old.</li>
            <li> The jewels are so poorly made it looks like a child super glued the stones onto the metal piece.</li>
            <li> The fit on my (small) head is loose, but tight enough to stay on with hair up or down.</li>
            <li> For adult the hair band is too small (or I have big head</li>
            <li> delivery is way too long</li>
            <li> Bought this as a present for a little girl&#x27;s birthday present.  </li>
            <li> This headband is very pretty , but it&#x27;s for kids not adult, was very tight, hardly got it on!</li>
            <li> The elastic part has very limited stretch ability and</li>
            <li> A little bigger than expected...</li>
            <li> Item arrive as expected.</li>
            <li> I still tried to use it, as they were missing from the ends, but no matter what I tried,  it wont sit flat on my head, it always rolls backwards, and falls off.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too small and just overall seems sturdy.</li>
            <li> If I would have read the other reviews, I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> To my personal opinion, the chain is a little heavy since it is made of metal of some sort.</li>
            <li> When ever you have a bad hair day, pop this baby on and it will all be fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 and have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s  a little tight.</li>
            <li> Though it might feel a little tight for some people.</li>
            <li> i was a little worried for the price</li>
            <li> stones are all a mess - - three are missing,-</li>
            <li> Looks cute, but it has no fabric behind the crystals and it hurts forehead badly...</li>
            <li> The present was two weeks late, but at least the girl loves it.  </li>
            <li> Close up, the jems are not centered in the holder and the links opened up and broke after a few wears and got stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> I seen one of the rhinestone missing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go home with missing stones.</li>
            <li> Pulls hair out and messy</li>
            <li> Not happy at all waited too long</li>
            <li> The only negative was that I received it &#x27;broken&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I was anxiously awaiting for this head band for over a month</li>
            <li> and I get told that it looks like I have a small tiara on.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly, not too tight and not too loose!</li>
            <li> Came in broken and missing gems, poor quality, rips hair</li>
            <li> the quality is no good.</li>
            <li> But let me assure you, it wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> it arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> and handband is broken when i recieved it ......</li>
            <li> Unfortunately during shipping the headband came in broken.</li>
            <li> hair caught in it from time to time, worst of all, the size is very small.  </li>
            <li> Had to give it away. :(</li>
            <li> terrible quality.. looked like it was from a dollar store... couldnt even use... :(</li>

            <li> I was anxiously awaiting for this head band for over a month and when I received it and tried to put it on it broke. I am unsatisfied that the resources used for this weren&#x27;t as great as they could have been.</li>
            <li> The attachment points are bulky and hurt the scalp.</li>
            <li> Fit well and didn&#x27;t slip. Has some shimmer but not gaudy. I was very happy with this headband.</li>
            <li> The headband is stunning. Unfortunately during shipping the headband came in broken. The break was an easy fix and it looks absolutely stunning with my wedding dress!!!!</li>
            <li> Is lovely!  I&#x27;m very happy with item!  I plan to wear in a special activity!  Very nice!</li>
            <li> To be honest,I was nervous to order this because of some of the reviews. But I figured with it being super cheap and all, why not? The earliest delivery date was June 9th, but I got it today, May 29th. I&#x27;m actually really impressed with it. It&#x27;s not a flimsy cheap metal, and the crystals in it are really pretty and sparkly. It wasn&#x27;t too small and just overall seems sturdy. The only negative was that I received it &#x27;broken&#x27;. But let me assure you, it wasn&#x27;t broken. One of the links had become open, so all I had to do was pop it back on and tighten. Good as new, but for that I take it down a star. If I had to compare it, I would say quality-wise, it&#x27;s similar to forever 21 merchandise. Good, but obviously not perfect.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to wear on my wedding, and it will work perfectly. It was very inexpensive, and actually arrive really fast!  It looks much more expensive than it actually was, and was great for a budget friendly bride to be!</li>
            <li> Very pretty from far away. Close up, the jems are not centered in the holder and the links opened up and broke after a few wears and got stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> I wore it today, it&#x27;s pretty cute, but probably won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> It was very pretty but it broke the second time I wore it. It may have been my fault. One of the jump rings came apart.</li>
            <li> Wore it at my wedding and looks beautiful and fit comfortably!</li>
            <li> I love it, but my order was incomplete, I just received one hair band of 8</li>
            <li> Super cute headband, was able to fit me very well. The front part if worn for a few hours, kind of irritates the scalp a bit. But overall super cute and received lots of complements!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s prom and it is really beautiful, however it broke within the first five minutes. The elastic part that holds the headband together was very cheaply made and simply pulling on it too hard breaks it. I guess you get what you pay for. But it was beautiful and would look gorgeous on any one, just be very gentle with it because it is fragile.</li>
            <li> A little bigger than expected...or I have a tiny head. Very pretty though.</li>
            <li> Left scars on my skin not too comfortable :/ broke after I wore it 3 times from the bands</li>
            <li> well made product and price was nice as well.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel like the PRINCESS...I think I am!! LOVE IT!! BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> My wedding is not untill my fiancé comes home from afganstand  so I when ahead and got some of the wedding stuff I thought this was cute it came in today I was so happy about it untill I seen one of the rhinestone missing I guess I will order another one</li>
            <li> I seriously love this headband sooo much! Its so pretty! It fits perfectly, not too tight and not too loose! It spices up every hairdo!</li>
            <li> I have a large head, but even this headband is large for me. The jewels are so poorly made it looks like a child super glued the stones onto the metal piece. The pieces are not aligned onto their settings. I&#x27;m 100% sure if I were to wear it out a few times I&#x27;d go home with missing stones. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the seller shipped 2 weeks faster than when I was expecting the product and for once someone made a product large enough for my head to not feel like it was being choked out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice not what I expected based on the picture but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> Very cute sturdy constructed very we&#x27;ll keep in mind it takes up to 28 days to come from china! Happy</li>
            <li> Bought this as a present for a little girl&#x27;s birthday present.  It took three weeks to arrive, mailed from China.  The present was two weeks late, but at least the girl loves it.  To my personal opinion, the chain is a little heavy since it is made of metal of some sort. hair caught in it from time to time, worst of all, the size is very small.  Good for young girls, not adults.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gorgeous , I loved it inmidialy I saw it . I haven&#x27;t wore yet but, I hope it will comfortable</li>
            <li> Was very cute, but it would pull/rip my hair and give me headaches. Eventually it broke (after 2weeks)</li>
            <li> it arrived broken.  If I would have read the other reviews, I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 and have long thick hair. I usually wear it down but with the summer it becomes harder to manage, so I wanted a headband that was functional and pretty, but doesn&#x27;t make me look like a 5 year old. This one is perfect, and stays in place all day. The only thing I couldn&#x27;t do was use it along with a pony tail, it kept sliding back to the elastic. Also a quick way to polish up your look when you haven&#x27;t had a chance to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> So pretty and fits well.</li>
            <li> cute other than missing a stone.</li>
            <li> The item is Great quality and very sturdy. Not plastic. Fits perfectly!! It was definitely a pleasant surprise. Item arrive as expected.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be crappy, but no...it&#x27;s really good. It&#x27;s cute and very fashion forward, I get so many compliments and I get told that it looks like I have a small tiara on. When ever you have a bad hair day, pop this baby on and it will all be fine.</li>
            <li> Beautiful.  Will go perfectly will any outfit.</li>
            <li> Great quality, slightly too big for me though</li>
            <li> This immediately broke when putting it on</li>
            <li> Underside not flat... It hurts my head to wear because of that</li>
            <li> Never got to wear it because it broke</li>
            <li> Love this! Looks even better in person!!</li>
            <li> Pulls hair out and messy</li>
            <li> I removed it from the plastic&amp; when I try to put it on my head it break into 3 pcs..the quality is no good.</li>
            <li> I love it.!! I bought it for my daughter and I am using it.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all waited too long and handband is broken when i recieved it ......</li>
            <li> junk. broke minute we got it. delivery is way too long</li>
            <li> I do not have a big head at all. This headband is marketed to &amp;#34;Women&amp;#34; and I broke it and scratched my face trying to get it over my head. It&#x27;s pretty but unless I replace the extension part of the head band it will never be large enough to actually use. It is sized for children.</li>
            <li> Beautiful peace.. not tight at all.. super cute... i was a little worried for the price but quality is great, not tight or uncomfortable l at all. Will be wearing this beautiful head band forbmy wedding in sept.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended it if your on a budget and still want to look gougorgeous l.</li>
            <li> Just a gorgeous headband. Stays on well and adds so much sparkle. Exactly what I was looking for! The fit on my (small) head is loose, but tight enough to stay on with hair up or down.</li>
            <li> terrible,,,,&lt;br /&gt;The stones are all a mess - - three are missing,- I still tried to use it, as they were missing from the ends, but no matter what I tried,  it wont sit flat on my head, it always rolls backwards, and falls off. It isn&#x27;t worth the little bit that they charged. Skip this one if you can,,,</li>
            <li> This headband is very pretty , but it&#x27;s for kids not adult, was very tight, hardly got it on! Had to give it away. :(</li>
            <li> So great and the product is as described. I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Broke after a day of wearing</li>
            <li> arrived in a timely manner and its adorable! I love it,wouldn&#x27;t hesitate on buying another. if your debating on buying this for a wedding or formal event. stop thinking about it,buy it!! would be cute for bridesmaids in a wedding as well.</li>
            <li> Very nice happy happy</li>
            <li> Super cute and perfect for any occasion!</li>
            <li> Very pretty! Look just like the picture! Didn&#x27;t break when I put it on even after accidently drop it.  Love the flowers!  Though it might feel a little tight for some people.</li>
            <li> My headband was broke when I took it out of the package. Not satisfied at all. I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Looks cute, but it has no fabric behind the crystals and it hurts forehead badly... But still can be worn as headpand... The prize was good and delivery fast.</li>
            <li> Broke when I tried it on</li>
            <li> Dint even get to use it came all damage like it got cought to something and the package was burnt when open it came all broke would of asked for another one but just didnt want to go threw the prosses so just threw it away it also came with a free gift but was not good</li>
            <li> great look and affordable</li>
            <li> The headband is nice-looking, but it has no lining under the rhinestones, which hurts my scalp. It&#x27;s still a nice hair accessory if worn for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to wear this hair band even once.  The elastic part has very limited stretch ability and the silver flowers just broke into pieces (in several places).</li>
