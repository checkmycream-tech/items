            <li>Happy Aloe Geling!</li>
            <li>It is also GREAT for sunburns!!!</li>
            <li>This item is a great moisturizer for after sun, swim or bath.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>so I was happy to see it online.</li>
            <li>Great for after a day in the sun.</li>
            <li>Their sunscreens are great too</li>
            <li>This stuff is great</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>It also greatly speeds healing and scaring.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SO AMAZING!</li>
            <li>My husband and I have used this product many times and it is great.</li>
            <li>Favorite aloe out there!</li>
            <li>believe, these 3 factors are what make this product so amazing.</li>
            <li>Been using this potion for years and its always handy.</li>
            <li>It is a nice product to be used after IPL treatments.</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because it was priced competitively, packaged great and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>However, it is by far the best Aloe product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Maybe there is something out there as good as or better with a label I would feel more comfortable with.  </li>
            <li>This Aloe gel is wonderful after time in the sun - very healing and cooling, easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>However, aloe vera is one of many ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li>a bottle you get more for your money.</li>
            <li>Glad to find this product at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love ocean potion products.</li>
            <li>Water is the best fluid to assist in allowing heat to escape your body.  </li>
            <li>Because oils and greases will plug up and trap moisture and heat into your skin, causing even more damage than if you didn&#x27;t put anything on your skin at all.  </li>
            <li>The Ocean Potion works better, faster and it no where as toxic.  </li>
            <li>I want to have a stock and at more than one location.  </li>
            <li>Educate yourself so you can make better choices in products for your family.</li>
            <li>very good product and the price is low</li>
            <li>If you want, by far, the best burn treatment stock your first aid kit with the Silvadene also.  </li>
            <li>The price is good and it applies really well to your skin.</li>
            <li>it out my easily burning friends.  </li>
            <li>If anyone comes up with something better I would be most interested in hearing about it.  </li>
            <li>so I could harvest my own pure Aloe.  </li>
            <li>but of course it was available thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and not sticky.</li>
            <li>This is important.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I felt comfortable going to sleep with, without having to shower it off.  </li>
            <li>The texture is really light</li>
            <li>I use this product whenever my skin feels like it is burned or irritated and recommend it even for skin softening although that is not its primary use.</li>
            <li>By Ibe Truthr:  I found this product years ago when it was cheap, at WallMarts.  </li>
            <li>Great for sunburns or minor skin repair.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it because it had Aloe Gel</li>
            <li>Many people are under the mistaken impression that this is 100% pure aloe vera from the plant.</li>
            <li>Before you buy anything, research each ingredient they use in their product to make sure you really want to use that on your skin.</li>
            <li>It is fresh and let the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>aside from this one being available, this is the next-best product for ANY kind of burn, &amp; AMZ prices are terrific!</li>
            <li>And Amazon&#x27;s delivery is very fast!</li>
            <li>This product offers cool, refreshing, moisturizing relief from the sun once home.  </li>
            <li>a side note, this stuff makes pretty awesome very light hold hair gel &amp; the additives aren&#x27;t any worse than most hair gel products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Upon further consideration, I chose to give this product 5 stars - it is the product as described, it shipped quickly, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product for use after getting a little too much sun.</li>
            <li>okay,  I was really looking for pure Aloe Vera Gel</li>
            <li>Until we get straight and accurate answers stay away from this product.</li>
            <li>So now you know the facts as I see them, and I am a good careful judge.  </li>
            <li>After you let this product dry after application (may take 15 minutes with generous application), you skin feels nice.  </li>
            <li>I am only able to find it on -line</li>
            <li>I first used it in Hawaii and just ran out</li>
            <li>to put on your face:  No way, has too many itchy things in it (orange peel oil and methyl and propyl parabens).&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  It&#x27;s going back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>But first, let me tell you my experience with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My last bottle shared by many just ran out.  </li>
            <li>That is exactly two years.  </li>
            <li>If you have to pay the whole cost, its worth it</li>
            <li>Not only does it work better than this, but it&#x27;s also inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This product not only soothes the burn, but helps cool any skin irritation and is very gentle on your skin!</li>
            <li>Prior to that I had to use strong prescription drugs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to spread around on large areas, which is essential for a sunburn.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sting on your skin and it isn&#x27;t all goopy like pure aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>This is not correct even though this is advertised as 100% pure aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>A product advertised as 100% pure aloe vera gel should contain 100% aloe vera.</li>
            <li>I want to know what % of this product is pure aloe vera?</li>
            <li>bottle (it&#x27;s large) at Walmart for about $6.</li>
            <li>I purchased it while on vacation based on the front label claiming it was nothing but pure Aloe Vera, and put it on my daughter&#x27;s sunburn.  </li>
            <li>and I thought is was pure.  </li>
            <li>Amazon sells 100% pure aloe vera juice.</li>
            <li>Besides the dyes and other chemicals, there is alcohol in this product; it seems terribly ironic that most companies put alcohol (very drying!)</li>
            <li>Really helps relieve and revitalize skin after a sunburn.  </li>
            <li>This means that my feet burn intensely, and I also experience nerve spasms.</li>
            <li>Thanks for listening.  </li>
            <li>But why is it better then other oils and emollients that are vaseline or petrolatum based?  </li>
            <li>This product is not pure and natural, I am glad it lists its ingredient list.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>High Recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The reason it may FEEL good to put those on, is because they usually contain lidocaine, a local numbing agent, and menthol that provides a tingling feeling (like when you chew winterfresh gum).&lt;br /&gt;SO-</li>
            <li>The first application takes about 50% of the pain and the second removes 90+%.  </li>
            <li>no. 5, FD&amp;C blue no. 1, fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Very very far from pure, but it does work for sunburn.</li>
            <li>There may have been some 100% pure Aloe Vera ADDED to the mix, but this product is loaded with different chemicals.  </li>
            <li>The color is added (dyes), the fragrance is added (fragrance + orange peel oil), and the aloe vera gel is actually aloe vera juice (way cheaper than pure gel).  </li>
            <li>Great price, but the product has a lot of additives that I&#x27;m not too crazy about.</li>
            <li>The only product I&#x27;ve ever found that works even better was also by Ocean Potion, was a blue gel called \\&quot;Ice\\&quot; and had not only Aloe but also had  , a numbing agent, which I found, and NEEDED, in Hawaii recently.</li>
            <li>no response to requests directly to Ocean Potion...</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>A natural product, known to stimulate healing and rejuvenate skin.  </li>
            <li>He likes it so much that he uses it as a daily body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>A little gooey at first, but does soak in if you don&#x27;t put too much.</li>
            <li>What does 100% pure aloe vera gel really mean and how much aloe vera is really in this product?</li>
            <li>When I was a child, my mother had a large aloe plant, and whenever I got a cut she would break off a little tab and squeeze the fluid paste onto my cut before putting on a bandage, and it ALWAYS helped sooth and heal the wounds fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great when the sun gets you bad.</li>
            <li>Is it worth saving a few bucks?</li>
            <li>If you put a lot on your skin may have a green tinge to it until it is absorbed, but it absorbs quickly especially if you are sunburned.</li>
            <li>rub it on large dark sun spots on my hand as soon as one appears.</li>
            <li>I have been a die hard aloe vera user since my first sunburn!</li>

            <li> I have been a die hard aloe vera user since my first sunburn!</li>
            <li> If it were, it wouldn&#x27;t have such a long list of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Aloe vera is the THIRD ingredient and then a list of scary ingredients including PARABENS (a cheap preservative that can be replaced by something safer) which mimic and disrupt estrogen and has been linked to some cancers.</li>
            <li> Aloe vera juice is not as thick as this stuff, but it can be easily applied with a small towel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a bad product on its own merit, but I was furious at the outright misleading name and labeling.</li>
            <li> No, not really: acrylates / C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, polysorbate 20, DMDM hydantoin, phenoxyethanol, methyl (&amp;) propyl parabens, triethanolamine, FD&amp;C yellow</li>
            <li> Definitely a must have during summer when you forget the sunscreen or for someone like me that is not very caring about sun screens.</li>
            <li> Even wearing sunscreen your skin is not completely protected.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have been using this stuff since my last trip to Hawaii.  Highly recommend it.  Great for sunburns or minor skin repair.</li>
            <li> This Aloe gel is wonderful after time in the sun - very healing and cooling, easily absorbed. Items were shipped well and arrived on time. The only product I&#x27;ve ever found that works even better was also by Ocean Potion, was a blue gel called \\&quot;Ice\\&quot; and had not only Aloe but also had  , a numbing agent, which I found, and NEEDED, in Hawaii recently. Haven&#x27;t found it in Calif. &amp; no response to requests directly to Ocean Potion... aside from this one being available, this is the next-best product for ANY kind of burn, &amp; AMZ prices are terrific!</li>
            <li> I brought two of it! Stayed outside alot at the beach. Me and my husband didnt have no more sun burn and no peeling after we used this! IT&#x27;S SO AMAZING! Will buy this again when I run out... Thank you the seller</li>
            <li> This item is a great moisturizer for after sun, swim or bath.  I use it year round.  I am only able to find it on -line</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting on your skin and it isn&#x27;t all goopy like pure aloe vera gel. It&#x27;s easy to spread around on large areas, which is essential for a sunburn. Also the pump works well.</li>
            <li> This product is not pure and natural, I am glad it lists its ingredient list. Before you buy anything, research each ingredient they use in their product to make sure you really want to use that on your skin. Is it worth saving a few bucks?</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  Really helps relieve and revitalize skin after a sunburn.  High Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> very good product and the price is low</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;PURE&amp;#34;? No, not really: acrylates / C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, polysorbate 20, DMDM hydantoin, phenoxyethanol, methyl (&amp;) propyl parabens, triethanolamine, FD&amp;C yellow no. 5, FD&amp;C blue no. 1, fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Very very far from pure, but it does work for sunburn.</li>
            <li> Many people are under the mistaken impression that this is 100% pure aloe vera from the plant. This is not correct even though this is advertised as 100% pure aloe vera gel. A product advertised as 100% pure aloe vera gel should contain 100% aloe vera. However, aloe vera is one of many ingredients in this product. I want to know what % of this product is pure aloe vera? Is it 1% or half of 1%? What does 100% pure aloe vera gel really mean and how much aloe vera is really in this product? Until we get straight and accurate answers stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of Aloe Gel for years, but it is hard to find past summer, but of course it was available thru Amazon.  Great stuff.  Medium consistency and very soothing after being out in the sun, wind or cold weather.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff to put on your arms and legs. You don&#x27;t have to be sun burned. Rub it in if your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> We use it for bites and burns and other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I rub it on large dark sun spots on my hand as soon as one appears. You have to rub it on everyday until the spot is gone.&lt;br /&gt;We also use it for dark sun spots on my husbands head.</li>
            <li> Wow. Aloe vera is the THIRD ingredient and then a list of scary ingredients including PARABENS (a cheap preservative that can be replaced by something safer) which mimic and disrupt estrogen and has been linked to some cancers. It also includes artificial color (WHY DOES IT NEED THIS!!!!????). Blue no.1 is made from petroleum,yeeeuuk. Your skin is your largest organ, and it absorbs what you put on it into the bloodstream. Be informed.</li>
            <li> works okay,  I was really looking for pure Aloe Vera Gel</li>
            <li> There may have been some 100% pure Aloe Vera ADDED to the mix, but this product is loaded with different chemicals.  I ended up buying a load of Aloe plants so I could harvest my own pure Aloe.  I don&#x27;t think this is a bad product on its own merit, but I was furious at the outright misleading name and labeling.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product and a few years back bought a 20 oz. bottle (it&#x27;s large) at Walmart for about $6. The combination of aloe and lidocaine is what makes this product a life saver. I, like millions of Amercians suffer from Neurapathy in my feet. This means that my feet burn intensely, and I also experience nerve spasms. I do take Gabapentin, a medication to stop the spasms, which does take the edge off. After a day of wearing heels, and my soles rubbing back and forth, at the end of the day my feet feel like they are sunburn on the bottom! This product relieves the pain. Now, the Walmarts in Houston, TX anyway, have stopped carrying Ocean Potion, and now carry a small 8 oz bottle of Banana Boat, aloe and lidocaine for the same price! Rip off! I will now purchase the Ocean Potion lotion via Amazon, as even adding s/h cost, at 20 oz. a bottle you get more for your money. Happy Aloe Geling!</li>
            <li> I use aloe gel for shaving my legs since I have, years now, I never have dry or bumping skin</li>
            <li> Great price, but the product has a lot of additives that I&#x27;m not too crazy about. Besides the dyes and other chemicals, there is alcohol in this product; it seems terribly ironic that most companies put alcohol (very drying!) into a product that is supposed to help provide moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, this stuff makes pretty awesome very light hold hair gel &amp; the additives aren&#x27;t any worse than most hair gel products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Upon further consideration, I chose to give this product 5 stars - it is the product as described, it shipped quickly, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obvious from the list of ingredients the makers of this product don&#x27;t understand what 100% Aloe Vera Juice means.  This stuff is not 100% Aloe Vera.  If it were, it wouldn&#x27;t have such a long list of ingredients.  I purchased it while on vacation based on the front label claiming it was nothing but pure Aloe Vera, and put it on my daughter&#x27;s sunburn.  She screamed in pain until I rinsed it off.  I now use only 100% Aloe Vera juice that is actually 100% Aloe Vera.  Imagine that...a product that is what it says it is.  If I were a wealthier person, I&#x27;d sue this company in a heartbeat for what they put us through.</li>
            <li> Works great when the sun gets you bad. Been using this potion for years and its always handy. Definitely a must have during summer when you forget the sunscreen or for someone like me that is not very caring about sun screens.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this product at Amazon. I first used it in Hawaii and just ran out so I was happy to see it online. It goes on smoothly and not sticky. Great for after a day in the sun. I love ocean potion products. Their sunscreens are great too</li>
            <li> Packaging:  Horrible, leaks like a son of a gun.&lt;br /&gt;Gel:  Not 100% aloe vera gel and has some nasty ingredients including orange peel oil (used as a cleaner and solvent), as well as methyl and propyl parabens.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturization:  None, applied it and my skin was dry less than five minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;Stickiness:  Just as sticky as other aloe vera gels.&lt;br /&gt;Safe to put on your face:  No way, has too many itchy things in it (orange peel oil and methyl and propyl parabens).&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  It&#x27;s going back to Amazon.  Don&#x27;t know where all these 5 star reviews came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient list from the bottle:  Water, glycerin, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, acrylates/c10-30 alkyl acrylate, crosspolymer, polysorbate 20, dmdm hydantoin, phenoxyethanol (ethanols are dangerous), methylparaben, propylparaben, triethanolamine (created from ethylene oxide and ammonia; used in industrial cleaners and printer ink; very dangerous), fd&amp;c yellow no 5, fd&amp;c blue no 1, fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice the ingredients.  The color is added (dyes), the fragrance is added (fragrance + orange peel oil), and the aloe vera gel is actually aloe vera juice (way cheaper than pure gel).  So nothing about this product is quality.  I&#x27;m going back to Hawaiian Tropics.  It may not be 100% aloe vera gel, but it&#x27;s way closer to it than this.  Ignore the hype; this is poor quality.</li>
            <li> This product is one-of-a-kind; and let me tell you why.  But first, let me tell you my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a city lifeguard in an outdoor pool in the 110*F+ heat of the Las Vegas, Nevada summer.  I tried every different lotion and balm to sooth my skin after 12 hours outdoors.  My regimen was this,  3 applications of 50 SPF throughout the day approx every 3 hours, but even with that, at the end of the day my skin had taken a beating.  I would get home take an ice cold shower to draw all the heat that was trapped in my skin and tissue out (to stop damage), and then lathered myself with this lotion, relax for the evening and go to sleep before doing it all over again the next day.  Let me tell you, I woke up every single morning like I hadn&#x27;t just spent 12 hours out in the sun the day prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you specifically why this product is so great:&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s water based.&lt;br /&gt;  This is important.  Water is the best fluid to assist in allowing heat to escape your body.  That&#x27;s why you sweat.  But why is it better then other oils and emollients that are vaseline or petrolatum based?  Because oils and greases will plug up and trap moisture and heat into your skin, causing even more damage than if you didn&#x27;t put anything on your skin at all.  The reason it may FEEL good to put those on, is because they usually contain lidocaine, a local numbing agent, and menthol that provides a tingling feeling (like when you chew winterfresh gum).&lt;br /&gt;SO- this product is water based, and that does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Aloe Vera-&lt;br /&gt;  A natural product, known to stimulate healing and rejuvenate skin.  When I was a child, my mother had a large aloe plant, and whenever I got a cut she would break off a little tab and squeeze the fluid paste onto my cut before putting on a bandage, and it ALWAYS helped sooth and heal the wounds fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It doesn&#x27;t dry sticky.&lt;br /&gt;  After you let this product dry after application (may take 15 minutes with generous application), you skin feels nice.  It&#x27;s not sticky or gross.  It&#x27;s something I felt comfortable going to sleep with, without having to shower it off.  (kinda silly have to take two showers in a row, just to be able to apply a skin treatment between them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe, these 3 factors are what make this product so amazing.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used this product many times and it is great. The price is good and it applies really well to your skin. He likes it so much that he uses it as a daily body moisturizer. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on my skin when I need to go out in the sun. It protects my skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. The texture is really light and I&#x27;ve also tried it on my hair. This stuff is great and I&#x27;ll order another bottle when I finish this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an idiot - I forget sunscreen and burn all the time.  I&#x27;m constantly buying aloe while traveling for a burn and I never like the product (sticky, smelly, bad texture, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this brand once and now I just buy it from amazon in bulk.  It does the job with the least intrusive combination of smell, texture, weight, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out my easily burning friends.  It works great.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product for use after getting a little too much sun. A little gooey at first, but does soak in if you don&#x27;t put too much. And Amazon&#x27;s delivery is very fast!</li>
            <li> It is a nice product to be used after IPL treatments. It is fresh and let the skin smooth. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Favorite aloe out there!</li>
            <li> Living in FL this product is a must!  Even wearing sunscreen your skin is not completely protected.  This product offers cool, refreshing, moisturizing relief from the sun once home.  Kept me from drying out and peeling!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my uncle. He has been using this same product on the back of his hands. He has brown spots on the back of his hands, and has been putting this aloe gel on a couple times a day and in just a few weeks they have already started to get smaller and some have disappeared!! I had never known aloe gel would do that!! It is also GREAT for sunburns!!!</li>
            <li> I have been a die hard aloe vera user since my first sunburn! This product not only soothes the burn, but helps cool any skin irritation and is very gentle on your skin! I gave it 5 stars because it was priced competitively, packaged great and arrived quickly. I use this product whenever my skin feels like it is burned or irritated and recommend it even for skin softening although that is not its primary use. If you put a lot on your skin may have a green tinge to it until it is absorbed, but it absorbs quickly especially if you are sunburned.</li>
            <li> Its alright. It helps with sunburn</li>
            <li> By Ibe Truthr:  I found this product years ago when it was cheap, at WallMarts.  I originally bought it because it had Aloe Gel and I thought is was pure.  Along with the other comments concerning the other products in it, I was concerned.  However, it is by far the best Aloe product I have ever used.  Don&#x27;t ask me why.  I don&#x27;t know.  It just works.  We use it for everything including rash breakouts on my dog.  Prior to that I had to use strong prescription drugs.  The Ocean Potion works better, faster and it no where as toxic.  My last bottle shared by many just ran out.  That is exactly two years.  I have also recommended it to doctors, nurses, and vets.  I have no financial interest or benefit from recommending this product.  It is a shame not to use it.  Maybe there is something out there as good as or better with a label I would feel more comfortable with.  I just do not know what it would be.  I have other bottles of &amp;#34;pure aloe&amp;#34; in my cupboard.  With the sole exception of Silvadene Cream 1% a prescription  ointment for serious burns.  Ocean beats all the others hands down.  So now you know the facts as I see them, and I am a good careful judge.  If anyone comes up with something better I would be most interested in hearing about it.  I am about to order 4 or 5 bottles because I cannot purchase it around here and I&#x27;m going to give one or two away.  I want to have a stock and at more than one location.  Do your self a favor and try it.  If you want, by far, the best burn treatment stock your first aid kit with the Silvadene also.  Its drug name is silver sulfadiazine.  It quite expensive but there is nothing close in performance.  Don&#x27;t let medical people tell you otherwise.  The first application takes about 50% of the pain and the second removes 90+%.  It also greatly speeds healing and scaring.  The insurance industry doesn&#x27;t like the cost and has doctors telling us there are other ointments that work as well.  Tell them to use them on themselves, you want the Silvadene.  If you have to pay the whole cost, its worth it and I would do it in advance of the need.  Thanks for listening.  Do you and yours a favor you will not regret.</li>
            <li> Your skin will absorb what you put on it. Dyes, fragrance, and other chemicals are not good for you, and this product contains all of those. Amazon sells 100% pure aloe vera juice. Keep it in the fridge, and apply to sun burned skin. Not only does it work better than this, but it&#x27;s also inexpensive. Aloe vera juice is not as thick as this stuff, but it can be easily applied with a small towel. Don&#x27;t support companies who try and sell you junk with deceptive wording in their descriptions. Always read the ingredients of everything you buy. If you don&#x27;t know what an ingredient is, search it on Google. Educate yourself so you can make better choices in products for your family. These companies only care about making money, not your safety.</li>
