            <li>Its working like the product claims my hair feels and lookks so much better</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels incredibly healthy after I use this duo.</li>
            <li>Hair stays so healthy when using this product.</li>
            <li>I am a hair junkie and have tried many products over the years.</li>
            <li>and I always get complements on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have been using purology for many years.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Pureology Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Favorite product.</li>
            <li>The best part is you really don&#x27;t need to use much at all; just add water.</li>
            <li>So far so good, smells great and it takes s tiny amount to build a good lather.</li>
            <li>I am also a huge fan of the Living Proof line repair shampoo, but I think that this both performs and smells a bit better.</li>
            <li>So far, I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and it leaves my hair soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The seller got it to me very quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and smooth, easy to blow out</li>
            <li>DID NOT WORK for fine hair damaged by highlights!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The added bonus is that the shampoo is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair air light</li>
            <li>so my hair has alot of flow and bounce plus it leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>This duo is a keeper, it makes my hair feather light, with lots of bounce and shine.</li>
            <li>Remember the first 6 ingredients in labels are THEE MOST IMPORTANT.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Great hair product, lasts a long time if you use it correctly!</li>
            <li>This is the shampoo I save for special occasions.</li>
            <li>The first order came and the quality was fine, but it could have been tampered with for all I know.</li>
            <li>This is not only my favorite reparative shampoo, but also my favorite product in the Pureology line.</li>
            <li>but amazingly, also cleanses your hair, unlike so many other sulfate-free products out there that have no cleansing ability.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone that really wants a shampoo/conditioner that is effective</li>
            <li>The conditioner is white so not hard to keep color, but smell was a huge giveaway!!!  </li>
            <li>and I have medium fine and straight hair.</li>
            <li>Very much worth the investment.</li>
            <li>love it  leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>They are not getting absorbed.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Pureology is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>A friend told me about this product and said, \\&quot;It might be pricey but it&#x27;s worth every penny\\&quot; and she was right.</li>
            <li>They leave my hair feeling very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>That all ends this week, the new bottle has a snap on lid and just as easy as it snaps on it snaps off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much it lathers up the second time.</li>
            <li>This was my first time to try the repair formula.  </li>
            <li>washing my hair, I first use about a pea sized amount to shampoo my scalp, rinse then do it again.</li>
            <li>Really like these!  </li>
            <li>I really like the conditioner but not crazy about the shampoo as it dries and tangles my hair.</li>
            <li>Long story short my hair feels great</li>
            <li>and i would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I love pureology essential repair.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is higher up than anything helpful, and they use Mineral oil.. NOT coconut, olive etc... but Mineral oil, a petroleum product.</li>
            <li>, that can actually create a barrier on the top layer</li>
            <li>.... especially if you receive regular color treatments.  keeps hair moist, rich and looking nice and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>have never left a product review before, because in general I am very happy with the products I buy, because I choose them carefully.</li>
            <li>It works well, but I don&#x27;t find it too different from more reasonably priced shampoo.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft,but this is pretty much all it did.</li>
            <li>Most people do hot oil treatments on their dry hair when what it really needs is to be hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have colored my hair for over 20 years and this is the first product that really works for a very damaged colored hair.</li>
            <li>will reorder the large ones now</li>
            <li>Feels very silky.</li>
            <li>I also highlight my hair and the color seems to stay very well.</li>
            <li>I never really believed that one variety of shampoo and conditioner could make a substantially greater difference in my hair than another.</li>
            <li>You cant beat the price I use to buy from hair dresser and it cost twice as much as these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive but incredible.</li>
            <li>Fast delievery</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so very misleading.</li>
            <li>no matter how much conditioner I used.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rinse your hair really well or the conditioner will weigh it down.</li>
            <li>If youa re going to continue using this shampoo with the new design you need to make certain you seal the bottle with tape to keep it from popping off.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and bouncy without any oil, as well as I can skip a day of washing my hair and it will still fresh and smell fresh the next day.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and live in Houston</li>
            <li>I use pureology super strait on opposite days.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My hair was badly damaged after a salon dye job, and this shampoo was wonderful in helping stop the breakage and loss.</li>
            <li>Even with washing my hair twice I still dont use as much as I would with a cheap shampoo AND without over drying my previously dyed hair.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it last longer than other shampoos (because it&#x27;s concentrated) but it smells amazing and leaves my long, wavy, frizzy, and fine hair...</li>
            <li>A new bottle.</li>
            <li>To prevent breakage I try to go as long as possible between washes so shampoo and conditioner last a long time for me which makes it worth the extra $ for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Cannot be certain if you will receive 100% quality product or if they have mixed it with something else.</li>
            <li>It had the same effect as my much cheaper $ 6.00 shampoo.</li>
            <li>(I have naturally wavy/fizz prone hair).</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and it makes my hair so soft and my hair even feels thicker.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I would not use it everyday, because it is a rebuilding product, but on days when I want my hair to look fabulous, I turn to this product.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>this really brought my hair back to life!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this product since it disappeared off the shelves in the old lavender bottles.</li>
            <li>No heavy build up, rinses quite well.</li>
            <li>I switched to their volumizing formula for the summer, but I will probably come back to get more of the green repair when winter comes</li>
            <li>Anything actually good for your hair is so far down the list that it becomes pointless.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are on the fence between the hydrate and the essential repair.</li>
            <li>I am of African American decent and this product has worked wonders on my hair!</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth the extra cost, and you don&#x27;t need much so use as little as possible!</li>
            <li>After the first wash, when my hair dried, it looked like I had a mop of hair on my head: it left my hair super dry, puffy and added extreme freeze to it (and I have straight hair, not curly).</li>
            <li>Back to getting my supply from the slaon directly.</li>
            <li>I did come back to reorder when I ran out, but the second order came with Pureology branded tape sealing the lids shut, which made me feel like it was definitely the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I tried the hydrate shampoo first by Purelogoy and was disappointed by the results and decided to try this product and was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>We packed for a trip last week and when we arrived home the shampoo cap came off and made a huge mess and all of the shampoo was wasted.</li>

            <li> It made my hair soft,but this is pretty much all it did.</li>
            <li> Most people do hot oil treatments on their dry hair when what it really needs is to be hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for over 20 years and this is the first product that really works for a very damaged colored hair.</li>
            <li> will reorder the large ones now</li>
            <li> Feels very silky.</li>
            <li> I also highlight my hair and the color seems to stay very well.</li>
            <li> I never really believed that one variety of shampoo and conditioner could make a substantially greater difference in my hair than another.</li>
            <li> You cant beat the price I use to buy from hair dresser and it cost twice as much as these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but incredible.</li>
            <li> Fast delievery</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so very misleading.</li>
            <li> no matter how much conditioner I used.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> Make sure to rinse your hair really well or the conditioner will weigh it down.</li>
            <li> If youa re going to continue using this shampoo with the new design you need to make certain you seal the bottle with tape to keep it from popping off.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and bouncy without any oil, as well as I can skip a day of washing my hair and it will still fresh and smell fresh the next day.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and live in Houston</li>
            <li> I use pureology super strait on opposite days.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair was badly damaged after a salon dye job, and this shampoo was wonderful in helping stop the breakage and loss.</li>
            <li> Even with washing my hair twice I still dont use as much as I would with a cheap shampoo AND without over drying my previously dyed hair.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it last longer than other shampoos (because it&#x27;s concentrated) but it smells amazing and leaves my long, wavy, frizzy, and fine hair...</li>
            <li> A new bottle.</li>
            <li> To prevent breakage I try to go as long as possible between washes so shampoo and conditioner last a long time for me which makes it worth the extra $ for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Cannot be certain if you will receive 100% quality product or if they have mixed it with something else.</li>
            <li> It had the same effect as my much cheaper $ 6.00 shampoo.</li>
            <li> (I have naturally wavy/fizz prone hair).</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and it makes my hair so soft and my hair even feels thicker.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I would not use it everyday, because it is a rebuilding product, but on days when I want my hair to look fabulous, I turn to this product.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> this really brought my hair back to life!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product since it disappeared off the shelves in the old lavender bottles.</li>
            <li> No heavy build up, rinses quite well.</li>
            <li> I switched to their volumizing formula for the summer, but I will probably come back to get more of the green repair when winter comes</li>
            <li> Anything actually good for your hair is so far down the list that it becomes pointless.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are on the fence between the hydrate and the essential repair.</li>
            <li> I am of African American decent and this product has worked wonders on my hair!</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth the extra cost, and you don&#x27;t need much so use as little as possible!</li>
            <li> After the first wash, when my hair dried, it looked like I had a mop of hair on my head: it left my hair super dry, puffy and added extreme freeze to it (and I have straight hair, not curly).</li>
            <li> Back to getting my supply from the slaon directly.</li>
            <li> I did come back to reorder when I ran out, but the second order came with Pureology branded tape sealing the lids shut, which made me feel like it was definitely the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I tried the hydrate shampoo first by Purelogoy and was disappointed by the results and decided to try this product and was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> We packed for a trip last week and when we arrived home the shampoo cap came off and made a huge mess and all of the shampoo was wasted.</li>
            <li> My hair hardly falls out anymore, and I use 90% less product and my hair is soft and full.</li>
            <li> Today we received almost half of the cost of the bottle which was new when we started.</li>
            <li> I would not use it everyday, maybe once a week because it is a rebuilding product and using it too much can dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me about 20 or more to dry my hair (thick hair)</li>
            <li> I color, I flat iron, I blow dry and occasionally tease and hairspray.</li>
            <li> but since my colored hair is very dry decided to try the essential repair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and color/</li>
            <li> a long way.</li>
            <li> Having it dry and damaged on top of its unfortunate natural state sucks.</li>
            <li> In other words its a total pain in the a$$.</li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged from perms, it was frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> I had been using Surface products, but they started to dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> My hair was getting dry and brittle</li>
            <li> I have dry hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the product will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is not normal for pureology products.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, less frazzled, and stronger when I use Essential Repair ---</li>
            <li> This is a cheap filler in a very expensive product, that cannot penetrate the hair shaft (molecules are too big and NOT water soluble)</li>
            <li> My local salon recommended this product because i am trying to grow out my hair, but it is hard for me to make appointments for a health trim on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no glitches.</li>
            <li> I find the conditioner not strong enough</li>
            <li> I use it ever other day.</li>
            <li> Wish they still made this works extremely well on my hair.</li>
            <li> Since then my salon has moved on to other products</li>
            <li> I do use a small amount of Argon oil on my ends before I flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair that I put through the ringer as far as it goes with heat (curling iron, straightener, blow dryer, etc.)</li>
            <li> Look forward to trying their other products!  </li>
            <li> I feel there is less shedding since using Pureology.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair feel heavy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> It is not cheap and I feel like I wasted my money on something I will just throw out.</li>
            <li> usually have issues with color shampoos (allergic gives me hives lots of shampoos</li>
            <li> bought the small one to try it out.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo, HATE!</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and dry and this shampoo was a Godsend!!  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, somewhat thick, and has a weird frizzy uneven wave.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed at such an oversight and annoyed that I had to take the time to take it to UPS to ship it back.</li>
            <li> Hard to get a comb through.</li>
            <li> we have hard water</li>
            <li> I complained about it and never got a refund for it.</li>
            <li> I have read some of the negative reviews, but I wanted to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> Last week I ran out, and within two days of using my old product, my hair was in awful condition.</li>
            <li> (my hair gets really dry in the cold weather).</li>
            <li> It is a green shampoo so it would be difficult to mix it with another and keep the color, etc.</li>
            <li> It is pure grease and doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair, so disappointed!!!!!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll read articles that say oh that&#x27;s all false, but</li>
            <li> But Pureology proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this product is marketed for use on damaged hair if it makes your hair feel and look worse!</li>
            <li> It is expensive but lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wary about not buying this from the salon, but for the price difference</li>
            <li> I had terrible damage from using a flat iron and this has saved my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels like straw, not healthy, looks bad, styled horribly.</li>
            <li> Saved my hair from a really bad bleach job.</li>
            <li> the company posting those articles doesn&#x27;t want you to think mineral oil is bad, and 2.</li>
            <li> The makeup of oil vs ur hair, you&#x27;ll understand, its bad.</li>
            <li> But this one is so bad, I have to say something!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed...</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> All I can say is awful!</li>
            <li> I have horrible hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Made my hair feel heavy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and Conditioner work great.  I use it in combination to my Ouidad products.  I use Pureology once or twice a week. Has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago because my hair stylist recommend it to me,saying it keeps your hair color longer...Well,it doesn&#x27;t at all.It had the same effect as my much cheaper $ 6.00 shampoo.It made my hair soft,but this is pretty much all it did.I am very disappointed...</li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged from perms, it was frizzy and dry. A friend told me about this product and said, \\&quot;It might be pricey but it&#x27;s worth every penny\\&quot; and she was right. Most people do hot oil treatments on their dry hair when what it really needs is to be hydrated. This product does that and more. The seller got it to me very quickly. Absolutely no glitches.</li>
            <li> best shampoo for split ends</li>
            <li> I have long hair and color/highight about every 6-7 weeks. This duo made a difference immediately. My hair is shiny and smooth, easy to blow out (I have naturally wavy/fizz prone hair). Feels very silky. To prevent breakage I try to go as long as possible between washes so shampoo and conditioner last a long time for me which makes it worth the extra $ for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I got his prior to giving birth. It came only the shampoo without the conditioner. I complained about it and never got a refund for it. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I have never found a shampoo and conditioner that worked so well on my hair. I have very thick, curly hair that I put through the ringer as far as it goes with heat (curling iron, straightener, blow dryer, etc.) and this combo made my hair look and feel amazing. Its definitely worth the extra cost, and you don&#x27;t need much so use as little as possible!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have very curly hair and live in Houston so the friz is always a problem. Pureology makes my hair softer and easier to control. I also highlight my hair and the color seems to stay very well. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is the best shampoo and conditioner i have tried.  my hair is softer and healthier as a result of using it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with how healthy my hair is since I started to use it. Very pleased with helpfulness of Kandi cosmetics follow through on order and prompt customer service. Will order from them again.</li>
            <li> This product is great. My hair looks and feel a lot better. I use it ever other day. I use pureology super strait on opposite days. I would recommend all pureology product. I haven&#x27;t found one yet that wasn&#x27;t awesome.</li>
            <li> I love pureology shampoos and conditioners. These are the best you can buy. I haven&#x27;t had my hair colored for a year now but these shampoos and conditioners are awesome. Any one who wants great hair, colored or not, should look into Pureology.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Purelogy Essential Repair duo for almost two years. It does a wonderful job keeping my hair healthy and prolonging the life of my color. The added bonus is that the shampoo is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pureology for 10 years!  This was my first time to try the repair formula.  It smells great and leaves my hair silky smooth.  You have to rinse out well though because it tends to leave a residue</li>
            <li> I was worried about the smell, because some of purelogy products smell like dog shampoo. But this was is wonderful. I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I have read some of the negative reviews, but I wanted to try it anyway.  So far, I am happy with it.  My color has not faded and it doesn&#x27;t have the ingredients that I am shunning away from.</li>
            <li> I am African American with relaxed hair. This pureology combo is excellent. Leaves hair air light so my hair has alot of flow and bounce plus it leaves my hair smooth. I do use a small amount of Argon oil on my ends before I flat iron. I would not use it everyday, maybe once a week because it is a rebuilding product and using it too much can dry out my hair. All and all this product is perfect, leaves relaxed hair shiny, bouncy and smooth!</li>
            <li> This stuff saves my hair after I color it. If you color your hair and struggle with breakage afterwords, use this shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> These products work well to keep hair color beautiful.  I find the conditioner not strong enough and I have medium fine and straight hair.</li>
            <li> I never really believed that one variety of shampoo and conditioner could make a substantially greater difference in my hair than another. But Pureology proved me wrong. My hair is softer, less frazzled, and stronger when I use Essential Repair --- whether I let it air-dry or blow-dry. Very much worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Saved my hair from a really bad bleach job. It was stretching and breaking.&lt;br /&gt;I usually have issues with color shampoos (allergic gives me hives lots of shampoos do) Not this one absolutely love it! and the replacement strengthen shampoo!</li>
            <li> love it  leaves my hair soft and shiny. it is great for color treated hair. bought the small one to try it out. will reorder the large ones now</li>
            <li> I had been using Surface products, but they started to dry my hair out. So I came back to Pureology and I am so happy!! I use the Essential Repair Shampoo, Conditioner, Essential Repair Mask, Split End Repair and Shine Max. I use The Essential Repair Shampoo/Conditoner/Mask once a week, then I use Pureology Hydrate Shampoo and Conditioner the rest of the time. Pureology has brought my deep copper red colored hair back from the brink. My hair is once again healthy, shines, soft and smells great!</li>
            <li> My hair feels stronger. I feel there is less shedding since using Pureology.  I would recommend using both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this works great makes hair look and feel healthy. You cant beat the price I use to buy from hair dresser and it cost twice as much as these.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does not smell the greatest but my hair has never been more healthy and shiny. Remember to use only a little!!&lt;br /&gt;Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The very best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo I save for special occasions. It&#x27;s expensive but incredible. Not only does it last longer than other shampoos (because it&#x27;s concentrated) but it smells amazing and leaves my long, wavy, frizzy, and fine hair... manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When washing my hair, I first use about a pea sized amount to shampoo my scalp, rinse then do it again. It&#x27;s amazing how much it lathers up the second time. Even with washing my hair twice I still dont use as much as I would with a cheap shampoo AND without over drying my previously dyed hair.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Fast delievery and I love the prooduct. Its working like the product claims my hair feels and lookks so much better</li>
            <li> Love this product, I have used Pureology before and it is amazing shampoo and conditioner. A little goes a long way, so the product will last for a long time. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Really like these!  Highly recommended!  Using salon product at home is convenient.  Look forward to trying their other products!  Love the scent!</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK for fine hair damaged by highlights!&lt;br /&gt;I have never left a product review before, because in general I am very happy with the products I buy, because I choose them carefully. But this one is so bad, I have to say something! I bought these shampoo and conditioner hoping that it will help repair some damage caused by years of blond highlights. After the first wash, when my hair dried, it looked like I had a mop of hair on my head: it left my hair super dry, puffy and added extreme freeze to it (and I have straight hair, not curly). I don&#x27;t understand how this product is marketed for use on damaged hair if it makes your hair feel and look worse! It is not cheap and I feel like I wasted my money on something I will just throw out.</li>
            <li> The two bottles that I had purchased (EssentialRepair Shampoo &amp; the Conditioner) were both opened. The factory seal was not in tact or anywhere to be found. Cannot be certain if you will receive 100% quality product or if they have mixed it with something else.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by stylist. It works well</li>
            <li> The conditioner I was sent smelled like it was mixed with another conditioner, not all pureology!  To double check I went to the store for the same conditioner. They were different!!!  The shampoo I was sent seems to be all pureology. It is a green shampoo so it would be difficult to mix it with another and keep the color, etc. The conditioner is white so not hard to keep color, but smell was a huge giveaway!!!  I am extremely disappointed with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend so I tried it. I really like the conditioner but not crazy about the shampoo as it dries and tangles my hair.</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for over 20 years and this is the first product that really works for a very damaged colored hair. My hair has a healthy look, shines..love it!</li>
            <li> I regularly use the Hydrate formula by Pureology but since my colored hair is very dry decided to try the essential repair. All I can say is awful! I could tell from minute I sudsed (tried to suds, no suds) up. My hair feels like straw, not healthy, looks bad, styled horribly. Hard to get a comb through. I love Pureology, but stick with the purple hydrate version!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  It is one of my favorite products.  My hair feels incredibly healthy after I use this duo.</li>
            <li> My local salon recommended this product because i am trying to grow out my hair, but it is hard for me to make appointments for a health trim on a regular basis. I have been using this product and it makes my hair so soft and my hair even feels thicker. I have no split ends that I have seen. The best part is you really don&#x27;t need to use much at all; just add water. Long story short my hair feels great and i would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Pureology products are wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of it&#x27;s natural oils.  Hair stays so healthy when using this product.</li>
            <li> I believe the product was tainted. The shampoo did not smell like purology. There was a hint of amonia to the sent. This is not normal for pureology products. I will never buy this product through this source again. Back to getting my supply from the slaon directly.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and dry and this shampoo was a Godsend!!  I highly recommend it to anyone that really wants a shampoo/conditioner that is effective</li>
            <li> I am of African American decent and this product has worked wonders on my hair! I am a hair junkie and have tried many products over the years. This duo is a keeper, it makes my hair feather light, with lots of bounce and shine. I have been using it for over a year now and I always get complements on how healthy my hair looks. I would not use it everyday, because it is a rebuilding product, but on days when I want my hair to look fabulous, I turn to this product. Try it you will love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love pureology essential repair.  I had terrible damage from using a flat iron and this has saved my hair.  It is expensive but lasts forever.  Make sure to rinse your hair really well or the conditioner will weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Smells great and it leaves my hair soft and hydrated. I also use this on my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using purology for many years. That all ends this week, the new bottle has a snap on lid and just as easy as it snaps on it snaps off. We packed for a trip last week and when we arrived home the shampoo cap came off and made a huge mess and all of the shampoo was wasted. A new bottle. I contacted the company who was apologetic and offered to reimburse our cost of the shampoo and pass the information on the produce design along. Today we received almost half of the cost of the bottle which was new when we started. If youa re going to continue using this shampoo with the new design you need to make certain you seal the bottle with tape to keep it from popping off.</li>
            <li> This is not only my favorite reparative shampoo, but also my favorite product in the Pureology line. It does an incredible job eliminating breakage- but amazingly, also cleanses your hair, unlike so many other sulfate-free products out there that have no cleansing ability. My hair was badly damaged after a salon dye job, and this shampoo was wonderful in helping stop the breakage and loss. I used it with the Pureology Moisturizing conditioner. I am also a huge fan of the Living Proof line repair shampoo, but I think that this both performs and smells a bit better.</li>
            <li> Great hair product, lasts a long time if you use it correctly! Definitely see a difference in my hair when I use pureology vs store brands</li>
            <li> I got educated about the ingredients used in beauty products, and read the label. Read it, you&#x27;ll be amazed. Fragrance is higher up than anything helpful, and they use Mineral oil.. NOT coconut, olive etc... but Mineral oil, a petroleum product. This is a cheap filler in a very expensive product, that cannot penetrate the hair shaft (molecules are too big and NOT water soluble), that can actually create a barrier on the top layer your hair- so those after conditioner treatment products you use? They are not getting absorbed. You&#x27;ll read articles that say oh that&#x27;s all false, but you if you understand  1. the company posting those articles doesn&#x27;t want you to think mineral oil is bad, and 2. The makeup of oil vs ur hair, you&#x27;ll understand, its bad. Anything actually good for your hair is so far down the list that it becomes pointless. Remember the first 6 ingredients in labels are THEE MOST IMPORTANT. I&#x27;m posting this because with a name like \\&quot;Pureology\\&quot; you think you would be getting the best of the best, along with the price tag- it&#x27;s so very misleading.</li>
            <li> we have hard water and i highlight my hair. My hair was getting dry and brittle this really brought my hair back to life!</li>
            <li> I tried the hydrate shampoo first by Purelogoy and was disappointed by the results and decided to try this product and was thrilled with the results. It leaves my hair soft and bouncy without any oil, as well as I can skip a day of washing my hair and it will still fresh and smell fresh the next day. I highly recommend this product if you are on the fence between the hydrate and the essential repair. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo, HATE! the conditioner. It is pure grease and doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair, so disappointed!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time.  I do a lot of traveling and it keeps my hair looking good and gives it the moisture and nutrients that are needed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Pureology Shampoo and Conditioner.  This kind works best with my hair.  It usually takes me about 20 or more to dry my hair (thick hair) but with this - its like 8 min tops!  My hair has never been better - and Amazon has the best pricing!</li>
            <li> I have horrible hair. I am only 22, yet I was losing it almost in chunks and it was feeling like straw no matter how much conditioner I used. Pureology is definitely worth the investment. My hair hardly falls out anymore, and I use 90% less product and my hair is soft and full. Last week I ran out, and within two days of using my old product, my hair was in awful condition. I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> So far so good, smells great and it takes s tiny amount to build a good lather. Hair is looking healthier after a week.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product since it disappeared off the shelves in the old lavender bottles. It is the only shampoo/conditioner that produces a shine on my colored gray hair. No heavy build up, rinses quite well. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wary about not buying this from the salon, but for the price difference I though I&#x27;d give it a try. The first order came and the quality was fine, but it could have been tampered with for all I know. I did come back to reorder when I ran out, but the second order came with Pureology branded tape sealing the lids shut, which made me feel like it was definitely the real stuff. I switched to their volumizing formula for the summer, but I will probably come back to get more of the green repair when winter comes (my hair gets really dry in the cold weather).</li>
            <li> Wish they still made this works extremely well on my hair.</li>
            <li> It works well, but I don&#x27;t find it too different from more reasonably priced shampoo. I bought it because several hair stylist recommend it.</li>
            <li> Favorite product. Fast Shipping. Wish pureology still made this !!</li>
            <li> .... especially if you receive regular color treatments.  keeps hair moist, rich and looking nice and hydrated.  This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I started using these products because they were recommended at my salon as being more kind to color-treated hair.  Since then my salon has moved on to other products but I have stuck with these.  They leave my hair feeling very clean and soft.</li>
            <li> All I received was the shampoo. Somehow the conditioner did not make it in the box. I was disappointed at such an oversight and annoyed that I had to take the time to take it to UPS to ship it back.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair. I color, I flat iron, I blow dry and occasionally tease and hairspray. My hair is long, somewhat thick, and has a weird frizzy uneven wave. In other words its a total pain in the a$$. Having it dry and damaged on top of its unfortunate natural state sucks. I see a noticeable difference when I use this shampoo and conditioner. In also like the hydrating one in the purple bottle, both formulas are great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff for 50 yr old colored hair! Hair comes out silky and looks sooo healthy!  You will notice a difference after just one washing.  Try it!</li>
