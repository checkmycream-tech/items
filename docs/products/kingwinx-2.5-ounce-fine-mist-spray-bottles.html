            <li>These spray bottles arrived early and worked perfectly.</li>

            <li>I ordered 2 more sets.</li>
            <li>they could not have been more pleased.</li>
            <li>Its an OK product for the price you are paying.</li>
            <li>I will pay more and get one that doesn&#x27;t wash my hands.</li>
            <li>But they work great so far.</li>
            <li>I also have glasses cleaner in one of them in my home for easy access.</li>
            <li>so I guess it is fine to mix in this bottle and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them for a month now and they are still working just fine.</li>
            <li>these are sturdy little bottles fit perfectly in my gym bag.</li>
            <li>They are cheap bottles</li>
            <li>I bought these for my massage practice to give out free samples of my magnesium oil.</li>
            <li>I filled one with Neatsfoot Oil and it sprays my boots like a champ.  </li>
            <li>When I had originally ordered them I thought it was going to be a waste, that I wouldn&#x27;t ever use all 5 of the bottles, but it was the best deal at the time, so I bought the 5 pack.</li>
            <li>I bought them to keep screen cleaner in that I use to clean glasses, IPad, Iphone, etc.</li>
            <li>I use them to clean my earpiercings</li>
            <li>I use these for mixing perfume mostly but also find little spray bottles are handy to keep around for many things-glass cleaner for the car or for eyeglasses, etc.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>They are good quality bottles, work as expected.  </li>
            <li>I love these cute little bottles.</li>
            <li>I used my first order of these to fill with home made spray cat nip to give clients.</li>
            <li>The bottle never last for more that 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li>They spray the first time every time.  </li>
            <li>so I can always have a clean, clear faceshield for safer riding.</li>
            <li>and they work very well.</li>
            <li>One came out of the box crushed, but ok for what I need them for.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointing.</li>
            <li>no problem thanks.</li>
            <li>These bottles are a bit more sturdy than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t check the effectiveness of the spray pump, because I poured everything back into the original bottle once I got home.</li>
            <li>: They&#x27;re cute, they&#x27;re small, they don&#x27;t leak, and they spray evenly.</li>
            <li>Besides the shipping taking a couple weeks because it was so far away</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I had put each small bottle in a snack-size zip-lock plastic bag.  </li>
            <li>In general, they served the purpose.  </li>
            <li>They may dribble a little, but that&#x27;s all the better for my messy art.</li>

            <li> Despite the fact that I firmly screwed the tops back on, there was considerable leakage!!  </li>
            <li> They took a long time to get here.</li>

            <li> Came on time and worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using about three months and no leaks like other bottles that I have tried.</li>
            <li> So that you can see the little vile you drop down into the bottle.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday twice a day.</li>
            <li> I use them for my mosquito repellent and they spray a fine mist.</li>
            <li> why buy these small spray bottles for $1.99 at CVS when you can get them from the source for about 20% of that amount (assuming you buy in bulk at 5 bottle packs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the wrong type I guess:(</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!</li>

            <li> I love these cute little bottles. When I had originally ordered them I thought it was going to be a waste, that I wouldn&#x27;t ever use all 5 of the bottles, but it was the best deal at the time, so I bought the 5 pack. I&#x27;m shocked at how many legitimate uses I&#x27;ve come up with for these bottles. I only have 1 left, and I thought I wouldn&#x27;t ever use them...Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some helpful information: They&#x27;re cute, they&#x27;re small, they don&#x27;t leak, and they spray evenly.</li>
            <li> Priced well but some sprayers didn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> Use them for motorcycle faceshield cleaner. I carry them in each of my motorcycles so I can always have a clean, clear faceshield for safer riding. I also have glasses cleaner in one of them in my home for easy access.</li>
            <li> One broke already- but there are 4 more.</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY AND QUICK DELIVERY, THANKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding these on other sites at a responsible price. I used my first order of these to fill with home made spray cat nip to give clients. Great price and they work very well. I ordered 2 more sets.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  They are good quality bottles, work as expected.  I bought them to keep screen cleaner in that I use to clean glasses, IPad, Iphone, etc.</li>
            <li> These bottle are wonderful for mixing rose water or what ever else you can think of. So that you can see the little vile you drop down into the bottle. The bottle never last for more that 2-3 weeks so I guess it is fine to mix in this bottle and not the amber glass that can be recommended. I gave them to my daughters for Valentine&#x27;s Day they could not have been more pleased.</li>
            <li> These spray bottles arrived early and worked perfectly. I use them for my mosquito repellent and they spray a fine mist.</li>
            <li> Came on time and worked as expected.</li>
            <li> These took a while to arrive, but work beautifully.  I make my own rubber stamp cleaner and use these for the cleaner.  They spray the first time every time.  They were inexpensive, so I wasn&#x27;t too sure, but mine work great.</li>
            <li> I bought a 200 ml bottle of fragrance overseas and used these to decant it into carry-on acceptable sizes.  Despite the fact that I firmly screwed the tops back on, there was considerable leakage!!  Fortunately, I had put each small bottle in a snack-size zip-lock plastic bag.  In general, they served the purpose.  I didn&#x27;t check the effectiveness of the spray pump, because I poured everything back into the original bottle once I got home.</li>
            <li> these are sturdy little bottles fit perfectly in my gym bag. I have been using about three months and no leaks like other bottles that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is as described.</li>
            <li> why buy these small spray bottles for $1.99 at CVS when you can get them from the source for about 20% of that amount (assuming you buy in bulk at 5 bottle packs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these just hoping a couple of them would work well, and ALL OF THEM do.  Very good buy.  I use this for cleaning products and my wife uses them for cosmetics.  An excellent buy!</li>
            <li> I use these for mixing perfume mostly but also find little spray bottles are handy to keep around for many things-glass cleaner for the car or for eyeglasses, etc. Great to carry for traveling too.</li>
            <li> I used the bottles for fabric paint. One got clogged and one broke. I used the wrong type I guess:(</li>
            <li> These were smaller than the picture makes it look. The size is still no problem but when you start spraying they leak. Its an OK product for the price you are paying. They are cheap bottles and you get what you pay for. Next time I need a spray bottle I will pay more and get one that doesn&#x27;t wash my hands.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected.</li>
            <li> Bottles are good but some tend to leak through the top. But besides that bottles did the job. Not bad</li>
            <li> Besides the shipping taking a couple weeks because it was so far away I love the product for the price!</li>
            <li> One came out of the box crushed, but ok for what I need them for.</li>
            <li> I only received one bottle. Extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my massage practice to give out free samples of my magnesium oil. They all work like they are supposed to and are perfect for what I needed them for.</li>
            <li> I paid for 3 sets of 5 bottles. 15 bottles. Instead I received 3 bottles. Very dissapointing.</li>
            <li> Very good.  Came quicker than expeced.</li>
            <li> really good and convenient to use. no problem thanks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem yet. I&#x27;ve had them for a month now and they are still working just fine. I use them everyday twice a day. I use them to clean my earpiercings so I have to spray them side ways. They did not leak once.</li>
            <li> perfect for my essential oil sprays, great size to put in a purse!</li>
            <li> Nice size for mixing craft paint with water and spray. They may dribble a little, but that&#x27;s all the better for my messy art.</li>
            <li> these worked will for what I needed</li>
            <li> They took a long time to get here. But they work great so far. I am using them for essential oils and my daughter is trying to make perfume.</li>
            <li> These bottles are a bit more sturdy than I expected.  I filled one with Neatsfoot Oil and it sprays my boots like a champ.  The nozzle hasn&#x27;t clogged from the oil.  Thumbs up!</li>
