            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>i love the eyelashes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay a bit more for better quality.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Will buy again:-)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>I love every style and the quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>These tantalizing fake/false eyelashes makes your eyes look bigger, bright, and attractive.</li>
            <li>This gives me many style options and depends on my mood of the day and evening.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love it</li>
            <li>But in all I love this Lash set</li>
            <li>The shipper was great as far as the processing and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>They are lovely and light.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply also.</li>
            <li>but I never recieved the free applicator</li>
            <li>The eyes are a big part of the impression you make on others and these eyelashes is a great tool to enhance your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think the lashes are just right and not too over the top.</li>
            <li>Very nice having a big box of lashes!!</li>
            <li>This is definitely my new favorite!</li>
            <li>The quality is good and it comes with a tool to put them on (wished I would have read it more carefully since I ordered one without knowing it</li>
            <li>The saying is true: you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>For the price is really not bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they wore 5 different pairs of this 7 individual styles , I asked them the results of each pair they said no falling off and stuck on perfectly</li>
            <li>quick shipment.</li>
            <li>&gt;  Seller delivers quickly and on time.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;am the funny type if something is too cheap</li>
            <li>I had ordered this product one other time and liked most of the lashes.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Ultimately,  I feel its a great deal and would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Not the most comfortable lash, and most of the styles are over the top at least for me.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, if you are good at applying and adventurous,  you will like the more dramatic styles.</li>
            <li>Very neat, quick delivery!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>so when you&#x27;ll search for false lashes to wear remember that advice because of the 70 pairs and sister and friends perfect results</li>
            <li>3.2 ouncesr false lashes to wear remember that advice because of the 70 pairs and sister and friends perfect results</li>
            <li>Finding the best false eyelashes is a challenge.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>~ I seen it first hand</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and you look funny when they are fluttering off.</li>
            <li>Also love the different styles, I&#x27;m set for a while!</li>
            <li>I have a favorite and would like to get all of only that style</li>
            <li>They are so nice, super sturdy but not uncomfortable or stiff.</li>
            <li>It is a high quality and affordable price and can be used many times for parties, special events, and just simply for daily use.</li>
            <li>Other than that no broken single lashes and the shipping was great too.</li>
            <li>I get worried about that it&#x27;s possibly their made cheap</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend them.</li>
            <li>;P haha can&#x27;t have everything though</li>
            <li>My first set of false eyelashes, I think they&#x27;re pretty good quality</li>
            <li>My favorite bundle from all the other ones.</li>
            <li>best feature about these fake eyelashes is the different styles and extra pairs available.</li>
            <li>When I apply makeup, I notice that applying a thick false eyelashes makes your eyes pop and start looking more gorgeous and awake!</li>
            <li>I love them I cut 1 pair in half to glue to another pair for a new look!</li>
            <li>and you get a decent amount for the price.</li>
            <li>I gave one star for the nice assortment and another star for the quick delivery, otherwise these lashes feel very stiff and do not resemble human hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I will keep practicing and may be more comfortable with the dramatic lashes.  </li>
            <li>Kind of hard to remove from the packaging</li>
            <li>Lots of choices of lashes and will last for a long time there are so many.</li>
            <li>If you wear fake lashes..this is a fabulous bargin!!!</li>
            <li>These are ok as a back up but not really the quality I am used to.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal as they were pretty inexpensive,</li>
            <li>I am still new at using and applying them but once on, they do look natural.</li>
            <li>everyone to make it clear</li>
            <li>and they stayed on well, also look natural.</li>
            <li>And arrived 2 days early</li>
            <li>Decent enough product</li>
            <li>They are very thin and break easily as you peel them off the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that they don&#x27;t claim to be reusable like most I buy so for the price it doesn&#x27;t really matter if you break a few.</li>
            <li>Loved all the different styles but the fact that the band hangs a little past the lashes bugs me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no big deal to cut them but it would be useful if it didn&#x27;t have that little situation.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s no big deal to cut them but it would be useful if it didn&#x27;t have that little situation.</li>
            <li> Working from the center outward to the outer  corners , lightly press the false lashes to match your natural line .</li>
            <li> make sure the false lashes are lined up in the center .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thay are too long and too difficult to apply, tried many times, tried trimming them also and finally gave up.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, , well really just suggestion, is that you must buy  all of the diffetent styles.</li>
            <li> a derma roller not that long ago</li>
            <li> I have two total the other one I</li>
            <li> These are nothing like what I expected.</li>
            <li> The.bundle lashes are not real hair lashes</li>
            <li> so they are a bit harder and thicker but these softer than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> so all 5 total including my sister put these on instead of usual lashes</li>
            <li> but I asked sister and other 4 to tell me the results of wearing these .Now</li>
            <li> so my younger one who&#x27;s in her late 20s</li>
            <li> Apply a line of adhesive across the entire length of the lash strip and wait at least 30 seconds until adhesive becomes tacky .&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i wish they were all thick but different types</li>
            <li> Apply lash strip to the base of your natural lash , starting from the middle .</li>
            <li> but if money is tight then maybe I would.</li>
            <li> I caught them getting ready to go out and have a girls night out , say this is awkward</li>
            <li> If false lashes are too wide, trim lashes one at a time from outer edge .&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I gave as gift this box of 70 pairs false eyelashes to my other sister .</li>
            <li> but I have my usual complaint that they just dont stay on</li>

            <li> &amp;#34;Terrific buy- nice assort- you can&#x27;t beat it and I didn&#x27;t realize it came with lash attachment tool!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love the variety of lashes.</li>
            <li> great buy!! will order again</li>
            <li> Not the most comfortable lash, and most of the styles are over the top at least for me. I&#x27;ll stick with kiss brand. So far they are the best balance between price and comfort...</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo23LAOAK6CRPHP]]I made prerecorded video of false eyelashes before doing this review so you&#x27;ll can see what came in box that&#x27;s start by saying these lashes are attractive  , now to get to the results of use age ok it wasn&#x27;t me but I gave as gift this box of 70 pairs false eyelashes to my other sister . I have two total the other one I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gave a derma roller not that long ago so my younger one who&#x27;s in her late 20s I gave this to her again  as a gift and she don&#x27;t know I decided to give a review on them . So her and 4 friends all tried these eye lashes out recently ~ I seen it first hand they were obviously pros or something they had&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;adhesive already on hand in my sister house bathroom so all 5 total including my sister put these on instead of usual lashes I caught them getting ready to go out and have a girls night out , say this is awkward but I asked sister and other 4 to tell me the results of wearing these .Now everyone to make it clear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they wore 5 different pairs of this 7 individual styles , I asked them the results of each pair they said no falling off and stuck on perfectly and they each followed the results on the box which I will include in review below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Measure the lashes against your eye . If false lashes are too wide, trim lashes one at a time from outer edge .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply a line of adhesive across the entire length of the lash strip and wait at least 30 seconds until adhesive becomes tacky .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply lash strip to the base of your natural lash , starting from the middle . make sure the false lashes are lined up in the center .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Working from the center outward to the outer  corners , lightly press the false lashes to match your natural line . You can apply mascara if desired .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now price wise I seen cheaper bulk pairs like these,  but I&#x27;am the funny type if something is too cheap I get worried about that it&#x27;s possibly their made cheap so when you&#x27;ll search for false lashes to wear remember that advice because of the 70 pairs and sister and friends perfect results ~ it&#x27;s great : ) for what  TAO industry is offering and for Adhesive purchase because it&#x27;s not included I would use  [[ASIN:B003TTB4SG Revlon Precision Lash Adhesive 0.17 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll can use these for photo taking , and regular every day use age from what ~ sister and her friends told me these lashes could last  for days so that&#x27;s good news to me and they all have different designs and Styles for your change up preferences and each pair lasts up too 2 Weeks  that&#x27;s saying  24 months 1/2 usage ~~ Courtesy of TAO industry .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 100% Customer Satisfaction and Lifetime Guarantee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Dimensions: 6 x 2 x 3 inches ; 3 ounces&lt;br /&gt;Shipping Weight: 3.2 ouncesr false lashes to wear remember that advice because of the 70 pairs and sister and friends perfect results ~ it&#x27;s great : ) for what  TAO industry is offering and for Adhesive purchase because it&#x27;s not included I would use  [[ASIN:B003TTB4SG Revlon Precision Lash Adhesive 0.17 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll can use these for photo taking , and regular every day use age from what ~ sister and her friends told me these lashes could last  for days so that&#x27;s good news to me and they all have different designs and Styles for your change up preferences and each pair lasts up too 2 Weeks  that&#x27;s saying  24 months 1/2 usage ~~ Courtesy of TAO industry .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 100% Customer Satisfaction and Lifetime Guarantee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Dimensions: 6 x 2 x 3 inches ; 3 ounces&lt;br /&gt;Shipping Weight: 3.2 ounces</li>
            <li> quick shipment. quality product.</li>
            <li> It works for my wife, this is her second time to purchased this product,  great buy and works and looks great on her eyes.</li>
            <li> These are ok as a back up but not really the quality I am used to. They are very thin and break easily as you peel them off the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that they don&#x27;t claim to be reusable like most I buy so for the price it doesn&#x27;t really matter if you break a few. Personally I won&#x27;t be buying them again but if money is tight then maybe I would.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them! Very neat, quick delivery! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great for my granddaughter.  She will love them I am sure.</li>
            <li> Decent enough product but I have my usual complaint that they just dont stay on and you look funny when they are fluttering off.</li>
            <li> Very good quality lashes if you&#x27;re a make up artist and need to use them for one time occasions!</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product one other time and liked most of the lashes. This time they were all different and I thought they would be the same. The shipper was great as far as the processing and speedy delivery. Even with fewer lashes that I liked, it&#x27;s still a good deal.  Next time I will check the item number because they are different.</li>
            <li> Love them. Totally worth the price. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes for every occasion!!! Great price and product. Highly recommend. Be sure to buy your own glue, however.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to remove from the packaging but I think the lashes are just right and not too over the top.</li>
            <li> i love the eyelashes but i wish they were all thick but different types</li>
            <li> With mostly good reviews I decided to see these for myself. These are nothing like what I expected. I knew they weren&#x27;t human hair. I&#x27;ve used others that are synthetic. I just didn&#x27;t expect these to one look so fake and two look like they were packed in someone&#x27;s home. The assortment is nice and the price is great. However the quality for me just doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;d rather pay a bit more for better quality. Especially when it comes to putting something on my eye lid.</li>
            <li> These lashes are great you got 7 different styles to choose from.  I love them.</li>
            <li> Love them! Very fast delivery! Will buy again:-)</li>
            <li> My favorite bundle from all the other ones. The.bundle lashes are not real hair lashes so they are a bit harder and thicker but these softer than others I have tried. Also comes with a tool for easier application.&lt;br /&gt;  Seller delivers quickly and on time. This is definitely my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Very nice having a big box of lashes!! Nice quality too!! If you wear fake lashes..this is a fabulous bargin!!! I recommend!!!</li>
            <li> What a deal. Lots of choices of lashes and will last for a long time there are so many. Easy to apply also.</li>
            <li> everything is great, very fast shipment. A+</li>
            <li> I am soooooooooo happy I ordered these lashes! They are so nice, super sturdy but not uncomfortable or stiff. Also love the different styles, I&#x27;m set for a while! Thank you thank you thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Lashes are nice but I never recieved the free applicator</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them. The quality is good and it comes with a tool to put them on (wished I would have read it more carefully since I ordered one without knowing it came with it) as soon as it arrived I tried them on. Good price for the many u get. Will order again but it will b awhile till I run out. I just need practice!</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are great!! I love every style and the quality. You can actual use each pair a couple times. Absolutely recommend them. Don&#x27;t think about it twice order them. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are really good. I am still new at using and applying them but once on, they do look natural. My fav are the criss cross style. My only complaint, , well really just suggestion, is that you must buy  all of the diffetent styles. I have a favorite and would like to get all of only that style HOWEVER, if you are good at applying and adventurous,  you will like the more dramatic styles. I will keep practicing and may be more comfortable with the dramatic lashes.  Ultimately,  I feel its a great deal and would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Such a great variety of lashes, and a great price.</li>
            <li> Finding the best false eyelashes is a challenge. I&#x27;m so happy I found these eyelashes listing from Amazon! When I apply makeup, I notice that applying a thick false eyelashes makes your eyes pop and start looking more gorgeous and awake! After all, it is your lashes contribute a great deal to drawing attention to your eyes. These tantalizing fake/false eyelashes makes your eyes look bigger, bright, and attractive. The eyes are a big part of the impression you make on others and these eyelashes is a great tool to enhance your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature about these fake eyelashes is the different styles and extra pairs available. These fakes eyelashes have 7 different styles with 10 pairs each. This gives me many style options and depends on my mood of the day and evening. It is a high quality and affordable price and can be used many times for parties, special events, and just simply for daily use.</li>
            <li> Thay are too long and too difficult to apply, tried many times, tried trimming them also and finally gave up. Not a big deal as they were pretty inexpensive,</li>
            <li> Ordered these 2 days ago!! So happy with how quickly these came and they&#x27;re just like you&#x27;d find in the store!! I will buy from these guys again! I&#x27;m so in love!! Just wish I could buy all the same type in bulk! I&#x27;d love it they were all winged! ;P haha can&#x27;t have everything though, right? Thank you!! I love them!</li>
            <li> The saying is true: you get what you pay for. I gave one star for the nice assortment and another star for the quick delivery, otherwise these lashes feel very stiff and do not resemble human hair. I should&#x27;ve known better than to think I would be impressed with the quality. Definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love them I cut 1 pair in half to glue to another pair for a new look!</li>
            <li> My first set of false eyelashes, I think they&#x27;re pretty good quality and you get a decent amount for the price. I used georgies vegan adhesive and they stayed on well, also look natural. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product!  They&#x27;re reusable.. And arrived 2 days early</li>
            <li> They are lovely and light. The only issue is me trying to learn how to apply them. Other than that no broken single lashes and the shipping was great too.</li>
            <li> Just opened them, A nice variety of eyelashes. For the price is really not bad. You could use them just a couple days and toss them. Re using them is not that sanitary anyways . I would recommend by a DUO glue</li>
            <li> Great value for the money.  Just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Loved the packaging super cute. Loved all the different styles but the fact that the band hangs a little past the lashes bugs me. It&#x27;s no big deal to cut them but it would be useful if it didn&#x27;t have that little situation. But in all I love this Lash set and you can&#x27;t beat the great price! I would definitely recommend.</li>
