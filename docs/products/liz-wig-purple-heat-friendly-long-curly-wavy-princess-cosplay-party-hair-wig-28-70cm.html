            <li>Got so many compliments on it!</li>
            <li>Amazing, I got this a while ago but didn&#x27;t get around to reviewing it yet.</li>
            <li>I feel like the curl will relax into nice waves once it is out of the bag a bit.  </li>
            <li>It looks exactly as it does in the picture and falls beautifully.</li>
            <li>It barely shed, and styled perfectly.</li>
            <li>All in all the fit is good and it is very full.  </li>
            <li>This wig is a fantastic value!</li>
            <li>Okay .. Hair falls a lot</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a wig cap but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>It took me some playing around with the bangs to be able to get it out of my eyes</li>
            <li>Im glad I have glasses it helps.</li>
            <li>I think it looks decently cute.</li>
            <li>Although its much more shiny than the picture shows.</li>
            <li>I wanted my Lumpy Space Princess (Adventure Time) costume to be riveting for Halloween!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Love this wig, not too heavy beautiful color, and good quality.</li>
            <li>and I can easily get it all up into this wig without it killing my head.  </li>
            <li>wonderful!,product came on time, and fits like a dream, easy to style</li>
            <li>(more of a wave than the straight strands), it has a nice shine to it and is easily to comb, and more importantly doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>Color is beautiful, hair is long and sexy.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to stye it into a full ponytail.</li>
            <li>It came wavier than in the picture, which is just fine since the character the wig is for has curled hair.  </li>
            <li>Super cute wig...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>the color is rich and the wig has a sheen but is not too shiny.</li>
            <li>the synthetic fibers don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;d handle it despite the description saying it is heat friendly.</li>
            <li>Not thin, easily brushable in between wears, and SO flattering!</li>
            <li>I received this (very quick shipping by the way!) and tried it right on out of the box, and it surprised me by being so fabulous and miraculous!</li>
            <li>Its quite full</li>
            <li>, I thought it would be an okay wig, but it&#x27;s really something else.</li>
            <li>I love the color (very Leela if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for)</li>
            <li>so all in all it took a week or so to get here not bad since it is coming from China.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous wig, very soft and not too much shine.  </li>
            <li>And I ended up keeping the bangs in a bobby pin anyway because they were still super</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a cosplay and the wig has worked out great - not too much shedding and while it&#x27;s a little more curly than shown here</li>
            <li>Wore this for halloween, but will wear it just for fun now.  </li>
            <li>It is shiny but not in your face looks like I have a real healthy head of hair on my head if I want to tone it down</li>
            <li>I bought this wig along with several others at a similar price point, and this one is amazing!</li>
            <li>Looks a exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I definitely think it will last through many more wears.</li>
            <li>but It&#x27;s better than being too short.</li>
            <li>Everyone thought I dyed my hair purple because it looks so real!</li>
            <li>The fibers are really soft and full, making it look very anime-like.</li>
            <li>My head was kinda big for it, but I attached it to my wig cap with a clip and all was fine afterwards.</li>
            <li>The hair doesnt look real, but  I wasnt going for that anyway.  </li>
            <li>I bought this wig expecting it to be basically straight, but it&#x27;s a very wavy wig.</li>
            <li>I love how long and soft the hair is.</li>
            <li>After an initial gentle brushing, wig fibers rarely come out.</li>
            <li>:B00BJLR8ZE Purple Heat Friendly Long Curly Wavy Princess Cosplay Party Hair Wig 28&#x27;&#x27; 70cm</li>
            <li>There is a little more curl to it</li>
            <li>and I trimmed the bangs (they were super long)</li>
            <li>Not the most amazing wig but for the price it isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li>Bangs is cut very natural, wig doesnt shed almost at all</li>
            <li>It is very soft and you can style it however</li>
            <li>It is full and thick, very true to the picture, and the cap is large enough to cover my big head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty look, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li>that is to be expected with this much \\&quot;hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>just a slight wave really.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- a little shiny but not too much of a problem</li>
            <li>Inexpensive costume wigs are usually SO shoddy - the hair is thin, tangles easily, doesn&#x27;t sit on the head right and is thus unflattering, etc.</li>

            <li> The bangs are a bit long which will probably bug me enough that I trim them.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> The bangs are really long, but I got a friend to trim them.  </li>
            <li> The bangs are rather long, but they can be trimmed.</li>
            <li> the only thing i have to say bad about this wig is that in flash pictures it looks really fake because of the shininess, but in normal light it actually looks very real.</li>
            <li> hardly sheds, though the bangs are thick, its fine c:</li>
            <li> so I may end of sending this back as the color was not exactly what I was looking for</li>

            <li> the bangs are alot longer then a expected</li>
            <li> I have a few longer wigs that are sparse in the back</li>
            <li> The bangs are a lot longer than expected</li>
            <li> The bangs are a bit long, but there&#x27;s nothing like a little trim won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I think there are probably tons of other purple-haired characters waiting to be channeled through this wig.</li>
            <li> only problem is that it&#x27;s a very heavy wig.</li>
            <li> This wig was a shot in the dark for me.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying this in other colors!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my fault for assuming as the description does say dark purple and nothing about black.  </li>
            <li> I assumed based on the pictures this had a bit of black in it</li>
            <li> It does shed a little but</li>
            <li> The wig has little tine baby \\&quot; hairs\\&quot; where the part is.</li>
            <li> Had to make the bangs shorter with my layering scissors and it&#x27;s a little too shiny</li>
            <li> The bangs are a tad awkward looking, really.</li>
            <li> It does shed a little bit, but it really isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> hardly any shedding&lt;br</li>
            <li> Weirdly, friends were even asking me when I dyed my hair!</li>
            <li> , I just have had really bad luck.</li>

            <li> This wig is a fantastic value! I bought this wig along with several others at a similar price point, and this one is amazing! It is full and thick, very true to the picture, and the cap is large enough to cover my big head. It does shed a little bit, but it really isn&#x27;t that bad. I would totally buy this again!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very nice. you can&#x27;t see the netting at all</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for my Rarity cosplay and I absolutely love it! It came wavier than in the picture, which is just fine since the character the wig is for has curled hair.  The fibers are really soft and full, making it look very anime-like. The bangs are a bit long, but there&#x27;s nothing like a little trim won&#x27;t fix. This is one of the best cosplay wigs I own, and I might even wear it out when not cosplaying.</li>
            <li> the only thing i have to say bad about this wig is that in flash pictures it looks really fake because of the shininess, but in normal light it actually looks very real.</li>
            <li> Okay .. Hair falls a lot but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look how I imagined it would for the price. I actually fancy a $7 wig over this. The bangs are a tad awkward looking, really.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a wig cap but that&#x27;s okay I already had one... I love how long and soft the hair is. It does shed a little but that is to be expected with this much \\&quot;hair\\&quot;. It is shiny but not in your face looks like I have a real healthy head of hair on my head if I want to tone it down I will use baby powder and let you all know how that turns out. It took me some playing around with the bangs to be able to get it out of my eyes Im glad I have glasses it helps. The wig has little tine baby \\&quot; hairs\\&quot; where the part is. I posted some pics Oh yeah I ordered this on the 5th of November it took 4 days to get to San Fran. then two to get to abq NM only cause of the holiday on Monday. It is Tuesday the 12th. so all in all it took a week or so to get here not bad since it is coming from China. .[[ASIN:B00BJLR8ZE Purple Heat Friendly Long Curly Wavy Princess Cosplay Party Hair Wig 28&#x27;&#x27; 70cm + US Shipping 3 Days]]</li>
            <li> Very nice wig! Not too curly at all. Looks a exactly like the picture. I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of this wig for the price.</li>
            <li> The hair doesnt look real, but  I wasnt going for that anyway.  I have long hair and I can easily get it all up into this wig without it killing my head.  Feel great on.  The bangs are a bit long which will probably bug me enough that I trim them.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Not the most amazing wig but for the price it isn&#x27;t bad at all. I think it looks decently cute.</li>
            <li> -Very good quality&lt;br /&gt;- hardly any shedding&lt;br /&gt;- curls hold&lt;br /&gt;- a little shiny but not too much of a problem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for a costume. Its great. Its quite full and I was able to stye it into a full ponytail. the color is rich and the wig has a sheen but is not too shiny. (used for a Leela{futurama} costume)</li>
            <li> This is a very nice wig. For the price I bought it at, I thought it would be an okay wig, but it&#x27;s really something else.My head was kinda big for it, but I attached it to my wig cap with a clip and all was fine afterwards.</li>
            <li> Beautiful purple color, nice texture to the wig.</li>
            <li> I love the color (very Leela if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for) I managed to get it into a low ponytail and I trimmed the bangs (they were super long) And I ended up keeping the bangs in a bobby pin anyway because they were still super long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that it&#x27;s a very heavy wig. It kept falling back no matter what I did. I ended up using double sided tape on my forehead, which tore out a chunk of my hair when removed. But it looked great!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous wig, very soft and not too much shine.  There is a little more curl to it then the picture shows but not much, just a slight wave really.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a cosplay and the wig has worked out great - not too much shedding and while it&#x27;s a little more curly than shown here (more of a wave than the straight strands), it has a nice shine to it and is easily to comb, and more importantly doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> Not the color I was hoping for; a lot lighter than the picture</li>
            <li> Super cute wig... the color is a lot shinier but its not to bat... the bangs are alot longer then a expected but otherwise it was a nice wig!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig expecting it to be basically straight, but it&#x27;s a very wavy wig. It&#x27;s a very pretty look, but not what I expected. It is also a different shade of purple than what is shown.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as it does in the picture and falls beautifully. I&#x27;m going to love wearing this wig!!</li>
            <li> I assumed based on the pictures this had a bit of black in it but it doesn&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s my fault for assuming as the description does say dark purple and nothing about black.  I should have known to account for monitor differences.  Likewise I thought the style would be a bit straighter, mine has quite a bit of curl.  I feel like the curl will relax into nice waves once it is out of the bag a bit.  All in all the fit is good and it is very full.  I have a few longer wigs that are sparse in the back and this one is not.  I have a wig very similar so I may end of sending this back as the color was not exactly what I was looking for but I would definitely get this in another color since I&#x27;ve got something close to this shade already.  Haven&#x27;t tried any heat on it and probably won&#x27;t... the synthetic fibers don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;d handle it despite the description saying it is heat friendly.</li>
            <li> Color is beautiful, hair is long and sexy.  The bangs are really long, but I got a friend to trim them.  Wore this for halloween, but will wear it just for fun now.  Got so many compliments on it!</li>
            <li> Amazing, I got this a while ago but didn&#x27;t get around to reviewing it yet. It&#x27;s fantastic. hardly sheds, though the bangs are thick, its fine c: even wore this to school and it didn&#x27;t show the sightliest sign that it would fall apart. though, it is kinda big,but its adjustable ^u^</li>
            <li> Love this wig, not too heavy beautiful color, and good quality.</li>
            <li> I like it. Although its much more shiny than the picture shows. It is longer and fuller than the picture shows as well. The amount of hair on this wig and about 5 wavy layers makes this piece absolutely gorgeous. Bangs is cut very natural, wig doesnt shed almost at all and the cap is adjustable. Consider matting this wig when buying and you will be delighted with your purchase.</li>
            <li> Had to make the bangs shorter with my layering scissors and it&#x27;s a little too shiny but I love it and think it looks great</li>
            <li> This wig was a shot in the dark for me. I LOVE putting together costumes, but it can get expensive. Inexpensive costume wigs are usually SO shoddy - the hair is thin, tangles easily, doesn&#x27;t sit on the head right and is thus unflattering, etc., I just have had really bad luck. I went for this because it looked great in the seller image and had good reviews. I figured if it ended up being a bust I would then splurge for a &amp;#34;nicer&amp;#34; (more expensive) wig - I wanted my Lumpy Space Princess (Adventure Time) costume to be riveting for Halloween!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I received this (very quick shipping by the way!) and tried it right on out of the box, and it surprised me by being so fabulous and miraculous! Not thin, easily brushable in between wears, and SO flattering! Weirdly, friends were even asking me when I dyed my hair! It was even moderately styleable as I put it into a pony tail for a lower-maintenance Leela (Futurama) costume for a last costume party hurrah. I think there are probably tons of other purple-haired characters waiting to be channeled through this wig. I definitely think it will last through many more wears. Love. It.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is excellent. After an initial gentle brushing, wig fibers rarely come out. It fits well. The bangs are rather long, but they can be trimmed. It&#x27;s a bit shiny, and lighter than pictured, but I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> It was lovely!! It was the color that I was looking for and with the products that I used on it for a cosplay, I had no issues with this wig! I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying this in other colors!</li>
            <li> awesome wig, way better quality than I imagined. Very nice sewn in lace cap to help hold it in place.</li>
            <li> wonderful!,product came on time, and fits like a dream, easy to style</li>
            <li> Perfect! I got this for a cosplay of yurripe from angel beats. It barely shed, and styled perfectly.</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing! It is very soft and you can style it however you like and it doesn&#x27;t shed. The bangs are a lot longer than expected but It&#x27;s better than being too short. You can cut them shorter Lol. I got this wig for a Minene Uryuu Cosplay and with some styling this wig was absolutely perfect! Everyone thought I dyed my hair purple because it looks so real!</li>
            <li> not like the picture but still good</li>
