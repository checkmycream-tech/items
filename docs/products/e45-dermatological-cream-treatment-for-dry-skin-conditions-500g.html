            <li>Love love love it</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s fragrance-free.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for making your products available to the US!</li>
            <li>cream is pretty much liquid paraffin, which is wax, and while it is soothing and excellent and fragrance-free, you can tell it has a very light, waxy feel to it.</li>
            <li>Our bathroom counters are filled with many products and prescriptions, recommended by doctors, but the E45 line gave better results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Cream is Excellent for Very Dry Skin.</li>
            <li>Five full stars!</li>
            <li>DirectKart makes it easy to obtain this from the UK without always having to ask relatives to send care packages.  </li>
            <li>Some people have had good luck with this, however, it didn&#x27;t resolve our particular condition.</li>
            <li>Hands down best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful and very good cream for rush and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this lotion totally resolved that problem (the hydrocolloid band-aids cut in half lengthwise work great over fingertip cracks), but it IS the best lotion I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s NOT greasy, just lightly waxy.</li>
            <li>petroleum jelly to forcibly hold moisture in my facial problem areas, which are the corners of my mouth, my chin, cheek areas and around the folds of my nose, which worked great, but very shiny and greasy too, which often caused pore-clogging as a side effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product and highly recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s a huge success for us.</li>
            <li>Then I read somewhere about E45 and following the good reviews here</li>
            <li>product is made of Paraffin oil which has been in use for many years and is really works.</li>
            <li>It is odorless and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping!!  </li>
            <li>So far it feels good on the skin and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I had ordered two pumps in March and they were sent to me right away, I can tell because I saw the date stamped on the package.</li>
            <li>It is such a great cream, it has helped my entire body with the drying effects of winter heating!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested how this does during the winter as I wash my hands a lot and often get splits in my fingers.</li>
            <li>There is literally one spot left that needs a bit more cream applied to it to recover 100%.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have tried soooo many different creams from the store and this cream just as every ones review says really works.</li>
            <li>Love this cream&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders on dry and cracked heels&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I always ise this for and on dry skin, its magic.</li>
            <li>Convenient pump  Large size lotion (lasted me a year)  </li>
            <li>bottle is huge, it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend it everyone.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Nothing else worked very well.</li>
            <li>Very carefull package.</li>
            <li>It is very usefull to my skin.</li>
            <li>E45 is very helpfull .</li>
            <li>that is how fast and efficient they are.&lt;br</li>
            <li>itchy skin from too much sun&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly !</li>
            <li>and we are very generous with it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for babies, The British still make quality products</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m older and still have dry skin and have many health issues from thyroid to medication side affects.  </li>
            <li>First let me start by saying I do not usually leave feedback , just buy and go my way.</li>
            <li>This came quickly considering it was internationally shipped.</li>
            <li>The front of the bottle says, \\&quot; White Soft Paraffin\\&quot;, \\&quot;Light Liquid Paraffin\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Anhydrous Lanolin (Medilan)\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>, I ordered this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a little more than a week</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s right now only using the E45</li>
            <li>Now residing in the States and I cannot live without my E45 range.  </li>
            <li>Everyone is busy these days and buying it from Amazon makes it so that you don&#x27;t have to feel like a pest asking for family to send it to you.</li>
            <li>This so far seems to be working.</li>
            <li>and I have decided that I will only use E 45 cream for my whole body (face too).</li>
            <li>and my skin is almost completely recovered.</li>
            <li>I use E-45 on my whole body and as a facial moisturizer morning and night.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I add a bit of pure vegetable glycerin to it as I have very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It does leave my hands a little greasy right after putting it on so don&#x27;t put it on and try to write with a pen.  </li>
            <li>Also on the bottle&#x27;s label: \\&quot;also for more serious dry skin conditions such as eczema, dermatitis, ichthyosis and certain dry cases of psoriasis\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also adding another star because even though this cream isn&#x27;t very emollient, its working really well for my daughter who doesn&#x27;t like thick creams</li>
            <li>The thin lotion may be good for those who don&#x27;t like a thicker feeling, but for me its just not strong enough.    </li>
            <li>She has very dry and sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> She has very dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin.you cant buy it in the stores here :(</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a small tube of this to try and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this cream after reading the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I would use the lotion occasionally for living in dry climates here in the US and because I have always had dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have probably tried every heavy-duty lotion there is, from really expensive stuff to cheap Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> Also like the Wash, it is a UK-made product and not available here, as far as I have</li>
            <li> I tried different OTC products I got at CVS and other places</li>
            <li> Like the Emollient Wash, the E45 cream has rave reviews for those suffering from severe dry skin and Eczema.</li>
            <li> My hands crack from the dry weather every winter.  </li>
            <li> We have a 1.5 year old who suffers from pretty gnarly eczema since he was born</li>
            <li> E45 cream is recommended for \\&quot;soothing, dry, itching, flaking, chapped, rough and calloused skin, sunburn and detergent hands\\&quot;, according to the wording on the bottle.</li>
            <li> In my case it relieves itching due to stress and minor skin irritation.</li>
            <li> We received the E45 bottle last week (along with a few other &amp;#34;international&amp;#34; creams we will be trying over the next few months) and so far his skin has begun to heal up (no more scales and less red) and he hasn&#x27;t itched in a week!</li>
            <li> My hands still feel dry after using it, and it didn&#x27;t heal my flaky skin as well as some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve found (like Eucerin, glysomed and Amlactin).</li>
            <li> Cons:  Not very emollient or healing    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery time took longer then expected; so if you have a family member receiving radiation and/or chemo, order the E45 line at or before treatment begins.</li>
            <li> I have recommended James Graham Brown Cancer Center to look into E45 as an additional product to offer to their patients.</li>
            <li> My friend from Scotland had had surgery and told me she was advised to put this on her scar once it had closed to help prevent scarring and thickening.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have super dry skin that itches us like crazy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount</li>
            <li> However, it seems to be like any other lotion.</li>
            <li> Healing skin and less itch</li>
            <li> It is a very average cream for my skin.</li>
            <li> Poor little guy would scratch so much, especially at night that he&#x27;d bleed all over his crib.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I wear it under my makeup primer everyday.</li>
            <li> I had dry broken skin in my feet for a while.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when we moved back to the States from England, we could not find it.  </li>
            <li> Not as heavy as some lotions for people who don&#x27;t like thick creams    </li>
            <li> My diabetic husband has an angry red rash all over both calves.  </li>
            <li> but it was too late...</li>
            <li> I use this cream after I towel dry before I dress to prevent abrasions from scratching terrible itchy skin especially in the desert with forced air heat.  </li>
            <li> I hate having to order this from the UK</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Now residing in the States and I cannot live without my E45 range.  Great product and highly recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping!!  Product was well packaged too.  This is my 2nd time using the product and seems to work to keep my skin moisturized.  A little goes a long way... I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest, I&#x27;ve used E45 since it&#x27;s introduction, back then I like it as a guy for it not having a scent and working so well.  I would use the lotion occasionally for living in dry climates here in the US and because I have always had dry skin.  Now I&#x27;m older and still have dry skin and have many health issues from thyroid to medication side affects.  I use this cream after I towel dry before I dress to prevent abrasions from scratching terrible itchy skin especially in the desert with forced air heat.  The pump makes it easier to apply instead of glopping into a jar which works but is a bit messier to deal with.  DirectKart makes it easy to obtain this from the UK without always having to ask relatives to send care packages.  Everyone is busy these days and buying it from Amazon makes it so that you don&#x27;t have to feel like a pest asking for family to send it to you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful and very good cream for rush and dry skin. I would really recommend it everyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so awesome. I ended up buying it after reading reviews. My husband and I both have super dry skin that itches us like crazy. This came quickly considering it was internationally shipped. My husband loves it and I haven&#x27;t found a lotion that even comes close to how good this stuff is.</li>
            <li> This cream has been used by my wife for years.  She has very dry and sensitive skin.  E45 works excellently forr her and does not cause any problems. Unfortunately, when we moved back to the States from England, we could not find it.  Then through Amazon, we were able to find a vendor in England who would ship to the States.  Product actually arrived in about a week - well ahead on estimated delivery date.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this cream after reading the good reviews. It is a very average cream for my skin. My hands still feel dry after using it, and it didn&#x27;t heal my flaky skin as well as some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve found (like Eucerin, glysomed and Amlactin). The thin lotion may be good for those who don&#x27;t like a thicker feeling, but for me its just not strong enough.    Pros:  Convenient pump  Large size lotion (lasted me a year)  Not as heavy as some lotions for people who don&#x27;t like thick creams    Cons:  Not very emollient or healing    Update 2/1/15:  This lotion has lasted for a year so on that basis alone I am adding a star. I&#x27;m also adding another star because even though this cream isn&#x27;t very emollient, its working really well for my daughter who doesn&#x27;t like thick creams so I think there is a definite market for it.</li>
            <li> This Cream is Excellent for Very Dry Skin. Delivery was prompt. It is a UK product that should also be made in the USA</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. Her hands crack and bleed. We have tried numerous lotions and prescriptions. This so far seems to be working. Nothing else worked very well. This cream is amazing, After one use we saw and she felt improvement.</li>
            <li> I got it in a very short shipping time. Very carefull package. It is very usefull to my skin. I am taking cancer chemotherapy that cause hand foot syndrome. E45 is very helpfull .</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many different creams from the store and this cream just as every ones review says really works. It stopped my iching and helped a lot with the redness of my skin.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a small tube of this to try and it worked very well.  You only need a small amount otherwise you are rubbing for several minutes.  It does leave my hands a little greasy right after putting it on so don&#x27;t put it on and try to write with a pen.  I&#x27;m interested how this does during the winter as I wash my hands a lot and often get splits in my fingers.</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I do not usually leave feedback , just buy and go my way. I had ordered two pumps in March and they were sent to me right away, I can tell because I saw the date stamped on the package. Now this is from Europe, so after they do their part, USPS here has to their part..in my case there was a week delay, so thinking that I may not receive my products, I requested a refund. Well, British Goodies answered the same day with an apology and refunded the money ASAP!!! Guess what I got the creams 48h later..I contacted them so they could cancel the refund but it was too late...yeah that is how fast and efficient they are.&lt;br /&gt;They offered me to keep the creams and welcome me at anytime as their customer, with, mind you, another apology for a delay that was NOT their fault.&lt;br /&gt;If you have to buy this soothing, wonderful, cream that does wonders for your skin: THIS IS THE PLACE TO DO SO! i&#x27;ll be reordering very shortly! Five full stars! Way to go!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;m ordering this and I have decided that I will only use E 45 cream for my whole body (face too). It gives my skin a healthy glow and it keeps it moisturized all day. Sometimes I add a bit of pure vegetable glycerin to it as I have very dry and sensitive skin. It also gives me an even skin tone. Love it!</li>
            <li> Not greasy,  no offensive scent.  Moisturizing.  Works well my daughters eczema.</li>
            <li> Love this cream&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders on dry and cracked heels&lt;br /&gt;Also itchy skin from too much sun&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly !</li>
            <li> We have a 1.5 year old who suffers from pretty gnarly eczema since he was born and we&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun. Poor little guy would scratch so much, especially at night that he&#x27;d bleed all over his crib. We took to outfitting him in larger-sized pjs and sewing his sleeves shut so he wouldn&#x27;t itch at night. We received the E45 bottle last week (along with a few other &amp;#34;international&amp;#34; creams we will be trying over the next few months) and so far his skin has begun to heal up (no more scales and less red) and he hasn&#x27;t itched in a week! He&#x27;s right now only using the E45 and we are very generous with it. Healing skin and less itch, that&#x27;s a huge success for us.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Keeps the skin perfect during both summer and winter. I won&#x27;t use anything else. Love love love it</li>
            <li> You cannot get this here in the USA, as a user from the UK  when I lived there I always ise this for and on dry skin, its magic. I use it daily and it seems to do the trick</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> I had dry broken skin in my feet for a while. I tried different OTC products I got at CVS and other places but neither did anything except of applying good smell. Then I read somewhere about E45 and following the good reviews here, I ordered this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a little more than a week and my skin is almost completely recovered. There is literally one spot left that needs a bit more cream applied to it to recover 100%.&lt;br /&gt;This product is made of Paraffin oil which has been in use for many years and is really works. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> An excellent skin care product in a useful container/dispenser.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for babies, The British still make quality products</li>
            <li> My companion has received radiation treatment and Erbitux (chemo) for a throat cancer. E45 assisted in soothing the burn of the radiation and moisturizing his skin from the drying effect of the chemo. Our bathroom counters are filled with many products and prescriptions, recommended by doctors, but the E45 line gave better results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery time took longer then expected; so if you have a family member receiving radiation and/or chemo, order the E45 line at or before treatment begins. I have recommended James Graham Brown Cancer Center to look into E45 as an additional product to offer to their patients.</li>
            <li> Hands down best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. I have tried Neutrogena, Cetaphil, etc. They worked great for me as well, but none like this. I use E-45 on my whole body and as a facial moisturizer morning and night. The consistency is that of a body cream, something like Bodycology lotions and Bath &amp; Body Works body creams. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or feel heavy. I wear it under my makeup primer everyday. And it has drastically improved my eczema.LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful and smooth. In my case it relieves itching due to stress and minor skin irritation. It is odorless and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend to help nourish the skin. So far it feels good on the skin and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of lotion for your money. However, it seems to be like any other lotion. Some people have had good luck with this, however, it didn&#x27;t resolve our particular condition. No fault of the mfg though.</li>
            <li> I hate having to order this from the UK then I have to  drive the USA to pick it up.  Wish they sold it in Canada</li>
            <li> Like the Emollient Wash, the E45 cream has rave reviews for those suffering from severe dry skin and Eczema. Also like the Wash, it is a UK-made product and not available here, as far as I have searched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is pretty much liquid paraffin, which is wax, and while it is soothing and excellent and fragrance-free, you can tell it has a very light, waxy feel to it. It&#x27;s NOT greasy, just lightly waxy. It doesn&#x27;t make me shine, either. I think it&#x27;s absolutely brilliant, because it holds moisture in the skin really well. The front of the bottle says, \\&quot; White Soft Paraffin\\&quot;, \\&quot;Light Liquid Paraffin\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Anhydrous Lanolin (Medilan)\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I had to resort to Crisco (believe it or not) and petroleum jelly to forcibly hold moisture in my facial problem areas, which are the corners of my mouth, my chin, cheek areas and around the folds of my nose, which worked great, but very shiny and greasy too, which often caused pore-clogging as a side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The E45 cream is recommended for \\&quot;soothing, dry, itching, flaking, chapped, rough and calloused skin, sunburn and detergent hands\\&quot;, according to the wording on the bottle. Also on the bottle&#x27;s label: \\&quot;also for more serious dry skin conditions such as eczema, dermatitis, ichthyosis and certain dry cases of psoriasis\\&quot;. Can be used for everyone, including babies unless there&#x27;s an allergy to the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is huge, it will last quite a while. 500g equals 17.6 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this ships from the UK and will take a while (weeks) to arrive. Heads-up to you -to me, it was well-worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin.you cant buy it in the stores here :(</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent for eczema and psoriasis. With daily use it seems to prevent flare ups. It is unscented and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I always used this while in the UK, and it&#x27;s great that I can now continue to in the US.</li>
            <li> My friend from Scotland had had surgery and told me she was advised to put this on her scar once it had closed to help prevent scarring and thickening. I had just had surgery myself and decided to give it a try, instead of sticky Vitamin E oil.  It is such a great cream, it has helped my entire body with the drying effects of winter heating!</li>
            <li> My hands crack from the dry weather every winter.  I can&#x27;t say this lotion totally resolved that problem (the hydrocolloid band-aids cut in half lengthwise work great over fingertip cracks), but it IS the best lotion I&#x27;ve found and I have probably tried every heavy-duty lotion there is, from really expensive stuff to cheap Vaseline.  I also love that it&#x27;s fragrance-free.  My husband is from the UK and we got some of this when we were over there at his recommendation -- have been ordering it online in between visits ever since.</li>
            <li> A superb cream for damaged skin or to maintain skin soft.  I have been using it for 6 years un a MD&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li> My diabetic husband has an angry red rash all over both calves.  E45 cream is the only product to ever give him some relief, and it was almost instantly.  It is awesome!  Thank you for making your products available to the US!</li>
