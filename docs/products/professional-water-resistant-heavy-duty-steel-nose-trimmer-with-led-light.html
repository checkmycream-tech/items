            <li>this was sent as a gift, the person who received it loved every thing about it!&lt;br /&gt;think</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if you or a loved one owns a nose trimmer...</li>
            <li>The shape is good for standing up on counter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why the reviews are so good for this trimmer.</li>
            <li>This product was a good choice.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m hoping this indicates it&#x27;s well made and of good materials.</li>
            <li>it works good and doesn&#x27;t pinch</li>
            <li>95% of all the nose trimmers cost around $9.99 and you think that you are getting a good deal but believe me they will break on you and won&#x27;t do the job like this one.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>

            <li>It also worked nicely as a nose- and ear-hair trimmer, for the guys.</li>
            <li>like nice guys, but they should find another company to build these for them.</li>

            <li>Great price and shipped quickly .thank</li>
            <li>He offered to replace the item at no cost to me, but as a prime customer the shipping was \\&quot;free\\&quot; and Amazon is great about issuing credit quickly.</li>

            <li>It does a good job and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is the best most reasonably priced that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect trimmer for trimming nose hairs and ear hairs (the guys seem to really like it), as well as trimming an unsightly chin hair (or more, if you have them).</li>
            <li>The product itself is very impressive, as others have stated it feels like a quality product in your hand and it trims quickly and cleanly without pulling or yanking any hairs.</li>
            <li>This one is so easy to use, does not tweak or pull very gentle on the nose and does a wonderful job.  </li>
            <li>After receipt and installing a battery, (which was very easy, I might add)</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Cuts close too and very easy to use</li>
            <li>He said it is very easy to use and gets everything all cleaned up the way it should be.</li>
            <li>the trimmer is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is the best trimmer so far!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
            <li>I have been buying &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; trimmers for years and this one is by far the best quality.</li>
            <li>It is good quality, NOT made of cheap plastic material.  </li>
            <li>I have owned a lot of nose hair trimmers in my day, and this one has worked the best thus far.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best trimmer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I asked my husband how he liked it, he said it was ok.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very happy with this product...</li>
            <li>This was for my 89 year old dad and it works great!</li>
            <li>Honestly wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect, purchased this for my husband.</li>
            <li>By far the best nose hair trimmer I have owned.</li>
            <li>I also own a Panasonic trimmer and this one worked as well or better.</li>
            <li>This one is the best by far for the money.</li>
            <li>So far, my husband has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best trimmer I have used!</li>
            <li>LED light is good idea but could be a bit brighter</li>
            <li>Good nose trimmer, sturdy metal chassis, gets the job done and even has a light to see your work.</li>
            <li>I have used almost every brand nose hair trimmer and so far, this is the best.  </li>
            <li>looks that the construction is suitable.</li>
            <li>This one appears more sturdy and has performed nicely for 60 days or so.  </li>

            <li>Best of the three that I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>the build quality seemed good - it was heavier than cheap trimmers.</li>
            <li>In a word &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34;. It is vey under powered and the light might as well not be there at all for all the good it does.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best trimmer he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li>Great product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I then banged on the battery case with the palm of my hand and some kind of magic then happened</li>
            <li>Best  to just skip over this one until someone from the company post a note saying that they have it fixed.</li>
            <li>before I&#x27;m looking good and nose hair free.</li>
            <li>It works great and is worth the money.if I ever need to get another one I will buy it again</li>
            <li>I cannot say anything about longevity, but so far the item works great!</li>

            <li>Used it right away with great results.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it a great review because right out of the box the on-off switch did not work.</li>
            <li>works-- and so easily!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the performance of the Nose Trimmer; it is easy to use and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I strongly recommend!</li>

            <li>Its best to clean just inside your nose first to make sure it gets the hairs and not...</li>

            <li>The light does not add much to the trimmer but it would make an excellent product even better if the trimmer could incorporate the self-cleaning capability (\\&quot;Vortex Cleaning System\\&quot;) found in the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>A great company and this trimmer is  working exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>It feels solid in your hand, the light is bright, and the cut is superb.</li>

            <li>Works great and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I messed up.  </li>

            <li>Runs nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it as it saves on embarrassing hair in the nose area at my husbands and my age.</li>
            <li>Most of it is plastic.  </li>
            <li>Seems to cut hair OK</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li>The build quality is outstanding and it comes with a lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li>I love this eye brow trimer, it really does a great job.</li>

            <li>I really liked the LED light on the end of the trimmer.</li>

            <li>Looking forward to trying out more products from ToiletTree.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great product</li>
            <li>I love this nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li>They also followed up to make sure things were working well, so</li>
            <li>Because this unit is priced competitively, I believe it is now the best value on the market in a personal hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>and I was glad I did.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be using the warranty for sure.</li>
            <li>Worked MUCH better than others I have had.</li>
            <li>Cover top does not stay on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how one would use a light on a trimmer to see in their own ear or nose anyway.</li>
            <li>It works excellently; the problem seems to be getting all the defective stock back from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also like that it takes AA batteries instead of those rechargeable ones like in most electric razors</li>
            <li>and I can assure that I quite like, ears and nose, have a better cosmetic appearance.</li>
            <li>It replaced one that I have had for many years</li>
            <li>Nice and compact, I like the light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am quite satisfied with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a top tier product.</li>
            <li>one feels like it is made of better material</li>
            <li>the power switch is more like a power recommendation than a switch.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Closeness of trim could be better, but being painless</li>
            <li>Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used and would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I have used many trimmers like this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cheaper trimmers before that mostly pulled the hairs out.</li>
            <li>Top notch.</li>
            <li>Best of over ten tried.</li>
            <li>Better than any I have owned before.</li>
            <li>It trims better than any I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I received your trimmer in the mail, installed the battery, turned it on and the top flew off and a blade ejected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this item and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the performance.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good device but nothing worth that price.</li>
            <li>A razor can take care of most of it.</li>
            <li>It works okay - it could be sharper</li>
            <li>It is better than what I had before.</li>
            <li>The construction is metal, much better than the ones</li>
            <li>satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>this is my personal best!</li>
            <li>The light is a nice touch</li>
            <li>The light is nice but it isn&#x27;t that helpful.  </li>
            <li>What more could one ask for in terms of customer support?  </li>
            <li>And it is more efficient using power.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for a great product.  </li>
            <li>Works great and fast shipping</li>
            <li>And it even has a light!  </li>
            <li>If you want a fantastic NOSE and inside EAR hair trimmer, get this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how much better it worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be better if it had a rechargeable battery, but I&#x27;ll put up with battery replacement because it works so well.</li>
            <li>I took the chance, and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>Outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li>This groomer does an outstanding of getting rid of unsightly hair.</li>
            <li>Have tried em all, repeatedly, all the top rated, etc.  </li>

            <li>This is an outstanding product that I recommend with no reservations.</li>
            <li>I would love to have this trimmer and would try another to see if it was just an anomaly</li>
            <li>i am so glad to have a nose/ear hair trimmer that works.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that the product was working.</li>
            <li>are outstanding.</li>
            <li>but it works way better and quieter than any I have had before.  </li>
            <li>Better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The device worked 100 time better than I would ever have imagined.  </li>
            <li>Am glad it has a lifetime replacement guarantee.</li>

            <li>A quality product and not a piece of plastic junk like most stuff nowadays.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a better trimmer than the plastic and under-powered one I had been using.  </li>
            <li>So glad it has a light-makes it a lot easier to see.</li>
            <li>I like that this trimmer uses a AA battery which I am sure</li>
            <li>Perhaps that is something that I am going to have to have some more practice with though.</li>
            <li>He claims that it does a better job too.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bit of an oily smell, but it seems to work OK.</li>
            <li>works great-am quite pleased</li>
            <li>It does okay.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The LED light is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>me tell you more about it....</li>

            <li>so far.update, after having used this trimmer 3 or 4 times now it has gotten to where it does not start when you turn on the switch, have to tap it on counter top a couple times and then it comes on.</li>
            <li>changed battery made no difference still had to tap on counter top.</li>
            <li>price was even better.</li>

            <li>I have purchased many of these over the years.  </li>

            <li>It does seem to get rid of the hair better and faster than others.  </li>
            <li>but I sure could not find it.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>Does the job but looking for a bit more power.</li>
            <li>Junk - like many others, the device doesn&#x27;t lock after putting the battery in.</li>
            <li>at 70 years of age, this is a needed grooming aid and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I decided, after reading the reviews, to try the ToiletTree Trimmer and have been extremely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I even found the LED light to be beneficial!  </li>
            <li>Love the unit, love the company.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product do the job well and with style, at an already impressive value, but the warranty pushes this over the top into a must have for your bathroom.</li>
            <li>Arrived safely.</li>
            <li>pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, my most troublesome spot is both sides of the septum (the column between your nostrils) and this trimmer cleaned it out like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of that, the Remmy stopped working within two years.</li>
            <li>Best personal trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for many months and this trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut my skin or pull hairs.</li>
            <li>and I intend to buy more as gifts for my siblings.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, I know, we have reached the age when there&#x27;s more hair growing in our noses and ears than on our heads.</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>I wish they would have used a bit more horsepower in the motor</li>
            <li>It is efficient, painless and safe; and can be used without fear of injury.  </li>
            <li>Works better than most.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both tried many times.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who wants a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this one.</li>
            <li>Love it&lt;</li>
            <li>He says it doesn&#x27;t pull hairs, or pinch, and its highly effective and comfortable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely satisfied</li>
            <li>Stylish and works well on nose and ears without discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Works great, does not pull and cuts fast.</li>
            <li>Much better than most of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Led light is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>Some have worked better than others.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>My nose hairs have never been more svelte.</li>
            <li>does better job then a pair of rounded tip scissors, I think.</li>
            <li>Hefty feel in your hand and the light is nice.</li>
            <li>It pops the top part up</li>
            <li>This is simply the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>I am buying more of them this week.</li>
            <li>Well, in theory I love it-</li>
            <li>We have gone through many nose trimmers over the years.  </li>
            <li>Thought we&#x27;d try one more.  </li>
            <li>but I just love this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Already can see it will be better than any trimmer I have had before.</li>
            <li>Excellent performance and build quality, much better than the plastic big name brand</li>
            <li>Nice unit, smooth running</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an even possible modification for this tool, but if there were a micro-comb attachment that could be used, to get rid of cheeky peach fuzz, this tool would be perfect!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s battery powered.</li>
            <li>The light is also a nice feature.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement and this is a much better product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>Many thanks for a great problem solver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>It has a nice grip to it.&lt;br /&gt;It runs smooth and cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really doing a great job on the hairs</li>
            <li>They really love it.</li>
            <li>Smooth operation and feels nice in hand.</li>
            <li>I can see many years use from it.</li>
            <li>Their customer service is as outstanding as Amazon&#x27;s</li>
            <li>however it works so much better than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>this just means I need to trim a bit more often.  </li>
            <li>Glad I decided on this one.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Light is a nice added features.</li>
            <li>The head looks almost identical to a Panasonic trimmer I bought many years ago.</li>
            <li>So I came here instead, and bought this, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s better all the others that my nose hairs wore out.</li>
            <li>He has not had the chance to use his yet, but I&#x27;m sure that this will do the trick.  </li>
            <li>works well  pleased with purchase</li>

            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of the light for my husband to see what he is doing.</li>

            <li>I would give it five stars if the power up was better.</li>
            <li>All that it was described and more.  </li>
            <li>By the way Amazon&#x27;s return policy is fantastic!</li>
            <li>And it helps you spot those errant, fugitive hairs that pop out at the most embarrassing moments.</li>

            <li>Bought in May, 2014 and was working fine until one of the blades came</li>
            <li>brother says works fine.</li>
            <li>This is a particularly fine item.  </li>
            <li>However, it did arrive on time and seems to be working fine out of the box.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer for my husband and although he&#x27;s only used it once he is very pleased with the nice job it does.  </li>

            <li>The product arrived quickly and it is much heavier in a good way.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything about the long term yet, but the first couple of times using this trimmer were surprisingly easy and painless, so it&#x27;s off to an excellent start.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels solid and did a good job trimming nose hairs, but the blades quickly became uncomfortably warm.  </li>
            <li>This little product is the best I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good trimmer and works as I would have expected</li>

            <li>the cover would not lock into place&lt;br /&gt;After repeated attempts to secure the cover I gave up</li>
            <li>Works great for the price, bought several for christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>This is the best nose trimmer I&#x27;ve bought yet, and I&#x27;ve bought quite a few.</li>

            <li>Easy to clean and store.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s even a light that allows you to see up your nose.</li>

            <li>Fast and effective.  </li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many &amp; non are as powerful as this one.</li>
            <li>I received the item and when I inserted the battery it would not turn on, nor would the LED light come one.  </li>

            <li>The light does not always shine where I need it, but perhaps that is my problem.</li>

            <li>/&gt;The light is a &amp;#34;nice to have&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li>I find the LED light helpful.  </li>
            <li>How are you supposed to use the light it has.</li>
            <li>I found the unit works well, is easy to clean, and is waterproof as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I will agree, this is comfortable to hold and is feels well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and the light is an advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jjriolo@aol.com</li>

            <li>Its well made and even has an LED to help light things up.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a light, whereas the Panasonic does not.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it twice but with great results.</li>
            <li>I bet that is probably is made with a cheap plastic body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>So he is use it in the shower and it is easy to clean and rinse off.  </li>

            <li>Have used it several times and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as enamored with the light as some because it don&#x27;t seem to be of any benefit but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>AND IS EASY TO CLEAN.</li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>Cheap design and build.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t understand the great reviews personally.  </li>
            <li>It is also relatively easy to keep clean by just rinsing the head with water while it is turned on.  </li>
            <li>so i searched for a cheap nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>i just dont understand why there is a light on it.</li>
            <li>light is a joke--need tolight a match to see if it is on--trimmer  part works.</li>
            <li>Surpasses the cheap ones by a mile.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the trimmer a great product, but this seller is committed to customer satisfaction and that&#x27;s a plus in my world.  </li>
            <li>Slelf operated smoothly.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>great product for a very specific need.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of trimming nose hairs, is easy to clean and, so far, continues to work.</li>
            <li>so I went online to see what was available.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise though, it works well and is quieter than some others, which is important when trimming so close to the ears.</li>
            <li>, I have some nose hair that grows to a point where it is within view if you are up real close and kind of looking for it.</li>
            <li>I am not looking for a baby&#x27;s butt smooth surface inside my nose, like some posters seem to be.</li>
            <li>But it helps to keep the nostril free of buggers.</li>
            <li>This is a great, quiet, quality piece of craftsmanship-ed piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>It has a light, and it cuts the hair in you</li>
            <li>Nice product, seems more durable than the last one I had which stopped working, also does not pull on hairs and cause pain, am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>The light would come on but no trimmer.  </li>
            <li>LED light is a bonus.</li>
            <li>I had a great Panasonic trimmer years ago that finally wore out; it never pulled a hair.</li>
            <li>Cheap construction.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t comfortable in that department.  </li>
            <li>Seems like a cheap piece of plastic to me.</li>
            <li>It trims my nose hairs without getting stuck and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>But perhaps best of all those few who have reported encountering any issues with the product have received immediate attention and resolution to their issue.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing in your hand, like a real man&#x27;s nose hair trimmer should.</li>
            <li>He loves it because of the led light and because it has steel blades.</li>
            <li>Overall though, it gets the job done and does a great job doing</li>
            <li>Nice product - thanks.</li>
            <li>Fantastic nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Precise.</li>

            <li>It feels cheap.</li>
            <li>Works fabulously.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a light that shines into my nose while i weedwhack those gnarly spider leg looking hairs.  </li>
            <li>Great design which will last me a life time.</li>
            <li>Awesome trimmer built with metal case and not cheap plastic - trims hair cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li>The LED light is helpful, as well.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable and working parts quite letting one hear the hairs being trimmed away.  </li>
            <li>Like the light.</li>
            <li>Fast service, nice product</li>
            <li>Works smooth without pulling the hair.  </li>
            <li>It was also easy to clean by running the tip under water.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It all seems very well-constructed, and I anticipate getting many more years of use out of this one.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Loved this product, my Dad was surprised to receive this Thank</li>
            <li>So far so good with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many, many nose hair trimmers of all prices and brands, and they either don&#x27;t work or don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The metal body adds some nice weight to it and the light makes things go much smoother.</li>
            <li>Not so good as the old one.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>works great,so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>My old Wahl nose hair trimmer was okay but not as nicely engineered as this one.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>AND SO FAR SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>Having used similar for many years I am delighted with the features of this clipper.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Good product, glad I purchased it, but only time will tell.</li>
            <li>So far so good, nothing fancy</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very well made, and not with cheap plastic or cheap metal parts like many others I have tried, fits real comfortable in my hand, very easy to use runs off one AA battery and runs well, does not grab and pull the nose or ear hair&#x27;s, the LED light is pretty cool, lights up the way nice and bright, the blade trimmer end of it can be rinsed under running water, which is a plus, all in all seriously well worth the money, this is backed by a lifetime warranty, and it is built like it will last a lifetime, a perfect gift for anyone</li>
            <li>I originally bought one of these for myself and really liked it, I have so far bought 3 more as gifts.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the price is right.  </li>
            <li>Great quality not all plastic like most of the other makers use.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SERVICE!&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to use Toilet Tree Products in the future!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!!!</li>
            <li>Very useful tool in trimming ear and nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, no hair pulls ...</li>
            <li>it was a pain free, quick and easy experience.</li>
            <li>They allow for a clean smooth cut.  </li>
            <li>Second purchased in three years and without question, this is most effective, easy to use, deforester of noise and ear hairs.</li>
            <li>The toilet tree nose trimmer works great.</li>
            <li>Great customer service from Toilet Tree Products as well.  </li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s so easy and quick.</li>
            <li>It was good at first and worked very well.</li>
            <li>However, first time I used this trimmer, I LOVE THE LIGHT.  </li>
            <li>Feels substantial, works quickly, and stores easily.  </li>
            <li>Cuts hair easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it it was so smooth that I was sure they didn&#x27;t put a blade it in and that it was not working, but it was.</li>
            <li>no pulling.. quick and easy and fits well in the hand.</li>
            <li>I especially like the light feature, the fact that it successfully removes both nose and ear hairs and can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>This one really does cut my nose hairs very easily.</li>
            <li>Major  bummer as I loved it when it worked UPDATE 5/4/15-I</li>
            <li>It trimmed the hairs quickly and was easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very good heavy duty and the on/off switch works fine.</li>
            <li>So, if you are one of those fortunate beings like me that are blessed with nose/ear hairs that would withstand the full forces of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, then this is the trimmer you have been looking for.</li>
            <li>He was excited that it works well and was inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do but remarkably better than trimmers</li>
            <li>I had a minor issue and the support was great.</li>
            <li>The light was a cool too.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it long but seems to do a great job</li>
            <li>First it cuts more hair, never pinches, and</li>
            <li>So far very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>It was smooth and powerful; I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the  money!</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;d have to say this is totally worth it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>This unit may die tomorrow but on first impression I am well pleased.</li>
            <li>Many thanks to you!</li>
            <li>We need more of that in today&#x27;s cheaper made product, higher price world.</li>
            <li>Very pleased thus far</li>
            <li>Anyone willing to go through these lengths to make a customer satisfied deserves a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had the original Sharper Image for a Looooong time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get to overly excited about having a lot of ear and nose hair to be trimmed.</li>
            <li>I look forward to using this well into my golden years!</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s saying a lot if you&#x27;re familiar with Amazon).</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use, the light is directed right where he needs it, and it doesn&#x27;t pinch.  </li>
            <li>The light is useful as well and allows you to see fine hairs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m extremely satisfied, and feel confident about using this trimmer in any position with as much pressure as I want and need to get the job done right.</li>
            <li>Great little machine, glad I made this one my choice.</li>
            <li>Feels good and solid, not like those cheap plastic ones.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>so everybody clean up</li>
            <li>Ordered  4 different types this is by far a superior to any  will reorder !!!</li>
            <li>It cuts smoothly and quickly with no discomfort.</li>
            <li>Trims well and cleanly.</li>
            <li>Tried more cost effective similar options but they ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li>It did provide a clean cut of my nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Cheap ones die too quickly.</li>
            <li>Gets super close and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>i have tried several and this by far the best.</li>
            <li>and you can clean the nozzle in water too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more apt to keep trimming and keep things short rather than never do it at all with the trimmers that hurt.</li>
            <li>doesnt pull on your hair, cuts clean.</li>
            <li>It gets the hair out without discomfort and does a clean job.</li>
            <li>The features many users liked were the metal handle and the solid build quality.  </li>
            <li>It works so much better than my old one and that means that I use it more often.</li>
            <li>It does a clean cut, neat, clean and does not pull.  </li>
            <li>It cut my ear and when I went to clean the unit the blade fell out.</li>
            <li>I have purchased 3 of these products from different manufacturers and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>Dasy to clean.</li>
            <li>No pulling or tugging, clean cut every time I use it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer has a rotating head and the ability to clean under water.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull hair, cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is still going strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: In Nov 2014, when we disassembled the parts to clean the blade, we lost the blade part to the drain.</li>
            <li>This is the best trimmer I have purchased so far, but none of them seem to be powerfull enough for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several and they never seem to perform well, but so far this one seems excellent.  </li>
            <li>It cuts clean and doesn&#x27;t pinch.  </li>
            <li>I pulled the blade out and used a q-tip to clean out inside then oiled the blade with some of the oil for my hair clippers</li>
            <li>Compact but powerful and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a cinch to clean.</li>
            <li>I lost the tip blade because it fell into the sinkhole as I was trying to clean it up.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t trim as well as the Panasonics and is a pain to clean.</li>
            <li>i can run it under water to clean it, or use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I have had more than a few disappointments in the &amp;#34;sounds great, doesn&#x27;t work all that well&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Very easy use for unwanted hair, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>You do have to be a little more aggressive with it than what the directions state, but I think it works great and doesn&#x27;t go through batteries all that quick.</li>
            <li>I otherwise just don&#x27;t find this any better than the cheaper models except that over time it may prove worthy because of its being made with stainless steel!</li>
            <li>works very well; no pinching or pulling very smooth trim.</li>
            <li>The light really doesn&#x27;t do much for me, but I have been very happy with the unit overall.</li>
            <li>Was very surprised at how quickly it arrived and also surprised at how good its works!</li>
            <li>All the positive reviews I read on it, couldn&#x27;t of been any more true.</li>
            <li>True to most of the positive testimonials given.  </li>
            <li>The other is that the tip that&#x27;s in your nose or ear gets kind of warm.  </li>
            <li>Despite &amp;#34;steel&amp;#34; in the name, this is largely loose-fitting plastic parts - and too many parts to get separated.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain I can breath better because of this gadget.</li>
            <li>but this thing is nothing special and the metal body?????  </li>
            <li>This is the right beast for the job!</li>
            <li>I find this particular nose hair trimmer to be the most powerful of all the different brands I&#x27;ve tried, and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I have had numerous nose and ear hair trimmers and nearly all say they are the best, but this particular trimmer is hands down the best I have had.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It performs as expected and he is happy.</li>
            <li>Pretty good as far as trimmers go.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Is quiet and did a good job of trimming.</li>
            <li>The LED light doesn&#x27;t matter for nose, but is useful for trimming eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Performance is superior to my former Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Works really good and is quiet and doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li>Fairly noisy to operate, especially of course when trimming in ears.  </li>
            <li>GOOD SOLID PRODUCT , DOES THE JOB IT WAS MEANT TO DO............</li>
            <li>This one works properly and is a good product.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer stayed cool and trimmed close.  </li>
            <li>No painful grabbing while it does the job.</li>
            <li>Most highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It clears my ear and nose hair nicely without any pulling, which is why I got rid of my old one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the light is actually useful, though.</li>
            <li>it is cool works just like i hope it would.</li>
            <li>Put a battery in it, turn it on and it trims away unwanted hair quickly and cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Cuts close with no pulling of hair (nose or ear) and a true bargain for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always the full moon with me.</li>
            <li>My initial device was of good quality but had a price to match.</li>
            <li>Quick, clean cuts.</li>
            <li>Please issue full credit.</li>
            <li>I would like it to trim shorter hairs but it seems to be a good product overall.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with it so far.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer continues to work very well and seems to be holding up much better than its competitors.</li>
            <li>LED light is useful.</li>
            <li>Works good and is very quiet.</li>
            <li>The true test will be my husband&#x27;s ears.  </li>
            <li>I have not needed to use it again yet (5 days) because it does such a good job.</li>
            <li>I feel compelled to restore this review to a full 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>My last one (died on me, don&#x27;t even remember brand) was just fair</li>
            <li>Product is true to its description.  </li>
            <li>Handles nose and ears well and the led light is useful.  </li>
            <li>and this is what I praise about companies like Toilettree, to please have good customer support to back their products and Toiletree didn&#x27;t disappoint me there one bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Inexpensive item and so far cuts nicely</li>
            <li>The system works well when it decides to power up to full mode.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>The light is useful if one is trimming someone else&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li>As of now, we are delighted with this product although we have only used it once.  </li>
            <li>This thing is sweet.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is not bad for the money.  </li>
            <li>Not terribly bad.</li>
            <li>It is not a Bad product</li>
            <li>because I had to wonder if it was going to keep doing that until it brought tears to my eyes, but it didn&#x27;t, and so turned out to be not bad.</li>
            <li>Way to go Toilet Tree &amp; thanks for making superior products!</li>
            <li>This device is easy to use and it cuts your hair very gently without pulling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made, light weight, and easy to take care of.</li>
            <li>Works well, easy to use, and the light makes using it so much easier.</li>
            <li>I called customer service &amp; they were extremely nice &amp; said they would try 1 &amp; send a new 1 right away to me.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and am pleased with the quality of this little device as well as it&#x27;s built-in light.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer provides great results, too, and the little light is helpful.</li>
            <li>Anyone who has a plastic trimmer (or any other trimmer in my view) will be happy with the performance this trimmer provides.</li>
            <li>,It&#x27;s great for nose ,ear and other places,</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated, this trimmer works great and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair</li>
            <li>Certainly did not disappoint!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, clear instructions, no danger of pulling or injury, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The replacement works fine and gives no evidence of the problem I had with the first trimmer I received.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine at first, then died.  </li>
            <li>when promised.&lt;br /&gt; Has a metal casing, is powerful and cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li>Received quickly as stated also.</li>
            <li>Very well made, easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for trimming a mustache - easier than scissors, and since it only cuts one or two hairs at a time it is a lot safer than hair clippers which can chop way too much off in the blink of an eye.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly and it was well priced.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well packaged from retailer.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and worked as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It has some nice features, especially the light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going to take me a while to get used to the fact that it works quickly and painlessly no matter where I put it in my nose.  </li>
            <li>trimmer!!!the fact that it works quickly and painlessly no matter where I put it in my nose.  </li>
            <li>Well built and trims super close and is painless.</li>
            <li>It is solidly built, and it performs smoothly and effectively.  </li>
            <li>Seems to have decent power, a safe, non-pulling cutter head design and, works well for nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut quickly, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>The foil blade spins around without endangering one&#x27;s skin but slices off unwanted hairs quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking at more products by ToiletTree in the future.t more products by ToiletTree in the future.</li>
            <li>and I just happen to be the lucky recipient.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly, it was picked up for return quickly, and a refund was grated quickly.</li>
            <li>works well so far , love the light feature</li>
            <li>Sure enough most of those troublesome nose hairs were gone.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li>As I gotten older there is more hair hair growing in places where I don&#x27;t need it than places where I do need it</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>time lucky?</li>
            <li>You can drive a car over this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Blades spin quickly and cut without a lot of pulling.  </li>
            <li>Finally a better alternative to Panasonic trimmers that don&#x27;t last more than a year or two, and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>The trimmer came quickly and without a hitch.  </li>
            <li>Cuts quick and close.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I called the company and they quickly sent out a replacement part immediately and at no cost to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned with some of the on/off switch complaints people had, but they all seemed to be resolved quickly by the company.</li>
            <li>I have used a one with a similar tip for many years but this one seems to cut more hairs in a shorter time.  </li>
            <li>OUt of the 7 different nose trimmer products I have purchased, this bar none is the best nose and facial hair trimmer!!!!</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied with the purchase and will likely shop this brand again.</li>
            <li>The construction is solid, the light is nice, the blades work and cut hair, but it doesn&#x27;t cut close.  </li>
            <li>Nose hair is taken care of quickly and effeciantly.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer feels like a quality product.  </li>
            <li>I started using it and quickly noticed a brown goo building up in my nose.  </li>
            <li>It fast and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, he has been very pleasantly surprised with the ease of use and cleaning of it...and most importantly, the reliability of it.  </li>
            <li>As I grow older, I find more unwanted all the time.</li>
            <li>By the time I got to this guy, I wanted a trimmer that focuses on nose hair trimming -- not other stuff that sounds nice</li>
            <li>This one does, and the little light is very handy.  </li>
            <li>The folks at Toilet Tree Products sent me a FREE replacement blade assembly AND a FREE replacement blade assembly housing!!</li>
            <li>The trim head is very gentle but accurate.  </li>
            <li>So highly recommend to anyone with more hair in your nose than on your head.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend :-)</li>
            <li>High quality build and works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I chose this trimmer because of the many high ratings.  </li>
            <li>though it does the job, my husband complains it gets very hot so quickly.</li>
            <li>It works very well, the only problem I have with it is its very noisy, other wise its a excellent product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a little stubble somewhere, but next to filling my nose with Nair, I think that this is the best that it&#x27;s going to get.  </li>
            <li>cut hairs efficiently, very satisfied once I got the back cap to stay in place to engage the battery.</li>
            <li>My ears are smooth and hair-free for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>The delivery was very fast!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing sharp and safe</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast!</li>
            <li>It can be used in the shower and is easy to clean, just pop off the top and rinse it out, then pop it back on.  </li>
            <li>The tip gets very hot.</li>
            <li>Looks also pretty maintenance free as well.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this trimmer from ToiletTree Products and I am very pleased with the quality of it.  </li>
            <li>The light didn&#x27;t do much for me, but it also isn&#x27;t like it adds anything significant to the cost either.  </li>
            <li>It is a quality product  but would be even better with a bigger, more powerful electric motor.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is sturdy, well made, and does an incredible job at a task not many want to talk about.</li>
            <li>This product is, by far, the most durable, powerful trimmer available.  </li>
            <li>but I found it&#x27;s also good for trimming my mustache and long hairs around my mouth and chin.  </li>
            <li>Large, but easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Works great, no bogging down.</li>
            <li>Glad I found you Toilet Tree:)</li>
            <li>Works very well, pain free nose hair clean up.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job of trimming nose and ear hair ( a necessary job for us older folks.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied to finally get a nose trimmer that works very well!!  </li>
            <li>The product has a steel casing and appears to be solidly constructed, it&#x27;s easy to clean and service from the vendor was fast and courteous.</li>
            <li>High quality, great power, and quiet.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about the led light but it trims very well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I love my new Toiletree Nose Hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>I find your product very efficient and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>This device is so easy to use, and hey, it really works,</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it is a superior design compared to the product I was using that has an attachment clip on head of many for that task or if that head just gave out in terms of sharpness</li>
            <li>This personal trimmer works very nicely at trimming those pesky nose and ear hairs that plague us older folks.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be more satisfied with this being my first time experience with ToiletTree Products, I will be back.</li>
            <li>First time in years I don&#x27;t have to look at the \\&quot;forest\\&quot; in his nose!</li>
            <li>AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
            <li>Prior to buying it, I had tried all sorts of razors for my nose hair but this one has been the most efficient in getting them out without sneezing and &amp;#34;snarling&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>Just exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>It does remove hair with time - and heat - though I was hoping it would be more effective at removing hair so it would take less time.</li>
            <li>is easy it actually works better</li>
            <li>It cuts the hairs in the nose and around the ear quickly and painlessly, and the LED light is very helpful.</li>
            <li>And the tool is as I was looking for (and as it looks like): a pro instrument, solid, strong, elegant.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, simple and durable.</li>
            <li>The blades came off the first time I tried to clean it.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looked promising, but when I inserted the battery and turned it on, it sounded fine, but then it would not turn off.</li>
            <li>Very easy to control and very gentle and soft feeling when you are using it.</li>
            <li>Great little tool and safer than using scissors.</li>
            <li>what can I say great little product well maid</li>
            <li>This was great for a little over a year, but no longer works.</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>This little tool works great.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, well made, and tough</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little loud in the ear, but the quality of the cut is great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because I feel the Panasonic one trimmed a little more precisely, but I&#x27;m totally happy with this one.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;It puts the Panasonic to shame.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the build is overtly superior and the head design is far more comfortable and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;A little pricier than the Panasonic</li>
            <li>and I really like the led light.</li>
            <li>The LED light is a real plus.</li>
            <li>The LED light is also very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Bonus is that the light really does help get the job done.</li>
            <li>The nose trimmer is equipped with  a built in led light that really helps the trimming process.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it functions quite smoothly and others...not so much.</li>
            <li>When I ordered, I really wan&#x27;t focused on the light.  </li>
            <li>I really like the light feature.</li>
            <li>Light is not too much help, though.  </li>
            <li>my husband loves the way it trims and the led light is very helpful</li>
            <li>the light is very helpfull.</li>
            <li>Stopped working after a few use and it didn&#x27;t do a great job anyway.  </li>
            <li>Led light really helps.</li>
            <li>Powerful and works well</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; solid.</li>
            <li>Nice solid unit.  </li>
            <li>but I still wanted an idea of how powerful the motor was</li>
            <li>Much better than the last cheap thing I had.  </li>
            <li>Much better than my old one.</li>
            <li>Effective and quiet.  </li>
            <li>Looks good but doesn&#x27;t do the job as expected</li>
            <li>did a better job than my old clipper.</li>
            <li>Have only used it twice,but so far it&#x27;s great and no hair pulling.</li>
            <li>The battery was fresh and inserted correctly.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>The professional water resistant heavy duty steel nose-ear hair trimmer performs flawlessly, with a lifetime guarantee</li>
            <li>So worth it works as advertised worth every penny</li>
            <li>I have used my nose hair trimmer just once so far and it work better then</li>
            <li>Seem powerful when I turn it on.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is as good as expected.</li>
            <li>So far after three weeks, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>If only all companies had this kind of customer service.</li>
            <li>Nice job on the regular spots (nose and ears).</li>
            <li>This item is really worth your time and money.</li>
            <li>This is far better.</li>
            <li>This clipper is far better than the one I had.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be a test of time to see if it can work for the forseeable future, but that said, so far I am happy.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price to me.</li>
            <li>He continues to use it, so well worth the money.</li>
            <li>That is the only nice thing that can be said about the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I bought Panasonic&#x27;s newest model of the same model I had.  </li>
            <li>Worth the investment for what it is.</li>
            <li>Nice to have one of these that seems like it will last, not be replaced in three months.</li>
            <li>Nice, solid feel.</li>
            <li>It would be wonderful if all companies stood behind their merchandise like this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I replaced my old one with it.</li>
            <li>I like the product and there is nothing wrong with it, a good product and a good price...</li>
            <li>in need of a useful gift this Holiday</li>
            <li>may cost a bit more  [and really not that much more]  </li>
            <li>and then the fun started.</li>
            <li>I feel I got my moneys worth</li>
            <li>It may not come with battery but is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>my former trimmer did not trim the nose hairs as effectively.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice and solid.</li>
            <li>I used to laugh at products like this.  </li>
            <li>My favorite so far.</li>
            <li>So far - am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it about a week, but so far, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>but sometimes it is useful.  </li>
            <li>One has to be careful with these things, but a good product nonetheless.</li>
            <li>but it was not cutting it.</li>
            <li>Well worth my money.</li>
            <li>So far, love it.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a sturdy powerful trimmer that could handle the rigors of traveling for work.</li>
            <li>As for trimming that &#x27;female&#x27; cheeky peach fuzz, it&#x27;s not quite as EASILY effective - hence the *</li>
            <li>Followed directions, used a fresh battery, but motor doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Well worth</li>
            <li>I have had no problem with the battery or anything else that others might have mentioned, I can only speak to my own experience.</li>
            <li>The warranty makes the purchase worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The instructions are clear and the trimmer is easy to take apart and clean.</li>
            <li>Seems to cut more efficiently and painlessly and the light is a definite advantage for seeing nasal hairs</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>Simple to replace battery and the blades are effective at removing unwanted hair without removing wanted flesh.</li>
            <li>Rotating head gets a bit warm after awhile, but not enough to cause any discomfort or alarm.</li>
            <li>, my nose hairs are now nice and short</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Best nose clipper in the game.</li>
            <li>my wife do the trimming it would be useful.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool trimmer.  </li>
            <li>But I thought with that many problems with the switches that they would have it fixed by now.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a superior product that actually does what it&#x27;s meant to do and lives up to the claims made by the manufacturer!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think this one is worth it.</li>
            <li>Not even worth 1 star</li>
            <li>This trimmer feels high quality and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>High blade speed, relatively easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice little tool.  </li>
            <li>Very Handy little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Better than most due to the Steel Casing.  </li>
            <li>trimmer itself works fine, I like the aluminum handle, and decent customer service.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is great, I tried other ones and was very dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And like other aging men, what I lose on top, reappears magically out my ears and nose.</li>
            <li>The trimmer cuts quickly with no hair pulling, and the power remains consistent at all times.</li>
            <li>The item was received quickly and appears at first use to be just what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li>The tip gets very warm after a few minutes of use</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly and easily I trimmed hairs off my nose and ears without any pain.</li>
            <li>Great little item, does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>My fiance has been needing a nose hair trimmer for quite a while - he was a little nervous about using this, but he after the first use, he thought it was great.</li>
            <li>Also other trimmers don&#x27;t do a good job -</li>
            <li>I have used two other brands which did not do a good job.</li>
            <li>Given the build quality I&#x27;m fairly sure it will last a good long while and stay functional.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the on/off switch, which feels cheap and will most likely be the first thing to break on the unit.</li>
            <li>These are fast, efficient and painless—a real first for same-purpose products purchased over the years.  </li>
            <li>The little LED light is handy if you want to take a quick peek up there to see if everything looks clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didnt work right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Shipping was right on time.  </li>
            <li>It cuts right through and there is no pulling.</li>
            <li>Had to play with it a bit to get the contacts right and get the unit to turn on.  </li>
            <li>Switch did not shut off right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I put the batteries in and the unit went right on...and wouldn&#x27;t turn off unless you took the batteries out.</li>
            <li>and so do you if you&#x27;re here, am I right?</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly right out of the box.</li>
            <li>and you has to be on the right plane to cut the hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The one thing I did notice right away was that this trimmer did pull any of the hairs your were trying to use it....</li>
            <li>I tried it out right away</li>
            <li>I noticed right away</li>
            <li>Works well and shipped out right on time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just that right out of the box the on/off switch does not work</li>
            <li>This thing trims to just the right length.  </li>
            <li>The product works well and seems to do the job just right.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>But that crappy design on the battery cover has this problem built right in...</li>
            <li>However, I reserve the right to revisit my review if it deteriorates after a 12 month</li>
            <li>I read the reviews about the problem with the on off switch not working right out of the box.</li>
            <li>This nose trimmer works very well and is pretty accurate,</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic stopped working after a few years despite me taking perfect care of it, so I ordered this one and am very pleased so far - it seems better constructed and trims with less vibration.</li>
            <li>Toilet tree products are nice and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because of the fantastic reviews on Amazon and in particular the evidence of ToiletTree&#x27;s commitment to quality customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>His nose is clean as a whistle, thanks to the ToiletTree trimmer.</li>
            <li>Great little tool!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and quiet while using.  </li>
            <li>Paid the high price because I wanted something that would outlast cheap trimmers.  </li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for 17 bucks, but the light feature intrigued me.</li>
            <li>and I have bought a lot of these before this really does a great job of trimming unwanted hair and seems to be very sharp.</li>
            <li>Works very well for special grooming needs.  </li>
            <li>He says it feels like its better made than previous one he had, that cost more.</li>
            <li>It is more substantial and works better than my previous trimmers.</li>
            <li>Product works as advertised; Strongly recommend purchasing this item rather than buying a cheap model from one of local discount stores!</li>
            <li>Sharp, easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally dropped the blade piece from the top nozzle down my drain, and after emailing the vender, I was swiftly sent a new top piece at no charge!</li>
            <li>the LED light is a great plus...very useful in a poorly lit bathroom.</li>
            <li>Glad I selected this one, a few $ more but worth it.</li>
            <li>Just got it so not sure about longevity, but it works great.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, clean and the best part--no painful pulling of nose/ear hairs.  </li>
            <li>Small and great for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I like the little led light built in to the trimmer very comfortable to hold clean up</li>
            <li>and it certainly appears to be better made than most other trimmers.</li>
            <li>ToiletTree is a much studier product, and it got my nose completely clean the first time with no pulled hairs.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is the best I have ever owned, right up until the time I tried to pull the protective cap off to use it and the entire trimmer pulled apart destroying itself in the process.</li>
            <li>ToiletTree&#x27;s professional nose and facial hair trimmer does the job very nicely and doesn&#x27;t cause any pain when trimming nose hair like some other popular and well-known electric trimmers.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all i could say about this product, doesn&#x27;t hurt feels premium and has a handy little light too.</li>
            <li>You may charge little more money and sell a better product.</li>
            <li>I should know better, spend a little more and get quality, or get use to the fed x man coming for a  return.</li>
            <li>It is a great little trimmer and much quieter than others that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality, works okay, and the light is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy my new one.</li>
            <li>the company responded to our report asap &amp; is shipping us a new one free.</li>
            <li>Mr. Parisi got in touch with me and asked if I would like a new trimmer free of charge to try out.</li>
            <li>Very efficient, though I don&#x27;t see much use for the light.</li>
            <li>just received it last week but so far seems to be a good purchase</li>
            <li>I was also able to clean it better knowing it was at least water resistant.  </li>
            <li>and, this design and brand seems to be the best; at least, so far.</li>
            <li>Have bought many cheaper versions and this one is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>also found this one to be more powerful than my Panasonics although both use the same size battery</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solidly built and not cheap in quality and it works great!  </li>
            <li>It truly is painless, or at least so far, LOL!  </li>
            <li>Its easy to remove the tip for cleaning and also has a clear cap to protect it</li>
            <li>With a lifetime Guarantee I got a great trimmer with no concerns for possible future problems.</li>
            <li>Simple to use simple to clean and good battery life.</li>
            <li>Only had it a month, but, so far so good.</li>
            <li>The led light is OK,  but not really needed.</li>
            <li>After using two or three previous trimmers I found the ToiletTree superior.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, smooth running (I&#x27;ve found most cheap ones vibrate quite a bit, never really noticed that till I tried this one) and well built, not a single pulled hair so far and the built in led lights is a very nice addition.</li>
            <li>The LED light is a huge plus feature that I didn&#x27;t give a second thought too when I first ordered these.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, pretty solid.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy product and the light actually works better than other brands with lights that I have own.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item thinking it was going to be far superior to and more heavy duty than other trimmers I have owned and still own</li>
            <li>Came super fast, was exactly what I wanted, and my husband loves it.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for almost 2 months now and like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, well built product!</li>
            <li>Does the job for which is is intended and the delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and quiet.  </li>
            <li>Trimming is very fast and thorough.</li>
            <li>Very high quality &amp; gets the job done without any pain!</li>
            <li>Like the nose trimmer very much.</li>
            <li>did contact their customer support for a question not related to the performance of the item since I rely on my own self experience for that, needless to say though, their Customer support were absolutely courteous, kind</li>
            <li>So far it works fine</li>
            <li>So far the trimmer is working fine</li>
            <li>Better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried that are built cheap and fall apart after time.</li>
            <li>It works well, no pinching, and the light (unlike many other nose trimmers) is helpful.</li>
            <li>It cuts fine so far...</li>
            <li>comfortable to use and works better than any other product of its type we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It works very effectively and appears much more well built and substantial than similar products I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>so I was a little leery about buying it, but the reviews were good</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it is completely painless, which was my main reason for selecting this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The light is bright and useful, the body is well built and seems sturdy, and the tip seems sharp enough to tackle a nose hair jungle.</li>
            <li>No more visible growth peeking out, but better yet, everything \\&quot;up there\\&quot; felt smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>While the little led light is lacking in usefulness, I find the trimmer to be great overall.</li>
            <li>Only used twice so far but being Metal it feels very secure and easy to handle, cuts very well</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get quite close enough but works okay otherwise</li>
            <li>The pitiful screeching, grinding and garbage disposal noises made me think that nothing short of a chainsaw would be able to cut them trees.</li>
            <li>(I dropped the first one on the bathroom floor and it broke, so.....not anyone&#x27;s fault but mine.)</li>
            <li>I have had it for several months, and used it many</li>
            <li>Ordered and received exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Yes, I might be able to open the drain trap and find it, but</li>
            <li>works exactly as advertized</li>
            <li>Frankly, I&#x27;ve gone through so many of these things (embarrassingly enough) over the years</li>
            <li>Well built, solid product, much better than cheaper plastic imitations.</li>
            <li>Gave it four stars because like others have said it does get hot if I have it running for a while.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written</li>
            <li>Does exactly what you want it to do</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well on the hairs inside my ears, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Sharper Image we had been using for years Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love it and made to last.</li>
            <li>Buy this one, it met expectations - it has the feel of quality, not like that Panasonic one that only lasted 3 times and felt cheaply made!</li>
            <li>We have had it 8-months and still operating off the first battery we put in it.</li>
            <li>, first off, it wouldn&#x27;t shut off unless I removed the battery.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this product, from the first day I received it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: Seller contacted me and sent me a free replacement, which has been working well so far.</li>
            <li>Decided to try this newer and much more solid trimmer</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this device for trimming with out any discomfort!!</li>
            <li>First nose trimmer I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>and I expect it will last for many years.  </li>
            <li>Up to now, each one was a bit better than the last</li>
            <li>It did not come with a lubricating oil; many such products do come with a lubricating</li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s just the first time</li>
            <li>Also note it runs much better off a standard Kirkland Alkaline battery than Eneloop rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>others have mentioned, it is a truly painless no-pull trimmer, that is pretty fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, so hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>This product is EXACTLY what I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really one of those products that deserves 5+ stars!</li>
            <li>Looked to be exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I use it regularly and think it is the best on the market -- and especially for the substantially low price.</li>
            <li>Though I have only used it one time, I feel like it will be around and in working order for many years.</li>
            <li>Love the LED light near the tip, makes the product above all the rest!!</li>
            <li>For a device that should be so simple, many nose hair trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it should do and what I wanted.</li>
            <li>My husband has only used the nose and ear hair trimmer once, but he was quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we finally found one that works!</li>
            <li>should have left it off and reduced the SRP even more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please, for the love of mercy, DO NOT USE these trimmers for facial hair and expect them to work well.</li>
            <li>I can tell you I&#x27;ve gone in the ear and nose canal like I would with scissors and haven&#x27;t had the first pull or &amp;#34;mishap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This one is a very sturdy and useful trimmer</li>
            <li>and I love finally getting a product that I can use.</li>
            <li>While being used in this manner, the motor&#x27;s energy transmitted to the spinning blade tends to make the slotted tip quite hot to touch - and you can feel it get hot in your nostril.  </li>
            <li>Not the greatest, but better than all the other weak s## out there.  </li>
            <li>This was not my first trimmer.</li>
            <li>Its also pretty compact compared to others I have seen in store.</li>
            <li>Suggest might need Lithium batteries to get better power and longer last.</li>
            <li>Exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so much better then all the last ones we had.</li>
            <li>Performs with consistent results every time.  </li>
            <li>This really is a very well thought out and useful trimmer.</li>
            <li>Wipe it well before the first use, run it, wipe, run it, wipe.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many nose hair trimmers I have purchased, only to be thrown into the trash after a couple weeks use;  </li>
            <li>I must admit that I&#x27;ve been doing my best to test this thing as rigorously as possible because I wanted to be able to return it to Amazon if it failed like all the others.  </li>
            <li>The first trimmer I ordered would not turn off without removing the batteries.</li>
            <li>Trimmer gets hot immediately.</li>
            <li>i first ordered this, amazon used it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>WELL THE FIRST TOME</li>
            <li>This is the first trimmer that has worked.  </li>
            <li>From the first time I used it, it preformed.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what its suppose to do.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if you can change the number of stars after first review</li>
            <li>It gets extremely hot during use.</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic product and be assured that I will recommend Professional Water Resistant Trimmer to my friends and family.  </li>
            <li>First step is admitting you have a problem.</li>
            <li>I had so many different trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This also leads to what appears to be a much higher RPM.  </li>
            <li>This one stands above most for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a great gift for a man in his late 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t much use for the light, but it illuminates very well.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer is exactly what I wanted and is as described on the Amazon site.</li>
            <li>But it by no means gets hot, and I guess some could find the warmth soothing.</li>
            <li>My first nose electric trimmer</li>
            <li>I had my first one for a few years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Works as advertised and have no issues in first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It really does work well!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY what I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very well built!</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>Opened the box, pulled it out, put batteries in it and could not get the top back on.</li>
            <li>Exactly what he was looking for.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic he purchased prior to this was much better.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, works really well.</li>
            <li>It broke during the first use.  </li>
            <li>Works very well on unwanted hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall its an outstanding product and at an unbelievably cheap price, so even if it did break on me in the near future</li>
            <li>Well made works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Is has a heavy duty feel: it is easy to clean and I like its free standing design..</li>
            <li>This trimmer works great at keeping my thick mane of nosehair at bay.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced the power switch issues others have complained about, but I would have to say that the power switch does appear to be the weakest point in quality, just judging from the feel.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>Higher quality that any others trimmer</li>
            <li>They work very well!</li>
            <li>This trimmer is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I received my nose hair and facial trimmer from ToiletreeProducts a while ago and was extremely pleased at how well it worked.</li>
            <li>The product did fail again, but I&#x27;m so impressed with the service of the company, that I feel</li>
            <li>Although I did has some issues my initial unit, the performance of this unit is so outstanding along with excelent Customer service</li>
            <li>Thanks ToiletTree!</li>
            <li>Very prompt response!  </li>
            <li>Have to do it several times to be satisfied</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It works well, better than my last one.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for much else!</li>
            <li>We had an issue with the first trimmer, but was promptly promised a replacement by ToileTree Products.</li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t imagine ToileTree so willingly offering a replacement if they didn&#x27;t have confidence in their product.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It really does the job!</li>
            <li>It is exactly how it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>This product works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>the light is an unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li>Fast, painless, and powerful.</li>
            <li>I gave it its first test on my nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that it will also last longer than most.</li>
            <li>exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is the first nose trimmer I&#x27;ve used, so I had no idea what to expect.  </li>
            <li>This product from ToiletTree will not disappoint ;)</li>
            <li>This is the second  trimmer that we&#x27;ve purchased and we will be buying more as birthdays and Christmas come along  Fred D. Barton</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since purchased a second one for my brother-in-law knowing there isn&#x27;t a better choice</li>
            <li>but it appears to be much better made than anything I could have purchased locally.</li>
            <li>This trimmer really works!</li>
            <li>So much better than a regular trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just received the trimmer and tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product that does exactly what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li>So glad I researched the product and made the obvious correct choice.</li>
            <li>Simply works okay.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My first nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>what more can one expect from a simple ear/nose trimmer?  </li>
            <li>i have had a few and they weren&#x27;t much good but at wasting time.</li>
            <li>Assuming it lasts a few years, this is a really good trimmer.</li>
            <li>: so as you&#x27;ll see in the comments, the company was nice enough to contact me and offer to ship me a new unit.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, surgical, quick and quiet.  </li>
            <li>its well made, trims nose and ear hair quickly and painless,and the LED light is a big plus..</li>
            <li>I tried a manual one (didn’t work, only caused pain), an electric one by Panasonic (inconsistent speed) and another cheap one (quickly quit working).</li>
            <li>This unit is very easy to clean and is one of the few that I know of that comes with a cleaning brush (although I must admit that I have not opened the packages of all the others).  </li>
            <li>Very solidly-built and very smooth and quiet operation.  </li>
            <li>The phone answering system only talks about special offers and seems to be more of a marketing pitch.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried because it doesn&#x27;t pull or cause annoying pain, it&#x27;s pretty quiet, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and, to my surprise, the light is actually a very useful feature.  </li>
            <li>It even has a little light for you to see better.</li>
            <li>The little light seems to be a gimmick more than anything.</li>
            <li>Well, I only had one similar gadget and this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li>one of the better products in this category, previous comments helped me choose this and am not disappointed at all</li>
            <li>Both nostrils are now as clear and clean as a trumpet&#x27;s bell.</li>
            <li>trimmer?).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, pleased with the Toilet Tree trimmer.</li>
            <li>clean and runs and sounds like a professional model.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>While the LED light isn&#x27;t essential, I did find it useful.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It DOES quickly trap and burn nose hair inside creating a foul smell that you have to clean up regularly</li>
            <li>I have tried several facial hair trimmers over the years but none nearly as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only used it twice but am thrilled with the results...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s never enough light to be useful.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;stainless&amp;#34; is more &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; than actual stainless construction.  </li>
            <li>design, functionality overall is good for the money---the issue seems to be with the QC of their Chinese manufacturing process.</li>
            <li>Has a good solid feel to it which makes me believe it should last.</li>
            <li>but since it does such a good once it is running I can put up with the occasional hitting it to get it to start</li>
            <li>I highly recommended and after the first use you will feel like you did make the right choice in purchasing this item.</li>
            <li>This gets very close, very fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for the quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Finally I&#x27;ve found the product to clean me up!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad my old one finally broke down because I didn&#x27;t know what a good trimmer was</li>
            <li>This thing is tough, easier to hold, does a better job, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty quiet and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I read all the positive reviews, so I decided to order this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Switch has a positive on off function.</li>
            <li>Great for nose, not good for ears or eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It may cost a bit more than other trimmers but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>price of this device is reasonable and not expensive towards its quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Had a different model that used to tweak and pull, but then it&#x27;s now over 10 years old and finally found a really great product.  </li>
            <li>The motor in this unit appears to spin at a much higher rate than the one in the Panasonic did, which may account for much of the improved performance.</li>
            <li>What can you say, it is pretty much a necessity.</li>
            <li>Solidly built, not too loud, and provides the closest trim I&#x27;ve ever experienced with such a product.</li>
            <li>Great Quality compared to other similarly priced trimmers.  </li>
            <li>I would say it gets most hair but cannot tackle the really long ones.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed after removing the item from its packaging was that is not made of plastic and is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>It feels very sturdy and well-made, and it works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>It consist of metal, stainless steel to be exact, or maybe aluminum, idk.</li>
            <li>Have used a few other brands before, but this is the best.</li>
            <li>Seems more powerful than other brand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like being in a dark mine with a headlamp -- you never know what you&#x27;ll run into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good, I have literally tried about 20 other brands, options, and none of them have lasted....</li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple of times so far, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found much use for the LED light other than to use it to look up my nostrils to admire the fine workmanship it provides.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product but feel it runs a little slow and would work better with a faster/more powerful motor in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Cleaned those nostrils right out to the point I could actually breath more clearly.</li>
            <li>I have tried many similar nose hair trimmer over the years and would rate this one overall near the top.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, much better than last trimmer</li>
            <li>I have gone through several of the Panasonic (top rated) as well as a number of others that were also highly touted.  </li>
            <li>These really do mow it down on the first pass and don&#x27;t pull the hairs, with easy clean up.  </li>
            <li>Compared to many other trimmers, this one actually seems to work, and work quite well, for many months.</li>
            <li>This is my first nose hair trimmer, and other than the fact that I now feel like an old man for owning a nose hair trimmer, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t hear the same sound with these, which made me wonder if it was doing the job, but upon close inspection, it seems to mow right through without making the same sound.</li>
            <li>Great Little Trimmer For The Money !!!</li>
            <li>Only uses one battery and easy to change.</li>
            <li>Makes the chore of cleaning up those unsightly hairs simple and easy.</li>
            <li>easy to use,precision and simple clean-up, everything clicks into place;well-engineered!I&#x27;ve used nose/ear cleaner since 1965 and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, quiet, and trims closely.</li>
            <li>The diameter of this product is larger so it makes it easy to hold and adjust in your hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no hair pinching and simply....</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t strong  enough power to do the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll report back if I have any problems, but I&#x27;m hopeful that this will be a keeper for a good long time.</li>
            <li>They offered a new unit to try out and, since I had already sent my original purchase back too Amazon and received a full refund, I agreed.</li>
            <li>He uses hearing aids and the large amount of ear hair he grows interferes with their use.  </li>
            <li>have ALS, so the large diameter makes it easier to hold.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I certainly would recommend it.</li>
            <li>certainly consider buying from them again.  </li>
            <li>This is a great, durable replacement for those trimmers that last a few days / weeks, making you wonder why you ever bothered to get them in the first place.  </li>
            <li>The motor is much stronger than the competing &amp;#34;best-rated&amp;#34; trimmers I have used and it seems to be of a quality that will actually last a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of them loose the power after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>First one that arrived didn&#x27;t work, but they immediately sent me a new one to replace it!</li>
            <li>had this for months now and still works fine, the little light is helpful.</li>
            <li>Pulled nose hair a little bit but not horribly bad but other than that it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Only used it once, but seems to work just fine</li>
            <li>For a relatively low cost trimmer, this product does just fine.</li>
            <li>Build very strong, sharp and does better than the last 10 I have owned, by far.</li>
            <li>Not as good as my old Panasonic at reaching tight corners in ears.</li>
            <li>Even though it is a bit more expensive that others, I am very willing to spend a bit more to get the quality I am seeking.  </li>
            <li>Does tend to get a little warm the longer it runs.</li>
            <li>Just a nice, compact, well designed little product that gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>He said this little guy does the trick nicely.</li>
            <li>This is the second Toilet Tree Product we have bought and we are very pleased with all of them.</li>
            <li>Great nose trimmer so far, seems well built, better than some of the other trimmers that I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>one more thing, don&#x27;t expect this (or any other trimmer known to man) to last more than a year with normal use.</li>
            <li>Motor seems strong, cuts cleanly--much much better than the cheap Wahl trimmer I bought at our local big box store (the Wahl jammed up after 15 seconds use, so I just pitched it--who wants to return a used nose hair</li>
            <li>I am happy and  it gets the  job done, the only thing is that you have push a little deeper in your nose.</li>
            <li>It even has a little light to shine on where you want to trim, if that&#x27;s important for you.</li>
            <li>The only difference is that it looks a little more substantial and holds better in your hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light is kind of useless, but as far as the nose trimmer, it seems more sturdy and seems to have better blades than the little 9.99 ones I used to buy from Norelco and Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product due to all the positive reviews and initially after receiving I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to wince as I began trimming, however I only heard the sound of the trimmer…</li>
            <li>The RPM&#x27;s are fast, quiet, smooth and efficient.  </li>
            <li>We really like the product, especially the added feature of the light.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty design to last and trims great.</li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t as bright as I had hoped, but as I mentioned, I&#x27;m nearly blind.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be more powerful or heavy duty as it states.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and the LED light is brilliantly fantastic.</li>
            <li>, one is none thanks.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>Appears to be very well built</li>
            <li>I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times, and I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>This works as well as units that cost three times as much.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I hope there is a legal stipulation that does not allow companies to mail/fedex/ups batteries.  </li>
            <li>Bummer, really...</li>
            <li>The LED light is a big plus.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Must purchase of you need one that really works.</li>
            <li>The light is a definite plus.  </li>
            <li>Since it is an LED light there is relatively no battery drain whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>The LED light is a big plus.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Have had trimmers in this style that did not cut the hairs, but this one does very well, no discomfort.</li>
            <li>Thanks ToiletTree.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my Father and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Seems like a quality item, and works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a month now and really like it.  </li>
            <li>This is four star quality (feels cheap) and there are identical trimmers with different brand names.</li>
            <li>My husband has a bigger nose and thinks the light is beneficial.</li>
            <li>However, I adjusted my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because the LED light is starting to flicker.</li>
            <li>He has always had an abundance of hair in the nose and just one time into the nose and it really cleaned it up.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>He is very picky about trimmers, etc.</li>
            <li>I like this unit and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Very simple to use and is comfortable.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Better than i expected.</li>
            <li>Fast.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and efficient, painless too.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is made very well for the price .</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product and this vendor.</li>
            <li>The light is a big plus.</li>
            <li>Thanks ToiletTree Products.</li>
            <li>This appears to be a very well made product.  </li>
            <li>the way done when I realized that it just wasn&#x27;t bugging me at all, even though my face and whole body was tightened up fully expecting pain.  </li>
            <li>It cut the hairs much closer.  </li>
            <li>It cut the hairs much closer.  </li>
            <li>I did not use the blue light to help with visibility while using it.</li>
            <li>Others may find it very helpful.</li>
            <li>The instructions with this one are much improved as well.</li>
            <li>I suppose it would be convenient if you used it on someone else, but who wants to do that?</li>
            <li>This product works very well</li>
            <li>Thus far, it seems to be worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The product was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>It appears to be constructed in a very sturdy manner.</li>
            <li>WHO WANTS TO LOOK AT THAT?!?&lt;br</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t use light, cut by sound), and the cutting head with blade is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>That is high praise from this man!  </li>
            <li>That really makes all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The method of cleaning is reasonable and not difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>but then once a week I would twist off protective cover and the whole trimmer would fall apart.</li>
            <li>I especially like the light.</li>
            <li>The product is intuitive to use and really cuts through the hair without any problems.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer its AA-cell battery operation to the inconvenience of having to accommodate a(nother) recharging station.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Fast  delivery.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>, if only they&#x27;d invent a trimmer I could use in my ears that didn&#x27;t sound like an armored division grinding up a steep hill.</li>
            <li>It does the job fast and well, no nicks</li>
            <li>I wanted a trimmer I don&#x27;t have to spend time on and does the job well and fast - this one does it</li>
            <li>Vendor was very prompt with delivery.</li>
            <li>They proudly stand behind their products.  </li>
            <li>then the light just shines on the outside of your nose.</li>
            <li>Used if a couple of times and it seems to perform very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like to talk about my nose hair.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of pesky hairs fast</li>
            <li>I get that one gets what one pays for, but I actually spent 5 bucks more on this item (vs. comparable items at Amazon).</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>The light was especially helpful.</li>
            <li>but it really does the job.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really need, like sideburns or eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Performs very well.</li>
            <li>and it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>As described and very well built.</li>
            <li>one thing for me is that it is very bulky in the hand.</li>
            <li>I sent an email to the company and very rapidly received a response from the company president.  </li>
            <li>The built in light helps a man to see how deep the forest has become and is</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it does it very well.</li>
            <li>so much so, I can say, that I was quite leery about purchasing this one.</li>
            <li>Thanks a million...</li>
            <li>I just threw the whole thing away as I had discarded the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>husband really loves the water resistant feature.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are very cryptic and are of no help.  </li>
            <li>Others I&#x27;ve had were lighter and seemed flimsy and didn&#x27;t trim nose hair very well.</li>
            <li>WILL CONTINUE TO BUY AND READILY ENDORSE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>this one has been very dependable and doesn&#x27;t just yank out the hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t cut very well</li>
            <li>Trims ear and nose hairs very efficiently.  </li>
            <li>this trimmer has a plastic tip, i thought it was supposed to have a stainless steel tip.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying this product (and recommend buying from this seller)!</li>
            <li>IT WORKS VERY WELL</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>Very thorough in its hair removal.</li>
            <li>thanks.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Of course the real test will be to see how well it holds up over time</li>
            <li>It does NOT hurt or pull hairs in any way.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer feels very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this model!</li>
            <li>just got this, works really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to be of very sturdy construction.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this works.</li>
            <li>Works well and fast gets the job done</li>
            <li>Packaged very well, not over done, but protected the trimmer.</li>
            <li>thanks for fast shipment</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he loves the way it handles and that it seems much sturdier than ones he has had before.</li>
            <li>I did not realize there could be that much difference between trimmers.</li>
            <li>All I know is people don&#x27;t stare at my face in disgust as much as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast delivery....works well.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Very well designed.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so I just keep it in the bathroom at the ready..</li>
            <li>It is relatively silent, which is important for trimming the hairs in the outer ear.</li>
            <li>It works without pulling on the hairs, and still provides very close trimming.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;instrument&amp;#34; is very well well made and is industrial strength.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product works well in the nose and reasonable well in the ears</li>
            <li>I especially like the directive light to aid in seeing detail.</li>
            <li>It felt like a quality product in my hand and did a really job of removing the nose hair.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and product arrived without a dent.</li>
            <li>Have used it once and really like it....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works very well for trimming where we don&#x27;t like to see hair coming from.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done fast and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li>Product is well made and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I can not attest to all of the qualities/features advertised, but the bottom line is that this trimmer seems very durable</li>
            <li>The trimming blades are housed in a circular top so there&#x27;s not much exposed to nick or cut.  </li>
            <li>This unit is comfortable to use, well balanced and simply a terrific unit.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really examine that space, nor care that much as it is an out-of-view place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve run through dozens of nose hair clippers through the years and this one really stands out.</li>
            <li>the whole mechanism locked up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always surprised by how powerful it feels/</li>
            <li>Sunlight really shows the hair you don&#x27;t see in the house, so I keep one in the car.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Paula</li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>Looks very sleek.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with another Panasonic, which also never pulled a hair, but it wore out much much faster.</li>
            <li>but I do not use it that much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Light makes things so much easier and zip,</li>
            <li>It is quality workmanship at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and well-made - it&#x27;s holding up nicely to my 2 teen sons&#x27; and husband&#x27;s use, thus far (and they&#x27;re not exactly &#x27;gentle&#x27; with how they use things lol).</li>
            <li>It is a great relief to know there still are companies like this one that put out quality products and stand behind them.</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>But fortunately I have big hands.  </li>
            <li>Cleans up reasonably well.  </li>
            <li>cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Built very well, sturdy and well weighted in hand.</li>
            <li>The noise level is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how it much helps.</li>
            <li>The trimmer does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it does it very well.  </li>
            <li>Gr8 servicce, gr8 gproduct, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and i can do this during a power outage now thanks to the built in light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10, would trim again.</li>
            <li>When turned off it seemed like it was really trying to turn off make a slower deeper noise.</li>
            <li>The thing works very well</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why the extra light...</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t turn on from the very moment I received it.</li>
            <li>Thanks. .</li>
            <li>heavy duty &amp; works like a charm &amp; the light is a nice extra feature...</li>
            <li>Does the job very well.</li>
            <li>Needs only 1 battery &amp; the spot light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had much luck with nose hair</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>He loves it, especially the light.</li>
            <li>Plastic end wears way to fast and refuses to shut now.</li>
            <li>It was an appreciated gift.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the mucous membranes of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>very short.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very well made and trims</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Indeed this seems to be a very well built product.</li>
            <li>Much easier than plucking and painless.</li>
            <li>loses 1 star for an otherwise good product.</li>
            <li>I was devastated when I dropped and subsequently broke my old trimmer, but in retrospect, I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Few dollars more is worth.</li>
            <li>So far, now that i finally got this, it is working better than any nose trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From our experience with the scissors.... you have to try more, almost like a explorer, to find exactly the spot to &amp;#34;clip,&amp;#34; in THE DARK (maybe use a flash</li>
            <li>Seems far better than the crappy Panasonic cheaper ones I&#x27;ve purchased in recent years.</li>
            <li>I replaced my 15-year old Sharper Image trimmer that had served me well over many years, but finally broke.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty quiet, easy to position for hair removal, and so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>but that does not mean I recommend the item!</li>
            <li>Very quiet, cut hair quickly, worked exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Still pretty new to me, but it works well.</li>
            <li>To settle the matter I decided to buy an electric nose hair trimmer and found the Toilettree product based on some good experiences with other devices they make, and the low price.</li>
            <li>to clean and ready to go instantly.</li>
            <li>Seems to be of better quality than other models tried.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other trimmers I have tried.</li>
            <li>have tried many other brands online and from the market and bought&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item appears better constructed then other trimmers I have owned and works well.  </li>
            <li>Feels better than other brands I have used.</li>
            <li>I had an original Panasonic from almost 20 years ago that finally burned out.  </li>
            <li>It is made well and although I initially thought the LED light was strange, I now like the light.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Seems kind of flimsy, and the light is pretty useless for me, but it seems to work well.</li>
            <li>Better than other trimmers.</li>
            <li>Instructions are simple and straightforward to follow (in case you&#x27;ve never used a nose hair/ear hair trimmer before).  </li>
            <li>Work so much better than the other one I have.  </li>
            <li>Gets the job done better than any other products tried.</li>
            <li>one looks most durable among other options at amazon.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t check the other one, as I want to be able to return it for a refund.  </li>
            <li>High quality and light is added extra.</li>
            <li>It seems more hygienic than the other trimmers I have had that did not let you remove the actual trimmer to clean it throughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and to store, the cap fits tightly and is actually useful in protecting the head.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine, I hope it lasts a quarter as long as the lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li>Simply rotate the head, (coned area) use the included brush to clean all debris and then restore the head for use.</li>
            <li>No big deal really as I just run some cool water over it.</li>
            <li>Not sure that the light makes a huge difference</li>
            <li>I have used the trimmer about 4-5 times, and I really appreciate how much better constructed it is than the previous trimmer I had been using from a much wider known company.</li>
            <li>The first trimmer I have tried that didn&#x27;t just magically die after a few months.</li>
            <li>nose clean, so, that when the hair grows back, it doesn&#x27;t cut, or hurt you nostrils</li>
            <li>The only negative is that the light on the item is more of a gimmick than useful since it does not shine in the nose in any way that helps.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades are made of high quality stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>Very well made, high quality trimmer.  </li>
            <li>We really like it, and we highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>; I really think this is a high quality product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decently made and it is very simple to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>its small, travel friendly, has a light and NEVER cuts him (unlike scissors)</li>
            <li>It was simple, fast and completely pain free - which was my biggest concern having never used an electric nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li>The light feature isn&#x27;t needed and diminishes the battery life a bit but other than that it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised when I first tried this one.  </li>
            <li>sent it back and got a full refund.</li>
            <li>Nice product, but not sure yet how will hold up</li>
            <li>Trimmer wouldn&#x27;t work - sent it back for full refund.</li>
            <li>It is, by far the absolute winner!  </li>
            <li>Overall not bad.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Couple of major issues with this product - one, it didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Water Resistant Heavy Duty Steel Nose Trimmer does not cut the hairs quite as close as my older one did - however - the safety factor of not scratching the nasal tissue is worth the need to trim a bit more frequently.</li>
            <li>And...I&#x27;m an older woman (55) with dark hair and have been plagued with more nose hairs than ever before since menopause.  </li>
            <li>WAY better than sharp scissors in the nose or ear!</li>
            <li>Works better than any other nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve used!  </li>
            <li>It just does a better job than any other I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!</li>
            <li>I thought all trimmers were pretty much the same, but this much better than expected.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than the old trimmer I had; I&#x27;m glad the other one broke.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t do much about getting older and finding new hairs everywhere, but this trimmer reliably takes care of what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do a much better job than my previous nose hair remover.  </li>
            <li>It does not cut any better as a dollar store one nor does it make any less noise.</li>
            <li>I am sure the manufacturer will declare their defective rate is less than 1%</li>
            <li>The ToiletTree trimmer is better quality and cost half the price.</li>
            <li>It cuts the hairs close, safely and quickly, no pulling.  </li>
            <li>Works MUCH better than my previous one</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll stay with the nose trimmers that cost less and do a better job.</li>
            <li>Much better and sturdier than the product that I previously used.</li>
            <li>It feels solid, does an excellent job of a difficult task and inspires confidence that it will keep doing so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, efficient, light-weight and trims nose/ears hairs quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>I replaced it with the smaller metal Groom Mate mechanical rotary trimmer which has actual rotary metal on metal blades and does a better job without the noise and battery.</li>
            <li>Clever name btw.</li>
            <li>However I was very dissapointed upon my first use to find out the &amp;#34; blade mechanism&amp;#34; is barely usable.</li>
            <li>It actually feels like you have something worthy in your hand.</li>
            <li>only suggestion I would change is the placement of the light, which doesn&#x27;t seem to shine directly on the area you are aiming for.</li>
            <li>Also the unit is super quiet .</li>
            <li>Yet to experience something unique.&lt;br /&gt;But steady.</li>
            <li>This is a decent quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>Some things are better left private, but sometimes you have to help people out.</li>
            <li>This particular nose-hair trimmer was well reviewed.  </li>
            <li>and the older</li>
            <li>as a woman getting older I was noticing nose hair and this did the trick.  </li>
            <li>For my use the light is unnecessary and just uses battery power, otherwise it is an ok unit.</li>
            <li>I have only used the clippers once, but they are quick and painless.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that this unit wouldn&#x27;t have decent power because it ran on batteries.</li>
            <li>this works better than any of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Arrived today whereupon I installed the battery only to quickly realize that the trimmer cannot be switched off--unless the battery is removed.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly and I&#x27;ve only used it once</li>
            <li>Purchased this mainly to use on hair around my ears, but works well on eyebrows &amp; nasal hair also.</li>
            <li>as I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>It will get the job done whether you are male or female.  :)</li>
            <li>Bought this trimmer mainly because of the product description and its durable look and waterproof feature.</li>
            <li>I was able to put the tip up against the skin inside of my nostril and actually apply pressure so that I got an extra close cut.</li>
            <li>Does a decent job and have never pinched the inside of my nose</li>
            <li>Bought this as a replacement for an older device that quit working.  </li>
            <li>like that with a simple twist I can remove the top portion, run water through it, rinse it with soap and water, and put it back.</li>
            <li>oh, the joys of getting older.  </li>
            <li>As we seniors grow older we have lots of hair growing from our ears.  </li>
            <li>and it looks like it does a decent job .</li>
            <li>A decent product after a month of use.</li>
            <li>He certainly went the extra mile to ensure that customers felt that they had made the right choice.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;One of the main reasons I bought this particular model was the response from Toilettree whenever anybody reported a problem with their products.  </li>
            <li>only cons (just barely) are that it seems most effective when using multiple passes over the same area versus pushing it against the skin, but no big deal.  </li>
            <li>If a customer review had a complaint or a malfunction, there was a response within a day in most cases from the manufacturer trying to make it right.  </li>
            <li>I Wish the cap fit more tightly, it comes loose in the drawer all the time.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have to give 1 star because they made such a big deal about how it has a steel casing instead of cheap plastic, but of course it is cheap plastic, not steel, and made in China so definitely won&#x27;t last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact it has the feel of high quality instrument and not some plastic junk.  </li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>in a weird way, I&#x27;m happy the previous trimmer crapped out...:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two other trimmers - not this brand - and although I&#x27;ve just used this one twice so far, it is way, way better than what I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>It is truly solidly constructed, and is extremely efficient and effective.  </li>
            <li>Was not familiar with this brand but it works better than the name brand trimmers.</li>
            <li>I love the little LED light---great touch.</li>
            <li>If there was anything I wish was better, I wish it would cut a little closer.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and lasts much longer than the major brand models.</li>
            <li>After researching other nose trimmers going with this vendor was an easy choice.</li>
            <li>Strong, sharp, does not pull hair.</li>
            <li>Its easy to insert and remove the single AA battery, and it has plenty of power (not too loud either).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it even if you only rarely use it.  </li>
            <li>When removing the clear plastic cover, the head, where the blade is, easily gets loose.</li>
            <li>It looks conventional but works better than the many I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li>Does the job very well for one time use so far.</li>
            <li>So far it has worked very well.</li>
            <li>Still works perfectly and most importantly, it never pulls out my nose hair in any painful way whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>The unit works very well, they must have fixed the switch issue.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had two competitor models in house that both died of old age and were not covered by any reasonable warranty.  </li>
            <li>ordered on Monday and received it Friday, So far trimmer working very well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>Works well, light not as helpful as expected</li>
            <li>I have bought several of these in a target store and have never had very much success.</li>
            <li>I thought it was normal that your eyes should water while trimming hair.</li>
            <li>The light seems kinda pointless, but I can see how it&#x27;d be useful.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra cost over cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li>Came quick once ordered from Toilet Tree Products.</li>
            <li>Love it that it is water resistant and feels so heavy duty when you hold it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The same day I wrote this review, which I stand by 100%, the President of the company was kind enough to respond and offered a simple solution to my problem.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, powerful and well made</li>
            <li>You can tell by the way this is made, not cheap plastic like most of them, but</li>
            <li>and powerful enough so it DOESN&amp;#34;T stall and pull</li>
            <li>Hopefully Toiletree&#x27;s customer service sees this to make up for a waste of my time and money so I can update this review like many others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few others over the years and this one works better than any I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several nose/ear hair trimmers in the past and have thrown them all away after giving them fair trials.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra bucks</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is powerful, yet simple.</li>
            <li>Solid trimmer, definitely worth the price that it comes for</li>
            <li>however i can say the trimmer is heavy and looks better than the trimmers i have used before...</li>
            <li>He claims he is hearing better and doesn&#x27;t have to keep reseating the hearing aids every few minutes.  </li>
            <li>First time purchasing such a product, so real alternative experience to compare it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice thick handle and does not smell as metallic as the others I had when trimming nose-hair.</li>
            <li>Think it might have been good if wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li>Hands down better than my old Braun.</li>
            <li>other than that it works fine</li>
            <li>much better than the old one from Sharper Image and less $</li>
            <li>a dozen uses later still feeling strong on the same battery.</li>
            <li>It just plain sounds better than brand &amp;#34;W&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Looks like somebody finally did it right.</li>
            <li>I had a job interview the next day, so it came at just the right time.</li>
            <li>, I still love this nose trimmer even though I had to tape the top of the cone shaped cutting piece to the main body because the plastic grabs on the inside</li>
            <li>Solid metal casing, and it just does the job very efficiently and quietly, leaving everything nicely clean and closely cropped.</li>
            <li>The clear cap protects the blade from collecting dust, which is actually pretty smart yet simple.  </li>
            <li>Only used it a few times so far, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>I fine is the cutter head heats up nothing bad but over all I give it a good 9.5 out of 10.</li>
            <li>I had never been comfortable sticking sharp sissors up my nose.</li>
            <li>I really like the little light.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;This trimmer feels a little light when straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>The LED light was either on or off but not consistently on with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>We like the light and the trimmer did not pull the hairs like other trimmers we have used.  </li>
            <li>no hair pulling just plain old great cutting and nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery was unused brand new</li>
            <li>I put a new battery in it and could not get the cap on.</li>
            <li>I switched in new Amazon rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>Brand new batteries were used.</li>
            <li>So it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>I chose this new trimmer not because of the trimmer itself,  but because I was already sold on the company ToiletTree.  </li>
            <li>Get a new one every year if need be.</li>
            <li>My contention is that a customer should not have to do a backflip to make a new product work, but the fact this gentlemen took the time to correspond with a faceless customer deserves praise.</li>
            <li>and I thought they would just send me a new blade, but they sent me a brand new one.q</li>
            <li>It is brand new</li>
            <li>so I ordered a new one .</li>
            <li>In search of a new one, I decided to try this one by ToiletTree.  </li>
            <li>Powered trimmers have all but fallen off the map where I live.</li>
            <li>New batteries did not work, nothing.  </li>
            <li>The new trimmer arrived today and it even had a battery installed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always just used a sissors but this istaking it to a new level.</li>
            <li>and they send you a new blade or a new unit if need be.  </li>
            <li>After using my new trimmer, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product and its vendor.  </li>
            <li>Seeing my review on Amazon, Steve Parisi the President of ToiletTree, sent me a new nose trimmer at no cost to me.  </li>
            <li>I thought about buying a new one, figuring I just got a lemon.</li>
            <li>I tried my new trimmer</li>
            <li>and we will have a new unit shipped out at no charge.</li>
            <li>I grabbed a AA battery and put it in and the battery cover maybe because it is so new</li>
            <li>What else is new.</li>
            <li>however, I needed a new one &amp; decided to go with this product from ToiletTree Products....</li>
            <li>I called the customer service and they mailed me a new head within a day.</li>
            <li>i put a brand new battery and use it one time, i turned it off.</li>
            <li>i had to put another new battery.</li>
            <li>Contacted the manufacturer, they sent me a brand new one immediately.</li>
            <li>High quality, solid in structure, and works better than any other one I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Previous buyers reported problems installing the battery, but this was easy.</li>
            <li>I like it, but the light on the end is irrelevant and more of a nuisance than anything.</li>
            <li>By the end it would only run for a minute on a full battery, and it would barely get any</li>
            <li>The light would be better placed closer to the tip, but considering the way these trimmers are built that&#x27;d be rather difficult to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made very well and is very sturdy compared to others that I have purchased in recent years.  </li>
            <li>My husbands tried several different brands and none of them were cheap.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really get in there as much as I anticipated, but its enough to get what needs to be gotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this little gadget!  </li>
            <li>Does a great job cutting hairs, the LED really does nothing, very dim and when using the nose trimmer up your nose</li>
            <li>The President of the company noticed my poor review and responded with a message, and, unprompted, sent a replacement, explaining that the warranty was through the seller, not the Mfg.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this after a few months, but color me satisfied with the outstanding customer service!  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, the only sound I heard was the sweet sound of hair being cut and no pinching or pulling of any sort and the tickling sensation went away once I got use to it.  </li>
            <li>Very professional and sturdy and does its job.</li>
            <li>I think the round, rotating blade is much more efficient than the flat blades that so many other companies have on the market.  </li>
            <li>So...as soon as I broke my first one, I had no hesitation in ordering a second, new one.</li>
            <li>A friendly,  live,  English speaking human being answered the phone.  </li>
            <li>Oh, the 3rd one he wants to give to his best friend who he says needs it badly...</li>
            <li>If your significant other does not assault your lips....</li>
            <li>brought two, when I got the first one I purchased a second as a gift....</li>
            <li>WoW!</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>This products works as advertised, and it strikes me as being better made than similar products I&#x27;ve tried from other manufacturers.</li>
            <li>The reason I only gave it three stars is because with this trimmer I have to trim more often as it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as my other trimmers.</li>
            <li>Worked well at first, but only lasted about 9 months before it fell apart.  </li>
            <li>first examination, this nose trimmer looked solid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many trimmers in the past.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what I was looking for around my ears especially.  </li>
            <li>first unit shipped had not been quality checked carefully enough and had to be returned.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t nuts, I had three different people of various dexterity try to get it back on.</li>
            <li>This is the first such product I&#x27;ve owned, so I don&#x27;t have anything with which to compare it.  </li>
            <li>Battery cap would not securely go back on after first time being removed.  </li>
            <li>However, the first one DIED and it is in the box from this one for me to send back to you:  </li>
            <li>but its really no better than most others I&#x27;ve tried  hopefully the &amp;#34;lifetime&amp;#34</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>It might not have gotten hot enough to burn, but I didn&#x27;t wait to find out.  </li>
            <li>The blades cut through hairs on the first pass and this one is solidly built.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using such a product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think i have any more nose hair than other men, but definitely have some to trim.</li>
            <li>We used to use a pair of small scissor (without a safe rounded tip....</li>
            <li>Being a married mom of 3 sons and 2 daughters, I was looking for a facial hair trimmer that we all could benefit from.</li>
            <li>+ smaller LEDs consistently spaced versus one, non-helpful LED.  </li>
            <li>Better than anything I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I like the light if you need to trim in the dark</li>
            <li>first personal groomer that I like and works well</li>
            <li>This is my third trimmer and most of them simply dont have enough juice</li>
            <li>It has a little bulk and girth to it making it easy for us guys to handle.</li>
            <li>Little parts around the head easily fall out of place.  </li>
            <li>I had bought a Braun trimmer after I sent the original broken ToiletTree trimmer back and was some what satisfied with the  Braun until I received the new ToiletTree trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is also easier to clean inside than my last one, since you only have to remove one part.  </li>
            <li>Upon contact with my nose mane this trimmer reminded me of a Jedi Knight light saber taking down a Sith Lord.</li>
            <li>Long story short they sent me a new one free of charge.</li>
            <li>This trimmer allowed me to have a hairless nose without even a single tug strong enough to make me tear</li>
            <li>(many dark- AND light- complected females deal with this) -- the design featured a comb-like trimmer; which, when using, you&#x27;d just &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; down an area to get rid of the facial hair.</li>
            <li>Much heavier build quality than I expected, and so much better than the other two brands that I have had before, a Remington and a Wahl.</li>
            <li>It is far superior to any other nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried a few, including some of the best-reviewed here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I surprised they are sending me a new one it has been over a year</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very smooth and works well dry or wet with shave cream.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the best-selling cheap junk, I think this one will last a long time.</li>
            <li>This trimmer stopped working less than three months after purchase and light use (once a week).</li>
            <li>Heavy duty construction, trims ALL the hair in my nose VERY quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li>Used this a couple of times and so far it seems to work better than others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>On top of that the lugs are way too small for the soft flexible plastic the manufacturer decided to use if they are going to go with the bayonet design.</li>
            <li>The reviews on this one were numerous and encouragingly positive</li>
            <li>ToiletTree seems like a terrific company determined to make a buyer&#x27;s experience a positive one.</li>
            <li>I tweeze the darker/thicker hairs which grow around that area, but I also have in the same area, fine soft blond hair which grows very long which I used to snip with scissors.  </li>
            <li>The very first time I closed the battery compartment cover after installing the battery a retaining tab broke off so that now I have to hold the cover on with tape in order to get the device to reliably operate.</li>
            <li>Appears to be a well made trimmer and does not painfully pull out hairs like other trimmers I have owned.</li>
            <li>No painful tugging on hairs like some of the other brands do from time to time.</li>
            <li>This was a bit pricier than I expected but the money was well worth it as it works much better than the cheaper versions that I have purchased and thrown out in the past.  </li>
            <li>I used my new Toilettree nose hair clipper the other day for the first time and it worked great, but unfortunately it would not shut off unless I loosened the battery.  </li>
            <li>Previously, for ears, I used my beard trimmer, but this instrument is not only easier but does a much better job.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as short as my previous Remington one perhaps because of a better guard system..</li>
            <li>If you would like a great trimmer, don&#x27;t settle for less and pay the few extra $$$.</li>
            <li>Toilet Tree sells high quality products that come with a LIFETIME REPLACEMENT WARRANTY!!</li>
            <li>I ended up removing the battery and twisting the cover on it a few times to break it in, i but the battery in and this time the cover went on fine.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t cut the hair as tight as my old $10 trimmer which I would&#x27;ve kept but the light quit working.</li>
            <li>Others of lower quality that I have purchased have only had a 90 day or 1 year warranty and certainly was not water resistant.</li>
            <li>I generally use it daily or every other day, just to keep on top of the situation.</li>
            <li>It does come with a little brush and I like the light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  my only other experience is with the small, manual, twist-type trimmer (that supposedly has great reviews)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need the little LED light.</li>
            <li>Came when expected was packaged properly and works fine,.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product is adequate for the job.</li>
            <li>plus the little light on the end is something i didn&#x27;t expect to really find helpful, but it actually is.</li>
            <li>I purchased a popular brand trimmer which lasted less than two weeks and simply stopped working for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li>Takes care of those unwanted hairs better than any of the cheaper products that &amp;#34;claim&amp;#34; to do a good job, and I have tried a couple of the less expensive products!</li>
            <li>It does an amazing job without any  painful hair pulling that cheaply made trimmers do.</li>
            <li>1/2 star for not so bright LED, and weird shape.</li>
            <li>Instructions clear.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s incredibly stupid that they put a light in these things (many manufacturers do) because you can never position it where it&#x27;s truly useful</li>
            <li>Until the tissue is clear.</li>
            <li>ToiletTree makes really great products despite their awful (but memorable) name.</li>
            <li>The trimer came before i expected and works better that expected.</li>
            <li>I will be buying another one to put away, as the old saying goes</li>
            <li>an extremly busy person amd was just going to forget this,  </li>
            <li>he likes the round rotation of it and the light that shows here the hairs are.  </li>
            <li>This unit arrived earlier than first posted, so I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Now to test it out for long term use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to give them as stocking stuffers to all my adult children.  </li>
            <li>There is a feel of quality to this unit that far exceeds any price difference.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer fixed that</li>
            <li>I have purchase several nose trimmers form drug stores over the years and found none of them really trimmed any hairs too well.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t trim very closely, required multiple passes.  </li>
            <li>This product is very well made; solid and dependable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 62 years/female and this last year have been having too much nose hair growth.</li>
            <li>Only had a few months, but; love it so far..</li>
            <li>and i was pleasantly surprised that he likes it.  </li>
            <li>so far, this has held together well unlike a couple of others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Far easier and faster than my old methods.</li>
            <li>Where do people go to get their nose hair &#x27;professionally&#x27; done?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She did not accuse me of any mistreatment of the trimmer, didn&#x27;t ask for a photo of the taped unit, and the whole phone call took only 2 minutes and 43 seconds from the time their phone started ringing till she said I&#x27;d get another one in the mail.  </li>
            <li>no problems, but it still early remember.</li>
            <li>(Getting old, like me?)</li>
            <li>my old nose trimmer which is a wahl doesn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li>it is far quieter in operation than the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>It trims well and has a &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34; on it so you don&#x27;t shove it in too far.</li>
            <li>Being 70 years old</li>
            <li>I like it so far</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this trimmer to people with unwanted facial hair as well as landscape companies and jungle explorers alike.</li>
            <li>This has not been an issue for me so far, so I assume the problem has been fixed.  </li>
            <li>My expectations are very low, because 2 out of the three didn&#x27;t work straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>Worked well for a while, then completely died.</li>
            <li>So far I used it once ever since I got it</li>
            <li>sturdy housing &amp; the battery goes inside direct, not on a plastic sleeve.</li>
            <li>Works much better than trimmers than have blades that move side to side - at least for nasal hair.</li>
            <li>Works as described, so far.</li>
            <li>and they replaced my old one</li>
            <li>After trying several $10 trimmers over the years that didn&#x27;t work I got this trimmer for Christmas from my wife and it really works.</li>
            <li>Steve had decided there was a risk of the cap being dismantled during shipping, so just sent a complete replacement.  </li>
            <li>Seems that when guys grow old, hair tends to migrate.  </li>
            <li>it just didn&#x27;t make me say wow</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised about the amount of power it put out when I flipped the switch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a Professional ...Water Resistant...</li>
            <li>Only Lasted about 6 months - is this really guaranteed for Life?  </li>
            <li>Have not tried it yet since I used old one this morning.</li>
            <li>So far it does what&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>My old nose trimmer stopped working (even though I changed the batteries and it seemed to function</li>
            <li>; AS I HAVE RECENTLY HAD A STRKE AND CAN&#x27;T GET AROUND VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>Trimmer works very well on different types of hair.</li>
            <li>They all appear to be much the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I hope this is the last trimmer I ever have to buy thanks to the lifetime warranty.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>He likes that it is not round</li>
            <li>This is a solid nose trimmer, constructed very well.</li>
            <li>These remind me of a professional quality product.</li>
            <li>It is better than the device it replaced in at least two ways.</li>
            <li>I had bought several of the Drug Store types with the straight blade.  </li>
            <li>My husband has used this only once, but it was very efficient.</li>
            <li>Was the tip dummy proof enough that I could really root around and get the job</li>
            <li>My husbands old nose trimmer bit the dust</li>
            <li>Had a cheap one once that was a waste of money</li>
            <li>Working well so far...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worth a purchase if you have a sensitive nose, as I do.</li>
            <li>but he&#x27;s too far sighted to see them.</li>
            <li>far it feels sturdier than the name brand nose hair trimmers i&#x27;ve had in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lifetime guarantee is also something that is not found very often on moderately priced grooming tools.</li>
            <li>Well after toying with it some to see what was up with this thing and hoping mine wasn&#x27;t defected it eventually fixed itself.</li>
            <li>did not work, , so i took out the blade and put it in my old one.</li>
            <li>Made in China is clearly marked on the product.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for my old clipper.</li>
            <li>Customer service is VERY responsive and goes their extra mile to satisfy their customers</li>
            <li>Unlike a different nose trimmer I purchased years ago with unsatisfactory results, this one really does the job in those hard-to-reach areas.  </li>
            <li>Works well, well constructed, not the ultimate but works very well.....</li>
            <li>Replaced old Panasonic trimmer that I thought was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; .. it&#x27;s rotary blades always had to &amp;</li>
            <li>So far give it a five star.</li>
            <li>so far, would recommend.  </li>
            <li>This professional nose &amp; ear hair trimmer is everything it claims to be.&lt;br /&gt;Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>By far the highest quality nose trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Those two just did not last, and I didn&#x27;t use them very often.</li>
            <li>Also WOW a company that goes out of</li>
            <li>Most were made mostly of plastic and performed poorly or intermittently after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t as powerful as I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li>the years have failed to do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then, I&#x27;ve never been an old geezer with hair growing in weird places until fairly recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I put off buying a nose hair trimmer, fearing it would hurt even worse than pulling them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works OK but slow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it difficult to find good trimmers in the stores around me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to see a company truly standing behind a \\&quot;Lifetime Guarantee\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had to stop and let it cool down twice within a minute of use.  </li>
            <li>When I turn the switch to the off position it will turn off for just a second and the it comes right back on.  </li>
            <li>Battery cover was real hard to put on the first time but this unit does a fine job seems real professional</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews so quickly, but this nose trimmer really deserves a 5 star review.  </li>
            <li>The instructions tell you to insure that the battery cover is tight and then rinse under running water to clean the unit each time you use it.</li>
            <li>Just noticed many other similar comments, obviously the seller knows it is a piece of junk</li>
            <li>It is a tad bit more expensive than some other nose hair trimmers that seem to have a lot more frills and features.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy duty steel and very durable unlike most other products.</li>
            <li>I tried with brand new batteries would not turn on.. beyond a quick flash of the led light very disappointing as I was excited for this product</li>
            <li>price is right, and it came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>It is small, easy to store, and does its job well.  </li>
            <li>As mentioned by a few other reviewers the tip does get warm but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem.</li>
            <li>Used the Toilet Tree Professional once so far, purchased this after using Panasonic trimmers and other brands that do not last more than a couple of uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has already held up better than the more expensive one that didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>It even comes wirh a little brush to clean it.</li>
            <li>I really like how the trimmer itself has 8 flat surfaces instead of</li>
            <li>I chose this product above other brands because it claimed to be effective and durable due to its metallic makeup.</li>
            <li>I have had trouble with nose trimmer in the past eventually crapping out on me, and so far, this one is good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this a couple weeks, but so far I&#x27;d highly recommend this</li>
            <li>Very heavy duty and does the trick very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and picks up hairs quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it is back to new!</li>
            <li>Thanks Toilet Tree.  </li>
            <li>should, i&#x27;m not sure what was up with it but seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li>Online, I will search TOILETTREE first for similar products in the future.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t had it long, but so far it is really working well.</li>
            <li>Feels solid and handles great,the light to see in dark places, nose is a must,</li>
            <li>ok sounds gross but i usually just pull my nose hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want any refund or anything like that, I will suffer my own stupidity for buying it in the first place.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but so far I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks and see nothing that turn&#x27;s on any LED lights.</li>
            <li>my only issue with it (which is not a big deal) is that you have to trim probably a little bit more frequently</li>
            <li>Now for the true test, how is it at removing nose, or a little bit of ear hair.</li>
            <li>High quality unit, works well, feels solid.</li>
            <li>High quality works well and very quiet compared to others I have used.</li>
            <li>TolietTree Products has created such a high quality trimmer it is made with a steel casing.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this nose trimmer and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and light a big help.</li>
            <li>They sent me a new one without even having to return the old one.&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but the part-owner of the company called and apologized for the mistake.</li>
            <li>I think the batteries last longer because the tolerances on the moving parts are so smooth that there is less energy required.  </li>
            <li>My husband especially loves it since the tip is round and easily inserts into the nose.</li>
            <li>Solid piece of equipment, good value, stupid light.</li>
            <li>and I assume will be much cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li>I have purchased others in the past and they were cheaply made.</li>
            <li>We have had a difficult time finding one that works as well as our old one that died, but this trimmer works better than any we have had!</li>
            <li>Its not uncomfortably warm, so I doubt it could get warm enough to actually hurt</li>
            <li>this exactly watt I was expected.</li>
            <li>He had used others in the past but they break down easily, so we love the warranty this one has!</li>
            <li>Amazon should be a little more careful with the products that are sold on their website.</li>
            <li>and they immediately offered to send me a new unit, which arrived 3 days later.  </li>
            <li>the back of the trimmer and incerted a new batery.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t for me-my husband actually told me he needed a new nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t have an eyebrow attachment, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>#34;rev up&amp;#34; to get to running speed (which I realize now was actually just &amp;#34;walking&amp;#34; speed, compared to the new trimmer) before it could work.  </li>
            <li>The light is a great addition to an otherwise boring chore!&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li>The cutting part is precise and smooth metal.</li>
            <li>duh) and easy to use.</li>
            <li>In Jan 2014, I purchased Toilet Tree&#x27;s Professional Water Resistant Heavy Duty Steel Nose Hair Trimmer with LED Light.</li>
            <li>Have you seen those really big guys at the gym who can&#x27;t actually curl or bench nearly as much as they look like they</li>
            <li>This one is solid, quiet and works really well.</li>
            <li>Heavy Duty Steel Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer with LED light by ToiletTree</li>
            <li>after a few months woh this, it is still going strong, the light is useless but it does what it is supposed to and is very durable.</li>
            <li>The main reason I chose this over the Panasonic is that the owner of the company made an extraordinary effort to respond to all negative reviews and comments.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s made of metal on the outside, the innards are black plastic and obviously flimsy as I am not that strong.  </li>
            <li>It is very loud, especially for trimming in the ear.</li>
            <li>This product works well enough but it is very loud.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different trimmers, but this is the first and only one to truly work.  </li>
            <li>The ability to turn it off is a major asset.  </li>
            <li>major problem...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve not had a lot of luck with the major brands&#x27; offerings in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>had two major qualifications:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would be interested in knowing what other quality products your company sells and the prices.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It  worked perfectly right out of the box, and quieter than the previous trimmer I had from a leading?</li>
            <li>Two, it heats up VERY quickly and is uncomfortable to use for more than a few seconds at a time.  </li>
            <li>This is a powerful little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Like the light, also has decent amount of power behind it.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work better than other similar products; except the light is useless.</li>
            <li>However, it wasn&#x27;t more than 2 months before I noticed that the tip (which houses all of the moving parts, blades and removeable tip) was very delicate to handle during cleanings and the plastic molding that had grooves for the tip to screw into splintered and no longer held the tip in place.</li>
            <li>I hardly need a light.</li>
            <li>Less expensive than the name brands, well designed, very effective for nose and ear hair, is a sturdy and not too loud trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Toilet Tree products shipped me a new, replacement trimmer at no cost after reading and responding to my review below.</li>
            <li>Literally can&#x27;t think of anything other than positive to say about this product.</li>
            <li>I personally found the LED light to be of little practical value; BUT- that may be due to my particular lighting/mirror setup.  </li>
            <li>IT has a light with it, not sure if it is actually helpful though.  </li>
            <li>This thing does a fantastic job in only a few seconds!  </li>
            <li>i had another strange mis- shipment,  but Mr. Parisi contacted me directly and completely fixed the problem, and it got delivered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The led light is useless as the beam doesn&#x27;t really shine directly up inside the nostril, unless you tilt the device.</li>
            <li>LED Light is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li>Tried several brand names and this one is clearly tops.</li>
            <li>It has consistent trimming speed but the cutting power and closeness could be better.</li>
            <li>arrived timely works as expected thanks to everyone</li>
            <li>Outside steel, though surprised blade shift is plastic while my Panasonic is metal.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>The trim is very close with absolutely no pain and no tears.  </li>
            <li>It does a neat job and runs quiet compared to the old trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is quite and you can barely feel it working.  </li>
            <li>Well so far it&#x27;s lived up to the reviews I read only thing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>This one seems different - thus far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I can already tell the quality of engineering and manufacturing is far above the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>and it shipped in a very timely manner--quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it seems to be well  designed</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>Not really wanting to talk too much about a nose trimmer</li>
            <li>However, it works quite well, doesn&#x27;t pull hairs, and seems solidly and professionally built.</li>
            <li>I guess I will just have to continue searching for a replacement that actually works and can match my old unit for reliability and price.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the off position does not do what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Did the tip reach far enough into my nostril to get all the visible hair, and also some of the hair farther back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been through several nose hair trimmers and this one seems to work so far.  </li>
            <li>Gave up after 3 tries to find a way through their phone maze and to a real person.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>First off this thing is bigger than I expected, a bit unwieldy.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job of cutting ear and nose hair without pulling on them.</li>
            <li>The trimmer tip does get warm when in use, which was initially unsettling.</li>
            <li>As indicated by other reviewers, this product is as advertised and is superior to other nose trimmers I have owned in the past.  </li>
            <li>So far this trimmer has been doing exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do without any trouble.  </li>
            <li>Some discharged batteries very rapidly and, thus, slowed down frequently.  </li>
            <li>But seriously, I&#x27;m not a fan of the single LED or its aim.  </li>
            <li>Two days later, a package arrived and it actually contained a completely new unit.</li>
            <li>I expect it to live a long and productive life.</li>
            <li>HEAVY DUTY  feels right in your hand  </li>
            <li>Also, TOILETTREE took care of a small problem quickly, politely, and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m nearly blind, I gauged the volume of hair actually being cut on my last trimmer by the distinct sound it made when hacking through the thicket.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the small nylon bristle brush which came with this unit, making it easier to clean it properly after use.</li>
            <li>No loose connection causing the battery to cut out.</li>
            <li>AND REALLY DOES THE JOB REMOVING NOSE AND OTHER UNSIGHTLY HAIRS.&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT</li>
            <li>But...... as mentioned by other reviews it is very sturdy to the feel.</li>
            <li>I have used a similar device in the past, and this one is much quieter, yet works very well.</li>
            <li>The on switch is hard to push and the trimmer does not cut accurately or close enough to my liking.</li>
            <li>for its intended purpose, not a single pull or yanked hair in ears or nostrils.</li>
            <li>I have had several other less costly, cheaply made nose/ear hair trimmers in the past from various companies which worked OK, though did not last long....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean trimmer as it sucks the hair in while you trim.</li>
            <li>In a big screen, big audience setting, people can see clear to the moon up your nostrils.</li>
            <li>This aids me in fulfilling my social duty of snipping those unsightly nose hairs.</li>
            <li>My (3rd) old Panasonic unit (blade) finally quit working and could not get replacement blades.</li>
            <li>This item attracted my attent because my, 10 year old, American Made, trimmer was finally dieing.</li>
            <li>It worked okay, but it left a lot of noticeable hair behind.</li>
            <li>Of the few I&#x27;ve tried, this is the only one worth having.</li>
            <li>I ended up taking out the battery and just turning the switch on and off for a minute, then i put the battery back in and still it was running while it was off, but this time even slower so slow that the light wasn&#x27;t even powering on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I have very slight pulls, they were not nearly as bad as my previous trimmer (which did so much pulling that I was left in tears after two seconds of use, at which point I had to quit).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tip was exactly the length it should be, and reached back far enough to get all visible hair, plus a little bit more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was not familiar with this brand but it works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had all the major name brands &amp; this is the only one&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Takes up very little room compared to the rechargeable set we had previously and works much better.  </li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was its solid construction, this was nothing like the flimsy piece of junk I had previously.</li>
            <li>The motor is strong and doesn&#x27;t get bogged down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It think one of the reasons is the rotary cutting system which allows hairs to enter the trimmer tip from the top and also from the sides which is very helpful for stray hairs not only in the nose but also on eyebrows, beards and ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other similar products but this one REALLY works.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Other trimmers have rolled onto the floor and broken - so nice design touch.</li>
            <li>So I took a chance on this new product with no history, positive or negative.</li>
            <li>device is much sturdier than my previous trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>After reading all the glowing reviews I was really looking forward to something above average.  </li>
            <li>larger units with more batteries can&#x27;t match the clean cuts without pulling or leaving annoying stubble.</li>
            <li>The cutting end gets a little warm, but it hasn&#x27;t gotten too hot to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, I bought a second one when I accidentally crushed the end of my first one (knocked it on the floor, dropped a very heavy tool on it while doing some bathroom remodelling, still only snapped off the end).&lt;br /&gt;semi-CON:</li>
            <li>Of a sturdy construction, does not pull hairs, cuts precisely and fits nicely in my nose and ears, without an extreme annoying buzz like former units.  </li>
            <li>Nobody sells replacement blades - probably because they know people will go out and buy a whole new unit when it gets dull.  </li>
            <li>A single AA battery powers the motor that painlessly and neatly removes hair in sensitive and hard-to-reach places.  </li>
            <li>but it broke some reason it has a weak spot on it cheap plastic</li>
            <li>Buy this wonderful little device and, with the exception of your horrible taste in music, your troubles with a certain someone will vanish- just like this mother-of-all-nose-hair-trimmers will do to the inside of your nostrils and ear canal.</li>
            <li>It is a little much for me but husband loves it.  </li>
            <li>Like all other Nose Trimmers, seems to be under powered even with new batteries.</li>
            <li>some of you will pay $150 a MONTH for cable tv but will tell the whole world how angry you are that your precious little $20 nose hair trimmer conked out in 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using just for nose, which is very sensitive due to allergies.</li>
            <li>The light is stupid , I cant use the light to look up my nose.</li>

            <li> Good company.</li>
            <li> this was sent as a gift, the person who received it loved every thing about it!&lt;br /&gt;think</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if you or a loved one owns a nose trimmer...</li>
            <li> The shape is good for standing up on counter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the reviews are so good for this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product was a good choice.</li>
            <li> have never had a trimmer this good.</li>

            <li> it works good and doesn&#x27;t pinch</li>
            <li> 95% of all the nose trimmers cost around $9.99 and you think that you are getting a good deal but believe me they will break on you and won&#x27;t do the job like this one.</li>
            <li> Does a good job.</li>

            <li> I really liked the look of this trimmer for my husband and thought I would buy him top-of-the-line.  </li>

            <li> Very well priced for an awesome job.</li>
            <li> nice thing about this product is its size.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice weight to it and it trims my nose hair without doing any pulling.</li>
            <li> Trimmer seems to work nicely.  </li>
            <li> so nice to have a product that does what</li>
            <li> But I did ask the recipient how he liked it</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used and tried (and burnt up at one point or another) just about every kind of trimmer out there.</li>
            <li> Nicely protected (unlike the mini blade units that can cut you)</li>
            <li> The LED is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> It does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> It has a nice feel in the hand.</li>

            <li> see some folks have had products that required replacement and the company did so rapidly and courteously.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice sturdy feel.</li>

            <li> No germ spreading when everyone has their own trimmer.</li>
            <li> This one does a nice job, but solely for the nose and ear regions.  </li>
            <li> It also worked nicely as a nose- and ear-hair trimmer, for the guys.</li>
            <li> like nice guys, but they should find another company to build these for them.</li>
            <li> I had a Whal model that worked wonderfully but doesn&#x27;t operate very well anymore (years of use)</li>
            <li> Nice replacement from my ood unit.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby to keep a nice trim nose without the risk of pulling.</li>
            <li> It has a nice heft and the texture and feel when holding in your hand is nice.  </li>
            <li> The LED is handy.</li>
            <li> I hope this honest review helps others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an excellent nose trimmer that works fast and well.</li>
            <li> I am impressed - construction is sturdy, and it is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of crack they are smoking to say this thing is quality, but mine is dog poop.</li>
            <li> He is thrilled with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> (and I have nerve damage in my fingers on both hands so the easy grip design was a nice surprise) and works like a charm!  </li>
            <li> the light is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li> The light is very handy.</li>
            <li> LED light is very nice addition.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Toilet Tree for providing me with a great product and a wonderful customer service experience!!</li>
            <li> but this trimmer works great and is user friendly.</li>
            <li> Up to the point the original trimmer worked, it was great.</li>
            <li> I have never found a great trimmer in this realm, but this product does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> this product has been great to use and clean.  </li>

            <li> The light is a brilliant idea and allows for easy trimming.</li>
            <li> I had never used one of these type of products before and found the overall design to be pleasant and the functionality was perfect.</li>

            <li> Good product made of strong material.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the best most reasonably priced that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect trimmer for trimming nose hairs and ear hairs (the guys seem to really like it), as well as trimming an unsightly chin hair (or more, if you have them).</li>
            <li> The product itself is very impressive, as others have stated it feels like a quality product in your hand and it trims quickly and cleanly without pulling or yanking any hairs.</li>
            <li> This one is so easy to use, does not tweak or pull very gentle on the nose and does a wonderful job.  </li>
            <li> After receipt and installing a battery, (which was very easy, I might add)</li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Cuts close too and very easy to use</li>
            <li> He said it is very easy to use and gets everything all cleaned up the way it should be.</li>
            <li> the trimmer is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer so far!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
            <li> I have been buying &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; trimmers for years and this one is by far the best quality.</li>
            <li> It is good quality, NOT made of cheap plastic material.  </li>
            <li> I have owned a lot of nose hair trimmers in my day, and this one has worked the best thus far.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best trimmer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I asked my husband how he liked it, he said it was ok.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very happy with this product...</li>
            <li> This was for my 89 year old dad and it works great!</li>
            <li> Honestly wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect, purchased this for my husband.</li>
            <li> By far the best nose hair trimmer I have owned.</li>
            <li> I also own a Panasonic trimmer and this one worked as well or better.</li>
            <li> This one is the best by far for the money.</li>
            <li> So far, my husband has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best trimmer I have used!</li>
            <li> LED light is good idea but could be a bit brighter</li>

            <li> I have used almost every brand nose hair trimmer and so far, this is the best.  </li>
            <li> looks that the construction is suitable.</li>

            <li> Best of the three that I have used so far.  </li>
            <li> the build quality seemed good - it was heavier than cheap trimmers.</li>
            <li> In a word &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34;. It is vey under powered and the light might as well not be there at all for all the good it does.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best trimmer he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> Great product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I then banged on the battery case with the palm of my hand and some kind of magic then happened</li>
            <li> Best  to just skip over this one until someone from the company post a note saying that they have it fixed.</li>
            <li> before I&#x27;m looking good and nose hair free.</li>
            <li> It works great and is worth the money.if I ever need to get another one I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I cannot say anything about longevity, but so far the item works great!</li>

            <li> Used it right away with great results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it a great review because right out of the box the on-off switch did not work.</li>
            <li> works-- and so easily!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the performance of the Nose Trimmer; it is easy to use and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I strongly recommend!</li>

            <li> The light does not add much to the trimmer but it would make an excellent product even better if the trimmer could incorporate the self-cleaning capability (\\&quot;Vortex Cleaning System\\&quot;) found in the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> A great company and this trimmer is  working exactly as described.  </li>

            <li> Better than advertised.</li>

            <li> Very well made and does a great job and would recommend</li>
            <li> Runs nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it as it saves on embarrassing hair in the nose area at my husbands and my age.</li>
            <li> Most of it is plastic.  </li>
            <li> Seems to cut hair OK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li> The build quality is outstanding and it comes with a lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li> I love this eye brow trimer, it really does a great job.</li>
            <li> Worked for a while now it is all sound and no fury...just unclipped hairs!</li>
            <li> I really liked the LED light on the end of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I am posting in honor of my husband who claims, &amp;#34;I can breathe much better now...</li>

            <li> I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying out more products from ToiletTree.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product</li>
            <li> I love this nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li> They also followed up to make sure things were working well, so</li>
            <li> Because this unit is priced competitively, I believe it is now the best value on the market in a personal hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> and I was glad I did.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be using the warranty for sure.</li>
            <li> Worked MUCH better than others I have had.</li>
            <li> Cover top does not stay on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how one would use a light on a trimmer to see in their own ear or nose anyway.</li>
            <li> It works excellently; the problem seems to be getting all the defective stock back from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like that it takes AA batteries instead of those rechargeable ones like in most electric razors</li>
            <li> and I can assure that I quite like, ears and nose, have a better cosmetic appearance.</li>
            <li> It replaced one that I have had for many years</li>
            <li> Nice and compact, I like the light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am quite satisfied with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a top tier product.</li>
            <li> one feels like it is made of better material</li>
            <li> the power switch is more like a power recommendation than a switch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Closeness of trim could be better, but being painless</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used and would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I have used many trimmers like this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cheaper trimmers before that mostly pulled the hairs out.</li>
            <li> Top notch.</li>
            <li> Best of over ten tried.</li>
            <li> Better than any I have owned before.</li>
            <li> It trims better than any I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I received your trimmer in the mail, installed the battery, turned it on and the top flew off and a blade ejected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this item and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the performance.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good device but nothing worth that price.</li>
            <li> A razor can take care of most of it.</li>
            <li> It works okay - it could be sharper</li>
            <li> It is better than what I had before.</li>
            <li> The construction is metal, much better than the ones</li>
            <li> satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> this is my personal best!</li>
            <li> The light is a nice touch</li>
            <li> The light is nice but it isn&#x27;t that helpful.  </li>
            <li> What more could one ask for in terms of customer support?  </li>
            <li> And it is more efficient using power.</li>
            <li> Thanks again for a great product.  </li>
            <li> Works great and fast shipping</li>
            <li> And it even has a light!  </li>
            <li> If you want a fantastic NOSE and inside EAR hair trimmer, get this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how much better it worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be better if it had a rechargeable battery, but I&#x27;ll put up with battery replacement because it works so well.</li>
            <li> I took the chance, and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> Outstanding customer service.</li>

            <li> This is an outstanding product that I recommend with no reservations.</li>
            <li> I would love to have this trimmer and would try another to see if it was just an anomaly</li>
            <li> i am so glad to have a nose/ear hair trimmer that works.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that the product was working.</li>
            <li> are outstanding.</li>
            <li> but it works way better and quieter than any I have had before.  </li>
            <li> Better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The device worked 100 time better than I would ever have imagined.  </li>
            <li> Am glad it has a lifetime replacement guarantee.</li>

            <li> I just love that he has this to keep those hairs from sticking out of his nose all the time</li>
            <li> A quality product and not a piece of plastic junk like most stuff nowadays.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a better trimmer than the plastic and under-powered one I had been using.  </li>
            <li> So glad it has a light-makes it a lot easier to see.</li>
            <li> I like that this trimmer uses a AA battery which I am sure</li>
            <li> Perhaps that is something that I am going to have to have some more practice with though.</li>
            <li> He claims that it does a better job too.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of an oily smell, but it seems to work OK.</li>
            <li> works great-am quite pleased</li>
            <li> It does okay.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The LED light is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> me tell you more about it....</li>
            <li> Again: THANKS FOR OUTSTANDING SERVICE AND A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> this is SIMPLY the best!</li>
            <li> (:))</li>
            <li> An outstanding product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Even has a light!</li>
            <li> Does not seem any better than either of the cheaper ones I have.</li>
            <li> Works very well, great price</li>
            <li> so far.update, after having used this trimmer 3 or 4 times now it has gotten to where it does not start when you turn on the switch, have to tap it on counter top a couple times and then it comes on.</li>
            <li> changed battery made no difference still had to tap on counter top.</li>
            <li> price was even better.</li>
            <li> Overall the best trimmer I have ever had and much more convenient than using tweezers and scissors.</li>
            <li> Much better than I have had before.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many of these over the years.  </li>
            <li> Having had the opportunity to purchase better known brands (Panasonic and&lt;br /&gt;Phillips</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Had much better quality.</li>
            <li> Works better than the others I have had.</li>
            <li> I thought it would get better with use</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m glad that I have it.</li>
            <li> I Love It</li>
            <li> love that part a lot and with a life time Guarantee,That in it self sold Me,Ones cost much more than this one</li>
            <li> Was unfamiliar with this name, but this is a well constructed product that works better than any of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> i love this thing, it takes no time at all and no sneeze attacks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice light</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s plastic</li>
            <li> The people who designed this realized that consumers want something that performs for more than a month.</li>
            <li> Never could have wished for a better noise hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> use it only for my nose hair and it works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Better than others I have owned</li>
            <li> It does seem to get rid of the hair better and faster than others.  </li>
            <li> but I sure could not find it.</li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> Does the job but looking for a bit more power.</li>
            <li> Junk - like many others, the device doesn&#x27;t lock after putting the battery in.</li>
            <li> at 70 years of age, this is a needed grooming aid and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I decided, after reading the reviews, to try the ToiletTree Trimmer and have been extremely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> I even found the LED light to be beneficial!  </li>
            <li> Love the unit, love the company.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product do the job well and with style, at an already impressive value, but the warranty pushes this over the top into a must have for your bathroom.</li>
            <li> Arrived safely.</li>
            <li> pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, my most troublesome spot is both sides of the septum (the column between your nostrils) and this trimmer cleaned it out like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of that, the Remmy stopped working within two years.</li>
            <li> Best personal trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for many months and this trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut my skin or pull hairs.</li>
            <li> and I intend to buy more as gifts for my siblings.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, I know, we have reached the age when there&#x27;s more hair growing in our noses and ears than on our heads.</li>
            <li> Much better.</li>
            <li> I wish they would have used a bit more horsepower in the motor</li>
            <li> It is efficient, painless and safe; and can be used without fear of injury.  </li>
            <li> Works better than most.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both tried many times.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who wants a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this one.</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;</li>
            <li> He says it doesn&#x27;t pull hairs, or pinch, and its highly effective and comfortable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m completely satisfied</li>
            <li> Stylish and works well on nose and ears without discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Works great, does not pull and cuts fast.</li>
            <li> Much better than most of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Led light is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> Some have worked better than others.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> My nose hairs have never been more svelte.</li>
            <li> does better job then a pair of rounded tip scissors, I think.</li>
            <li> Hefty feel in your hand and the light is nice.</li>
            <li> It pops the top part up</li>
            <li> This is simply the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> I am buying more of them this week.</li>
            <li> Well, in theory I love it-</li>
            <li> We have gone through many nose trimmers over the years.  </li>
            <li> Thought we&#x27;d try one more.  </li>
            <li> but I just love this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Already can see it will be better than any trimmer I have had before.</li>
            <li> Excellent performance and build quality, much better than the plastic big name brand</li>
            <li> Nice unit, smooth running</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an even possible modification for this tool, but if there were a micro-comb attachment that could be used, to get rid of cheeky peach fuzz, this tool would be perfect!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s battery powered.</li>
            <li> The light is also a nice feature.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement and this is a much better product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li> Many thanks for a great problem solver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> It has a nice grip to it.&lt;br /&gt;It runs smooth and cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really doing a great job on the hairs</li>
            <li> They really love it.</li>
            <li> Smooth operation and feels nice in hand.</li>
            <li> I can see many years use from it.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is as outstanding as Amazon&#x27;s</li>
            <li> however it works so much better than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> this just means I need to trim a bit more often.  </li>
            <li> Glad I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> Light is a nice added features.</li>
            <li> The head looks almost identical to a Panasonic trimmer I bought many years ago.</li>
            <li> So I came here instead, and bought this, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s better all the others that my nose hairs wore out.</li>
            <li> He has not had the chance to use his yet, but I&#x27;m sure that this will do the trick.  </li>
            <li> works well  pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> Perfect product for facial grooming.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this trimmer...</li>

            <li> The LED light is a nice touch.</li>

            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Asking nme in 6 months or a year would be a much better indicator of quality.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of the light for my husband to see what he is doing.</li>
            <li> sure if mine is defective or not.</li>
            <li> I would give it five stars if the power up was better.</li>
            <li> All that it was described and more.  </li>
            <li> By the way Amazon&#x27;s return policy is fantastic!</li>
            <li> And it helps you spot those errant, fugitive hairs that pop out at the most embarrassing moments.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the cleaning method - thanks!!!!</li>

            <li> Pretty good quality.  </li>
            <li> Its a minor inconvenience that he has to take the battery out to turn it off, but it also shows the quality control on this product is not the greatest.</li>

            <li> The light isn&#x27;t bright at all and is barely worth having..</li>
            <li> Works great, more complete job than the reciprocating model from the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I am 100 percent thrilled with the quality of this item, as well as the quick service provided.  </li>

            <li> Very good steel nose trimmer with light, better than old one, cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> With a better cap it would be fine.</li>
            <li> Was expecting to spend much more money for a nose hair trimmer, but this one works just fine.</li>
            <li> I called the company, Toilettree Products at 888-251-0985, told the very nice woman in customer service what had happened, and she sent me a brand new one in retail packaging.  </li>
            <li> The price was quite attractive, and after reading the positive reviews relating to it&#x27;s durability, I figured this would be a great grooming tool for the entire family (except our youngest</li>

            <li> Works as expected, very good quality!</li>
            <li> The light is more of a gimick</li>
            <li> Better motor and a light make them east to use.</li>
            <li> The top cover also does not close securely and falls off.</li>
            <li> It showed up on time but it looks more cheaply made than I thought it would and it doesn&#x27;t turn off....</li>
            <li> So far it seems like a great product.  </li>

            <li> It is also relatively easy to keep clean by just rinsing the head with water while it is turned on.  </li>
            <li> so i searched for a cheap nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> i just dont understand why there is a light on it.</li>
            <li> light is a joke--need tolight a match to see if it is on--trimmer  part works.</li>
            <li> Surpasses the cheap ones by a mile.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all cheaply made.  </li>

            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> great product for a very specific need.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of trimming nose hairs, is easy to clean and, so far, continues to work.</li>
            <li> so I went online to see what was available.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise though, it works well and is quieter than some others, which is important when trimming so close to the ears.</li>
            <li> , I have some nose hair that grows to a point where it is within view if you are up real close and kind of looking for it.</li>
            <li> I am not looking for a baby&#x27;s butt smooth surface inside my nose, like some posters seem to be.</li>
            <li> But it helps to keep the nostril free of buggers.</li>
            <li> This is a great, quiet, quality piece of craftsmanship-ed piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> It has a light, and it cuts the hair in you</li>
            <li> Nice product, seems more durable than the last one I had which stopped working, also does not pull on hairs and cause pain, am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The light would come on but no trimmer.  </li>
            <li> LED light is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I had a great Panasonic trimmer years ago that finally wore out; it never pulled a hair.</li>
            <li> Cheap construction.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t comfortable in that department.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a cheap piece of plastic to me.</li>
            <li> It trims my nose hairs without getting stuck and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> But perhaps best of all those few who have reported encountering any issues with the product have received immediate attention and resolution to their issue.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing in your hand, like a real man&#x27;s nose hair trimmer should.</li>
            <li> He loves it because of the led light and because it has steel blades.</li>
            <li> Overall though, it gets the job done and does a great job doing</li>
            <li> Nice product - thanks.</li>

            <li> Precise.</li>

            <li> Reasonably priced and effective.</li>
            <li> It feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Works fabulously.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a light that shines into my nose while i weedwhack those gnarly spider leg looking hairs.  </li>
            <li> Great design which will last me a life time.</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer built with metal case and not cheap plastic - trims hair cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li> The LED light is helpful, as well.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable and working parts quite letting one hear the hairs being trimmed away.  </li>
            <li> Like the light.</li>
            <li> Fast service, nice product</li>
            <li> Works smooth without pulling the hair.  </li>
            <li> It was also easy to clean by running the tip under water.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It all seems very well-constructed, and I anticipate getting many more years of use out of this one.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Loved this product, my Dad was surprised to receive this Thank</li>
            <li> So far so good with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many, many nose hair trimmers of all prices and brands, and they either don&#x27;t work or don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The metal body adds some nice weight to it and the light makes things go much smoother.</li>
            <li> Not so good as the old one.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> works great,so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> My old Wahl nose hair trimmer was okay but not as nicely engineered as this one.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> AND SO FAR SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> Having used similar for many years I am delighted with the features of this clipper.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Good product, glad I purchased it, but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> So far so good, nothing fancy</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very well made, and not with cheap plastic or cheap metal parts like many others I have tried, fits real comfortable in my hand, very easy to use runs off one AA battery and runs well, does not grab and pull the nose or ear hair&#x27;s, the LED light is pretty cool, lights up the way nice and bright, the blade trimmer end of it can be rinsed under running water, which is a plus, all in all seriously well worth the money, this is backed by a lifetime warranty, and it is built like it will last a lifetime, a perfect gift for anyone</li>
            <li> I originally bought one of these for myself and really liked it, I have so far bought 3 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the price is right.  </li>
            <li> Great quality not all plastic like most of the other makers use.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SERVICE!&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to use Toilet Tree Products in the future!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!!!</li>
            <li> Very useful tool in trimming ear and nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, no hair pulls ...</li>
            <li> it was a pain free, quick and easy experience.</li>
            <li> They allow for a clean smooth cut.  </li>
            <li> Second purchased in three years and without question, this is most effective, easy to use, deforester of noise and ear hairs.</li>
            <li> The toilet tree nose trimmer works great.</li>
            <li> Great customer service from Toilet Tree Products as well.  </li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s so easy and quick.</li>
            <li> It was good at first and worked very well.</li>
            <li> However, first time I used this trimmer, I LOVE THE LIGHT.  </li>
            <li> Feels substantial, works quickly, and stores easily.  </li>
            <li> Cuts hair easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it it was so smooth that I was sure they didn&#x27;t put a blade it in and that it was not working, but it was.</li>
            <li> no pulling.. quick and easy and fits well in the hand.</li>
            <li> I especially like the light feature, the fact that it successfully removes both nose and ear hairs and can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> This one really does cut my nose hairs very easily.</li>
            <li> Major  bummer as I loved it when it worked UPDATE 5/4/15-I</li>
            <li> It trimmed the hairs quickly and was easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very good heavy duty and the on/off switch works fine.</li>
            <li> So, if you are one of those fortunate beings like me that are blessed with nose/ear hairs that would withstand the full forces of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, then this is the trimmer you have been looking for.</li>
            <li> He was excited that it works well and was inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do but remarkably better than trimmers</li>
            <li> I had a minor issue and the support was great.</li>
            <li> The light was a cool too.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long but seems to do a great job</li>
            <li> First it cuts more hair, never pinches, and</li>
            <li> So far very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> It was smooth and powerful; I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the  money!</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;d have to say this is totally worth it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This unit may die tomorrow but on first impression I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> Many thanks to you!</li>
            <li> We need more of that in today&#x27;s cheaper made product, higher price world.</li>
            <li> Very pleased thus far</li>
            <li> Anyone willing to go through these lengths to make a customer satisfied deserves a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had the original Sharper Image for a Looooong time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get to overly excited about having a lot of ear and nose hair to be trimmed.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this well into my golden years!</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s saying a lot if you&#x27;re familiar with Amazon).</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use, the light is directed right where he needs it, and it doesn&#x27;t pinch.  </li>
            <li> The light is useful as well and allows you to see fine hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely satisfied, and feel confident about using this trimmer in any position with as much pressure as I want and need to get the job done right.</li>
            <li> Great little machine, glad I made this one my choice.</li>
            <li> Feels good and solid, not like those cheap plastic ones.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> so everybody clean up</li>
            <li> Ordered  4 different types this is by far a superior to any  will reorder !!!</li>
            <li> It cuts smoothly and quickly with no discomfort.</li>
            <li> Trims well and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Tried more cost effective similar options but they ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> It did provide a clean cut of my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Cheap ones die too quickly.</li>
            <li> Gets super close and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> i have tried several and this by far the best.</li>
            <li> and you can clean the nozzle in water too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more apt to keep trimming and keep things short rather than never do it at all with the trimmers that hurt.</li>
            <li> doesnt pull on your hair, cuts clean.</li>
            <li> It gets the hair out without discomfort and does a clean job.</li>
            <li> The features many users liked were the metal handle and the solid build quality.  </li>
            <li> It works so much better than my old one and that means that I use it more often.</li>
            <li> It does a clean cut, neat, clean and does not pull.  </li>
            <li> It cut my ear and when I went to clean the unit the blade fell out.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these products from different manufacturers and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> Dasy to clean.</li>
            <li> No pulling or tugging, clean cut every time I use it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a rotating head and the ability to clean under water.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull hair, cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is still going strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: In Nov 2014, when we disassembled the parts to clean the blade, we lost the blade part to the drain.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have purchased so far, but none of them seem to be powerfull enough for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several and they never seem to perform well, but so far this one seems excellent.  </li>
            <li> It cuts clean and doesn&#x27;t pinch.  </li>
            <li> I pulled the blade out and used a q-tip to clean out inside then oiled the blade with some of the oil for my hair clippers</li>
            <li> Compact but powerful and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a cinch to clean.</li>
            <li> I lost the tip blade because it fell into the sinkhole as I was trying to clean it up.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim as well as the Panasonics and is a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> i can run it under water to clean it, or use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have had more than a few disappointments in the &amp;#34;sounds great, doesn&#x27;t work all that well&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very easy use for unwanted hair, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You do have to be a little more aggressive with it than what the directions state, but I think it works great and doesn&#x27;t go through batteries all that quick.</li>
            <li> I otherwise just don&#x27;t find this any better than the cheaper models except that over time it may prove worthy because of its being made with stainless steel!</li>
            <li> works very well; no pinching or pulling very smooth trim.</li>
            <li> The light really doesn&#x27;t do much for me, but I have been very happy with the unit overall.</li>
            <li> Was very surprised at how quickly it arrived and also surprised at how good its works!</li>
            <li> All the positive reviews I read on it, couldn&#x27;t of been any more true.</li>
            <li> True to most of the positive testimonials given.  </li>
            <li> The other is that the tip that&#x27;s in your nose or ear gets kind of warm.  </li>
            <li> Despite &amp;#34;steel&amp;#34; in the name, this is largely loose-fitting plastic parts - and too many parts to get separated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain I can breath better because of this gadget.</li>
            <li> but this thing is nothing special and the metal body?????  </li>
            <li> This is the right beast for the job!</li>
            <li> I find this particular nose hair trimmer to be the most powerful of all the different brands I&#x27;ve tried, and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I have had numerous nose and ear hair trimmers and nearly all say they are the best, but this particular trimmer is hands down the best I have had.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It performs as expected and he is happy.</li>
            <li> Pretty good as far as trimmers go.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Is quiet and did a good job of trimming.</li>
            <li> The LED light doesn&#x27;t matter for nose, but is useful for trimming eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Performance is superior to my former Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Works really good and is quiet and doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> Fairly noisy to operate, especially of course when trimming in ears.  </li>
            <li> GOOD SOLID PRODUCT , DOES THE JOB IT WAS MEANT TO DO............</li>
            <li> This one works properly and is a good product.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer stayed cool and trimmed close.  </li>
            <li> No painful grabbing while it does the job.</li>
            <li> Most highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It clears my ear and nose hair nicely without any pulling, which is why I got rid of my old one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the light is actually useful, though.</li>
            <li> it is cool works just like i hope it would.</li>
            <li> Put a battery in it, turn it on and it trims away unwanted hair quickly and cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Cuts close with no pulling of hair (nose or ear) and a true bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always the full moon with me.</li>
            <li> My initial device was of good quality but had a price to match.</li>
            <li> Quick, clean cuts.</li>
            <li> Please issue full credit.</li>
            <li> I would like it to trim shorter hairs but it seems to be a good product overall.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with it so far.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer continues to work very well and seems to be holding up much better than its competitors.</li>
            <li> LED light is useful.</li>
            <li> Works good and is very quiet.</li>
            <li> The true test will be my husband&#x27;s ears.  </li>
            <li> I have not needed to use it again yet (5 days) because it does such a good job.</li>
            <li> I feel compelled to restore this review to a full 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> My last one (died on me, don&#x27;t even remember brand) was just fair</li>
            <li> Product is true to its description.  </li>
            <li> Handles nose and ears well and the led light is useful.  </li>
            <li> and this is what I praise about companies like Toilettree, to please have good customer support to back their products and Toiletree didn&#x27;t disappoint me there one bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Inexpensive item and so far cuts nicely</li>
            <li> The system works well when it decides to power up to full mode.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> The light is useful if one is trimming someone else&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li> As of now, we are delighted with this product although we have only used it once.  </li>
            <li> This thing is sweet.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is not bad for the money.  </li>
            <li> Not terribly bad.</li>
            <li> It is not a Bad product</li>
            <li> because I had to wonder if it was going to keep doing that until it brought tears to my eyes, but it didn&#x27;t, and so turned out to be not bad.</li>
            <li> Way to go Toilet Tree &amp; thanks for making superior products!</li>
            <li> This device is easy to use and it cuts your hair very gently without pulling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made, light weight, and easy to take care of.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use, and the light makes using it so much easier.</li>
            <li> I called customer service &amp; they were extremely nice &amp; said they would try 1 &amp; send a new 1 right away to me.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and am pleased with the quality of this little device as well as it&#x27;s built-in light.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer provides great results, too, and the little light is helpful.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has a plastic trimmer (or any other trimmer in my view) will be happy with the performance this trimmer provides.</li>
            <li> ,It&#x27;s great for nose ,ear and other places,</li>

            <li> Certainly did not disappoint!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, clear instructions, no danger of pulling or injury, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The replacement works fine and gives no evidence of the problem I had with the first trimmer I received.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine at first, then died.  </li>
            <li> when promised.&lt;br /&gt; Has a metal casing, is powerful and cuts cleanly.</li>

            <li> Very well made, easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for trimming a mustache - easier than scissors, and since it only cuts one or two hairs at a time it is a lot safer than hair clippers which can chop way too much off in the blink of an eye.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly and it was well priced.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged from retailer.</li>

            <li> Finally a better alternative to Panasonic trimmers that don&#x27;t last more than a year or two, and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> The trimmer came quickly and without a hitch.  </li>
            <li> Cuts quick and close.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I called the company and they quickly sent out a replacement part immediately and at no cost to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned with some of the on/off switch complaints people had, but they all seemed to be resolved quickly by the company.</li>
            <li> I have used a one with a similar tip for many years but this one seems to cut more hairs in a shorter time.  </li>
            <li> OUt of the 7 different nose trimmer products I have purchased, this bar none is the best nose and facial hair trimmer!!!!</li>
            <li> I am more than satisfied with the purchase and will likely shop this brand again.</li>
            <li> The construction is solid, the light is nice, the blades work and cut hair, but it doesn&#x27;t cut close.  </li>
            <li> Nose hair is taken care of quickly and effeciantly.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer feels like a quality product.  </li>
            <li> I started using it and quickly noticed a brown goo building up in my nose.  </li>
            <li> It fast and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, he has been very pleasantly surprised with the ease of use and cleaning of it...and most importantly, the reliability of it.  </li>
            <li> As I grow older, I find more unwanted all the time.</li>
            <li> By the time I got to this guy, I wanted a trimmer that focuses on nose hair trimming -- not other stuff that sounds nice</li>
            <li> This one does, and the little light is very handy.  </li>
            <li> The folks at Toilet Tree Products sent me a FREE replacement blade assembly AND a FREE replacement blade assembly housing!!</li>
            <li> The trim head is very gentle but accurate.  </li>
            <li> So highly recommend to anyone with more hair in your nose than on your head.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend :-)</li>
            <li> High quality build and works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I chose this trimmer because of the many high ratings.  </li>
            <li> though it does the job, my husband complains it gets very hot so quickly.</li>
            <li> It works very well, the only problem I have with it is its very noisy, other wise its a excellent product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a little stubble somewhere, but next to filling my nose with Nair, I think that this is the best that it&#x27;s going to get.  </li>
            <li> cut hairs efficiently, very satisfied once I got the back cap to stay in place to engage the battery.</li>
            <li> My ears are smooth and hair-free for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing sharp and safe</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast!</li>
            <li> It can be used in the shower and is easy to clean, just pop off the top and rinse it out, then pop it back on.  </li>
            <li> The tip gets very hot.</li>
            <li> Looks also pretty maintenance free as well.</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this trimmer from ToiletTree Products and I am very pleased with the quality of it.  </li>
            <li> The light didn&#x27;t do much for me, but it also isn&#x27;t like it adds anything significant to the cost either.  </li>
            <li> It is a quality product  but would be even better with a bigger, more powerful electric motor.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is sturdy, well made, and does an incredible job at a task not many want to talk about.</li>
            <li> This product is, by far, the most durable, powerful trimmer available.  </li>
            <li> but I found it&#x27;s also good for trimming my mustache and long hairs around my mouth and chin.  </li>
            <li> Large, but easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Works great, no bogging down.</li>
            <li> Glad I found you Toilet Tree:)</li>
            <li> Works very well, pain free nose hair clean up.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job of trimming nose and ear hair ( a necessary job for us older folks.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied to finally get a nose trimmer that works very well!!  </li>
            <li> The product has a steel casing and appears to be solidly constructed, it&#x27;s easy to clean and service from the vendor was fast and courteous.</li>
            <li> High quality, great power, and quiet.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about the led light but it trims very well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love my new Toiletree Nose Hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I find your product very efficient and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> This device is so easy to use, and hey, it really works,</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is a superior design compared to the product I was using that has an attachment clip on head of many for that task or if that head just gave out in terms of sharpness</li>
            <li> This personal trimmer works very nicely at trimming those pesky nose and ear hairs that plague us older folks.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be more satisfied with this being my first time experience with ToiletTree Products, I will be back.</li>
            <li> First time in years I don&#x27;t have to look at the \\&quot;forest\\&quot; in his nose!</li>
            <li> AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
            <li> Prior to buying it, I had tried all sorts of razors for my nose hair but this one has been the most efficient in getting them out without sneezing and &amp;#34;snarling&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> It does remove hair with time - and heat - though I was hoping it would be more effective at removing hair so it would take less time.</li>
            <li> is easy it actually works better</li>
            <li> It cuts the hairs in the nose and around the ear quickly and painlessly, and the LED light is very helpful.</li>
            <li> And the tool is as I was looking for (and as it looks like): a pro instrument, solid, strong, elegant.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, simple and durable.</li>
            <li> The blades came off the first time I tried to clean it.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looked promising, but when I inserted the battery and turned it on, it sounded fine, but then it would not turn off.</li>
            <li> Very easy to control and very gentle and soft feeling when you are using it.</li>
            <li> Great little tool and safer than using scissors.</li>
            <li> what can I say great little product well maid</li>
            <li> This was great for a little over a year, but no longer works.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> This little tool works great.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, well made, and tough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud in the ear, but the quality of the cut is great!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because I feel the Panasonic one trimmed a little more precisely, but I&#x27;m totally happy with this one.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;It puts the Panasonic to shame.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the build is overtly superior and the head design is far more comfortable and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;A little pricier than the Panasonic</li>
            <li> and I really like the led light.</li>
            <li> The LED light is a real plus.</li>
            <li> The LED light is also very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Bonus is that the light really does help get the job done.</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer is equipped with  a built in led light that really helps the trimming process.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it functions quite smoothly and others...not so much.</li>
            <li> When I ordered, I really wan&#x27;t focused on the light.  </li>
            <li> I really like the light feature.</li>
            <li> Light is not too much help, though.  </li>
            <li> my husband loves the way it trims and the led light is very helpful</li>
            <li> the light is very helpfull.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few use and it didn&#x27;t do a great job anyway.  </li>
            <li> Led light really helps.</li>
            <li> Powerful and works well</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; solid.</li>
            <li> Nice solid unit.  </li>
            <li> but I still wanted an idea of how powerful the motor was</li>
            <li> Much better than the last cheap thing I had.  </li>
            <li> Much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> Effective and quiet.  </li>
            <li> Looks good but doesn&#x27;t do the job as expected</li>
            <li> did a better job than my old clipper.</li>
            <li> Have only used it twice,but so far it&#x27;s great and no hair pulling.</li>
            <li> The battery was fresh and inserted correctly.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The professional water resistant heavy duty steel nose-ear hair trimmer performs flawlessly, with a lifetime guarantee</li>
            <li> So worth it works as advertised worth every penny</li>
            <li> I have used my nose hair trimmer just once so far and it work better then</li>
            <li> Seem powerful when I turn it on.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is as good as expected.</li>
            <li> So far after three weeks, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> If only all companies had this kind of customer service.</li>
            <li> Nice job on the regular spots (nose and ears).</li>
            <li> This item is really worth your time and money.</li>
            <li> This is far better.</li>
            <li> This clipper is far better than the one I had.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be a test of time to see if it can work for the forseeable future, but that said, so far I am happy.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> He continues to use it, so well worth the money.</li>
            <li> That is the only nice thing that can be said about the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, I bought Panasonic&#x27;s newest model of the same model I had.  </li>
            <li> Worth the investment for what it is.</li>
            <li> Nice to have one of these that seems like it will last, not be replaced in three months.</li>
            <li> Nice, solid feel.</li>
            <li> It would be wonderful if all companies stood behind their merchandise like this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I replaced my old one with it.</li>
            <li> I like the product and there is nothing wrong with it, a good product and a good price...</li>
            <li> in need of a useful gift this Holiday</li>
            <li> may cost a bit more  [and really not that much more]  </li>
            <li> and then the fun started.</li>
            <li> I feel I got my moneys worth</li>
            <li> It may not come with battery but is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> my former trimmer did not trim the nose hairs as effectively.  </li>
            <li> Feels nice and solid.</li>
            <li> I used to laugh at products like this.  </li>
            <li> My favorite so far.</li>
            <li> So far - am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it about a week, but so far, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it is useful.  </li>
            <li> One has to be careful with these things, but a good product nonetheless.</li>
            <li> but it was not cutting it.</li>
            <li> Well worth my money.</li>
            <li> So far, love it.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a sturdy powerful trimmer that could handle the rigors of traveling for work.</li>
            <li> As for trimming that &#x27;female&#x27; cheeky peach fuzz, it&#x27;s not quite as EASILY effective - hence the *</li>
            <li> Followed directions, used a fresh battery, but motor doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Well worth</li>
            <li> I have had no problem with the battery or anything else that others might have mentioned, I can only speak to my own experience.</li>
            <li> The warranty makes the purchase worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear and the trimmer is easy to take apart and clean.</li>
            <li> Seems to cut more efficiently and painlessly and the light is a definite advantage for seeing nasal hairs</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Simple to replace battery and the blades are effective at removing unwanted hair without removing wanted flesh.</li>
            <li> Rotating head gets a bit warm after awhile, but not enough to cause any discomfort or alarm.</li>
            <li> , my nose hairs are now nice and short</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Best nose clipper in the game.</li>
            <li> my wife do the trimming it would be useful.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool trimmer.  </li>
            <li> But I thought with that many problems with the switches that they would have it fixed by now.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a superior product that actually does what it&#x27;s meant to do and lives up to the claims made by the manufacturer!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this one is worth it.</li>
            <li> Not even worth 1 star</li>
            <li> This trimmer feels high quality and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> High blade speed, relatively easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice little tool.  </li>
            <li> Very Handy little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Better than most due to the Steel Casing.  </li>
            <li> trimmer itself works fine, I like the aluminum handle, and decent customer service.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great, I tried other ones and was very dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And like other aging men, what I lose on top, reappears magically out my ears and nose.</li>
            <li> The trimmer cuts quickly with no hair pulling, and the power remains consistent at all times.</li>
            <li> The item was received quickly and appears at first use to be just what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li> The tip gets very warm after a few minutes of use</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly and easily I trimmed hairs off my nose and ears without any pain.</li>
            <li> Great little item, does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> My fiance has been needing a nose hair trimmer for quite a while - he was a little nervous about using this, but he after the first use, he thought it was great.</li>
            <li> Also other trimmers don&#x27;t do a good job -</li>
            <li> I have used two other brands which did not do a good job.</li>
            <li> Given the build quality I&#x27;m fairly sure it will last a good long while and stay functional.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the on/off switch, which feels cheap and will most likely be the first thing to break on the unit.</li>
            <li> These are fast, efficient and painless—a real first for same-purpose products purchased over the years.  </li>
            <li> The little LED light is handy if you want to take a quick peek up there to see if everything looks clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didnt work right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Shipping was right on time.  </li>
            <li> It cuts right through and there is no pulling.</li>
            <li> Had to play with it a bit to get the contacts right and get the unit to turn on.  </li>
            <li> Switch did not shut off right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I put the batteries in and the unit went right on...and wouldn&#x27;t turn off unless you took the batteries out.</li>
            <li> and so do you if you&#x27;re here, am I right?</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly right out of the box.</li>
            <li> and you has to be on the right plane to cut the hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The one thing I did notice right away was that this trimmer did pull any of the hairs your were trying to use it....</li>
            <li> I tried it out right away</li>
            <li> I noticed right away</li>
            <li> Works well and shipped out right on time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just that right out of the box the on/off switch does not work</li>
            <li> This thing trims to just the right length.  </li>
            <li> The product works well and seems to do the job just right.</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> But that crappy design on the battery cover has this problem built right in...</li>
            <li> However, I reserve the right to revisit my review if it deteriorates after a 12 month</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about the problem with the on off switch not working right out of the box.</li>
            <li> This nose trimmer works very well and is pretty accurate,</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic stopped working after a few years despite me taking perfect care of it, so I ordered this one and am very pleased so far - it seems better constructed and trims with less vibration.</li>
            <li> Toilet tree products are nice and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the fantastic reviews on Amazon and in particular the evidence of ToiletTree&#x27;s commitment to quality customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> His nose is clean as a whistle, thanks to the ToiletTree trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great little tool!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and quiet while using.  </li>
            <li> Paid the high price because I wanted something that would outlast cheap trimmers.  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for 17 bucks, but the light feature intrigued me.</li>
            <li> and I have bought a lot of these before this really does a great job of trimming unwanted hair and seems to be very sharp.</li>
            <li> Works very well for special grooming needs.  </li>
            <li> He says it feels like its better made than previous one he had, that cost more.</li>
            <li> It is more substantial and works better than my previous trimmers.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised; Strongly recommend purchasing this item rather than buying a cheap model from one of local discount stores!</li>
            <li> Sharp, easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally dropped the blade piece from the top nozzle down my drain, and after emailing the vender, I was swiftly sent a new top piece at no charge!</li>
            <li> the LED light is a great plus...very useful in a poorly lit bathroom.</li>
            <li> Glad I selected this one, a few $ more but worth it.</li>
            <li> Just got it so not sure about longevity, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, clean and the best part--no painful pulling of nose/ear hairs.  </li>
            <li> Small and great for traveling.  </li>
            <li> I like the little led light built in to the trimmer very comfortable to hold clean up</li>
            <li> and it certainly appears to be better made than most other trimmers.</li>
            <li> ToiletTree is a much studier product, and it got my nose completely clean the first time with no pulled hairs.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is the best I have ever owned, right up until the time I tried to pull the protective cap off to use it and the entire trimmer pulled apart destroying itself in the process.</li>
            <li> ToiletTree&#x27;s professional nose and facial hair trimmer does the job very nicely and doesn&#x27;t cause any pain when trimming nose hair like some other popular and well-known electric trimmers.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all i could say about this product, doesn&#x27;t hurt feels premium and has a handy little light too.</li>
            <li> You may charge little more money and sell a better product.</li>
            <li> I should know better, spend a little more and get quality, or get use to the fed x man coming for a  return.</li>
            <li> It is a great little trimmer and much quieter than others that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality, works okay, and the light is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy my new one.</li>
            <li> the company responded to our report asap &amp; is shipping us a new one free.</li>
            <li> Mr. Parisi got in touch with me and asked if I would like a new trimmer free of charge to try out.</li>
            <li> Very efficient, though I don&#x27;t see much use for the light.</li>
            <li> just received it last week but so far seems to be a good purchase</li>
            <li> I was also able to clean it better knowing it was at least water resistant.  </li>
            <li> and, this design and brand seems to be the best; at least, so far.</li>
            <li> Have bought many cheaper versions and this one is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> also found this one to be more powerful than my Panasonics although both use the same size battery</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solidly built and not cheap in quality and it works great!  </li>
            <li> It truly is painless, or at least so far, LOL!  </li>
            <li> Its easy to remove the tip for cleaning and also has a clear cap to protect it</li>
            <li> With a lifetime Guarantee I got a great trimmer with no concerns for possible future problems.</li>
            <li> Simple to use simple to clean and good battery life.</li>
            <li> Only had it a month, but, so far so good.</li>
            <li> The led light is OK,  but not really needed.</li>
            <li> After using two or three previous trimmers I found the ToiletTree superior.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, smooth running (I&#x27;ve found most cheap ones vibrate quite a bit, never really noticed that till I tried this one) and well built, not a single pulled hair so far and the built in led lights is a very nice addition.</li>
            <li> The LED light is a huge plus feature that I didn&#x27;t give a second thought too when I first ordered these.</li>
            <li> Other than that I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, pretty solid.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy product and the light actually works better than other brands with lights that I have own.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking it was going to be far superior to and more heavy duty than other trimmers I have owned and still own</li>
            <li> Came super fast, was exactly what I wanted, and my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for almost 2 months now and like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, well built product!</li>
            <li> Does the job for which is is intended and the delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and quiet.  </li>
            <li> Trimming is very fast and thorough.</li>
            <li> Very high quality &amp; gets the job done without any pain!</li>
            <li> Like the nose trimmer very much.</li>
            <li> did contact their customer support for a question not related to the performance of the item since I rely on my own self experience for that, needless to say though, their Customer support were absolutely courteous, kind</li>
            <li> So far it works fine</li>
            <li> So far the trimmer is working fine</li>
            <li> Better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried that are built cheap and fall apart after time.</li>
            <li> It works well, no pinching, and the light (unlike many other nose trimmers) is helpful.</li>
            <li> It cuts fine so far...</li>
            <li> comfortable to use and works better than any other product of its type we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It works very effectively and appears much more well built and substantial than similar products I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> so I was a little leery about buying it, but the reviews were good</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it is completely painless, which was my main reason for selecting this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The light is bright and useful, the body is well built and seems sturdy, and the tip seems sharp enough to tackle a nose hair jungle.</li>
            <li> No more visible growth peeking out, but better yet, everything \\&quot;up there\\&quot; felt smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> While the little led light is lacking in usefulness, I find the trimmer to be great overall.</li>
            <li> Only used twice so far but being Metal it feels very secure and easy to handle, cuts very well</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get quite close enough but works okay otherwise</li>
            <li> The pitiful screeching, grinding and garbage disposal noises made me think that nothing short of a chainsaw would be able to cut them trees.</li>
            <li> (I dropped the first one on the bathroom floor and it broke, so.....not anyone&#x27;s fault but mine.)</li>
            <li> I have had it for several months, and used it many</li>
            <li> Ordered and received exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Yes, I might be able to open the drain trap and find it, but</li>
            <li> works exactly as advertized</li>
            <li> Frankly, I&#x27;ve gone through so many of these things (embarrassingly enough) over the years</li>
            <li> Well built, solid product, much better than cheaper plastic imitations.</li>
            <li> Gave it four stars because like others have said it does get hot if I have it running for a while.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written</li>
            <li> Does exactly what you want it to do</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well on the hairs inside my ears, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Sharper Image we had been using for years Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love it and made to last.</li>
            <li> Buy this one, it met expectations - it has the feel of quality, not like that Panasonic one that only lasted 3 times and felt cheaply made!</li>
            <li> We have had it 8-months and still operating off the first battery we put in it.</li>
            <li> , first off, it wouldn&#x27;t shut off unless I removed the battery.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this product, from the first day I received it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: Seller contacted me and sent me a free replacement, which has been working well so far.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this newer and much more solid trimmer</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this device for trimming with out any discomfort!!</li>
            <li> First nose trimmer I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> and I expect it will last for many years.  </li>
            <li> Up to now, each one was a bit better than the last</li>
            <li> It did not come with a lubricating oil; many such products do come with a lubricating</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s just the first time</li>
            <li> Also note it runs much better off a standard Kirkland Alkaline battery than Eneloop rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> others have mentioned, it is a truly painless no-pull trimmer, that is pretty fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, so hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is EXACTLY what I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really one of those products that deserves 5+ stars!</li>
            <li> Looked to be exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I use it regularly and think it is the best on the market -- and especially for the substantially low price.</li>
            <li> Though I have only used it one time, I feel like it will be around and in working order for many years.</li>
            <li> Love the LED light near the tip, makes the product above all the rest!!</li>
            <li> For a device that should be so simple, many nose hair trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it should do and what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My husband has only used the nose and ear hair trimmer once, but he was quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad we finally found one that works!</li>
            <li> should have left it off and reduced the SRP even more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please, for the love of mercy, DO NOT USE these trimmers for facial hair and expect them to work well.</li>
            <li> I can tell you I&#x27;ve gone in the ear and nose canal like I would with scissors and haven&#x27;t had the first pull or &amp;#34;mishap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This one is a very sturdy and useful trimmer</li>
            <li> and I love finally getting a product that I can use.</li>
            <li> While being used in this manner, the motor&#x27;s energy transmitted to the spinning blade tends to make the slotted tip quite hot to touch - and you can feel it get hot in your nostril.  </li>
            <li> Not the greatest, but better than all the other weak s## out there.  </li>
            <li> This was not my first trimmer.</li>
            <li> Its also pretty compact compared to others I have seen in store.</li>
            <li> Suggest might need Lithium batteries to get better power and longer last.</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so much better then all the last ones we had.</li>
            <li> Performs with consistent results every time.  </li>
            <li> This really is a very well thought out and useful trimmer.</li>
            <li> Wipe it well before the first use, run it, wipe, run it, wipe.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many nose hair trimmers I have purchased, only to be thrown into the trash after a couple weeks use;  </li>
            <li> I must admit that I&#x27;ve been doing my best to test this thing as rigorously as possible because I wanted to be able to return it to Amazon if it failed like all the others.  </li>
            <li> The first trimmer I ordered would not turn off without removing the batteries.</li>
            <li> Trimmer gets hot immediately.</li>
            <li> i first ordered this, amazon used it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> WELL THE FIRST TOME</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer that has worked.  </li>
            <li> From the first time I used it, it preformed.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what its suppose to do.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if you can change the number of stars after first review</li>
            <li> It gets extremely hot during use.</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic product and be assured that I will recommend Professional Water Resistant Trimmer to my friends and family.  </li>
            <li> First step is admitting you have a problem.</li>
            <li> I had so many different trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This also leads to what appears to be a much higher RPM.  </li>
            <li> This one stands above most for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great gift for a man in his late 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t much use for the light, but it illuminates very well.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer is exactly what I wanted and is as described on the Amazon site.</li>
            <li> But it by no means gets hot, and I guess some could find the warmth soothing.</li>
            <li> My first nose electric trimmer</li>
            <li> I had my first one for a few years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Works as advertised and have no issues in first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It really does work well!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very well built!</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> Opened the box, pulled it out, put batteries in it and could not get the top back on.</li>
            <li> Exactly what he was looking for.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic he purchased prior to this was much better.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, works really well.</li>
            <li> It broke during the first use.  </li>
            <li> Works very well on unwanted hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall its an outstanding product and at an unbelievably cheap price, so even if it did break on me in the near future</li>
            <li> Well made works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Is has a heavy duty feel: it is easy to clean and I like its free standing design..</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great at keeping my thick mane of nosehair at bay.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced the power switch issues others have complained about, but I would have to say that the power switch does appear to be the weakest point in quality, just judging from the feel.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> Higher quality that any others trimmer</li>
            <li> They work very well!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I received my nose hair and facial trimmer from ToiletreeProducts a while ago and was extremely pleased at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> The product did fail again, but I&#x27;m so impressed with the service of the company, that I feel</li>
            <li> Although I did has some issues my initial unit, the performance of this unit is so outstanding along with excelent Customer service</li>
            <li> Thanks ToiletTree!</li>
            <li> Very prompt response!  </li>
            <li> Have to do it several times to be satisfied</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It works well, better than my last one.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for much else!</li>
            <li> We had an issue with the first trimmer, but was promptly promised a replacement by ToileTree Products.</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t imagine ToileTree so willingly offering a replacement if they didn&#x27;t have confidence in their product.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It really does the job!</li>
            <li> It is exactly how it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> the light is an unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li> Fast, painless, and powerful.</li>
            <li> I gave it its first test on my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that it will also last longer than most.</li>
            <li> exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is the first nose trimmer I&#x27;ve used, so I had no idea what to expect.  </li>
            <li> This product from ToiletTree will not disappoint ;)</li>
            <li> This is the second  trimmer that we&#x27;ve purchased and we will be buying more as birthdays and Christmas come along  Fred D. Barton</li>
            <li> Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since purchased a second one for my brother-in-law knowing there isn&#x27;t a better choice</li>
            <li> but it appears to be much better made than anything I could have purchased locally.</li>
            <li> This trimmer really works!</li>
            <li> So much better than a regular trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received the trimmer and tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product that does exactly what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> So glad I researched the product and made the obvious correct choice.</li>
            <li> Simply works okay.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My first nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> what more can one expect from a simple ear/nose trimmer?  </li>
            <li> i have had a few and they weren&#x27;t much good but at wasting time.</li>
            <li> Assuming it lasts a few years, this is a really good trimmer.</li>
            <li> : so as you&#x27;ll see in the comments, the company was nice enough to contact me and offer to ship me a new unit.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, surgical, quick and quiet.  </li>
            <li> its well made, trims nose and ear hair quickly and painless,and the LED light is a big plus..</li>
            <li> I tried a manual one (didn’t work, only caused pain), an electric one by Panasonic (inconsistent speed) and another cheap one (quickly quit working).</li>
            <li> This unit is very easy to clean and is one of the few that I know of that comes with a cleaning brush (although I must admit that I have not opened the packages of all the others).  </li>
            <li> Very solidly-built and very smooth and quiet operation.  </li>
            <li> The phone answering system only talks about special offers and seems to be more of a marketing pitch.  </li>
            <li> It is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried because it doesn&#x27;t pull or cause annoying pain, it&#x27;s pretty quiet, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and, to my surprise, the light is actually a very useful feature.  </li>
            <li> It even has a little light for you to see better.</li>
            <li> The little light seems to be a gimmick more than anything.</li>
            <li> Well, I only had one similar gadget and this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li> one of the better products in this category, previous comments helped me choose this and am not disappointed at all</li>
            <li> Both nostrils are now as clear and clean as a trumpet&#x27;s bell.</li>
            <li> trimmer?).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, pleased with the Toilet Tree trimmer.</li>
            <li> clean and runs and sounds like a professional model.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> While the LED light isn&#x27;t essential, I did find it useful.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It DOES quickly trap and burn nose hair inside creating a foul smell that you have to clean up regularly</li>
            <li> I have tried several facial hair trimmers over the years but none nearly as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used it twice but am thrilled with the results...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s never enough light to be useful.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;stainless&amp;#34; is more &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; than actual stainless construction.  </li>
            <li> design, functionality overall is good for the money---the issue seems to be with the QC of their Chinese manufacturing process.</li>
            <li> Has a good solid feel to it which makes me believe it should last.</li>
            <li> but since it does such a good once it is running I can put up with the occasional hitting it to get it to start</li>
            <li> I highly recommended and after the first use you will feel like you did make the right choice in purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> This gets very close, very fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for the quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Finally I&#x27;ve found the product to clean me up!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad my old one finally broke down because I didn&#x27;t know what a good trimmer was</li>
            <li> This thing is tough, easier to hold, does a better job, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty quiet and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews, so I decided to order this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Switch has a positive on off function.</li>
            <li> Great for nose, not good for ears or eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It may cost a bit more than other trimmers but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> price of this device is reasonable and not expensive towards its quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Had a different model that used to tweak and pull, but then it&#x27;s now over 10 years old and finally found a really great product.  </li>
            <li> The motor in this unit appears to spin at a much higher rate than the one in the Panasonic did, which may account for much of the improved performance.</li>
            <li> What can you say, it is pretty much a necessity.</li>
            <li> Solidly built, not too loud, and provides the closest trim I&#x27;ve ever experienced with such a product.</li>
            <li> Great Quality compared to other similarly priced trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I would say it gets most hair but cannot tackle the really long ones.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed after removing the item from its packaging was that is not made of plastic and is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> It feels very sturdy and well-made, and it works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> It consist of metal, stainless steel to be exact, or maybe aluminum, idk.</li>
            <li> Have used a few other brands before, but this is the best.</li>
            <li> Seems more powerful than other brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like being in a dark mine with a headlamp -- you never know what you&#x27;ll run into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have literally tried about 20 other brands, options, and none of them have lasted....</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of times so far, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found much use for the LED light other than to use it to look up my nostrils to admire the fine workmanship it provides.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product but feel it runs a little slow and would work better with a faster/more powerful motor in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Cleaned those nostrils right out to the point I could actually breath more clearly.</li>
            <li> I have tried many similar nose hair trimmer over the years and would rate this one overall near the top.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, much better than last trimmer</li>
            <li> I have gone through several of the Panasonic (top rated) as well as a number of others that were also highly touted.  </li>
            <li> These really do mow it down on the first pass and don&#x27;t pull the hairs, with easy clean up.  </li>
            <li> Compared to many other trimmers, this one actually seems to work, and work quite well, for many months.</li>
            <li> This is my first nose hair trimmer, and other than the fact that I now feel like an old man for owning a nose hair trimmer, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hear the same sound with these, which made me wonder if it was doing the job, but upon close inspection, it seems to mow right through without making the same sound.</li>
            <li> Great Little Trimmer For The Money !!!</li>
            <li> Only uses one battery and easy to change.</li>
            <li> Makes the chore of cleaning up those unsightly hairs simple and easy.</li>
            <li> easy to use,precision and simple clean-up, everything clicks into place;well-engineered!I&#x27;ve used nose/ear cleaner since 1965 and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, quiet, and trims closely.</li>
            <li> The diameter of this product is larger so it makes it easy to hold and adjust in your hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no hair pinching and simply....</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t strong  enough power to do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll report back if I have any problems, but I&#x27;m hopeful that this will be a keeper for a good long time.</li>
            <li> They offered a new unit to try out and, since I had already sent my original purchase back too Amazon and received a full refund, I agreed.</li>
            <li> He uses hearing aids and the large amount of ear hair he grows interferes with their use.  </li>
            <li> have ALS, so the large diameter makes it easier to hold.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I certainly would recommend it.</li>
            <li> certainly consider buying from them again.  </li>
            <li> This is a great, durable replacement for those trimmers that last a few days / weeks, making you wonder why you ever bothered to get them in the first place.  </li>
            <li> The motor is much stronger than the competing &amp;#34;best-rated&amp;#34; trimmers I have used and it seems to be of a quality that will actually last a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of them loose the power after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> First one that arrived didn&#x27;t work, but they immediately sent me a new one to replace it!</li>
            <li> had this for months now and still works fine, the little light is helpful.</li>
            <li> Pulled nose hair a little bit but not horribly bad but other than that it worked great.  </li>
            <li> Only used it once, but seems to work just fine</li>
            <li> For a relatively low cost trimmer, this product does just fine.</li>
            <li> Build very strong, sharp and does better than the last 10 I have owned, by far.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old Panasonic at reaching tight corners in ears.</li>
            <li> Even though it is a bit more expensive that others, I am very willing to spend a bit more to get the quality I am seeking.  </li>
            <li> Does tend to get a little warm the longer it runs.</li>
            <li> Just a nice, compact, well designed little product that gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> He said this little guy does the trick nicely.</li>
            <li> This is the second Toilet Tree Product we have bought and we are very pleased with all of them.</li>
            <li> Great nose trimmer so far, seems well built, better than some of the other trimmers that I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> one more thing, don&#x27;t expect this (or any other trimmer known to man) to last more than a year with normal use.</li>
            <li> Motor seems strong, cuts cleanly--much much better than the cheap Wahl trimmer I bought at our local big box store (the Wahl jammed up after 15 seconds use, so I just pitched it--who wants to return a used nose hair</li>
            <li> I am happy and  it gets the  job done, the only thing is that you have push a little deeper in your nose.</li>
            <li> It even has a little light to shine on where you want to trim, if that&#x27;s important for you.</li>
            <li> The only difference is that it looks a little more substantial and holds better in your hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light is kind of useless, but as far as the nose trimmer, it seems more sturdy and seems to have better blades than the little 9.99 ones I used to buy from Norelco and Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product due to all the positive reviews and initially after receiving I loved it.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to wince as I began trimming, however I only heard the sound of the trimmer…</li>
            <li> The RPM&#x27;s are fast, quiet, smooth and efficient.  </li>
            <li> We really like the product, especially the added feature of the light.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty design to last and trims great.</li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t as bright as I had hoped, but as I mentioned, I&#x27;m nearly blind.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be more powerful or heavy duty as it states.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and the LED light is brilliantly fantastic.</li>
            <li> , one is none thanks.</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> Appears to be very well built</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times, and I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> This works as well as units that cost three times as much.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I hope there is a legal stipulation that does not allow companies to mail/fedex/ups batteries.  </li>
            <li> Bummer, really...</li>
            <li> The LED light is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Must purchase of you need one that really works.</li>
            <li> The light is a definite plus.  </li>
            <li> Since it is an LED light there is relatively no battery drain whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> The LED light is a big plus.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Have had trimmers in this style that did not cut the hairs, but this one does very well, no discomfort.</li>
            <li> Thanks ToiletTree.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my Father and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Seems like a quality item, and works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a month now and really like it.  </li>
            <li> This is four star quality (feels cheap) and there are identical trimmers with different brand names.</li>
            <li> My husband has a bigger nose and thinks the light is beneficial.</li>
            <li> However, I adjusted my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because the LED light is starting to flicker.</li>
            <li> He has always had an abundance of hair in the nose and just one time into the nose and it really cleaned it up.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> He is very picky about trimmers, etc.</li>
            <li> I like this unit and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Very simple to use and is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Better than i expected.</li>
            <li> Fast.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and efficient, painless too.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is made very well for the price .</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product and this vendor.</li>
            <li> The light is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Thanks ToiletTree Products.</li>
            <li> This appears to be a very well made product.  </li>
            <li> the way done when I realized that it just wasn&#x27;t bugging me at all, even though my face and whole body was tightened up fully expecting pain.  </li>
            <li> It cut the hairs much closer.  </li>
            <li> It cut the hairs much closer.  </li>
            <li> I did not use the blue light to help with visibility while using it.</li>
            <li> Others may find it very helpful.</li>
            <li> The instructions with this one are much improved as well.</li>
            <li> I suppose it would be convenient if you used it on someone else, but who wants to do that?</li>
            <li> This product works very well</li>
            <li> Thus far, it seems to be worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The product was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> It appears to be constructed in a very sturdy manner.</li>
            <li> WHO WANTS TO LOOK AT THAT?!?&lt;br</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t use light, cut by sound), and the cutting head with blade is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> That is high praise from this man!  </li>
            <li> That really makes all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The method of cleaning is reasonable and not difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> but then once a week I would twist off protective cover and the whole trimmer would fall apart.</li>
            <li> I especially like the light.</li>
            <li> The product is intuitive to use and really cuts through the hair without any problems.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer its AA-cell battery operation to the inconvenience of having to accommodate a(nother) recharging station.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Fast  delivery.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> , if only they&#x27;d invent a trimmer I could use in my ears that didn&#x27;t sound like an armored division grinding up a steep hill.</li>
            <li> It does the job fast and well, no nicks</li>
            <li> I wanted a trimmer I don&#x27;t have to spend time on and does the job well and fast - this one does it</li>
            <li> Vendor was very prompt with delivery.</li>
            <li> They proudly stand behind their products.  </li>
            <li> then the light just shines on the outside of your nose.</li>
            <li> Used if a couple of times and it seems to perform very well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like to talk about my nose hair.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of pesky hairs fast</li>
            <li> I get that one gets what one pays for, but I actually spent 5 bucks more on this item (vs. comparable items at Amazon).</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> The light was especially helpful.</li>
            <li> but it really does the job.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really need, like sideburns or eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Performs very well.</li>
            <li> and it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li> As described and very well built.</li>
            <li> one thing for me is that it is very bulky in the hand.</li>
            <li> I sent an email to the company and very rapidly received a response from the company president.  </li>
            <li> The built in light helps a man to see how deep the forest has become and is</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it does it very well.</li>
            <li> so much so, I can say, that I was quite leery about purchasing this one.</li>
            <li> Thanks a million...</li>
            <li> I just threw the whole thing away as I had discarded the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> husband really loves the water resistant feature.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are very cryptic and are of no help.  </li>
            <li> Others I&#x27;ve had were lighter and seemed flimsy and didn&#x27;t trim nose hair very well.</li>
            <li> WILL CONTINUE TO BUY AND READILY ENDORSE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> this one has been very dependable and doesn&#x27;t just yank out the hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t cut very well</li>
            <li> Trims ear and nose hairs very efficiently.  </li>
            <li> this trimmer has a plastic tip, i thought it was supposed to have a stainless steel tip.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend buying this product (and recommend buying from this seller)!</li>
            <li> IT WORKS VERY WELL</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> Very thorough in its hair removal.</li>
            <li> thanks.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Of course the real test will be to see how well it holds up over time</li>
            <li> It does NOT hurt or pull hairs in any way.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer feels very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this model!</li>
            <li> just got this, works really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to be of very sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this works.</li>
            <li> Works well and fast gets the job done</li>
            <li> Packaged very well, not over done, but protected the trimmer.</li>
            <li> thanks for fast shipment</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves the way it handles and that it seems much sturdier than ones he has had before.</li>
            <li> I did not realize there could be that much difference between trimmers.</li>
            <li> All I know is people don&#x27;t stare at my face in disgust as much as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast delivery....works well.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Very well designed.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> so I just keep it in the bathroom at the ready..</li>
            <li> It is relatively silent, which is important for trimming the hairs in the outer ear.</li>
            <li> It works without pulling on the hairs, and still provides very close trimming.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> haha  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;instrument&amp;#34; is very well well made and is industrial strength.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product works well in the nose and reasonable well in the ears</li>
            <li> I especially like the directive light to aid in seeing detail.</li>
            <li> It felt like a quality product in my hand and did a really job of removing the nose hair.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and product arrived without a dent.</li>
            <li> Have used it once and really like it....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works very well for trimming where we don&#x27;t like to see hair coming from.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done fast and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> Product is well made and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I can not attest to all of the qualities/features advertised, but the bottom line is that this trimmer seems very durable</li>
            <li> The trimming blades are housed in a circular top so there&#x27;s not much exposed to nick or cut.  </li>
            <li> This unit is comfortable to use, well balanced and simply a terrific unit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really examine that space, nor care that much as it is an out-of-view place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve run through dozens of nose hair clippers through the years and this one really stands out.</li>
            <li> the whole mechanism locked up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always surprised by how powerful it feels/</li>
            <li> Sunlight really shows the hair you don&#x27;t see in the house, so I keep one in the car.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Paula</li>
            <li> Came fast.</li>
            <li> Looks very sleek.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with another Panasonic, which also never pulled a hair, but it wore out much much faster.</li>
            <li> but I do not use it that much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Light makes things so much easier and zip,</li>
            <li> It is quality workmanship at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and well-made - it&#x27;s holding up nicely to my 2 teen sons&#x27; and husband&#x27;s use, thus far (and they&#x27;re not exactly &#x27;gentle&#x27; with how they use things lol).</li>
            <li> It is a great relief to know there still are companies like this one that put out quality products and stand behind them.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But fortunately I have big hands.  </li>
            <li> Cleans up reasonably well.  </li>
            <li> cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Built very well, sturdy and well weighted in hand.</li>
            <li> The noise level is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how it much helps.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it does it very well.  </li>
            <li> Gr8 servicce, gr8 gproduct, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> and i can do this during a power outage now thanks to the built in light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10, would trim again.</li>
            <li> When turned off it seemed like it was really trying to turn off make a slower deeper noise.</li>
            <li> The thing works very well</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why the extra light...</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t turn on from the very moment I received it.</li>
            <li> Thanks. .</li>
            <li> heavy duty &amp; works like a charm &amp; the light is a nice extra feature...</li>
            <li> Does the job very well.</li>
            <li> Needs only 1 battery &amp; the spot light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had much luck with nose hair</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> He loves it, especially the light.</li>
            <li> Plastic end wears way to fast and refuses to shut now.</li>
            <li> It was an appreciated gift.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the mucous membranes of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> very short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very well made and trims</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Indeed this seems to be a very well built product.</li>
            <li> Much easier than plucking and painless.</li>
            <li> loses 1 star for an otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> I was devastated when I dropped and subsequently broke my old trimmer, but in retrospect, I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Few dollars more is worth.</li>
            <li> So far, now that i finally got this, it is working better than any nose trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From our experience with the scissors.... you have to try more, almost like a explorer, to find exactly the spot to &amp;#34;clip,&amp;#34; in THE DARK (maybe use a flash</li>
            <li> Seems far better than the crappy Panasonic cheaper ones I&#x27;ve purchased in recent years.</li>
            <li> I replaced my 15-year old Sharper Image trimmer that had served me well over many years, but finally broke.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty quiet, easy to position for hair removal, and so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> but that does not mean I recommend the item!</li>
            <li> Very quiet, cut hair quickly, worked exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Still pretty new to me, but it works well.</li>
            <li> To settle the matter I decided to buy an electric nose hair trimmer and found the Toilettree product based on some good experiences with other devices they make, and the low price.</li>
            <li> to clean and ready to go instantly.</li>
            <li> Seems to be of better quality than other models tried.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other trimmers I have tried.</li>
            <li> have tried many other brands online and from the market and bought&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item appears better constructed then other trimmers I have owned and works well.  </li>
            <li> Feels better than other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> I had an original Panasonic from almost 20 years ago that finally burned out.  </li>
            <li> It is made well and although I initially thought the LED light was strange, I now like the light.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Seems kind of flimsy, and the light is pretty useless for me, but it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Better than other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Instructions are simple and straightforward to follow (in case you&#x27;ve never used a nose hair/ear hair trimmer before).  </li>
            <li> Work so much better than the other one I have.  </li>
            <li> Gets the job done better than any other products tried.</li>
            <li> one looks most durable among other options at amazon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t check the other one, as I want to be able to return it for a refund.  </li>
            <li> High quality and light is added extra.</li>
            <li> It seems more hygienic than the other trimmers I have had that did not let you remove the actual trimmer to clean it throughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and to store, the cap fits tightly and is actually useful in protecting the head.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine, I hope it lasts a quarter as long as the lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li> Simply rotate the head, (coned area) use the included brush to clean all debris and then restore the head for use.</li>
            <li> No big deal really as I just run some cool water over it.</li>
            <li> Not sure that the light makes a huge difference</li>
            <li> I have used the trimmer about 4-5 times, and I really appreciate how much better constructed it is than the previous trimmer I had been using from a much wider known company.</li>
            <li> The first trimmer I have tried that didn&#x27;t just magically die after a few months.</li>
            <li> nose clean, so, that when the hair grows back, it doesn&#x27;t cut, or hurt you nostrils</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the light on the item is more of a gimmick than useful since it does not shine in the nose in any way that helps.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are made of high quality stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> Very well made, high quality trimmer.  </li>
            <li> We really like it, and we highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> ; I really think this is a high quality product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decently made and it is very simple to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> its small, travel friendly, has a light and NEVER cuts him (unlike scissors)</li>
            <li> It was simple, fast and completely pain free - which was my biggest concern having never used an electric nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li> The light feature isn&#x27;t needed and diminishes the battery life a bit but other than that it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised when I first tried this one.  </li>
            <li> sent it back and got a full refund.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but not sure yet how will hold up</li>
            <li> Trimmer wouldn&#x27;t work - sent it back for full refund.</li>
            <li> It is, by far the absolute winner!  </li>
            <li> Overall not bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Couple of major issues with this product - one, it didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Water Resistant Heavy Duty Steel Nose Trimmer does not cut the hairs quite as close as my older one did - however - the safety factor of not scratching the nasal tissue is worth the need to trim a bit more frequently.</li>
            <li> And...I&#x27;m an older woman (55) with dark hair and have been plagued with more nose hairs than ever before since menopause.  </li>
            <li> WAY better than sharp scissors in the nose or ear!</li>
            <li> Works better than any other nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve used!  </li>
            <li> It just does a better job than any other I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!</li>
            <li> I thought all trimmers were pretty much the same, but this much better than expected.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than the old trimmer I had; I&#x27;m glad the other one broke.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t do much about getting older and finding new hairs everywhere, but this trimmer reliably takes care of what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do a much better job than my previous nose hair remover.  </li>
            <li> It does not cut any better as a dollar store one nor does it make any less noise.</li>
            <li> I am sure the manufacturer will declare their defective rate is less than 1%</li>
            <li> The ToiletTree trimmer is better quality and cost half the price.</li>
            <li> It cuts the hairs close, safely and quickly, no pulling.  </li>
            <li> Works MUCH better than my previous one</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll stay with the nose trimmers that cost less and do a better job.</li>
            <li> Much better and sturdier than the product that I previously used.</li>
            <li> It feels solid, does an excellent job of a difficult task and inspires confidence that it will keep doing so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, efficient, light-weight and trims nose/ears hairs quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li> I replaced it with the smaller metal Groom Mate mechanical rotary trimmer which has actual rotary metal on metal blades and does a better job without the noise and battery.</li>
            <li> Clever name btw.</li>
            <li> However I was very dissapointed upon my first use to find out the &amp;#34; blade mechanism&amp;#34; is barely usable.</li>
            <li> It actually feels like you have something worthy in your hand.</li>
            <li> only suggestion I would change is the placement of the light, which doesn&#x27;t seem to shine directly on the area you are aiming for.</li>
            <li> Also the unit is super quiet .</li>
            <li> Yet to experience something unique.&lt;br /&gt;But steady.</li>
            <li> This is a decent quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> Some things are better left private, but sometimes you have to help people out.</li>
            <li> This particular nose-hair trimmer was well reviewed.  </li>
            <li> and the older</li>
            <li> as a woman getting older I was noticing nose hair and this did the trick.  </li>
            <li> For my use the light is unnecessary and just uses battery power, otherwise it is an ok unit.</li>
            <li> I have only used the clippers once, but they are quick and painless.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that this unit wouldn&#x27;t have decent power because it ran on batteries.</li>
            <li> this works better than any of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Arrived today whereupon I installed the battery only to quickly realize that the trimmer cannot be switched off--unless the battery is removed.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly and I&#x27;ve only used it once</li>
            <li> Purchased this mainly to use on hair around my ears, but works well on eyebrows &amp; nasal hair also.</li>
            <li> as I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li> It will get the job done whether you are male or female.  :)</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer mainly because of the product description and its durable look and waterproof feature.</li>
            <li> I was able to put the tip up against the skin inside of my nostril and actually apply pressure so that I got an extra close cut.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job and have never pinched the inside of my nose</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for an older device that quit working.  </li>
            <li> like that with a simple twist I can remove the top portion, run water through it, rinse it with soap and water, and put it back.</li>
            <li> oh, the joys of getting older.  </li>
            <li> As we seniors grow older we have lots of hair growing from our ears.  </li>
            <li> and it looks like it does a decent job .</li>
            <li> A decent product after a month of use.</li>
            <li> He certainly went the extra mile to ensure that customers felt that they had made the right choice.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;One of the main reasons I bought this particular model was the response from Toilettree whenever anybody reported a problem with their products.  </li>
            <li> only cons (just barely) are that it seems most effective when using multiple passes over the same area versus pushing it against the skin, but no big deal.  </li>
            <li> If a customer review had a complaint or a malfunction, there was a response within a day in most cases from the manufacturer trying to make it right.  </li>
            <li> I Wish the cap fit more tightly, it comes loose in the drawer all the time.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have to give 1 star because they made such a big deal about how it has a steel casing instead of cheap plastic, but of course it is cheap plastic, not steel, and made in China so definitely won&#x27;t last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact it has the feel of high quality instrument and not some plastic junk.  </li>
            <li> So we would highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> in a weird way, I&#x27;m happy the previous trimmer crapped out...:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two other trimmers - not this brand - and although I&#x27;ve just used this one twice so far, it is way, way better than what I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> It is truly solidly constructed, and is extremely efficient and effective.  </li>
            <li> Was not familiar with this brand but it works better than the name brand trimmers.</li>
            <li> I love the little LED light---great touch.</li>
            <li> If there was anything I wish was better, I wish it would cut a little closer.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and lasts much longer than the major brand models.</li>
            <li> After researching other nose trimmers going with this vendor was an easy choice.</li>
            <li> Strong, sharp, does not pull hair.</li>
            <li> Its easy to insert and remove the single AA battery, and it has plenty of power (not too loud either).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it even if you only rarely use it.  </li>
            <li> When removing the clear plastic cover, the head, where the blade is, easily gets loose.</li>
            <li> It looks conventional but works better than the many I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well for one time use so far.</li>
            <li> So far it has worked very well.</li>
            <li> Still works perfectly and most importantly, it never pulls out my nose hair in any painful way whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> The unit works very well, they must have fixed the switch issue.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had two competitor models in house that both died of old age and were not covered by any reasonable warranty.  </li>
            <li> ordered on Monday and received it Friday, So far trimmer working very well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> Works well, light not as helpful as expected</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these in a target store and have never had very much success.</li>
            <li> I thought it was normal that your eyes should water while trimming hair.</li>
            <li> The light seems kinda pointless, but I can see how it&#x27;d be useful.</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra cost over cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li> Came quick once ordered from Toilet Tree Products.</li>
            <li> Love it that it is water resistant and feels so heavy duty when you hold it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The same day I wrote this review, which I stand by 100%, the President of the company was kind enough to respond and offered a simple solution to my problem.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, powerful and well made</li>
            <li> You can tell by the way this is made, not cheap plastic like most of them, but</li>
            <li> and powerful enough so it DOESN&amp;#34;T stall and pull</li>
            <li> Hopefully Toiletree&#x27;s customer service sees this to make up for a waste of my time and money so I can update this review like many others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few others over the years and this one works better than any I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several nose/ear hair trimmers in the past and have thrown them all away after giving them fair trials.</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra bucks</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is powerful, yet simple.</li>
            <li> Solid trimmer, definitely worth the price that it comes for</li>
            <li> however i can say the trimmer is heavy and looks better than the trimmers i have used before...</li>
            <li> He claims he is hearing better and doesn&#x27;t have to keep reseating the hearing aids every few minutes.  </li>
            <li> First time purchasing such a product, so real alternative experience to compare it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice thick handle and does not smell as metallic as the others I had when trimming nose-hair.</li>
            <li> Think it might have been good if wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> Hands down better than my old Braun.</li>
            <li> other than that it works fine</li>
            <li> much better than the old one from Sharper Image and less $</li>
            <li> a dozen uses later still feeling strong on the same battery.</li>
            <li> It just plain sounds better than brand &amp;#34;W&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Looks like somebody finally did it right.</li>
            <li> I had a job interview the next day, so it came at just the right time.</li>
            <li> , I still love this nose trimmer even though I had to tape the top of the cone shaped cutting piece to the main body because the plastic grabs on the inside</li>
            <li> Solid metal casing, and it just does the job very efficiently and quietly, leaving everything nicely clean and closely cropped.</li>
            <li> The clear cap protects the blade from collecting dust, which is actually pretty smart yet simple.  </li>
            <li> Only used it a few times so far, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I fine is the cutter head heats up nothing bad but over all I give it a good 9.5 out of 10.</li>
            <li> I had never been comfortable sticking sharp sissors up my nose.</li>
            <li> I really like the little light.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This trimmer feels a little light when straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> The LED light was either on or off but not consistently on with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> We like the light and the trimmer did not pull the hairs like other trimmers we have used.  </li>
            <li> no hair pulling just plain old great cutting and nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery was unused brand new</li>
            <li> I put a new battery in it and could not get the cap on.</li>
            <li> I switched in new Amazon rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> Brand new batteries were used.</li>
            <li> So it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> I chose this new trimmer not because of the trimmer itself,  but because I was already sold on the company ToiletTree.  </li>
            <li> Get a new one every year if need be.</li>
            <li> My contention is that a customer should not have to do a backflip to make a new product work, but the fact this gentlemen took the time to correspond with a faceless customer deserves praise.</li>
            <li> and I thought they would just send me a new blade, but they sent me a brand new one.q</li>
            <li> It is brand new</li>
            <li> so I ordered a new one .</li>
            <li> In search of a new one, I decided to try this one by ToiletTree.  </li>
            <li> Powered trimmers have all but fallen off the map where I live.</li>
            <li> New batteries did not work, nothing.  </li>
            <li> The new trimmer arrived today and it even had a battery installed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always just used a sissors but this istaking it to a new level.</li>
            <li> and they send you a new blade or a new unit if need be.  </li>
            <li> After using my new trimmer, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product and its vendor.  </li>
            <li> Seeing my review on Amazon, Steve Parisi the President of ToiletTree, sent me a new nose trimmer at no cost to me.  </li>
            <li> I thought about buying a new one, figuring I just got a lemon.</li>
            <li> I tried my new trimmer</li>
            <li> and we will have a new unit shipped out at no charge.</li>
            <li> I grabbed a AA battery and put it in and the battery cover maybe because it is so new</li>
            <li> What else is new.</li>
            <li> however, I needed a new one &amp; decided to go with this product from ToiletTree Products....</li>
            <li> I called the customer service and they mailed me a new head within a day.</li>
            <li> i put a brand new battery and use it one time, i turned it off.</li>
            <li> i had to put another new battery.</li>
            <li> Contacted the manufacturer, they sent me a brand new one immediately.</li>
            <li> High quality, solid in structure, and works better than any other one I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Previous buyers reported problems installing the battery, but this was easy.</li>
            <li> I like it, but the light on the end is irrelevant and more of a nuisance than anything.</li>
            <li> By the end it would only run for a minute on a full battery, and it would barely get any</li>
            <li> The light would be better placed closer to the tip, but considering the way these trimmers are built that&#x27;d be rather difficult to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made very well and is very sturdy compared to others that I have purchased in recent years.  </li>
            <li> My husbands tried several different brands and none of them were cheap.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get in there as much as I anticipated, but its enough to get what needs to be gotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this little gadget!  </li>
            <li> Does a great job cutting hairs, the LED really does nothing, very dim and when using the nose trimmer up your nose</li>
            <li> The President of the company noticed my poor review and responded with a message, and, unprompted, sent a replacement, explaining that the warranty was through the seller, not the Mfg.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this after a few months, but color me satisfied with the outstanding customer service!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, the only sound I heard was the sweet sound of hair being cut and no pinching or pulling of any sort and the tickling sensation went away once I got use to it.  </li>
            <li> Very professional and sturdy and does its job.</li>
            <li> I think the round, rotating blade is much more efficient than the flat blades that so many other companies have on the market.  </li>
            <li> So...as soon as I broke my first one, I had no hesitation in ordering a second, new one.</li>
            <li> A friendly,  live,  English speaking human being answered the phone.  </li>
            <li> Oh, the 3rd one he wants to give to his best friend who he says needs it badly...</li>
            <li> If your significant other does not assault your lips....</li>
            <li> brought two, when I got the first one I purchased a second as a gift....</li>
            <li> WoW!</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> This products works as advertised, and it strikes me as being better made than similar products I&#x27;ve tried from other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> The reason I only gave it three stars is because with this trimmer I have to trim more often as it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as my other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Worked well at first, but only lasted about 9 months before it fell apart.  </li>
            <li> first examination, this nose trimmer looked solid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many trimmers in the past.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what I was looking for around my ears especially.  </li>
            <li> first unit shipped had not been quality checked carefully enough and had to be returned.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t nuts, I had three different people of various dexterity try to get it back on.</li>
            <li> This is the first such product I&#x27;ve owned, so I don&#x27;t have anything with which to compare it.  </li>
            <li> Battery cap would not securely go back on after first time being removed.  </li>
            <li> However, the first one DIED and it is in the box from this one for me to send back to you:  </li>
            <li> but its really no better than most others I&#x27;ve tried  hopefully the &amp;#34;lifetime&amp;#34</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> It might not have gotten hot enough to burn, but I didn&#x27;t wait to find out.  </li>
            <li> The blades cut through hairs on the first pass and this one is solidly built.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using such a product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i have any more nose hair than other men, but definitely have some to trim.</li>
            <li> We used to use a pair of small scissor (without a safe rounded tip....</li>
            <li> Being a married mom of 3 sons and 2 daughters, I was looking for a facial hair trimmer that we all could benefit from.</li>
            <li> + smaller LEDs consistently spaced versus one, non-helpful LED.  </li>
            <li> Better than anything I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I like the light if you need to trim in the dark</li>
            <li> first personal groomer that I like and works well</li>
            <li> This is my third trimmer and most of them simply dont have enough juice</li>
            <li> It has a little bulk and girth to it making it easy for us guys to handle.</li>
            <li> Little parts around the head easily fall out of place.  </li>
            <li> I had bought a Braun trimmer after I sent the original broken ToiletTree trimmer back and was some what satisfied with the  Braun until I received the new ToiletTree trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is also easier to clean inside than my last one, since you only have to remove one part.  </li>
            <li> Upon contact with my nose mane this trimmer reminded me of a Jedi Knight light saber taking down a Sith Lord.</li>
            <li> Long story short they sent me a new one free of charge.</li>
            <li> This trimmer allowed me to have a hairless nose without even a single tug strong enough to make me tear</li>
            <li> (many dark- AND light- complected females deal with this) -- the design featured a comb-like trimmer; which, when using, you&#x27;d just &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; down an area to get rid of the facial hair.</li>
            <li> Much heavier build quality than I expected, and so much better than the other two brands that I have had before, a Remington and a Wahl.</li>
            <li> It is far superior to any other nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried a few, including some of the best-reviewed here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I surprised they are sending me a new one it has been over a year</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very smooth and works well dry or wet with shave cream.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the best-selling cheap junk, I think this one will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This trimmer stopped working less than three months after purchase and light use (once a week).</li>
            <li> Heavy duty construction, trims ALL the hair in my nose VERY quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> Used this a couple of times and so far it seems to work better than others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> On top of that the lugs are way too small for the soft flexible plastic the manufacturer decided to use if they are going to go with the bayonet design.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this one were numerous and encouragingly positive</li>
            <li> ToiletTree seems like a terrific company determined to make a buyer&#x27;s experience a positive one.</li>
            <li> I tweeze the darker/thicker hairs which grow around that area, but I also have in the same area, fine soft blond hair which grows very long which I used to snip with scissors.  </li>
            <li> The very first time I closed the battery compartment cover after installing the battery a retaining tab broke off so that now I have to hold the cover on with tape in order to get the device to reliably operate.</li>
            <li> Appears to be a well made trimmer and does not painfully pull out hairs like other trimmers I have owned.</li>
            <li> No painful tugging on hairs like some of the other brands do from time to time.</li>
            <li> This was a bit pricier than I expected but the money was well worth it as it works much better than the cheaper versions that I have purchased and thrown out in the past.  </li>
            <li> I used my new Toilettree nose hair clipper the other day for the first time and it worked great, but unfortunately it would not shut off unless I loosened the battery.  </li>
            <li> Previously, for ears, I used my beard trimmer, but this instrument is not only easier but does a much better job.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as short as my previous Remington one perhaps because of a better guard system..</li>
            <li> If you would like a great trimmer, don&#x27;t settle for less and pay the few extra $$$.</li>
            <li> Toilet Tree sells high quality products that come with a LIFETIME REPLACEMENT WARRANTY!!</li>
            <li> I ended up removing the battery and twisting the cover on it a few times to break it in, i but the battery in and this time the cover went on fine.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t cut the hair as tight as my old $10 trimmer which I would&#x27;ve kept but the light quit working.</li>
            <li> Others of lower quality that I have purchased have only had a 90 day or 1 year warranty and certainly was not water resistant.</li>
            <li> I generally use it daily or every other day, just to keep on top of the situation.</li>
            <li> It does come with a little brush and I like the light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  my only other experience is with the small, manual, twist-type trimmer (that supposedly has great reviews)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need the little LED light.</li>
            <li> Came when expected was packaged properly and works fine,.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product is adequate for the job.</li>
            <li> plus the little light on the end is something i didn&#x27;t expect to really find helpful, but it actually is.</li>
            <li> I purchased a popular brand trimmer which lasted less than two weeks and simply stopped working for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> Takes care of those unwanted hairs better than any of the cheaper products that &amp;#34;claim&amp;#34; to do a good job, and I have tried a couple of the less expensive products!</li>
            <li> It does an amazing job without any  painful hair pulling that cheaply made trimmers do.</li>
            <li> 1/2 star for not so bright LED, and weird shape.</li>
            <li> Instructions clear.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s incredibly stupid that they put a light in these things (many manufacturers do) because you can never position it where it&#x27;s truly useful</li>
            <li> Until the tissue is clear.</li>
            <li> ToiletTree makes really great products despite their awful (but memorable) name.</li>
            <li> The trimer came before i expected and works better that expected.</li>
            <li> I will be buying another one to put away, as the old saying goes</li>
            <li> an extremly busy person amd was just going to forget this,  </li>
            <li> he likes the round rotation of it and the light that shows here the hairs are.  </li>
            <li> This unit arrived earlier than first posted, so I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Now to test it out for long term use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to give them as stocking stuffers to all my adult children.  </li>
            <li> There is a feel of quality to this unit that far exceeds any price difference.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer fixed that</li>
            <li> I have purchase several nose trimmers form drug stores over the years and found none of them really trimmed any hairs too well.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t trim very closely, required multiple passes.  </li>
            <li> This product is very well made; solid and dependable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 years/female and this last year have been having too much nose hair growth.</li>
            <li> Only had a few months, but; love it so far..</li>
            <li> and i was pleasantly surprised that he likes it.  </li>
            <li> so far, this has held together well unlike a couple of others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Far easier and faster than my old methods.</li>
            <li> Where do people go to get their nose hair &#x27;professionally&#x27; done?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She did not accuse me of any mistreatment of the trimmer, didn&#x27;t ask for a photo of the taped unit, and the whole phone call took only 2 minutes and 43 seconds from the time their phone started ringing till she said I&#x27;d get another one in the mail.  </li>
            <li> no problems, but it still early remember.</li>
            <li> (Getting old, like me?)</li>
            <li> my old nose trimmer which is a wahl doesn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> it is far quieter in operation than the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> It trims well and has a &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34; on it so you don&#x27;t shove it in too far.</li>
            <li> Being 70 years old</li>
            <li> I like it so far</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this trimmer to people with unwanted facial hair as well as landscape companies and jungle explorers alike.</li>
            <li> This has not been an issue for me so far, so I assume the problem has been fixed.  </li>
            <li> My expectations are very low, because 2 out of the three didn&#x27;t work straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> Worked well for a while, then completely died.</li>
            <li> So far I used it once ever since I got it</li>
            <li> sturdy housing &amp; the battery goes inside direct, not on a plastic sleeve.</li>
            <li> Works much better than trimmers than have blades that move side to side - at least for nasal hair.</li>
            <li> Works as described, so far.</li>
            <li> and they replaced my old one</li>
            <li> After trying several $10 trimmers over the years that didn&#x27;t work I got this trimmer for Christmas from my wife and it really works.</li>
            <li> Steve had decided there was a risk of the cap being dismantled during shipping, so just sent a complete replacement.  </li>
            <li> Seems that when guys grow old, hair tends to migrate.  </li>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t make me say wow</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised about the amount of power it put out when I flipped the switch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a Professional ...Water Resistant...</li>
            <li> Only Lasted about 6 months - is this really guaranteed for Life?  </li>
            <li> Have not tried it yet since I used old one this morning.</li>
            <li> So far it does what&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> My old nose trimmer stopped working (even though I changed the batteries and it seemed to function</li>
            <li> ; AS I HAVE RECENTLY HAD A STRKE AND CAN&#x27;T GET AROUND VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works very well on different types of hair.</li>
            <li> They all appear to be much the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I hope this is the last trimmer I ever have to buy thanks to the lifetime warranty.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> He likes that it is not round</li>
            <li> This is a solid nose trimmer, constructed very well.</li>
            <li> These remind me of a professional quality product.</li>
            <li> It is better than the device it replaced in at least two ways.</li>
            <li> I had bought several of the Drug Store types with the straight blade.  </li>
            <li> My husband has used this only once, but it was very efficient.</li>
            <li> Was the tip dummy proof enough that I could really root around and get the job</li>
            <li> My husbands old nose trimmer bit the dust</li>
            <li> Had a cheap one once that was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Working well so far...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth a purchase if you have a sensitive nose, as I do.</li>
            <li> but he&#x27;s too far sighted to see them.</li>
            <li> far it feels sturdier than the name brand nose hair trimmers i&#x27;ve had in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lifetime guarantee is also something that is not found very often on moderately priced grooming tools.</li>
            <li> Well after toying with it some to see what was up with this thing and hoping mine wasn&#x27;t defected it eventually fixed itself.</li>
            <li> did not work, , so i took out the blade and put it in my old one.</li>
            <li> Made in China is clearly marked on the product.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my old clipper.</li>
            <li> Customer service is VERY responsive and goes their extra mile to satisfy their customers</li>
            <li> Unlike a different nose trimmer I purchased years ago with unsatisfactory results, this one really does the job in those hard-to-reach areas.  </li>
            <li> Works well, well constructed, not the ultimate but works very well.....</li>
            <li> Replaced old Panasonic trimmer that I thought was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; .. it&#x27;s rotary blades always had to &amp;</li>
            <li> So far give it a five star.</li>
            <li> so far, would recommend.  </li>
            <li> This professional nose &amp; ear hair trimmer is everything it claims to be.&lt;br /&gt;Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> By far the highest quality nose trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Those two just did not last, and I didn&#x27;t use them very often.</li>
            <li> Also WOW a company that goes out of</li>
            <li> Most were made mostly of plastic and performed poorly or intermittently after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as powerful as I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> the years have failed to do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then, I&#x27;ve never been an old geezer with hair growing in weird places until fairly recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, I put off buying a nose hair trimmer, fearing it would hurt even worse than pulling them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works OK but slow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it difficult to find good trimmers in the stores around me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to see a company truly standing behind a \\&quot;Lifetime Guarantee\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had to stop and let it cool down twice within a minute of use.  </li>
            <li> When I turn the switch to the off position it will turn off for just a second and the it comes right back on.  </li>
            <li> Battery cover was real hard to put on the first time but this unit does a fine job seems real professional</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews so quickly, but this nose trimmer really deserves a 5 star review.  </li>
            <li> The instructions tell you to insure that the battery cover is tight and then rinse under running water to clean the unit each time you use it.</li>
            <li> Just noticed many other similar comments, obviously the seller knows it is a piece of junk</li>
            <li> It is a tad bit more expensive than some other nose hair trimmers that seem to have a lot more frills and features.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy duty steel and very durable unlike most other products.</li>
            <li> I tried with brand new batteries would not turn on.. beyond a quick flash of the led light very disappointing as I was excited for this product</li>
            <li> price is right, and it came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It is small, easy to store, and does its job well.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned by a few other reviewers the tip does get warm but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem.</li>
            <li> Used the Toilet Tree Professional once so far, purchased this after using Panasonic trimmers and other brands that do not last more than a couple of uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has already held up better than the more expensive one that didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> It even comes wirh a little brush to clean it.</li>
            <li> I really like how the trimmer itself has 8 flat surfaces instead of</li>
            <li> I chose this product above other brands because it claimed to be effective and durable due to its metallic makeup.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with nose trimmer in the past eventually crapping out on me, and so far, this one is good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a couple weeks, but so far I&#x27;d highly recommend this</li>
            <li> Very heavy duty and does the trick very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and picks up hairs quickly.  </li>
            <li> and it is back to new!</li>
            <li> Thanks Toilet Tree.  </li>
            <li> should, i&#x27;m not sure what was up with it but seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> Online, I will search TOILETTREE first for similar products in the future.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had it long, but so far it is really working well.</li>
            <li> Feels solid and handles great,the light to see in dark places, nose is a must,</li>
            <li> ok sounds gross but i usually just pull my nose hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want any refund or anything like that, I will suffer my own stupidity for buying it in the first place.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but so far I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks and see nothing that turn&#x27;s on any LED lights.</li>
            <li> my only issue with it (which is not a big deal) is that you have to trim probably a little bit more frequently</li>
            <li> Now for the true test, how is it at removing nose, or a little bit of ear hair.</li>
            <li> High quality unit, works well, feels solid.</li>
            <li> High quality works well and very quiet compared to others I have used.</li>
            <li> TolietTree Products has created such a high quality trimmer it is made with a steel casing.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this nose trimmer and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and light a big help.</li>
            <li> They sent me a new one without even having to return the old one.&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but the part-owner of the company called and apologized for the mistake.</li>
            <li> I think the batteries last longer because the tolerances on the moving parts are so smooth that there is less energy required.  </li>
            <li> My husband especially loves it since the tip is round and easily inserts into the nose.</li>
            <li> Solid piece of equipment, good value, stupid light.</li>
            <li> and I assume will be much cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have purchased others in the past and they were cheaply made.</li>
            <li> We have had a difficult time finding one that works as well as our old one that died, but this trimmer works better than any we have had!</li>
            <li> Its not uncomfortably warm, so I doubt it could get warm enough to actually hurt</li>
            <li> this exactly watt I was expected.</li>
            <li> He had used others in the past but they break down easily, so we love the warranty this one has!</li>
            <li> Amazon should be a little more careful with the products that are sold on their website.</li>
            <li> and they immediately offered to send me a new unit, which arrived 3 days later.  </li>
            <li> the back of the trimmer and incerted a new batery.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t for me-my husband actually told me he needed a new nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t have an eyebrow attachment, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> #34;rev up&amp;#34; to get to running speed (which I realize now was actually just &amp;#34;walking&amp;#34; speed, compared to the new trimmer) before it could work.  </li>
            <li> The light is a great addition to an otherwise boring chore!&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li> The cutting part is precise and smooth metal.</li>
            <li> duh) and easy to use.</li>
            <li> In Jan 2014, I purchased Toilet Tree&#x27;s Professional Water Resistant Heavy Duty Steel Nose Hair Trimmer with LED Light.</li>
            <li> Have you seen those really big guys at the gym who can&#x27;t actually curl or bench nearly as much as they look like they</li>
            <li> This one is solid, quiet and works really well.</li>
            <li> Heavy Duty Steel Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer with LED light by ToiletTree</li>
            <li> after a few months woh this, it is still going strong, the light is useless but it does what it is supposed to and is very durable.</li>
            <li> The main reason I chose this over the Panasonic is that the owner of the company made an extraordinary effort to respond to all negative reviews and comments.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s made of metal on the outside, the innards are black plastic and obviously flimsy as I am not that strong.  </li>
            <li> It is very loud, especially for trimming in the ear.</li>
            <li> This product works well enough but it is very loud.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different trimmers, but this is the first and only one to truly work.  </li>
            <li> The ability to turn it off is a major asset.  </li>
            <li> major problem...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve not had a lot of luck with the major brands&#x27; offerings in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had two major qualifications:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would be interested in knowing what other quality products your company sells and the prices.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It  worked perfectly right out of the box, and quieter than the previous trimmer I had from a leading?</li>
            <li> Two, it heats up VERY quickly and is uncomfortable to use for more than a few seconds at a time.  </li>
            <li> This is a powerful little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Like the light, also has decent amount of power behind it.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work better than other similar products; except the light is useless.</li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t more than 2 months before I noticed that the tip (which houses all of the moving parts, blades and removeable tip) was very delicate to handle during cleanings and the plastic molding that had grooves for the tip to screw into splintered and no longer held the tip in place.</li>
            <li> I hardly need a light.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than the name brands, well designed, very effective for nose and ear hair, is a sturdy and not too loud trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Toilet Tree products shipped me a new, replacement trimmer at no cost after reading and responding to my review below.</li>
            <li> Literally can&#x27;t think of anything other than positive to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I personally found the LED light to be of little practical value; BUT- that may be due to my particular lighting/mirror setup.  </li>
            <li> IT has a light with it, not sure if it is actually helpful though.  </li>
            <li> This thing does a fantastic job in only a few seconds!  </li>
            <li> i had another strange mis- shipment,  but Mr. Parisi contacted me directly and completely fixed the problem, and it got delivered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The led light is useless as the beam doesn&#x27;t really shine directly up inside the nostril, unless you tilt the device.</li>
            <li> LED Light is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Tried several brand names and this one is clearly tops.</li>
            <li> It has consistent trimming speed but the cutting power and closeness could be better.</li>
            <li> arrived timely works as expected thanks to everyone</li>
            <li> Outside steel, though surprised blade shift is plastic while my Panasonic is metal.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> The trim is very close with absolutely no pain and no tears.  </li>
            <li> It does a neat job and runs quiet compared to the old trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is quite and you can barely feel it working.  </li>
            <li> Well so far it&#x27;s lived up to the reviews I read only thing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> This one seems different - thus far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I can already tell the quality of engineering and manufacturing is far above the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> and it shipped in a very timely manner--quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it seems to be well  designed</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> Not really wanting to talk too much about a nose trimmer</li>
            <li> However, it works quite well, doesn&#x27;t pull hairs, and seems solidly and professionally built.</li>
            <li> I guess I will just have to continue searching for a replacement that actually works and can match my old unit for reliability and price.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the off position does not do what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Did the tip reach far enough into my nostril to get all the visible hair, and also some of the hair farther back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been through several nose hair trimmers and this one seems to work so far.  </li>
            <li> Gave up after 3 tries to find a way through their phone maze and to a real person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> First off this thing is bigger than I expected, a bit unwieldy.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job of cutting ear and nose hair without pulling on them.</li>
            <li> The trimmer tip does get warm when in use, which was initially unsettling.</li>
            <li> As indicated by other reviewers, this product is as advertised and is superior to other nose trimmers I have owned in the past.  </li>
            <li> So far this trimmer has been doing exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do without any trouble.  </li>
            <li> Some discharged batteries very rapidly and, thus, slowed down frequently.  </li>
            <li> But seriously, I&#x27;m not a fan of the single LED or its aim.  </li>
            <li> Two days later, a package arrived and it actually contained a completely new unit.</li>
            <li> I expect it to live a long and productive life.</li>
            <li> HEAVY DUTY  feels right in your hand  </li>
            <li> Also, TOILETTREE took care of a small problem quickly, politely, and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m nearly blind, I gauged the volume of hair actually being cut on my last trimmer by the distinct sound it made when hacking through the thicket.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the small nylon bristle brush which came with this unit, making it easier to clean it properly after use.</li>
            <li> No loose connection causing the battery to cut out.</li>
            <li> AND REALLY DOES THE JOB REMOVING NOSE AND OTHER UNSIGHTLY HAIRS.&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT</li>
            <li> But...... as mentioned by other reviews it is very sturdy to the feel.</li>
            <li> I have used a similar device in the past, and this one is much quieter, yet works very well.</li>
            <li> The on switch is hard to push and the trimmer does not cut accurately or close enough to my liking.</li>
            <li> for its intended purpose, not a single pull or yanked hair in ears or nostrils.</li>
            <li> I have had several other less costly, cheaply made nose/ear hair trimmers in the past from various companies which worked OK, though did not last long....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean trimmer as it sucks the hair in while you trim.</li>
            <li> In a big screen, big audience setting, people can see clear to the moon up your nostrils.</li>
            <li> This aids me in fulfilling my social duty of snipping those unsightly nose hairs.</li>
            <li> My (3rd) old Panasonic unit (blade) finally quit working and could not get replacement blades.</li>
            <li> This item attracted my attent because my, 10 year old, American Made, trimmer was finally dieing.</li>
            <li> It worked okay, but it left a lot of noticeable hair behind.</li>
            <li> Of the few I&#x27;ve tried, this is the only one worth having.</li>
            <li> I ended up taking out the battery and just turning the switch on and off for a minute, then i put the battery back in and still it was running while it was off, but this time even slower so slow that the light wasn&#x27;t even powering on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I have very slight pulls, they were not nearly as bad as my previous trimmer (which did so much pulling that I was left in tears after two seconds of use, at which point I had to quit).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tip was exactly the length it should be, and reached back far enough to get all visible hair, plus a little bit more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was not familiar with this brand but it works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had all the major name brands &amp; this is the only one&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Takes up very little room compared to the rechargeable set we had previously and works much better.  </li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was its solid construction, this was nothing like the flimsy piece of junk I had previously.</li>
            <li> The motor is strong and doesn&#x27;t get bogged down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It think one of the reasons is the rotary cutting system which allows hairs to enter the trimmer tip from the top and also from the sides which is very helpful for stray hairs not only in the nose but also on eyebrows, beards and ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products but this one REALLY works.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Other trimmers have rolled onto the floor and broken - so nice design touch.</li>
            <li> So I took a chance on this new product with no history, positive or negative.</li>
            <li> device is much sturdier than my previous trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> After reading all the glowing reviews I was really looking forward to something above average.  </li>
            <li> larger units with more batteries can&#x27;t match the clean cuts without pulling or leaving annoying stubble.</li>
            <li> The cutting end gets a little warm, but it hasn&#x27;t gotten too hot to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, I bought a second one when I accidentally crushed the end of my first one (knocked it on the floor, dropped a very heavy tool on it while doing some bathroom remodelling, still only snapped off the end).&lt;br /&gt;semi-CON:</li>
            <li> Of a sturdy construction, does not pull hairs, cuts precisely and fits nicely in my nose and ears, without an extreme annoying buzz like former units.  </li>
            <li> Nobody sells replacement blades - probably because they know people will go out and buy a whole new unit when it gets dull.  </li>
            <li> A single AA battery powers the motor that painlessly and neatly removes hair in sensitive and hard-to-reach places.  </li>
            <li> but it broke some reason it has a weak spot on it cheap plastic</li>
            <li> Buy this wonderful little device and, with the exception of your horrible taste in music, your troubles with a certain someone will vanish- just like this mother-of-all-nose-hair-trimmers will do to the inside of your nostrils and ear canal.</li>
            <li> It is a little much for me but husband loves it.  </li>
            <li> Like all other Nose Trimmers, seems to be under powered even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> some of you will pay $150 a MONTH for cable tv but will tell the whole world how angry you are that your precious little $20 nose hair trimmer conked out in 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using just for nose, which is very sensitive due to allergies.</li>
            <li> The light is stupid , I cant use the light to look up my nose.</li>
            <li> Seems a little less powerful and doesn&#x27;t cut as well as some other similar products, but those all broke down quickly.  </li>
            <li> Its cutting action is crisp and precise with relatively quiet little snippy sounds.  </li>
            <li> Very effectively removes those annoying hairs in the nose...without tugging and having to go over the same spot repeatedly to get the job done.</li>
            <li> they just plain didn&#x27;t trim hair very well at all.</li>
            <li> This is the second personal grooming product I have purchased from Toilet Tree products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it does get a bit hot after a short period of time using it.</li>
            <li> any of the other ones by far  </li>
            <li> So, naturally when I know what I want, but not exactly which product, I head to the world&#x27;s largest marketplace, Amazon.  </li>
            <li> it totally being a flat cylinder-</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s a bit weak even with a full set of batteries, but it does the job</li>
            <li> The original broken ToiletTree trimmer must have been a fluke  </li>
            <li> It spins around blades at high RPMs while a slotted (perforated) metal tip, the part of the trimmer that looks like a bullet jacket, gets your hairs stuck inside the little holes to then be cut by the spinning blade.  </li>
            <li> I emailed customer service and got a new one in less than 2 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if ToilTree Products offers other products, but I&#x27;ll certainly take a look and would recommend doing business with them for anything they offer.</li>
            <li> After several back and forths, it was determined that I was missing a part in the cap, so Steve was going to send out a new cap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who, like me, has nose hairs pointed out at least once a month by a significant other and plans to use a trimmer going forward.</li>
            <li> I have tried several nose hair trimmers in the past from infomercials and just locating them in stores and they never worked very well.</li>
            <li> This is the third one I&#x27;ve had in a year, so I&#x27;m hoping, because this feels substantially made, that it will last long for me.</li>
            <li> I have that hair growing in those places that like to grow hair when you get older and have had a few trimmers before this one.  </li>
            <li> He was becoming very concerned that he was going to lose them if the earpiece kept coming loose and with the cost of hearing aids that is a very frightening proposition.  </li>
            <li> This is the second out of two times that I have bought a defective product from Toilet Tree Products!  </li>
            <li> Why are nose hair clippers so weak and unreliable/stop working so quickly?  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the blades would not seat in the cutting head properly after cleaning, and there would be a loud grinding sound when the unit was on.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot though, or at least didn&#x27;t during the time I needed to use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other trimmers that barely did the job and came to this one.  </li>
            <li> He has used the product long enough to see its value.</li>
            <li> The ones with the &#x27;flat&#x27; head should be avoided.</li>
            <li> have not used it long enough to review.</li>
            <li> Use a FLAT head trimmer or freaking razor for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> had a nose hair trimmer that has a flat blade</li>
            <li> will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Just as described - works well - feels substantial in the hand - guess is, it will last, and do its job, a long time</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> I will only change my review if I do not get long service out of it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Light is not useful, not bright enough.</li>
            <li> Solid and very smooth cutting blade.</li>
            <li> Cleans the Forest us exactly what I mean.</li>
            <li> called the manufacturer and after explaining the issue and trying a few fixes, they are sending me out a new unit tomorrow.</li>
            <li> NEVER HAD ONE OF THESE LAST very long</li>
            <li> I expect this trimmer will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Getting old sucks, I have hair growing wild in my ears, my nose...</li>
            <li> thank you toilet tree</li>
            <li> It is indeed a heavy duty facial hair trimmer, but certainly not heavy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few times and so far it does what it is supposed to do and feels sturdy enough to hold up.</li>
            <li> just for the sake of argument I called toilet tree products boy</li>
            <li> Mr parisi, President of Toilet Tree Products, has won my confidence in both this product and his company.</li>
            <li> I looked into more expensive models, but was not ready to make that sort of investment.</li>
            <li> Thank you Toilet Tree Products.</li>
            <li> Toilet Tree Product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  I have to hand it to Toilet Tree Products:  </li>
            <li> I had some dealings with Toilet Tree Products.  </li>
            <li> I called Toilet Tree</li>
            <li> Easy to use and only a single AA battery makes this a simplistic device.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the top cover is hard to remove if your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d the new 1 very quickly at no charge.  </li>
            <li> but  I just use rechargeable batteries and this should last a very long time!</li>
            <li> I did some pretty serious rooting around.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like many reviewers here, I received a unit that will not turn off due a defective on/off switch.</li>
            <li> It is not very efficient at cutting hairs and can get hot enough during use that you have to stop operation to let it cool down.  </li>
            <li> I only purchased this one month ago, so I cannot attest to it&#x27;s durability, or how long the blade will remain sharp enough to cut my ear and nose hairs.</li>
            <li> The only issue is the metal tip gets hot pretty quickly due to the friction of the circular rotation of the cutting blade.</li>
            <li> After trying several other brands previously, this one so far has exceeded our expectations.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that any bad reviews were satisfactorily addressed by ToiletTree Products.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the LED light</li>
            <li> The on off switch has a smooth surface and is difficult to turn on or off.</li>
            <li> The LED light is bothersome and fails to help.  </li>
            <li> think the LED light is useless, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just continued using it as directed until I did not hear any more of the hair cutting noise.</li>
            <li> The light is a silly add on that will help kill a battery faster</li>
            <li> Product could be improved with more horsepower and sharper cutting.</li>
            <li> need to see how long battery lasts and how long it stays</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long, but did use it on my husbands ear hair.  </li>
            <li> Hallelujah, you don&#x27;t know how long its taken me to find a nose hair trimmer that does what its supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> came the Professional Water Resistant Heavy Duty Steel Nose</li>
            <li> I imagine that it will continue to work for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve missed the speed and comfort of the old Panasonic that stopped working after a few years and decided to look on the internet again for another brand.  </li>
            <li> I should have ordered it long ago.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s entirely possible that it&#x27;s my fault, but I was trying to be careful.</li>
            <li> I had purchased THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY a LONG time ago.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to how long it has lasted - we will see.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also confident that if anything goes wrong within a reasonable time with the product the company will stand behind it.</li>
            <li> you are trying to build a business for the long haul, this is how you run it.</li>
            <li> Others were a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> will wait to see how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> Looks like it should hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> The trimmer arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> , it looks waxy or strange.  </li>
            <li> Also the size and shape is a bit strange.  </li>
            <li> This seems strange to me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this one for a long time (over 10 years).</li>
            <li> Should have figured it out a long time ago....</li>
            <li> Good tool for one of life&#x27;s annoying tasks.  </li>
            <li> MADE BY TOILET TREE !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks but believe with regular cleaning it should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This trimmer definitely exceeds the results I had from previous &amp;#34;mass market&amp;#34; trimmers such as Norelco and Braun.  </li>
            <li> I had a similar product from a different manufacturer that lasted less than a year.</li>
            <li> I mean absolutely kills it.</li>
            <li> Poor design, plastic hooks to hold battery in place did not catch right out of box.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is certainly not a replacement for the Panasonic ER430K vacuum trimmer</li>
            <li> I WANT TO THANK THE FOLKS AT TOILET TREE FOR OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TAKING THE TIME TO CORRECT THE INITIAL BAD IMPRESSION I HAD.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these devices from other makers in the past and have found them very short-lived.  </li>
            <li> The cutting cap that holds the blade in place is also kinda loose fitting.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, and it runs quiet.</li>
            <li> Other reviews showed same problem for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer, and had to send it back due to the oft repeated &#x27;stuck on/off switch&#x27; problem.</li>
            <li> and I believe the other one would only work part-time.  </li>
            <li> have only had it for 2 weeks, but it out performs the other three I had</li>
            <li> I purchased these as gifts, chose this model after reading several reviews on other brands that didn&#x27;t seem to have longevity.</li>
            <li> I will also buy other products from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> THE LITTLE PLASTIC PARTS INSIDE STARTED TO LOOSEN AND WERE CATCHING THE NOSE HAIR WITHOUT CUTTING IT.  </li>
            <li> and I believe it will last a lot longer than other brand</li>
            <li> I have had a product like this from other makers and they all quit working after a (short)</li>
            <li> It works well, the problem is that it cannot be used for eyebrows, sideburns or other facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with other trimmers (specifically Remington) that simply died and replacing the battery did not work.</li>
            <li> I have bought several other products in the passed.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and only have to do a once over, maybe twice (unlike other nose hair trimmers)</li>
            <li> Very solid feeling holding it, unlike other nose trimmers I have used.</li>
            <li> Works decent for 6 months than the blades dull.</li>
            <li> Then, to reinstall the head again, it is hard to get it attached to the main body while keeping the blade holder where it should be.</li>
            <li> I’ve had a hard time finding a decent nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> After going through several trimmers over the years, this Toilet Tree trimmer knocks all the competitors down &amp; out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very elegant looking, but that is only a personal preference.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this unit very long</li>
            <li> This trimmer is high quality and hard to not recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made for this, but I also used it to clean up random hairs below my eyebrows (NOT the eyebrows).</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m a few months shy of 50, and let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve got a lot more hair in my nose and ears than I used to.  </li>
            <li> My only negative comment would be that the motor hum is loud for trimming around the ears.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, this concerns me about the overall longevity of the device.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is solid, heavy duty, well designed and simple to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of trimmers the last few years, but not one that would last.</li>
            <li> , I went searching for a different trimmer and happened upon this one, the &amp;#34;Professional Water Resistant Heavy Duty Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer&amp;#34; by ToiletTree Products.</li>
            <li> Nice item, feels solid and seems to have made my annoying nose and ear hairs retreat from sight.</li>
            <li> Most of them did a certain amount of pulling, along with the cutting, making the experience not very pleasant -- and the pulling got worse as the trimmer got older.  </li>
            <li> single battery operates this effortlessly....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Loved the Panasonic trimmer but two of them broke after dropping it a single time.  </li>
            <li> Runs on a single AA battery.</li>
            <li> Previously Had a more expensive nose trimmer that lasted only a few years.</li>
            <li> Not a good way to get ready for a night out.</li>
            <li> only  Performance  is below average.</li>
            <li> however, NOT enough to be uncomfortable or alarming - just thought it worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li> The motors were not powerful enough and they did not cut hair</li>
            <li> I will say I was surprised by how small it is.</li>
            <li> I tried several batteries with no success.  </li>
            <li> Was disappointed to be honest.  </li>
            <li> it works but takes a long time to use to get everything as closely as i would have expected.</li>
            <li> and so I was very surprised that it did the job in just a few seconds cutting my hair cleanly.</li>
            <li> I push up and down on the power button several times and it all takes about a minute.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs like several of the other trimmers!  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the cap won&#x27;t stay on, (which isn&#x27;t a major deal)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked the look when I&#x27;ve seen other women shave or wax or otherwise completely remove hair from the upper lip</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it&#x27;s a little hard to clean...</li>
            <li> It allows easy removal of the cutters for cleaning and it lets you rinse the cutting blades in water.</li>
            <li> Unlike the two previous name brand trimmers I have purchased, this one is actually works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several different brands of nose trimmers in the past.</li>
            <li> Stopped working altogether after less than a year of occasional use.  </li>
            <li> My previous one could not get some of the short hairs.</li>
            <li> Bought this one after getting another brand for half the price that simply didn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> , sometimes it won&#x27;t turn on, sometimes it only runs at half speed.  </li>
            <li> (AA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer also has a locking switch which means it is less likely to get turned on your toiletry bag while traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had previously bought a rechargeable nose trimmer from a local store.</li>
            <li> I take back what I said Above Unbelievable   </li>
            <li> The blades are not very sharp and the motor doesn&#x27;t seem to turn fast enough and it ends up just pulling the hairs out instead of cutting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I tried this new ToiletTree Nose Trimmer, and I have to say that I was completely uptight about using it half expecting it to yank out my hairs like the other poor performers.  </li>
            <li> We are probably going to purchase another one of these items as our former trimmers of other brands always break down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big</li>
            <li> received this little trimmer last week</li>
            <li> The second step is buying this little gizmo.</li>
            <li> Heats up a little if used for a longer period of time, but that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> this seems like a really solid little trimmer.</li>
            <li> only little caveat I have is the LED.  </li>
            <li> We have only had it a little while</li>
            <li> It is big in the hand and a little tougher to maneuver around.  </li>
            <li> I have used other trimmers and none of them lasted very long.</li>
            <li> After trying and using several other kinds or brands of Nose Hair Trimmers over many years and finding them all to be pretty useless and/or painful, I had given up on ever trying another.  </li>
            <li> The built in light makes cutting them a breeze.</li>
            <li> When I no longer heard the grinding sound of the trimmer cutting hairs, I stuck it in my ears.  </li>
            <li> Works great for my nose hair cutting !!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how long this will last, but it works for now and does what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It works really well for nose, ear, and random facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I am a hairy man with hairy ancestors and so, to avoid all those curious stares that come with being a bushman I try to maintain all of those places where hairs seem to startle peoples sensibility.</li>
            <li> Product works as well as to be expected</li>
            <li> Battery compartment cover could not to be closed.</li>
            <li> It was not as expected however it does perform the task</li>
            <li> only lasted a few months then broke, we got a lemon.</li>
            <li> Received this a few weeks ago, and recently used it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s louder than in the Panasonic, but this is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; ve only used the trimmer a few times at writing.</li>
            <li> I can say I have owned quite a few different brands of these trimmers thru&#x27; the years</li>
            <li> I have spent some time using the product</li>
            <li> I probably would give it 5 stars, but I had a different one a few years ago that I lost.  </li>
            <li> I found it NOT AS EXPECTED AT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days and used it once.</li>
            <li> The last trimmer I purchased a few years ago cost me $35.00 and can&#x27;t compare with this one.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and expected.  </li>
            <li> Not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> Came as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No regrets here.</li>
            <li> have purchased three trimmers in the last few years.</li>
            <li> Not very well made.</li>
            <li> but when we went to put the battery in the endcap would not fit back on regardless of our efforts.  </li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say.</li>
            <li> jammed or stopped working yet.</li>
            <li> NO THANKS.</li>
            <li> I offered partial payment for that, but he declined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days but he claims that there is no pulling on the hairs like some others he has owned.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> It is not very often you find items are are guaranteed for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> UPS  USPS combo, [which I&#x27;ve had some trouble with on several orders]</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried in a wet environment as I use it when sitting at my desk or watching TV.  </li>
            <li> I kept trying to twist it harder to see if it would stay in place and ended up breaking both the blade cap and the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;-BUT-&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I have another five star review for this shaver but want to add a plus and a minus.  </li>
            <li> con (minus) is in the on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I was in the military for over 12 years, so I looked at it like I would</li>
            <li> Not much else to say</li>
            <li> This trimmer costs about twice as much as basic trimmers and is described as heavy duty, lifetime guarantee, etc.  </li>
            <li> The Toilettree trimmer is expensive, but well worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product a few days, so I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up over time.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to take longer to cut than I expected.</li>
            <li> Does not work as expected</li>
            <li> , I am all about quality as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> the money spent.</li>
            <li> do have to be a bit careful when cleaning.  </li>
            <li> so I pressed a bit harder and it took off a chunk of skin and drew blood.  </li>
            <li> Product performed as expected.</li>
            <li> Does not do a close cut, but that is expected on something that will not yank hairs out by the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Heavy, solid build, cuts well.. not close, but</li>
            <li> If I saved all the money I spent on nose trimmers I would be a millionaire by now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review in a few weeks and see is the thing starts acting up again.</li>
            <li> not very noisy at all</li>
            <li> I expected this to hurt or tickle, it doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> Not a very close cut.  </li>
            <li> broke after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Works as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I turned it on and there was NOT much Power</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;r not happy, they&#x27;re not happy, and they will make sure you are.</li>
            <li> This trimmer replaced a Sharper Image trimmer that broke after several years of usage (I was moving from one home to another and the Sharper Image trimmer was accidentally crushed under a heavy moving box).</li>
            <li> This means I have those wicked daddy long legs creeping out that need to be cut down.  </li>
            <li> Turned the entire inside of my nose black!</li>
            <li> Though it does not come with vacuum cleaning system, I like its water resistant heavy duty steel and lifetime guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Or, hey, maybe my nose hair&#x27;s just not fine enough for the Brookstone class of customer.</li>
            <li> you have to depress the small white strip on the switch.</li>
            <li> I bought this metal trimmer to replace other plastic trimmers that seemed to break or just stop working after a few short months.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting the clean cutting action with zero - and I mean zero, nill, nada (0) pulled hairs.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem with the nose hair choppers I&#x27;ve bought in the past is that their blades dull too fast.</li>
            <li> This guy grinds em down like a tiny little weed whacker.</li>
            <li> the trimmer slowed down a little bit, I found that I had not been cleaning it well enough.  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an old one that needed to seriously thrown out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t take no time for that small gadget to fall apart (it was cheaply made).</li>
            <li> In less than a minute of use I had heavy hair removed that my old trimmer wouldn&#x27;t touch and got bogged down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Solid little trimmer, doesn&#x27;t pull like others!  </li>
            <li> Update: the blade cracked in half, and despite it being a single removable part</li>
            <li> Initially received a malfunction unit with a bad on/off switch, but the seller quickly sent a working replacement within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The base you hold is about as big around as a tube of toothpaste, so its easy to hold onto.  </li>
            <li> Other trimmers pull hair and hurt, but this one does not.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other battery powered trimmers and scissors and didn&#x27;t like either.</li>
            <li> Extremely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> but I have a small nose and may not be using it properly.</li>
            <li> This stubble sharply pricked the inside of my nose</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about it and thought i&#x27;d purchase it for him.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up on the cordless models, purchased a Trimmit Nose Hair Trimmer and settled for Platinum XL Nose Hair Trimmer for the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Even when I wriggle my nose around I can&#x27;t feel the hair tickling the other side of my nose.  </li>
            <li> Even when I wriggle my nose around I can&#x27;t feel the hair tickling the other side of my nose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other trimmers before and none worked this well...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to carry with me when I&#x27;m on travel and can be cleaned by washing under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviews, this does not cut as close as other trimmers.</li>
            <li> I had tried several nose trimmers some years ago and was never really satisfied with the outcome...</li>
            <li> Like other nose trimmers.</li>
            <li> After only 1 minute of use, no more hair in either place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is possible, and highly likely, that I inserted the battery in the wrong direction on my initial set up process.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a couple of these type products in the past and been totally underwhelmed by the flimsy trimmer that I received.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other brands, but this one seems well made</li>
            <li> Other trimmers tend to pull which I would endure if need be</li>
            <li> Use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Cutter blade is sharp and doesn&#x27;t seem to pull at all ( unlike the others I&#x27;d used and found would tug a hair out when I wasn&#x27;t expecting</li>
            <li> The fact that it truly is painless sets it apart from all other products I have used.</li>
            <li> The vendor has an extremely admirable policy of addressing and solving any issue with this product.</li>
            <li> Every  other one has quit working in a matter of months...</li>
            <li> No more nicks to my nose while trying to trim as close as possible with a scissors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several trimmers of this sort in the past.  </li>
            <li> Other than, I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I wish I got it sooner, before I bought other named brands and specialty store brands that are inferior to the ToiletTree product!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hopefully it won&#x27;t stop working like all the other brands that I&#x27;ve bought over the years.</li>
            <li> When in use it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair like other models he&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to start using a trimmer after hearing issues other users have had with their trimmers.  </li>
            <li> like I have with other designs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other trimmers.</li>
            <li> The cutting head does get quite warm after a short time, but rinsing it while running seems to keep it from getting uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> pun)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is sharp as &amp;*#^ and gets it done in 15 seconds or so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other nose/ear hair trimmers before.  </li>
            <li> I had one of those small &amp;#34;As seen on tv&amp;#34; gadgets (facial hair trimmer)</li>
            <li> This trimmer does what the other reviews state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, this review is not from someone who has tried a lot of other brands and styles...</li>
            <li> The business end looks like other nose trimmers</li>
            <li> YES I will recommend it to other buyers</li>
            <li> Works extremely well to clip ear and nose hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter that the motor is still humming away: The sharp blades always dully within a year or so and require a repurchasing of the product.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of other brands, but they never worked to my expectation.</li>
            <li> LED lamp is next to pointless.</li>
            <li> Use it every other morning.</li>
            <li> and i will buy other products from this company</li>
            <li> I was worried about the rotating blades because of past experience with inferior products which snagged and pulled hairs, but this one has no such issue.</li>
            <li> The cutters are sharp and the device is durable.</li>
            <li> My husband put a battery in it and did not have any difficulty with that, as we have seen in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> i had a some trouble getting the cover back on the unit, took me a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I got sick of tweezing my nose hairs and thought I&#x27;d try something a little more humane.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the first time I put the battery in the one little plastic thingy that holds the battery end on, broke and now I have to hold it with both hands to get to work as the end has to be fully closed to work.</li>
            <li> I promise, if you throw down and purchase this trimmer, you will not only be pleased with the results, but your girlfriend (or boyfriend) will not hesitate to lock on to your lips now that the fearful octopoid hairs that resided in that reef of a nose have been decimated.  </li>
            <li> Sounds like a heck of a deal to me, especially since other trimmers I purchased in the past stopped working a few months in.</li>
            <li> the way, what does &#x27;professional&#x27; nose trimmer even mean?!</li>
            <li> Seems so simple, but so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> The battery compartment cover is a really cheap, chinsy BAD design.  </li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> It was not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> but the struggle with the battery cover is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer had a promising start but the on/off switch is flawed.</li>
            <li> I was a dedicated Wahl Trimmer user, but have had numerous issues of late regarding their quality and the units needing to be replaced at my cost.  </li>
            <li> not worth the purchase, save your time and money.</li>
            <li> But the last one I bought must have been at least 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I am 77, long past the age where hair starts growing from your ears and nose.</li>
            <li> I am hopeful the small electric motor will last a few years.</li>
            <li> This can prevent me from completely finishing my trimming in one setting which can be frustrating at times.</li>
            <li> This on looked a bit like my old one had a lifetime warranty,  and Amazon, thank god, stood behind it.</li>
            <li> Nohing worse whan an old guy with hair growing out his nose.  </li>
            <li> Tgw cap to hold in the battery is plastic and wont stay clipped down to make a connection with the battery.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer mows them down and close</li>
            <li> I turned it upside down</li>
            <li> the down side of things</li>
            <li> Unlike Panasonic who just sent me into a phone call loop nightmare when I tried to get a replacement under warranty when their trimmer broke down,</li>
            <li> Well built, sturdy and doesn&#x27;t bog down.  </li>
            <li> In July 2014, about six months after I made the purchase, I dropped the blade assembly down the drain of my bathroom sink while cleaning it with the included brush.</li>
            <li> Like the shape since it does not roll when you lay it down.  </li>
            <li> Beats the panasonic hands down.</li>
            <li> Stays sharp, this is the one to buy!</li>
            <li> I used the trimmer once and the instructions say to rinse the trimmer out by taking off the black cap and rinsing the cap upside down.  </li>
            <li> It is water proof and very sharp.</li>
            <li> My husband says it is very sharp and well-shaped.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your time looking at other trimmers.</li>
            <li> purchased this item about six months ago, it worked alright for a few months, but the blades became dull and shortly the blade and the guard started grinding against eachother and</li>
            <li> My old trimmer (different brand) which was at least 10 years old was getting dull, and pulling hairs instead of cutting them.  </li>
            <li> Previous trimmers have always sounded like they were self destructing when attempting to trim the hedges.</li>
            <li> No flaws as some previous reviews indicate.</li>
            <li> does the job, without pulling the hair or jamming , as happens with less well constructed trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , couldn&#x27;t get it with the previous trimmer I had.  </li>
            <li> Previous unis oils type I have</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t happen, as with my previous trimmer, which was a Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Wahl 5545-506, which is about half the price.  </li>
            <li> UPDATE: over a year and a half, and still works well.</li>
            <li> Now, of all the subjects of conversation, I typically avoid those centered around nose hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and got in less than 36 hours (Prime).</li>
            <li> I have used panasonic and remington trimmers previously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less than $20.</li>
            <li> It never seemed to get it all, and I&#x27;m talking about some visible hair, not just out-of-reach, hidden growth.  </li>
            <li> helpful finding those odd hairs that want to curl or avoid being cut.</li>
            <li> The size, weight, durability, and cutting action are second to none!  </li>
            <li> It does have a short tip which makes it difficult to go deep.</li>
            <li> on/off switch broke after less than 15 uses.</li>
            <li> there is  black oil oozing out of the head when using and gets on hands and face.  </li>
            <li> My previous trimmer started to work erratically with slower speeds which did not cut as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer had a velvet &amp; zippered cover at least&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the lifetime warranty - I was tired of other brands because I keep having to buy a new trimmer every year because the blade got dull.  </li>
            <li> Also makes less of a mess.</li>
            <li> The last time I bought a nose hair trimmer from a different company, it was made very poorly, and never worked well at all.</li>
            <li> unscrewed battery compartment, placced batter in (postive side first, towards cutting blade).</li>
            <li> Anyway, I dropped it less than a foot and the little plastic &#x27;catch&#x27; that holds the blade portion to the body chipped off.  </li>
            <li> Not very strong and a little overpriced</li>
            <li> /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how it does a few months down the line.  </li>
            <li> Even new batteries failed  to help: It was just worn out.</li>
            <li> but it seems pretty useless / ineffective (for me at least)</li>
            <li> It is hard to remove the cap with wet hands, which I would think to be typical when you are grooming and preparing for work.</li>
            <li> before.&lt;br /&gt;Great little unit, trims like a champ.</li>
            <li> No better than any other cheapo</li>
            <li> I still find it a little under powered, but all in all it works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And this one is frankly a little embarrassing.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using little scissors.</li>
            <li> He said it tickles a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if was a little lighter.</li>
            <li> It is quieter and gets all the nose hair with little effort.</li>
            <li> It even comes with its on little cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does seem a little sturdier and the company sent an email asking how I like it, so I&#x27;m hoping it holds up or the company will follow through with its guarantee.  </li>
            <li> This is a nifty little device that I got for my husband to remove his ear hair and nose hair.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly cleaned the unit before use but am still a little creeped out at the possibility that someone else had my trimmer up their nose.</li>
            <li> Having tried another trimmer which was about the same price but failed after the first use, my husband was skeptical about this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish it cut a little closer.</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time getting the battery cover back on.</li>
            <li> works well, but it is very hard to get the battery door back on after switching out the batteries!</li>
            <li> feel ridiculous having waited so long.  </li>
            <li> Definite upgrade from previous Panasonic I had although it looks almost identical when you break open the cutting head end.</li>
            <li> Very hard to catch coarse hair in the narrow slots.</li>
            <li> Has drastically cut down on grooming time and effort!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with ones I&#x27;ve used in the past due to the hairs being pulled and anyone who has experienced thst knows just how painful it can be and the apprehension in using another.  </li>
            <li> Nose hair tickles me so much it drive me crazy</li>
            <li> What encouraged me most was the mention in a review of the co. President contacting one unhappy customer , and rectifying his failed trimmer.</li>
            <li> You can hear it cutting hairs, sometimes you don&#x27;t realize you had that much hair in there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plucking with tweezers which takes awhile in addition to sneezing &amp; hurting - and missing some hairs.  </li>
            <li> I do wish I had one that was linear as well as round, but I am done trying to combine those needs, I will try to get that separately.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy duty as it makes it out to be.</li>
            <li> Use the round one like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on anything else.  </li>
            <li> It does the job well enough that you should pick one up if you have errant hairs irritating your nose.  </li>
            <li> one has a round blade.</li>
            <li> Been using for 1 month and found painlessly cut without missing hairs.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; it refers to the construction...</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of using trimmers that don&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> few quibbles:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had trouble with the battery cover and returned the trimmer and gave it one star.</li>
            <li> AND IT STILL WILL NOT LIGHT UP OR RUN?  </li>
            <li> Waste of time buying.  </li>
            <li> I like fact that handle is metal without being heavy.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as one would think.</li>
            <li> but.....the end cap that holds the battery in place locks firmly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not really important since it has a protective cover.  </li>
            <li> we look at our faces everyday in mirror</li>
            <li> The round design lets me get to all the nooks and crannies without worrying about nicking.</li>
            <li> you have trouble with hair in you</li>
            <li> Wasted my time.</li>
            <li> No cheap looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In few seconds no matter how curly it is, the blade will find it.</li>
            <li> Not cheap ass plastic (like in CHINA).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product.</li>
            <li> that I had to throw away after few uses.</li>
            <li> This product seems heavy duty and well constructed.</li>
            <li> and I have owned a few.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time trying another brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 &amp;#34;Professional Water Resistant Heavy Duty Steel Nose Trimmer with LED light&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This is a Heavy Duty quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> Heavy Duty....</li>
            <li> No problem getting a refund just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Also the cutter slots are narrow.</li>
            <li> Heavy and well made.</li>
            <li> Will give it a few months to see if it is durable and write again.</li>
            <li> Any trouble and</li>
            <li> Believe me, I&#x27;ve owned quite a few nose hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> I use to use a small scissors to cut them out when they got thick and long.</li>
            <li> This product works just as well if not better (slightly)</li>
            <li> Maybe the slots were slightly too small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I learned the hard way not to stick it into my nostril as I have with other trimmers like the Panasonic and Wahl.  </li>
            <li> Apparently I broke the switch by pushing too hard without depressing the white strip.</li>
            <li> I strongly do not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> Trimming nose hair was becoming tedious (and possibly dangerous) using my small Barber scissors because my hands tend to shake a little.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the base is so wide it prevents you from reaching far up in your nose.</li>
            <li> I am not sure the product I received is made of metal, let alone heavy duty steel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few trimmers in the past and I must say this is the highest quality trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer helps to keep the ugliness down.</li>
            <li> But, this little gadget has saved the day... and probably my nose!</li>
            <li> I hope this little machine lasts!</li>
            <li> I originally gave this trimmer a 1 star rating and a scathing review since it had failed on reliability after ~ 8 months.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten him several other ones in the past, and they did not work - one pulled rather than cutting</li>
            <li> big claim, for a very weak interior motor..</li>
            <li> I have had to deal with itchy nose hairs for the past few years because of poorly performing nose hair clippers, and I&#x27;m extremely relieved to have found this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I have had to deal with itchy nose hairs for the past few years because of poorly performing nose hair clippers, and I&#x27;m extremely relieved to have found this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Because there was no pain and very little sensation</li>
            <li> Buy one if you need a new trimmer, you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> This technique allows for convenient operation; however, you have to run it for at least a minute or two to get decent nose-hair cutting to result.  </li>
            <li> one drop from even a few inches onto a hard surface</li>
            <li> No more tweezers and the pain and tears that comes with that procedure.  </li>
            <li> Difficult changing battery and putting cover back on.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if will order again</li>
            <li> For months, my wife has been complaining about some unsightly nose hairs that I have refused (been to lazy) to trim with a clipper.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t pull my nose hairs like a lot of trimmers have in the past.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job, not much better than any cheaper nose/ear hair trimmer you can get at a department store for under $7.99.</li>
            <li> no more nose hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I survived without this gem.  </li>
            <li> I was never able to manipulate the thing to get it all.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> Because, the nose hairs have to enter the small holes in the tip in order to be cut - this is something that cannot be controlled</li>
            <li> and he still whines and blubbers, but he isn&#x27;t crying or running!</li>
            <li> Something to consider, since with a failed blade I&#x27;m back to using scissors.</li>
            <li> usually purchase brand name items.</li>
            <li> In the present case, I had an unfortunate case of the trimmer falling on the floor.</li>
            <li> But this is not your ordinary trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So no more pinching and pulling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure that will help because I had to use a lot of force to screw on the cover.  </li>
            <li> If any product gets by basic inspection of its mechanical function, IT SHOULD BE REJECTED, not allowed to reach a customer in useless condition.</li>
            <li> No more plucking.  </li>
            <li> No more teary eyes or sneezing from plucking, just hairless nostrils and ears.  </li>
            <li> and sorry I hadn&#x27;t bought one much earlier in my life.</li>
            <li> Mine did not work at all, and I am not  sure what I did with it,  I will try to locate it, and return it.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s weird and gross.</li>
            <li> No more hairy noise and ears.</li>
            <li> Now with this we have peace in mind and no more &amp;#34;accidental poking and ouchhhhhhhh&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> no more nose hair pocking out....</li>
            <li> no more ouchhhhh moment.</li>
            <li> My problem in the past has been that they work initially but then fail over time.  </li>
            <li> then the others I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> My nose hairs were like small tree trunks.</li>
            <li> These things usually don&#x27;t stand the test of time though.</li>
            <li> it small size means that I can take it with me when I travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no match any of the devices I used in the past.</li>
            <li> , I have tried a couple before but was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review something</li>
            <li> This one is lightweight and works as well if not better.  </li>
            <li> I did and the white cutting blade fell out and, because I didn&#x27;t have the screen in place over the drain, the blade went down the drain.  </li>
            <li> All of the previous reviews sold me on this product!!  </li>
            <li> I owned one of their older irrigators and the battery prematurely  went bad after the warranty ended.  </li>
            <li> I did trim my ear hairs with this also, but was not real happy as it did not seem to get them trimmed that well.</li>
            <li> It does the job but not easily!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a heavy duty trimmer not the usual plastic design with a weak motor.</li>
            <li> The lifetime warranty is a big plus for someone (like me) with bad experiences with other products.</li>
            <li> I have cleaned with care because  of the small and delicate cutters.</li>
            <li> It you&#x27;re tired of using scissors or other trimmers that either pull hairs or other ill issues try this model.</li>
            <li> You work hard for your money.</li>
            <li> , I shook it really hard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  The on/off switch often stucks making it hard to use</li>
            <li> Also, hard to be a lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li> For some reason, it leaves &#x27;stubble&#x27; no matter how hard I press.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find product.  </li>
            <li> his hardly worked at all and mine also quit working.  </li>
            <li> but they were lacking as it hard to get in there.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;to get to the hard places.</li>
            <li> and I found them hard to hold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of these hair trimming products due to fact that I&#x27;ve had crappy ones in the past...</li>
            <li> Never nicked me once no matter how hard</li>
            <li> After one month of hardly use</li>
            <li> Needed to push the switch REALLY hard to turn on.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell on battery life and getting dull etc.</li>
            <li> the blade is hard to get out.</li>
            <li> suppose my only complaint is the LED is not very bright to illuminate the cutting area.  </li>
            <li> But if having five o&#x27;clock shadow in my nose and having to trim a little more often than I did with my last trimmer (which was crap by the way) is the worst thing that could happen to me, then I&#x27;ll be alright..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several nose trimmers over the last 15 years, and some have been real torture tools--so bad that I tossed them out--really disgusted with them and absolutely appalled that manufacturers would even bring them to market when they cause that much pain.  </li>
            <li> Base is wide enough that it stands upright in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I see this is a common complaint.  </li>
            <li> The all steel body and cutting head makes short work of any noise hair you have in seconds.</li>
            <li> ToiletTree Products emailed me immediately after I wrote a negative review and offered a replacement.  </li>
            <li> it had only one cutting blade instead of two.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay attention to the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for at least three weeks</li>
            <li> Which brings me to the next disappointment.</li>
            <li> [and I have tried at least 6 others]&lt;br /&gt;enjoy</li>
            <li> Not nearly as effective as this one.</li>
            <li> and then the on/off switch jammed rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> aversion to cutting my nose hairs has been replaced with a knowing awareness that the task is finally painless.  </li>
            <li> There is a lot of negative talk about nose hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shoddy product and shoddy customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have nothing negative to report.  </li>
            <li> I have some thick nose hair.</li>
            <li> It also requires the use of two hands and is a slow process.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous and slow putting it in my nose but soon realized that my eyes were tearing up but not from pain.  </li>
            <li> I was forced to take the battery out to keep it off.  </li>
            <li> I am forced to choose a Star</li>
            <li> I have thick hairs.</li>
            <li> The ToiletTree nose clipper WORKS in my thickly hairy nose.</li>
            <li> It cuts my thick nose hair, just as promised.</li>
            <li> No better than the the less expensive panasonic model.</li>
            <li> Tried new batteries to no avail. :(</li>
            <li> Some were just plain poor quality.  </li>
            <li> you hear it cutting, you see less and less (nose or ear) hair as you use it, but you do not feel a thing...</li>
            <li> NO more tickling nose hairs!</li>
            <li> No more using scissors or plucking out hairs with tears!</li>
            <li> Problems can arise, i mean i don&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> No more sticking scissors into my nostrils!</li>
            <li> I picked this trimmer over other brands because of the commitment to quality, which I&#x27;m sad to say just doesn&#x27;t hit the mark because paying money for a defective unit should NOT be a hoop for consumers to jump through.</li>
            <li> They mean it when they say they&#x27;ll take care of</li>
            <li> Furthermore, even if it were to fail, the company seems to be actively engaged with its customers, with the CEO himself interacting with customers here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The parts in side the cutting head are delicate and you can really mess them up if have a heavy touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 years old and finally got tired of my HS friend being disgusted about my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Not much more you could ask for at this stage of the game.</li>
            <li> This trimmer never turned on and the battery cap was nearly impossible to put back on.</li>
            <li> Seriously-</li>
            <li> Using a scissor of any size is difficult and less functional.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to get the cap back on once you put the battery in.  </li>
            <li> ALL since it is weak , not effective in removing ear or nose hair...</li>
            <li> It seems like it is a little difficult for the hair to get caught (and cut) by the blades.  </li>
            <li> I think he&#x27;s a little sad about saying goodbye to his nose hairs</li>
            <li> well if I am careful to turn the end as I push the cutting tip into my nose, but</li>
            <li> If I forget to stop pushing it into my nose when I&#x27;m not turning the end, the trimmer then acts like a massive needle nose pliers and painfully yanks on the hairs in my nose.  </li>
            <li> Sad I didn&#x27;t do this a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just plain difficult to move</li>
            <li> Base is still somewhat loose and does not fit snuggly against the bottom.  </li>
            <li> The battery was hard to get in, I had to squeeze on the on switch real hard to get it to turn on, and keep pressure applied to it, took 2 hands to squeeze.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> FINALLY, and end to cutting the inside of my nose w/ scissors!</li>
            <li> and I had to turn To a different tool to get my desired result :(((</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am not PLEASED.</li>
            <li> I have tried every trimmer out there over the years only to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Weak motor.  </li>
            <li> immediate impression was that it was weak and poorly made</li>
            <li> Being made of steel, we were afraid it would be heavy; but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> However I was rather annoyed it did not come with a battery.  </li>
            <li> Worked poorly for me -</li>
            <li> End battery cap that holds the battery in the base broke the second time that I removed it.  </li>
            <li> I just think the battery end cap is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> A lot of trimmers are pencil thin in diameter</li>
            <li> Now I have a broken &amp;#34;lifetime&amp;#34</li>
            <li> years younger not having annoying hairs hanging out of my nose.</li>
            <li> Mr. Steve Parisi stands behind his product.</li>
            <li> Just not great.</li>
            <li> The base is not closing properly and the item is not turning on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is actually a total piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> Broken upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> That seems like a poor design choice for a device that is going to get stuck into my nose.  </li>
            <li> My husband was not happy with the way this trimmer worked.  </li>
            <li> so I just run cold water on it a few times while I use it.</li>
            <li> These days, poor build quality and even poorer customer service have become the norm.</li>
            <li> poor hubby) and</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t keep in business with this type of service if you&#x27;re selling poor quality.  </li>
            <li> and I have no air-tight proof behind this claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really poor design and material choice on that</li>
            <li> Opened the lid-the blade had broken and fallen</li>
            <li> I was tired of ripping them out with my Gerber Multitool.</li>
            <li> We always stand 100% behind all of our products.</li>
            <li> Switch Was broken.</li>
            <li> Bottom screw-on base not go back on!  </li>
            <li> I have had painful experiences with other well known brands.  </li>
            <li> Got sick of using tweezers on the random long nose hairs and figured it was time to get a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Again, when I was getting no more cutting sounds from my ears, I shut the beast off and prepared myself for inspection.  </li>
            <li> I grew tired of standing there for five minutes with a noisy little gadget up my nose and still seeing those ugly hairs sticking out.</li>
            <li> I hardly know if it is cutting hairs in my nose.  </li>
            <li> It does not get dull and start ripping out the hairs instead of cutting them like a couple of others I have tried.</li>
            <li> And if it does fail in time, the company appears to stand behind their product with a lifetime guarantee.</li>
            <li> I am an old man with hair in my ears and nose that is very annoying.</li>
            <li> Also the long cord was annoying and messy and the charger base increased the room that it took up.</li>
            <li> All others have failed in comparison.</li>
            <li> hate flimsy, jamming nose, ear and facial hair trimmers, nothing quite as annoyingly painful as a pulled nose hair.(sorry</li>
            <li> I especially had difficulty with ONE hair which was at the very base of the inside of my nose.  </li>
            <li> It trimmed my nose hairs with some difficulty leaving stubble behind in my nose!</li>
            <li> /&gt;you won&#x27;t be sorry with this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like another reviewer reported, I was unable to close the unit once it was opened to insert the battery.</li>
            <li> You have difficult time to do the job...</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of difficult attempts with scissors or ineffective electric trimmers that do nothing.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with buying any ToiletTree product.  </li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> There were some stubborn hairs that I was unable to remove (I tried on separate occasions)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this product.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I would not buy another.</li>
            <li> If you sadly find your nostrils in need of deforestation, this is the tool for you.</li>
            <li> If you need one (and who doesn&#x27;t) get this one, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to return this for a refund.</li>
            <li> the trimming experience was so scary to him.</li>
            <li> but I had a difficult time getting it to work.  </li>
            <li> Cap difficult to screw on.</li>
            <li> Sadly that was not the case.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say</li>
            <li> Trimming with sissors is difficult.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ve been blessed with nasal hair that has the strength of carbon fiber ...</li>
            <li> Mine is stripped, or manufactured wrong.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but does the job well.</li>
            <li> I find it a bit silly leaving a review a week after I get a product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had a piece break off when it dropped.</li>
            <li> Not good!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband, and he, who does not give stars casually, says this deserves five stars.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality control.</li>
            <li> So much less painful than using a tweezers!</li>
            <li> Some just drove me crazy with the noise in my ear, others just pulled and tugged the wrong way.  </li>
            <li> This was tedious, awkward and sometimes I cut myself.</li>
            <li> I think the plastuc that keeps the razor portion on the base is too weak.</li>
            <li> The cutting tip does not pull on the nose hairs as others I have owned.</li>
            <li> I do not worry about cutting my face or skin.</li>
            <li> Panasonic didn&#x27;t make that one anymore, so I tried another Panasonic--bad idea--just ripped out my nose hairs instead of cutting them.  </li>
            <li> As for the trimmer, it works as advertised, and I no longer worry about cutting the inside of my nose with a scissors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to need to return this item to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding ear hair grows like crazy and where there never was before.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m afraid it may get damaged if I don&#x27;t keep it on there.</li>
            <li> Cutting head is somewhat blunt and doesn&#x27;t catch some hair in nose &amp; ear channels.</li>
            <li> The clippers require an awkward angle to shine on what you&#x27;re aiming for.  </li>
            <li> 10 minutes wasted of my life fooling with this piece of crap!</li>
            <li> So for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the ToiletTree Nose &amp; Ear Trimmer!</li>
            <li> sounds, and not once have I had an unpleasant tug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of trimmers from expensive scissors to electric and all failed miserably.</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to put the battery cover on.  </li>
            <li> The end cap is impossible to attach.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll let you know if anything bad happens, like pulling nose hairs or just dosen&#x27;t cut the hair.</li>
            <li> .......very bad</li>
            <li> Too bad: I started with 5 stars for design, box, and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad one, however, I am returning.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t painful</li>
            <li> I purchased another battery one (forgot the brand name) and it too was extremely painful to use.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a painful experience, where the blades would catch on nasal hairs and cause the motor to stop.</li>
            <li> they chewed it off which was rather painful.</li>
            <li> It did not perform well, it just didn&#x27;t seem to get my nose hairs trimmed and did a lot of painful pulling.</li>
            <li> When inserted into the ear canal, the noise is painful.</li>
            <li> I used to use the WAHL nose trimmer and quite frustrated it.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was generally disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> guarantee you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Probably to prevent injury/liability by working too well :(.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> My nose hairs are really annoying and unsightly.</li>
            <li> As a result, the blade doesn&#x27;t stay attached to the base anymore</li>
            <li> Used to hate trimming</li>
            <li> I decided that a lifetime product warranty was worthless if there is no way to either call or email ToiletTree if there is a problem.</li>
            <li> Junky crap,</li>
            <li> I removed the battery and found no approach could reattach the base to the unit.</li>
            <li> I hate that I need it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull the crap out of your nose.</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> The screw in base is plastic, and it screws in to plastic.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> this one is almost impossible to cut or hurt yourself!</li>
            <li> I bought this after I had to throw away a &amp;#34;Panasonic&amp;#34; one that was really bad !</li>
            <li> Ouch, very painful.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Had others &amp; was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed...</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S DISGUSTING!</li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve had in my life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it works as advertised and seems to do the (rather disgusting) trick quite well.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get to use once and not trying another one of these awful products.</li>
            <li> Here are all the disgusting details:  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Substantial feel.  Works great</li>
            <li> finally one that works. Well built, solid. I will be buying another one to put away, as the old saying goes two is one , one is none thanks.</li>
            <li> This unit is better than the pictures show! I was impressed with the quality of this item and the price. When I received it, the order was on time and perfectly packed and shipped. It  worked perfectly right out of the box, and quieter than the previous trimmer I had from a leading? mfg. As my name states, I do not purchase anything before I review what the &amp;#34;real people&amp;#34; think of a product. What impressed me with this seller, is their customer satisfaction culture. This seller&#x27;s priority is customer satisfaction for his buyers. He knows &amp;#34;we&amp;#34; are his most important product, and treats us that way. You can read that in the reviews. Hey, things happen, we all know that, but the important fact is, does the seller/mfg take care of &amp;#34;us&amp;#34; when a problem/situation occurs? Well, the last mfg didn&#x27;t that I dealt with, and did not care to resolve the problem, so in the trash went his product and any future sales, they did not have the customer satisfaction culture in their business. ToiletTree Products sell competitively prices items, ship on time and back everything they sell with their guaranteed customer satisfaction, if you&#x27;r not happy, they&#x27;re not happy, and they will make sure you are. I can&#x27;t be more satisfied with this being my first time experience with ToiletTree Products, I will be back.</li>
            <li> Works Great!  Wonderful tool.</li>
            <li> Works better than i thought it would..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get quite close enough but works okay otherwise</li>
            <li> The best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It has a slightly larger blade and it trims closer without grabbing.  Sturdy to hold, and the light is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> The call this a nose hair trimmer. That is correct; just don&#x27;t try to trim a second hair. It jams continuously.</li>
            <li> Great quality product. I have been buying &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; trimmers for years and this one is by far the best quality. I am a hairy man with hairy ancestors and so, to avoid all those curious stares that come with being a bushman I try to maintain all of those places where hairs seem to startle peoples sensibility. Previous trimmers have always sounded like they were self destructing when attempting to trim the hedges. The pitiful screeching, grinding and garbage disposal noises made me think that nothing short of a chainsaw would be able to cut them trees. Not so with this product. Upon contact with my nose mane this trimmer reminded me of a Jedi Knight light saber taking down a Sith Lord. The force is strong with this one! So, if you are one of those fortunate beings like me that are blessed with nose/ear hairs that would withstand the full forces of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, then this is the trimmer you have been looking for. William Walace&#x27;s 2 handed sword has nothing on this nose saber. I promise, if you throw down and purchase this trimmer, you will not only be pleased with the results, but your girlfriend (or boyfriend) will not hesitate to lock on to your lips now that the fearful octopoid hairs that resided in that reef of a nose have been decimated.  You will thank me. If your significant other does not assault your lips....well...I can recommend a breath mint.</li>
            <li> I am an extremly busy person amd was just going to forget this,  but you asked. The service and price were excellent. The product, made in china is junk. It didnt work right out of the box. Tgw cap to hold in the battery is plastic and wont stay clipped down to make a connection with the battery.  With a better cap it would be fine.</li>
            <li> bought for my husband and he says it is definitely a 5 star trimmer. he likes the round rotation of it and the light that shows here the hairs are.  most of all he likes that it doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs. ouch!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that has nose or ear hair.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product!  My husband loves this trimmer.  It has a nice feel in the hand.  It operates very smoothly and cuts great.  Being made of steel, we were afraid it would be heavy; but it&#x27;s not.  The LED light works great for in the nostril.  We are very pleased with this product and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is the one that works. I like it better than any I have tried before. Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised!  I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> I posted a review for this item last week, and it mysteriously disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of major issues with this product - one, it didn&#x27;t work right out of the box. I had to read a tutorial on how to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; it before it would finally work.  That should not happen!  Two, it heats up VERY quickly and is uncomfortable to use for more than a few seconds at a time.  Third, the fact that &amp;#34;someone&amp;#34; removed my critical review speaks volumes about the validity of all these 5-star reviews that we see here.</li>
            <li> Unlike the two previous name brand trimmers I have purchased, this one is actually works! This is a perfect example of, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  It is made of quality materials, and well designed. It even has a light to help you find those errant hairs. Also you get a lifetime warranty that I hope I never use.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, cut hair quickly, worked exactly as advertised. Received quickly as stated also. Works great and I love it. Great quality not all plastic like most of the other makers use.</li>
            <li> This works well and the light is great. I have to put pressure on to really get a good clean cut but it isn&#x27;t painful and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Advertised to come with a battery, but I had to buy one to use it. Seems to work fine, I hope it lasts a quarter as long as the lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li> Product works as well as to be expected</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he thinks it&#x27;s great.  He was excited that it works well and was inexpensive.  I can&#x27;t say how I feel it works, but if the boyfriends happy, so am I!</li>
            <li> Works great. No pulling of nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I received it in only a couple days. It seems to be working great so far. Seems to be solidly built.</li>
            <li> Battery compartment cover could not to be closed. The closing mechanism was defective.</li>
            <li> arrived timely works as expected thanks to everyone</li>
            <li> This is the only nose trimmer I am not scared to stick in my nose.  Other trimmers pull hair and hurt, but this one does not.  Also other trimmers don&#x27;t do a good job - but this one leaves smooth hairless skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works perfect, I would recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent unit !&lt;br /&gt;The finest that I have ever owned !</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.  Is quiet and did a good job of trimming.</li>
            <li> Powerful and works well</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS GREAT, PERFECT.</li>
            <li> cut hairs efficiently, very satisfied once I got the back cap to stay in place to engage the battery.</li>
            <li> What a difference!  works great</li>
            <li> Works well as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve had. (I dropped the first one on the bathroom floor and it broke, so.....not anyone&#x27;s fault but mine.) After researching the available grooming products, and buying many of them, for years, this seems to be the most durable and best one &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34;. It feels solid, does an excellent job of a difficult task and inspires confidence that it will keep doing so. So...as soon as I broke my first one, I had no hesitation in ordering a second, new one. I got it promptly.</li>
            <li> great litle gadget with it&#x27;s own light to see those pesky hairs!</li>
            <li> This works very well. No complaints. I have had it for several months, and used it many times.&lt;br /&gt;If I have any issues I will report them, but for now, the trimmer is working great.</li>
            <li> My nose hairs are really annoying and unsightly. I had a Conair for years that worked ok. It finally broke and I purchased this model. I couldn&#x27;t be any happier.  No tugging, pulling or discomfort. Easy to clean. If it breaks I&#x27;ll buy another one in a flash.  Really great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two other trimmers - not this brand - and although I&#x27;ve just used this one twice so far, it is way, way better than what I&#x27;ve had before.&lt;br /&gt;Great little unit, trims like a champ.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; solid. Outside steel, though surprised blade shift is plastic while my Panasonic is metal. Works great now, &amp; blades are metal, so it should still hold up well. LIKE THE SOLID FEEL.</li>
            <li> Works great, and feels very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Like the light, also has decent amount of power behind it.  Seems to be a well made product.</li>
            <li> Nice solid unit.  Base is wide enough that it stands upright in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Works great, no bogging down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big but I guess it has to be to have all that power. Works great, wished they made yard equipment because this really mows and trims.</li>
            <li> I am returning these as they do leave a &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34;. lol</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works as advertised.  I&#x27;ve tried several trimmers that don&#x27;t work at all or work for a while then quit.  This product has been great.  No regrets.</li>
            <li> VERY  nice product. Does the job very well for one time use so far. Appears to be very well built and I really like the led light. Very cool. I hear the customer service is fantastic for this clipper which means alot. Lifetime warranty is fantastic. Buy one if you need a new trimmer, you cant go wrong! A+</li>
            <li> My husband has tried a lot of trimmers and this is the best. It doesn&#x27;t pull hair and is easy to clean. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice product and speedy delivery! Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Well, I only had one similar gadget and this one is pretty good. But no miracles</li>
            <li> I was looking for a heavy duty trimmer not the usual plastic design with a weak motor. When I read the description especially with the lifetime warranty it seemed to be jus what I was looking for...then it arrived&lt;br /&gt;I undid I as per the instructions in order to insert a battery&lt;br /&gt;I got the battery in then the cover would not lock into place&lt;br /&gt;After repeated attempts to secure the cover I gave up but I still wanted an idea of how powerful the motor was so I held the battery cover on with my thumb and turned it on&lt;br /&gt;Nothing&lt;br /&gt;The battery was unused brand new&lt;br /&gt;This was my experience I&#x27;m not saying this product performs like this for everyone it may be a great product but one observation I was left with was that it didn&#x27;t feel like it had any steel in it at all&lt;br /&gt;My immediate impression was that it was weak and poorly made</li>
            <li> High quality unit, works well, feels solid. Unlike the best-selling cheap junk, I think this one will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Works great for the price, bought several for christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Received product, placed batteries, did not work. Will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Took the product out of the box and noticed immediately that it falls apart in your hands. Battery cover will not stay on. Couldn&#x27;t get the product to work at all so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness. Returning it now.</li>
            <li> This is the best nose trimmer I&#x27;ve bought yet, and I&#x27;ve bought quite a few. The LED light is a huge plus feature that I didn&#x27;t give a second thought too when I first ordered these.</li>
            <li> The bottom would not stay on so the battery kept falling out.</li>
            <li> Great buy.  it does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> My husband has three different nose trimmers and this is the best! It does a great job at getting all the hair and it even has a light so you can see better when trimming. Very happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li> Does a great job trimming ear and nose hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  He loves that it cuts close and is painless. It is lightweight, easy to use and the LED light is a plus.  The product shipped fast and the price is a good value.</li>
            <li> Much better than the last cheap thing I had.  Just wish I could buy one that does not make the cut hairs like mini daggers inside your nose :-)</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent service and monitoring, especially pleased me to communicate with me to ask if everything was ok, excellent after sales</li>
            <li> This does everything it promises to do. It feels solid and works well.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have used. It may cost a bit more than other trimmers but it is well worth the price. Not to mention it has a lifetime warranty. I have used two other brands which did not do a good job. This one seems to cut better and feels better in your hand.</li>
            <li> IT IS OK, MY HUSBAND WASN&#x27;T TO IMPRESSED THO</li>
            <li> A good trimmer for the price. It works very well.</li>
            <li> Works great and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting to use the product &amp; I will need help from family. He has used the product long enough to see its value. So far it works fine &amp; I&#x27;m pleased. I will give it time to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Disappointed...would never buy again.</li>
            <li> So far the trimmer is working fine, I&#x27;ll let you know if anything bad happens, like pulling nose hairs or just dosen&#x27;t cut the hair.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to clean</li>
            <li> I wish I had purchased this years ago. Very well made, easy to handle and clean. This unit arrived earlier than first posted, so I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Now to test it out for long term use.</li>
            <li> This is the best nose trimmer available.  I bought one a while ago, and had to purchase another, since my husband tried mine, and decided it was the best trimmer he&#x27;s every had!  I&#x27;m planning to give them as stocking stuffers to all my adult children.  Shipping was right on time.  Great product and service.</li>
            <li> Ordered and received exactly as described. The LED light is a real plus.</li>
            <li> Heavier than others tried. To date the product is trimming just as I have wanted. Seems to be of better quality than other models tried.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I messed up.  I used the trimmer once and the instructions say to rinse the trimmer out by taking off the black cap and rinsing the cap upside down.  I thought I should shake it to get all the water out.  I did and the white cutting blade fell out and, because I didn&#x27;t have the screen in place over the drain, the blade went down the drain.  Yes, I might be able to open the drain trap and find it, but yuk.  So I ordered another one, though I may still open the drain.  I liked the way the trimmer works and it appears well built, but be forewarned about the blade.</li>
            <li> I just got this. No flaws as some previous reviews indicate. It seems much more substantial than the el cheapo I had before. I had never been comfortable sticking sharp sissors up my nose. OK, I can&#x27;t spell.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expections!  Much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> Nose hair tickles me so much it drive me crazy so this is a great help</li>
            <li> excellent product.  works exactly as advertized</li>
            <li> Good product, reasonable price</li>
            <li> This is excellent.  Effective and quiet.  Very efficient, though I don&#x27;t see much use for the light.</li>
            <li> Great nose trimmer. The light is kind of useless, but as far as the nose trimmer, it seems more sturdy and seems to have better blades than the little 9.99 ones I used to buy from Norelco and Panasonic. It cuts right through and there is no pulling. For some reason nose hair trimmers always seem to break on me, but I have had this one for about 6 months and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> works very well; no pinching or pulling very smooth trim.</li>
            <li> much better than the old one from Sharper Image and less $</li>
            <li> Has a nice feel to it. Solid!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love the lite.</li>
            <li> This Works excellent. I have bought several of these in a target store and have never had very much success. The blades are not very sharp and the motor doesn&#x27;t seem to turn fast enough and it ends up just pulling the hairs out instead of cutting.  I really enjoy my new one.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a number of these type trimmers over the years and have enjoyed using them.  But I was pleasantly surprised when I first tried this one.  It was smooth and pleasant to use with no harshness or tickle, either in my nose or ears.  I asked my wife to trim my ears.  She was impressed with the built-in light.  Its cutting action is crisp and precise with relatively quiet little snippy sounds.  There is a feel of quality to this unit that far exceeds any price difference.  I highly recommend it as to performance.  As to durability, I have owned it for only a short time but have the utmost confidence in it.</li>
            <li> AWSOME PRODUCT, there isent a better one out there</li>
            <li> I bought this exclusively for the lifetime warranty. Frankly, I&#x27;ve gone through so many of these things (embarrassingly enough) over the years, the lifetime warranty was the reason I bought it. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times, and I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I hope ToiletTree will be around for my lifetime! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than most we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well and easy to clean. The only issue is the metal tip gets hot pretty quickly due to the friction of the circular rotation of the cutting blade. This can prevent me from completely finishing my trimming in one setting which can be frustrating at times. I have never found a great trimmer in this realm, but this product does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all i could say about this product, doesn&#x27;t hurt feels premium and has a handy little light too. I would recommend this to anyone whose looking for a nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> The product arrived and my husband has used it and is happy with it.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other trimmers I have tried.</li>
            <li> Looks good but doesn&#x27;t do the job as expected</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband as a mini surprise present. He loves this thing. its small, travel friendly, has a light and NEVER cuts him (unlike scissors)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He purchased a number of cheaper ones over the years. Before using it, he said it has to be good, just by the feel I know it&#x27;s a quality item. After using it, he said we&#x27;ll buy 3 more when birthdays for our son and son-in-law come around. Oh, the 3rd one he wants to give to his best friend who he says needs it badly... Glad I found you Toilet Tree:)</li>
            <li> Very good product! Only uses one battery and easy to change. Feels good and solid, not like those cheap plastic ones.&lt;br /&gt;Also received an email from customer service to make sure every thing was ok, and that is great service!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> This is my first nose hair trimmer, and it works great. I don&#x27;t have a lot of nose hair, but one pokes out once in a while, so I wanted to get in the habit of regularly trimming. It&#x27;s also great for trimming a mustache - easier than scissors, and since it only cuts one or two hairs at a time it is a lot safer than hair clippers which can chop way too much off in the blink of an eye.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it was so practical this nose hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many other brands online and from the market and bought&lt;br /&gt; 3 of them which ended in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer which I received was fantastic and easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;the built-in light worked good with me and helped seeing and locating every&lt;br /&gt;single hair in my nose.&lt;br /&gt;The price of this device is reasonable and not expensive towards its quality.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone who have nose hair to trim or cut off</li>
            <li> FINALLY, and end to cutting the inside of my nose w/ scissors!</li>
            <li> This works as well as units that cost three times as much. Ideal for travel. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great thing is it cuts and does not pull hair.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks experience, this trimmer seems to work fine. The product has a steel casing and appears to be solidly constructed, it&#x27;s easy to clean and service from the vendor was fast and courteous.</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. I received it quickly and it was well priced. Very happy with the whole experience.</li>
            <li> Better than most.  Works very well.  But don&#x27;t drop it, you might break the blade assembly.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd unit.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love it.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have used, cuts the hair nice and short and doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs when you use it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this at request of my husband. He is happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Had a different model that used to tweak and pull, but then it&#x27;s now over 10 years old and finally found a really great product.  This one is so easy to use, does not tweak or pull very gentle on the nose and does a wonderful job.  Easy to clean and store.  Great product, would highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do but remarkably better than trimmers 4 times the price.  It&#x27;s quiet, efficient, light-weight and trims nose/ears hairs quickly and painlessly.  A great buy.</li>
            <li> excellent product works very well.</li>
            <li> High quality product for an attractive price. Excellent and timely service. They get five stars from me.</li>
            <li> Works great and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Good trimmer. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Great product for me. I&#x27;ve always had nose hairs sticking out and it does not look great. This trimmer fixed that and it also does ear hair! My ears are smooth and hair-free for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> It seems to do a much better job than my previous nose hair remover.  However I was rather annoyed it did not come with a battery.  I ordered it at a hotel and had to get a battery which was a royal pain.  I purchased a Gillette razor in a store which came with a battery.  I hope there is a legal stipulation that does not allow companies to mail/fedex/ups batteries.  If not lack of a battery is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit bulky but it does the best job on trimming nose hairs that I ever had with other devices.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and as advertised. NO more tickling nose hairs!</li>
            <li> It works ok. I&#x27;ve only used it once though.&lt;br /&gt;I need to see how long battery lasts and how long it stays sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I does seem sturdy though.</li>
            <li> Works okay for my needs.</li>
            <li> Great product. Solid device.</li>
            <li> I originally bought one of these for myself and really liked it, I have so far bought 3 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged from retailer. Product was as described.  works well and the light is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li> Very good heavy duty and the on/off switch works fine.</li>
            <li> Effective, painless, and easy to clean. No issues at this point.</li>
            <li> It was good while it lasted.  Every time I used it, I was astounded that the battery hadn&#x27;t died yet... then I replaced it anyway because it really felt like the battery should be dead by then.  Anyway, I dropped it less than a foot and the little plastic &#x27;catch&#x27; that holds the blade portion to the body chipped off.  As a result, the blade doesn&#x27;t stay attached to the base anymore and I can&#x27;t use it.  I see this is a common complaint.  Bummer, really... I liked this guy.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product!  No more tweezers and the pain and tears that comes with that procedure.  In addition the procedure is performed in 1 to 2 minutes as apposed to 20 to 30 minutes with tweezers.  The trim is very close with absolutely no pain and no tears.  This trimmer is second to none!</li>
            <li> Item was as described on Amazon.  Item appears better constructed then other trimmers I have owned and works well.  The LED light is a big plus.</li>
            <li> It works great, thanks!</li>
            <li> excellent product, excellent service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several different brands of nose trimmers in the past. All of them seemed to cut/rip my nose hairs. I thought it was normal that your eyes should water while trimming hair. I thought I&#x27;d give this model a try based on all the reviews I read. I immediately took it for a test drive when it was delivered today. I was ready to wince as I began trimming, however I only heard the sound of the trimmer….no pulling or ripping. What a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer. Works great, built well and very reasonably price. Used to hate trimming but now it&#x27;s so easy and quick.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and it works great! Very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Well built, solid product, much better than cheaper plastic imitations. Works like a champ!  Excellent value.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine.  Only used it a few times so far, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  I have purchase several nose trimmers form drug stores over the years and found none of them really trimmed any hairs too well. I have some thick nose hair.This one really does cut my nose hairs very easily. It works great. Would like to see them make one with a cord .  The price was really good too&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Works very well. I really like it !!!!!</li>
            <li> Best nose hair trimmer I have ever bought!!! Must purchase of you need one that really works.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. It works perfectly and is very good quality for the price!! I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks but believe with regular cleaning it should last a very long time. Happy so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other battery powered trimmers and scissors and didn&#x27;t like either.</li>
            <li> Have only used the product a couple of times, bu, speed seems excellent and was very comfortable.Onlu</li>
            <li> Received promptly and a really great product.</li>
            <li> Had an issue initially with the battery cap.  Company contacted me and their recommendation on correcting the issue resolved the issue.  Base is still somewhat loose and does not fit snuggly against the bottom.  Had to play with it a bit to get the contacts right and get the unit to turn on.  Is working now and doing the job.</li>
            <li> The light is a definite plus.  Although my husband hasn&#x27;t used it in the shower, we have used it to trim ear and nose hair.  It does a neat job and runs quiet compared to the old trimmer.</li>
            <li> As described. One thing I must say is that trimmers with the cylinder head are the best bet. The ones with the &#x27;flat&#x27; head should be avoided.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal, heavy-duty, as advertised.  All others have failed in comparison.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, well made, and tough does the job, without pulling the hair or jamming , as happens with less well constructed trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;I brought two, when I got the first one I purchased a second as a gift....&lt;br /&gt;I hate flimsy, jamming nose, ear and facial hair trimmers, nothing quite as annoyingly painful as a pulled nose hair.(sorry gross)&lt;br /&gt;Not a problem with this product....I do recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an old one that needed to seriously thrown out. I really like how the trimmer itself has 8 flat surfaces instead of it totally being a flat cylinder- much better grip with this unit. The light that is next to the trimmer tip, adds a nice touch and is super handy when the light isn&#x27;t that great. Great product and great deal. I highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> Love this product and I have spread the word to my buddies</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband and he loves it</li>
            <li> Compact, solidly built,almost looks like a sonic screwdriver, and does it&#x27;s job like it was designed to. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both electric and manual ear and nose trimmers.  ToiletTree&#x27;s professional nose and facial hair trimmer does the job very nicely and doesn&#x27;t cause any pain when trimming nose hair like some other popular and well-known electric trimmers.  I&#x27;m happy with the product and would recommend it to others.  The LED light doesn&#x27;t matter for nose, but is useful for trimming eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Great item, would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It was not as expected however it does perform the task</li>
            <li> Good product, nice feel and weight. Difficult changing battery and putting cover back on.</li>
            <li> Solid.  Does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Works great no issues!</li>
            <li> It cuts nose hairs.  What else can you say.  Ergonomics?  Who cares. Battery life?  Not sure yet.  Feels solid though.</li>
            <li> It has a little bulk and girth to it making it easy for us guys to handle. The cutting tip does not pull on the nose hairs as others I have owned. The motor is strong as well. All debris is captured in the removable head. Simply rotate the head, (coned area) use the included brush to clean all debris and then restore the head for use. Did I say it has a LIFETIME warranty! Others of lower quality that I have purchased have only had a 90 day or 1 year warranty and certainly was not water resistant. 2 AA Batteries.</li>
            <li> This item seems to be a very good product, it has worked well for what I needed it for so far.</li>
            <li> Great for my husband but bought it for me. It is a little much for me but husband loves it.  I bought a Phillips Precision one for myself as well.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get battery cover to stay attached. Item was returned and credit promptly received. Not sure if will order again</li>
            <li> Great product! Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> WoW! This is a nose and ear hair trimmer!! I&#x27;ve gone though three different models and none of them do the job. Most stall and pull hair or don&#x27;t cut very good. This one gets every hair, doesn&#x27;t stall or pull, and is very comfortable to use. Very easy to clean under running tap water per instructions.&lt;br /&gt;The company sent followup notes informing when the product shipped and another asking if I was satisfied. GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SERVICE!&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to use Toilet Tree Products in the future!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> as advertised. good product</li>
            <li> My wife uses these and her last one was not built as well as this one so she is happy with it.  Happy wife --  happy life.</li>
            <li> I find your product very efficient and easy to handle. It has become one of the accessories in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than the name brands, well designed, very effective for nose and ear hair, is a sturdy and not too loud trimmer.  So far very happy with this purchase, and recommend it if you are looking for a good quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as in I have to do all sorts of things to get it to go ON.  I remove and replace the battery, I shake it. I push up and down on the power button several times and it all takes about a minute.  It&#x27;s been like this since day 1.  I think I got a defective one and should have returned it.  Once it starts it works fine.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with the unit because it arrived without a trimmer head.  All I can say is WOW!  They sent me a new one without even having to return the old one.&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but the part-owner of the company called and apologized for the mistake. I have never gotten that great of a service from any company before.&lt;br /&gt;I am also happy that it does not snag hairs like some cheaper units.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Good quality!  Just what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> was very disappointed. Product arrived. It looked and felt substantial BUT when we put battery in, it was not possible to close the cover. We shipped it back and got a refund.</li>
            <li> This product looks good In the box only  Performance  is below average. The trimmer blades which seller boosts are no were close to what is described in product review. I am disappointed. You may charge little more money and sell a better product.</li>
            <li> No. Only owned for about 30 minutes. Paid the high price because I wanted something that would outlast cheap trimmers.  Opened the box, took the end cap off to insert a battery and the cap would not go back on.  Threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality of materials, build and operation.  Better than advertised. The RPM&#x27;s are fast, quiet, smooth and efficient.  Performance is superior to my former Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and worked as advertised.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not very strong and a little overpriced but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty construction, trims ALL the hair in my nose VERY quickly and painlessly. If you want a sturdy no nonsense nose trimmer look no further.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Great service from ToiletTree Products.</li>
            <li> One of the best investments I&#x27;ve made. This trimmer feels high quality and is easy to use. There&#x27;s even a light that allows you to see up your nose.</li>
            <li> Product represents everything stated by the seller.  Works well.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I received the product today. Opened it up, inserted the battery, and the battery cover would not go back on. Nor would the device turn on when I taped the battery cover onto the device so it would not fall off. In short, the product did not work. Extremely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Works really good and is quiet and doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband.  He uses hearing aids and the large amount of ear hair he grows interferes with their use.  This trimmer mows them down and close so he is very happy ti have them.</li>
            <li> Received the item today. unscrewed battery compartment, placced batter in (postive side first, towards cutting blade). Tried to put the battery cover  back on, but its immediately stripped some plastic piece on the inside of the cover rendering it unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the manufacturer and after explaining the issue and trying a few fixes, they are sending me out a new unit tomorrow. Great customer service!</li>
            <li> Very good clipper and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Used it as soon as I got it and it works good. Will do follow up in a couple of months and see if it still works as good.</li>
            <li> The second time I went to use this product, the on/off lever fell off!  The product is now unusable.  This is the second out of two times that I have bought a defective product from Toilet Tree Products!  Their products are obviously cheaply made and they should not be allowed to sell on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful little trimmer. It works well.</li>
            <li> Despite &amp;#34;steel&amp;#34; in the name, this is largely loose-fitting plastic parts - and too many parts to get separated.  Fairly noisy to operate, especially of course when trimming in ears.  Worked poorly for me - didn&#x27;t trim very closely, required multiple passes.  Despite similar shape to mechanical rotary trimmers, it seems to just vibrate a tiny blade back and forth.  Stopped working altogether after less than a year of occasional use.  I replaced it with the smaller metal Groom Mate mechanical rotary trimmer which has actual rotary metal on metal blades and does a better job without the noise and battery.</li>
            <li> This is what I call nice and neat so everybody clean up</li>
            <li> Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loved it.... then my son wanted wanted one so I had to buy a second one.  Very fast delivery. Good service and great product.</li>
            <li> This seems to be an excellent product, Delivery was quick and product was thus far everything it was advertised as.</li>
            <li> Very well made and does a great job and would recommend</li>
            <li> It does its job. The light seems kinda pointless, but I can see how it&#x27;d be useful. Gave it four stars because like others have said it does get hot if I have it running for a while. No big deal really as I just run some cool water over it.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. High quality, high speed, great product!</li>
            <li> Embarrassing to write a review about this, but, well, we all have nose hair.  This works great.  Fast and effective.  Love how easily it cleans up and the light is a bonus.</li>
            <li> After receipt and installing a battery, (which was very easy, I might add) this product has been great to use and clean.  I am very satisfied and am pleased with the quality of this little device as well as it&#x27;s built-in light.  Since it is an LED light there is relatively no battery drain whatsoever.  I would recommend this to my friends who have nasal hair to trim as I do.</li>
            <li> GOOD SOLID PRODUCT , DOES THE JOB IT WAS MEANT TO DO............</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and very nice and study product.  Runs nice and smooth. Love the lifetime warranty!!</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written but I feel this deserves one.  I happen to be one of those women with noticeable nose hair. I&#x27;ve tried several different trimmers, but this is the first and only one to truly work.  I can tell the difference after one use. Now I don&#x27;t have to be so self-conscious about this problem. What a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> Solid piece of hygiene equipment here. Feels good and works great!</li>
            <li> Arrived ahead of scheduled date. have not used it long enough to review. did a better job than my old clipper.</li>
            <li> Just received this week.  It is good quality, NOT made of cheap plastic material.  So far it has worked very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best trimmer that I&#x27;ve ever owned. No pulling or snagging. Very happy customer!!</li>
            <li> This product is very well made; solid and dependable.  The LED light is a big plus.  I am very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Quick service!</li>
            <li> Better than I expected. This is the only one I&#x27;ve owned that actually trims the nose hair, not just pulls it out.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Great product -- first one ever thar really works-- and so easily!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> So far works great.  Have had trimmers in this style that did not cut the hairs, but this one does very well, no discomfort.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product and this company. Great product, great service!</li>
            <li> Solid, well-built, and does the job.  But, it has one drawback.  It is very loud, especially for trimming in the ear.</li>
            <li> It is a great tool and does exactly what it is supposed to do the way it is supposed to do it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. HIghly recommend it.</li>
            <li> junk.........beware  .......very bad</li>
            <li> Does exactly what you want it to do</li>
            <li> excellent product - i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A welcome addition for my grooming needs. I had a cheaper unit that was a junker compared to this Cadillac of a trimmer. It does nose and ear hairs without a pull or pinch. Thanks ToiletTree. Clever name btw.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic. Battery cover wouldn&#x27;t screw back on.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s on its way back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Purchased for someone else</li>
            <li> Well made, easy to use, blade design avoids irritation in the tender nose tissue, and a light.  Well worth the extra cost over cheaper ones.  Also, TOILETTREE took care of a small problem quickly, politely, and efficiently.  Online, I will search TOILETTREE first for similar products in the future.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says on the tin , brilliant .</li>
            <li> The trimmer is nice and easy to operate.  It does a nice job getting all of the hairs without pulling.  My only negative comment would be that the motor hum is loud for trimming around the ears.</li>
            <li> Ordered  4 different types this is by far a superior to any  will reorder !!!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my Father and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Excellent just as described and works perfectly. Great price and shipped quickly .thank you</li>
            <li> This products works as advertised, and it strikes me as being better made than similar products I&#x27;ve tried from other manufacturers. It cuts smoothly and quickly with no discomfort.</li>
            <li> Appears to be a well made trimmer and does not painfully pull out hairs like other trimmers I have owned. Shipping was fast! The reason I only gave it three stars is because with this trimmer I have to trim more often as it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as my other trimmers. I guess this is the painless trade off. All in all, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Seems like a quality item, and works very well.</li>
            <li> Finally I&#x27;ve found the product to clean me up!  I&#x27;m 62 years/female and this last year have been having too much nose hair growth. I&#x27;ve been plucking with tweezers which takes awhile in addition to sneezing &amp; hurting - and missing some hairs.  I&#x27;m so happy with this tool; it does a great job, is painless, and best of all it&#x27;s quick!  It&#x27;s pretty quiet, easy to position for hair removal, and so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It&#x27;s not made for this, but I also used it to clean up random hairs below my eyebrows (NOT the eyebrows). My husband will be using it too and I will use it to remove ear hairs and earlobe hairs for him.  I&#x27;ve only had this a couple weeks, but so far I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a month now and really like it.  It&#x27;s pretty quiet and is easy to use.  Cuts nose hairs close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Before getting this trimmer I especially had difficulty with ONE hair which was at the very base of the inside of my nose.  (I know, I know, I was getting obsessively focused on it!)  Couldn&#x27;t quite get it with my razor when I shaved, couldn&#x27;t get it with the previous trimmer I had.  With this trimmer, problem solved.  Works pretty well on the hairs inside my ears, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t do much about getting older and finding new hairs everywhere, but this trimmer reliably takes care of what it&#x27;s supposed to.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Solid unit. Trims well and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Sturdy,well built and operates excellently! Tried more cost effective similar options but they ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all - threw it out.</li>
            <li> This thing is a great. I&#x27;m glad my old one finally broke down because I didn&#x27;t know what a good trimmer was til now.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted. Much better than the Sharper Image we had been using for years Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer so far! I&#x27;ve bought many &amp; non are as powerful as this one. Most of them loose the power after a couple of uses.The delivery was very fast! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> It has some nice features, especially the light. Works well for its purpose. Glad I got it as it saves on embarrassing hair in the nose area at my husbands and my age.</li>
            <li> This is four star quality (feels cheap) and there are identical trimmers with different brand names. But it has a lifetime replacement warranty and it works well so I&#x27;m giving it five stars.</li>
            <li> Build very strong, sharp and does better than the last 10 I have owned, by far. Only had a few months, but; love it so far..</li>
            <li> Well made and did not disappoint. Very effectively removes those annoying hairs in the nose...without tugging and having to go over the same spot repeatedly to get the job done. Not sure that the light makes a huge difference but I have a small nose and may not be using it properly. My husband has a bigger nose and thinks the light is beneficial. So who nose!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great. It is well-packaged, and includes everything you could possibly want in a trimmer. It all seems very well-constructed, and I anticipate getting many more years of use out of this one. The blades are sharp, and it runs quiet. The LED light is also very convenient.  Update: I have used the trimmer about 4-5 times, and I really appreciate how much better constructed it is than the previous trimmer I had been using from a much wider known company. To put it simply, it glides effortlessly where it needs to go, compared to having to force it in order to get all the hairs. However, I adjusted my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because the LED light is starting to flicker. Since I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, this concerns me about the overall longevity of the device. While the LED light isn&#x27;t essential, I did find it useful.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product even though it was for my husband.  He has always had an abundance of hair in the nose and just one time into the nose and it really cleaned it up.  He feels like it is a good product also.  I think that you will be happy if you purchase it.</li>
            <li> Feels better than other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> No better than any other cheapo</li>
            <li> Good product. Works great.</li>
            <li> This is the best nose and ear hair trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly what I wanted. Good product. Does a great job!</li>
            <li> I chose this product above other brands because it claimed to be effective and durable due to its metallic makeup. However I was very dissapointed upon my first use to find out the &amp;#34; blade mechanism&amp;#34; is barely usable. It trimmed my nose hairs with some difficulty leaving stubble behind in my nose! This stubble sharply pricked the inside of my nose and I had to turn To a different tool to get my desired result :(((</li>
            <li> I purchased with trimmer for my husband, as a gift.  I read other reviews about it and thought i&#x27;d purchase it for him. He is very picky about trimmers, etc. and i was pleasantly surprised that he likes it.  I personally don&#x27;t know how it works but if my husband is pleased with it, it&#x27;s a winner!  Good price too : -)</li>
            <li> Have only used it twice,but so far it&#x27;s great and no hair pulling.</li>
            <li> I received the item and when I inserted the battery it would not turn on, nor would the LED light come one.  The battery was fresh and inserted correctly.  I have returned the item.</li>
            <li> I like it, it trims all my nose hairs without pulling!</li>
            <li> Product has a quality feel and appearance. It also works as described. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> so far, this has held together well unlike a couple of others I have tried.  For the money it gets a high mark.  I do wish I had one that was linear as well as round, but I am done trying to combine those needs, I will try to get that separately.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying a cheap trimmer before I found this item on Amazon. This unit is not the cheap plastic trimmer. It actually feels like you have something worthy in your hand. The best thing about this unit is you don&#x27;t have to repeat the process over and over to get the trim you need.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I&#x27;ve only used it once since I received it.  It appears to be well built and is easy to use.  It did provide a clean cut of my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> High quality.  Works like a charm.  Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old Panasonic at reaching tight corners in ears. Also does not seem to trim as close, but it does appear to be well made. but does the job.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long, but did use it on my husbands ear hair.  It worked great, was quieter than my old one and th light is a great feature.</li>
            <li> I like this unit and it works very well. Very simple to use and is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Mislabel product.  Most of it is plastic.  Only the head is steel.  Also the Off/On switch is sticky and doesn&#x27;t function well.  Seems to cut hair OK</li>
            <li> Good size. Heavy duty. Most importantly, it is completely painless, which was my main reason for selecting this trimmer.  I have had painful experiences with other well known brands.  I liked the fact that any bad reviews were satisfactorily addressed by ToiletTree Products.  There were no issues with the 2 that I purchased.</li>
            <li> Love it and made to last.</li>
            <li> Best noise hair trimmer I have ever purchased. The all steel body and cutting head makes short work of any noise hair you have in seconds. The built in light makes cutting them a breeze.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Better than i expected.</li>
            <li> Never used a trimmer like this, but it worked great. The light is a brilliant idea and allows for easy trimming. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the trimmer that you have been looking at, but hesitant to buy. I have that hair growing in those places that like to grow hair when you get older and have had a few trimmers before this one.  You work hard for your money. This is not a purchase, but an investment. I have been using this trimmer for a good while and it has met the task. Bonus is that the light really does help get the job done. Quiet. Fast. Lightweight. Easy to clean. Makes the chore of cleaning up those unsightly hairs simple and easy.</li>
            <li> Buy this one, it met expectations - it has the feel of quality, not like that Panasonic one that only lasted 3 times and felt cheaply made!</li>
            <li> Great for nose, not good for ears or eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The actual functioning of this product is great.  It is small, easy to store, and does its job well.  The 3 star rating could have been a 5 but for one simple reason: Packaging. Its a standard paper box, not problem, but inside that the product is wrapped in two sheets of plastic, also fairly standard.  But these plastic sheets are not recyclable.  Why in this day and age would they not make this simple change to recyclable plastics?</li>
            <li> Works great, service also was great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever used. I&#x27;ve had six different trimmers and none trim hair like this one. Easy to use, easy to clean, simple and durable. Would recommend 100%.</li>
            <li> its nice. thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This works just fine. It is just wanted and hoped for. An excellent product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This product has been really good for me. I now have no unwanted hair from my neck up. I would recommend this product. I was skeptical about the LED light but now I see why it&#x27;s there.  You can see in some places without light.</li>
            <li> Best quality I&#x27;ve ever owned. Cheap ones die too quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great and arrived in one day.... Two thumbs up</li>
            <li> The best trimmer I have ever used</li>
            <li> For months, my wife has been complaining about some unsightly nose hairs that I have refused (been to lazy) to trim with a clipper.  To settle the matter I decided to buy an electric nose hair trimmer and found the Toilettree product based on some good experiences with other devices they make, and the low price. Once the package arrived, it took a total of 60 seconds to trim all the hairs my wife has been complaining about for months. It was simple, fast and completely pain free - which was my biggest concern having never used an electric nose hair trimmer before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up this is a 5 star product at a very low price. I will be a happy customer for a while.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and efficient, painless too.  This is a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> The product is good and the company ToiletTree is even awesomer.  I had a minor issue and the support was great.</li>
            <li> This device is so easy to use, and hey, it really works,what else do you want?&lt;br /&gt;And it doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;, metal not plastic.</li>
            <li> Great little item, does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Takes up very little room compared to the rechargeable set we had previously and works much better.  We have had it 8-months and still operating off the first battery we put in it.</li>
            <li> excellent product.. durable, gets the job done</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband.  He is very happy with it, says it works great!</li>
            <li> Worked well at first, but only lasted about 9 months before it fell apart.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Durable. Have dropped it several times and it still works. Effective. Easy to clean. Reasonably priced. I have been making do with scissors and whatnot and did not even know of this technology until my girlfriend mentioned electric hair trimmers as an alternative. Far easier and faster than my old methods.</li>
            <li> works well,  does not pull. The light is stupid , I cant use the light to look up my nose. But this is a quality product. Well built</li>
            <li> I was recently sent a replacement trimmer. This one works properly and is a good product.  The ability to turn it off is a major asset.  I still find it a little under powered, but all in all it works well.&lt;br /&gt;Clearly there is a switch issue, as I see someone else got one with my same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;Well, first off, it wouldn&#x27;t shut off unless I removed the battery.  I tried everything..  I pushed, I pulled on the on/off switch.  I turned it upside down, I shook it really hard.  I got a priest in.  Finally gave up and threw it in the bin.  I will say, that while it was relentlessly running it seemed woefully under-powered.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> We really like the product, especially the added feature of the light. You did a great job on the packaging also.</li>
            <li> only lasted a few months then broke, we got a lemon. the company responded to our report asap &amp; is shipping us a new one free. my hubby thought it was 100% effective.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality,trimmed hair very close.&lt;br /&gt;you won&#x27;t be sorry with this.</li>
            <li> The product works great. No issues. I do not worry about cutting my face or skin. Gets super close and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> After decades of hair getting pulled,uneven cuts, cheap plastic, the product is great! It is water proof and very sharp. First time use was impressive. Finally, we can keep ourselves trim without all the pain!</li>
            <li> I have owned a lot of nose hair trimmers in my day, and this one has worked the best thus far.  It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t pull my nose hairs like a lot of trimmers have in the past.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent investment!&lt;br /&gt;This product performs to meet expectations, feels like good quality, easy tu use, easy to clean, and easy to store. This product pays itself.</li>
            <li> I was torn between this product and a couple from Panasonic. I&#x27;m glad I chose this one. The build quality is outstanding and it comes with a lifetime warranty. I use it on a weekly basis and it does a fantastic jog with nose hair and ear hair.</li>
            <li> The blades came off the first time I tried to clean it.....couldn&#x27;t put it back together nor could I use it again.  Disappointed!</li>
            <li> First one that arrived didn&#x27;t work, but they immediately sent me a new one to replace it! Works great!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best trimmer I have ever used.  It is quite and you can barely feel it working.  This trimmer would make a wonderful gift for any man in your life</li>
            <li> My wife is so happy I got this,my electric trimmer gave up the ghost and this works great.</li>
            <li> Loved this product, my Dad was surprised to receive this Thank You Seller!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing sharp and safe</li>
            <li> just received it last week but so far seems to be a good purchase</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It is as promised and I am very satisfied with the hair trimmer</li>
            <li> I love this eye brow trimer, it really does a great job. And it is so easy to use. the product came as it was stated. it came in great condition.</li>
            <li> This product is made very well for the price . The outer case is metal. I would recommend this trimmer .</li>
            <li> It works.  That puts it a cut above anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Still, it does not cut as well as I think it should.</li>
            <li> Worked for a while now it is all sound and no fury...just unclipped hairs!</li>
            <li> Everything works fine</li>
            <li> Good prduct.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommended. The professional water resistant heavy duty steel nose-ear hair trimmer performs flawlessly, with a lifetime guarantee it&#x27;s a no-brainer to purchase.</li>
            <li> I love my new Toiletree Nose Hair trimmer. It groomed my nose and ears very efficiently and effectively without pulling the hairs out. I really liked the LED light on the end of the trimmer. It provided plenty of light so I could see what I was doing.</li>
            <li> I am 100 percent thrilled with the quality of this item, as well as the quick service provided.  This trimmer definitely exceeds the results I had from previous &amp;#34;mass market&amp;#34; trimmers such as Norelco and Braun.  I personally found the LED light to be of little practical value; BUT- that may be due to my particular lighting/mirror setup.  One thing I will note:  by the end of a &amp;#34;session&amp;#34;, the tip warms up NOTICEABLY... however, NOT enough to be uncomfortable or alarming - just thought it worth mentioning.  I would absolutely recommend this product and this vendor.</li>
            <li> Cuts fine.&lt;br /&gt;Looks solid.&lt;br /&gt;Battery hungry.&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat heavy.&lt;br /&gt;After one year of use button starts to stick.</li>
            <li> Great product with a great warranty!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Well made. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> PROs: Compared to many other trimmers, this one actually seems to work, and work quite well, for many months. Very sturdy, I bought a second one when I accidentally crushed the end of my first one (knocked it on the floor, dropped a very heavy tool on it while doing some bathroom remodelling, still only snapped off the end).&lt;br /&gt;semi-CON: It&#x27;s a bit noisy, but guess what? I&#x27;d rather hear something and have it work, then have a whisper quiet product that doesn&#x27;t do anything aside from cause aggravation and tickle my ear hairs.</li>
            <li> I am posting in honor of my husband who claims, &amp;#34;I can breathe much better now...&amp;#34;  LOL!  So this is an initial review.  If the product actually lasts, then we have a winner.  If not, I will let you know.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Does the job, looks good and has a good feel in your hand.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job, not much better than any cheaper nose/ear hair trimmer you can get at a department store for under $7.99.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he just loves it. It&#x27;s very well made, light weight, and easy to take care of. The light is a big plus. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great nose trimmer so far, seems well built, better than some of the other trimmers that I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I find this particular nose hair trimmer to be the most powerful of all the different brands I&#x27;ve tried, and it does a great job.  Very nice looking, stainless/black, feels like very good quality, and it works.  Hallelujah, you don&#x27;t know how long its taken me to find a nose hair trimmer that does what its supposed to do.  Thanks ToiletTree Products.</li>
            <li> Excellent product delivered in a timely manner</li>
            <li> works like a charm best purchase I&#x27;ve bought for toiletries in a long time</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, quality seems good, satisfactory performance.</li>
            <li> I love the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose, Ear n Facial Hair Trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;One major problem...one drop from even a few inches onto a hard surface and it&#x27;s blades are out of alignment.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would never find a nose trimmer even CLOSE to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came the Professional Water Resistant Heavy Duty Steel Nose Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;It puts the Panasonic to shame.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the build is overtly superior and the head design is far more comfortable and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;A little pricier than the Panasonic but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> So worth it works as advertised worth every penny thank you toilet tree no more nose hair I&#x27;m happy happy happy</li>
            <li> Switch did not shut off right out of the box. Very poor quality control. Other reviews showed same problem for years. Problem still continues. Look for another brand.</li>
            <li> This appears to be a very well made product.  I have used it twice on both nose and ears and it worked well.  Previous unis oils type I have owner tend to heat up during use.  This trimmer stayed cool and trimmed close.  I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> My husband has always used sharper image. As of today he is very pleased.</li>
            <li> Seems to work better than other similar products; except the light is useless.</li>
            <li> Handy item, feels very durable</li>
            <li> This aids me in fulfilling my social duty of snipping those unsightly nose hairs. I imagine that it will continue to work for a long time.</li>
            <li> Used this a couple of times and so far it seems to work better than others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> i have tried several and this by far the best. No painful grabbing while it does the job.</li>
            <li> this trimmer worked well until  I put a new battery in it and could not get the cap on. Several members of my family tried but to no avail.So I only have to give it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this product, from the first day I received it. All the positive reviews I read on it, couldn&#x27;t of been any more true. Looking forward to trying out more products from ToiletTree.</li>
            <li> Have you seen those really big guys at the gym who can&#x27;t actually curl or bench nearly as much as they look like they can?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, ToiletTree&#x27;s nose trimmer is &#x27;that guy&#x27; from the gym&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first examination, this nose trimmer looked solid. It has great hand feel, feels strong and sturdy, very manly appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I click on the button..... like a dying bee on it&#x27;s last flight back to the hive. I was dumbstruck. It can&#x27;t be. Must be the batteries. I switched in new Amazon rechargeable batteries. Same thing&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT cut nose hair in one try&lt;br /&gt;It DOES quickly trap and burn nose hair inside creating a foul smell that you have to clean up regularly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is certainly not a replacement for the Panasonic ER430K vacuum trimmer I lost.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, what does &#x27;professional&#x27; nose trimmer even mean?! Where do people go to get their nose hair &#x27;professionally&#x27; done?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All big claim, for a very weak interior motor.. In hind sight.. why should I even care what the external casing is made of? This is a nose trimmer!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Fast delivery and great product</li>
            <li> High quality works well and very quiet compared to others I have used.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like another reviewer reported, I was unable to close the unit once it was opened to insert the battery. With or without the battery in, the cover would not screw back on. I returned it for a refund.</li>
            <li> This seems like a well-made and quality trimmer. My husband says it is very sharp and well-shaped.  I cannot rate it&#x27;s durability yet.</li>
            <li> I love this nose trimmer.  I just received it 30 minutes ago.  I usually don&#x27;t write reviews so quickly, but this nose trimmer really deserves a 5 star review.  I&#x27;ve owned several nose trimmers over the last 15 years, and some have been real torture tools--so bad that I tossed them out--really disgusted with them and absolutely appalled that manufacturers would even bring them to market when they cause that much pain.  I had an original Panasonic from almost 20 years ago that finally burned out.  Panasonic didn&#x27;t make that one anymore, so I tried another Panasonic--bad idea--just ripped out my nose hairs instead of cutting them.  I purchased another battery one (forgot the brand name) and it too was extremely painful to use.  I finally gave up on the cordless models, purchased a Trimmit Nose Hair Trimmer and settled for Platinum XL Nose Hair Trimmer for the past 5 years.  This last one works well if I am careful to turn the end as I push the cutting tip into my nose, but because the motor is your fingers turning the end, I must stop pushing it further into my nose while I&#x27;m winding up my hand to spin the tail again.  If I forget to stop pushing it into my nose when I&#x27;m not turning the end, the trimmer then acts like a massive needle nose pliers and painfully yanks on the hairs in my nose.  It also requires the use of two hands and is a slow process.  I&#x27;ve missed the speed and comfort of the old Panasonic that stopped working after a few years and decided to look on the internet again for another brand.  I&#x27;ll never go back to Panasonic after they tortured me with the last one.&lt;br /&gt;Today I tried this new ToiletTree Nose Trimmer, and I have to say that I was completely uptight about using it half expecting it to yank out my hairs like the other poor performers.  I was about 3/4 the way done when I realized that it just wasn&#x27;t bugging me at all, even though my face and whole body was tightened up fully expecting pain.  It&#x27;s still going to take me a while to get used to the fact that it works quickly and painlessly no matter where I put it in my nose.  I have had to deal with itchy nose hairs for the past few years because of poorly performing nose hair clippers, and I&#x27;m extremely relieved to have found this trimmer.  It cut the hairs much closer.  Even when I wriggle my nose around I can&#x27;t feel the hair tickling the other side of my nose.  Fantastic!!!!  Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you.  I hope that you sell a ton of these things.  If it doesn&#x27;t last or is defective I will revisit this review to let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: October 4, 2017, I still love this nose trimmer even though I had to tape the top of the cone shaped cutting piece to the main body because the plastic grabs on the inside broke off.  I called the company, Toilettree Products at 888-251-0985, told the very nice woman in customer service what had happened, and she sent me a brand new one in retail packaging.  She did not accuse me of any mistreatment of the trimmer, didn&#x27;t ask for a photo of the taped unit, and the whole phone call took only 2 minutes and 43 seconds from the time their phone started ringing till she said I&#x27;d get another one in the mail.  This is what I call extremely good service on an already excellent product.  Thank you for living up to your lifetime warranty!!!  Still ecstatic about this nose trimmer!!!the fact that it works quickly and painlessly no matter where I put it in my nose.

            <li> I put the batteries in and the unit went right on...and wouldn&#x27;t turn off unless you took the batteries out. The on-off switch was defective. Returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Seller contacted me and sent me a free replacement, which has been working well so far. They also followed up to make sure things were working well, so kudos to great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion I would change is the placement of the light, which doesn&#x27;t seem to shine directly on the area you are aiming for. Otherwise it cuts well with no snags.</li>
            <li> Received this a few weeks ago, and recently used it. I was expecting a painful experience, where the blades would catch on nasal hairs and cause the motor to stop. But it didn&#x27;t happen, as with my previous trimmer, which was a Panasonic. I had purchased it several years ago. It was advertised in a mail order catalog as being the best trimmer on the market. I was generally disappointed with it. Sometimes the blades would not seat in the cutting head properly after cleaning, and there would be a loud grinding sound when the unit was on. But not with this one. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly and easily I trimmed hairs off my nose and ears without any pain. The motor in this unit appears to spin at a much higher rate than the one in the Panasonic did, which may account for much of the improved performance. It&#x27;s louder than in the Panasonic, but this is to be expected. I did not use the blue light to help with visibility while using it. Others may find it very helpful. I appreciate the small nylon bristle brush which came with this unit, making it easier to clean it properly after use. The instructions with this one are much improved as well. All in all, a very pleasant experience so far, which I hope will continue for a number of years. Because this unit is priced competitively, I believe it is now the best value on the market in a personal hair trimmer. Most highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My (3rd) old Panasonic unit (blade) finally quit working and could not get replacement blades. Decided to try this newer and much more solid trimmer and I was glad I did. Panasonic has a great product that worked well just had problems with blades going out especially if dropped. This product works just as well if not better (slightly) and I hope it last longer especially if dropped. Highly recommend this device for trimming with out any discomfort!!</li>
            <li> I have to give 1 star because they made such a big deal about how it has a steel casing instead of cheap plastic, but of course it is cheap plastic, not steel, and made in China so definitely won&#x27;t last a lifetime.  You&#x27;ll be using the warranty for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He uses it for his nose hairs, and ear hairs as well.  It works great, and does a great job.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very well made, and not with cheap plastic or cheap metal parts like many others I have tried, fits real comfortable in my hand, very easy to use runs off one AA battery and runs well, does not grab and pull the nose or ear hair&#x27;s, the LED light is pretty cool, lights up the way nice and bright, the blade trimmer end of it can be rinsed under running water, which is a plus, all in all seriously well worth the money, this is backed by a lifetime warranty, and it is built like it will last a lifetime, a perfect gift for anyone</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Worked MUCH better than others I have had. Well built and trims super close and is painless. Great followup from the seller to confirm delivery and satisfaction. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> What  a great trimmer, Easy clean and no hair pulling.  Cuts great</li>
            <li> Better than most due to the Steel Casing.  Cover top does not stay on.</li>
            <li> Well made. Will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...worked better than expected...I&#x27;ve had other trimmers before and none worked this well...in a weird way, I&#x27;m happy the previous trimmer crapped out...:)</li>
            <li> When the piece was removed to put in the battery, it would not go back on. It just kept turning and turning but never tightened so the trimmer never worked.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Does just what I wanted. No pulling or snagging.</li>
            <li> Works best of all tried, and I have tried a few.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Well-made and does everything promised. Good service and reasonable pricing.</li>
            <li> What can you say, it is pretty much a necessity. The device works quite well and is a big improvement over my last one.</li>
            <li> Well so far it&#x27;s lived up to the reviews I read only thing I fine is the cutter head heats up nothing bad but over all I give it a good 9.5 out of 10. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;  B Clarke</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Solid build&lt;br /&gt;Solid feel&lt;br /&gt;Looks attractive&lt;br /&gt;Works well&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable in the hand&lt;br /&gt;No extraneous features&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not mechanical</li>
            <li> awesome product, sturdy and it actually cuts the hairs like it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> Worked well until the plastic housing broke.  Go with all metal.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a trimmer that works without any gimmicks this is the one.</li>
            <li> I like it, but the light on the end is irrelevant and more of a nuisance than anything. The trimmer works great, though, so 4 solid stars. I don&#x27;t see how one would use a light on a trimmer to see in their own ear or nose anyway. I suppose it would be convenient if you used it on someone else, but who wants to do that? Solid piece of equipment, good value, stupid light. 4 solid stars.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this trimmer.  My only complaint is it does get a bit hot after a short period of time using it. Cleaning it is a breeze.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It is well made and works great.  I really like the little light.  It helps in getting the job done.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many, many nose hair trimmers of all prices and brands, and they either don&#x27;t work or don&#x27;t work very well.  This product works very well and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several facial hair trimmers over the years but none nearly as good as this one.  It is indeed a heavy duty facial hair trimmer, but certainly not heavy... It trims nose and ear hairs very effectively and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Spend the money and get a good one! It was good at first and worked very well. The light was a cool too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many trimmers in the past.  Most were made mostly of plastic and performed poorly or intermittently after just a few uses.  This trimmer performs at the opposite end of the scale.  It is solidly built, and it performs smoothly and effectively.  Anyone who has a plastic trimmer (or any other trimmer in my view) will be happy with the performance this trimmer provides.</li>
            <li> I have used my nose hair trimmer just once so far and it work better then any of the other ones by far  if that changes I will repost my results</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This trimmer feels a little light when straight out of the box. Once you throw in a battery, it ends up feeling solid and well made. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but I&#x27;ll update in a month or two. As of now 5 stars.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Half a dozen uses later still feeling strong on the same battery.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace a Panasonic brand..single battery operates this effortlessly....the LED light is a great plus...very useful in a poorly lit bathroom. Sturdy construction. Overall a great solution to an irksome task</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Wahl 5545-506, which is about half the price.  Though it worked for years, it always pulled my nose hairs, and over time it gradually ran out of battery faster.  By the end it would only run for a minute on a full battery, and it would barely get any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ToiletTree is a much studier product, and it got my nose completely clean the first time with no pulled hairs.  I was also able to clean it better knowing it was at least water resistant.  Given the build quality I&#x27;m fairly sure it will last a good long while and stay functional.</li>
            <li> Seem powerful when I turn it on.  With the LED light, one can use it at night in car.  The unit is well built and solid feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The on/off switch often stucks making it hard to use</li>
            <li> work great, just what i need</li>
            <li> Great product with delivery as promised!  All of the previous reviews sold me on this product!!  Certainly did not disappoint!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised; Strongly recommend purchasing this item rather than buying a cheap model from one of local discount stores!</li>
            <li> Hard to find a good nose trimmer, but this one had great reviews. No more using scissors or plucking out hairs with tears! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Was expecting to spend much more money for a nose hair trimmer, but this one works just fine.</li>
            <li> Well built.  Works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve come across</li>
            <li> Definitely superior in construction and performance to the lower priced &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Well made and works great.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied - was easy to use, easy to clean, did the job painlessly. Using just for nose, which is very sensitive due to allergies.</li>
            <li> Very  happy with  product just as a advertised. Will order again</li>
            <li> Great, but a battery monster&lt;br /&gt;used about 6 times, for about 2min maybe, and I already need to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> I had a similar product from a different manufacturer that lasted less than a year. I read all the reviews and did not find any product that sounded like I wanted to buy it. So I took a chance on this new product with no history, positive or negative. I&#x27;ve used a few times and so far it does what it is supposed to do and feels sturdy enough to hold up. Only time will tell.  UPDATE: over a year and a half, and still works well. I think I may have changed the battery once, but then I only use it about once a week. Has already held up better than the more expensive one that didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Best product of this type I have ever used</li>
            <li> An excellent trimmer. My previous one could not get some of the short hairs. This one does, and without pulling. The light does not always shine where I need it, but perhaps that is my problem.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is as good as expected.</li>
            <li> First nose trimmer I have ever purchased. Got sick of using tweezers on the random long nose hairs and figured it was time to get a trimmer. Works perfectly and doesn&#x27;t irritate or pull the hairs. You can tell just by holding it that it is a solid product. Also, hard to be a lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer, and had to send it back due to the oft repeated &#x27;stuck on/off switch&#x27; problem. After posting my feedback, the company contacted me and sent me a replacement for free. It works excellently; the problem seems to be getting all the defective stock back from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company appears to be going the extra step for customer satisfaction. I&#x27;d recommend the company and the product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great and appears to be of excellent quality. I have used other trimmers and none of them lasted very long. Corrosion and switch breakage were the problems I encountered. The motors were not powerful enough and they did not cut hair they chewed it off which was rather painful.</li>
            <li> It clears my ear and nose hair nicely without any pulling, which is why I got rid of my old one.</li>
            <li> Solid build. Very effective and it doesn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li> The best I ever used,I reccomend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had one of these before, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. I will say I was surprised by how small it is. It does the job it&#x27;s meant to do, and does it well. I also like that it takes AA batteries instead of those rechargeable ones like in most electric razors: those always die eventually. I don&#x27;t think the light is actually useful, though. But it doesn&#x27;t need one, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> NEVER HAD ONE OF THESE LAST very long so I will have to wait to give a final review but it appears strudy</li>
            <li> I&#x27; ve only used the trimmer a few times at writing. I can say I have owned quite a few different brands of these trimmers thru&#x27; the years and, this design and brand seems to be the best; at least, so far. Seems to have decent power, a safe, non-pulling cutter head design and, works well for nose and ear hair. Cutter head is easily removed for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Just my opinion.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long but seems to do a great job seems well made</li>
            <li> it is cool works just like i hope it would. no problems, but it still early remember. Problems can arise, i mean i don&#x27;t see it. But you never know until like a year from now. Get back with me in a year or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for almost 2 months now and like it very much. It works well, so well in fact my wife has stopped complaining about my nose hairs. It&#x27;s small enough to carry with me when I&#x27;m on travel and can be cleaned by washing under the faucet. Price is great also.</li>
            <li> Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;More power than the Remington brand one that this replaced.&lt;br /&gt;I have ALS, so the large diameter makes it easier to hold.&lt;br /&gt;And I like the fact that you can wash the cutter head off.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how long this will last, but it works for now and does what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have spent some time using the product and I can assure that I quite like, ears and nose, have a better cosmetic appearance. Recommend for us men it is always better to have a good presence in front of the family, girlfriend and friends.</li>
            <li> Had this for some time now. This trimmer is high quality and hard to not recommend. Looking for a nose hair trimmer? (Getting old, like me?) Get this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  Still retains an oily smell.</li>
            <li> I actually choose it because of the reviews I had read.  It replaced one that I have had for many years and so far this trimmer is really do a great job.  I certainly would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this one after getting another brand for half the price that simply didn&#x27;t do the job.  This one does, and the little light is very handy.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying a second one to keep in the car!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  It takes a bit of effort to maneuver around and catch all the hairs.  I probably would give it 5 stars, but I had a different one a few years ago that I lost.  I don&#x27;t remember the brand.  It was more expensive - but it was easier to use than this one, Reached even the tiniest hairs without having to dig around.  I would still recommend this one.  It is well made and I expect it will last for many years.  It&#x27;s design is just not as good as the one I remember.</li>
            <li> Good product, Was looking for a better trimmer than what I currently had, this product is made better and works fine.  IT has a light with it, not sure if it is actually helpful though.  Good Price</li>
            <li> Price was good, delivery was good, product works well.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is solid, heavy duty, well designed and simple to use. It looks conventional but works better than the many I have owned in the past. Put a battery in it, turn it on and it trims away unwanted hair quickly and cleanly.  It cuts short too so when you are done so is the hair.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice item, feels solid and seems to have made my annoying nose and ear hairs retreat from sight.</li>
            <li> Instructions clear. Simple to use. Quiet. Good clean cut. Good product. Recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on reviews.  The nose trimmer does not even cut any hair at all.  It is as if there is no blade in the trimmer.  Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the 5th nose hair trimmer I have purchased over the years.  Up to now, each one was a bit better than the last but each had it&#x27;s shortcomings.  Some pulled hair.  Some discharged batteries very rapidly and, thus, slowed down frequently.  Some were just plain poor quality.  This one seems different - thus far.  It is quiet.  It trims without pulling hair.  The batteries seem to last.  If this continues (and I hope it does) it will be the one I continue to use for years.  Even though it is a bit more expensive that others, I am very willing to spend a bit more to get the quality I am seeking.  Thus far, it seems to be worth the cost.</li>
            <li> have used it only a few times, but it seems to work  very well; no yanking of hairs, seems to run a bit faster rpm than the last brand i had(which didn&#x27;t survive a 30&amp;#34; drop off the sink). four stars only because of the short time i&#x27;ve had it. WAY better than sharp scissors in the nose or ear!</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast! I asked my husband how he liked it, he said it was ok. I guess that&#x27;s good. Thanks</li>
            <li> Like some other reviews, this does not cut as close as other trimmers. For some reason, it leaves &#x27;stubble&#x27; no matter how hard I press.  The good news is that it spins like a top on steroids which is the best part. And, it&#x27;s cleaned by running under water.  A decent trimmer, but not the best results.</li>
            <li> This nose trimmer works very well and is pretty accurate, my old nose trimmer which is a wahl doesn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact, I like the light.</li>
            <li> I found it NOT AS EXPECTED AT ALL since it is weak , not effective in removing ear or nose hair...You have difficult time to do the job...</li>
            <li> PROS:The product was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. It appears to be constructed in a very sturdy manner. It works just fine. The nose trimmer is equipped with  a built in led light that really helps the trimming process. The fact that it is water resistant helps with keeping it clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It did not come with a battery, so you have to supply that yourself. It did not come with a lubricating oil; many such products do come with a lubricating tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am quite satisfied with the trimmer. Reliability will depend on time.</li>
            <li> No pulls , tugs , tears or tears. Of course it&#x27;s just the first time</li>
            <li> The trimmer arrived on time and works great. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Best one I have owned</li>
            <li> Used the Toilet Tree Professional once so far, purchased this after using Panasonic trimmers and other brands that do not last more than a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can already tell the quality of engineering and manufacturing is far above the Panasonic.  First it cuts more hair, never pinches, and it is far quieter in operation than the Panasonic.  To me, a guy with a manufacturing background, the quietness of this product an indication of superior design, components, and assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is a &amp;#34;nice to have&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a top tier product. It is made well and although I initially thought the LED light was strange, I now like the light. I don&#x27;t use it often (light) but it is a neat feature when I need it. It trims well and has a &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34; on it so you don&#x27;t shove it in too far. I&#x27;ve experienced no pinching and it trims well. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> So far...so good! I only purchased this one month ago, so I cannot attest to it&#x27;s durability, or how long the blade will remain sharp enough to cut my ear and nose hairs. I also use it to trim my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased a different product from another company last year...and the thing stopped working after only 2 months. (I only paid $6.95 for that one...so I guess that should teach me a lesson about not always going for the lowest-priced product. Lesson learned.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one feels like it is made of better material and it has a &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; feel to it. So far, I am very happy with this product...and it shipped in a very timely manner--quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just what i wanted - a very well made effective trimmer. and you can clean the nozzle in water too.</li>
            <li> Purchased the trimmer as a gift for my husband.  He is very pleased.  Has used it and found it to work well.  Easy to use, trims close and a great price for the quality of the product.  Came quick once ordered from Toilet Tree Products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this so my boyfriend would stop yanking out his nose hairs.  It trimmed everything up without hurting him, but now it won&#x27;t turn off!  Guess I&#x27;ll be sending it back.</li>
            <li> Yeah work just fine. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. I only use it on my nose so cant say anything about how it works on ears.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: They sent me a free replacement and this one works like it should.  Also note it runs much better off a standard Kirkland Alkaline battery than Eneloop rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, it is a truly painless no-pull trimmer, that is pretty fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side of things the power switch is more like a power recommendation than a switch.  Sometimes it won&#x27;t turn off, sometimes it won&#x27;t turn on, sometimes it only runs at half speed.  You have to play with it for a bit until you hear it hit peak speed, then trim, then play with it for a bit to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of trim could be better, but being painless I&#x27;m more apt to keep trimming and keep things short rather than never do it at all with the trimmers that hurt.</li>
            <li> I use ear &amp; nose trimmers and this product is the best yet. Fits the hand nicely and the trimmer mechanism cuts very efficiently . Also the unit is super quiet . This is a great value. Tom</li>
            <li> Works well; just what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this trimmer! Now, of all the subjects of conversation, I typically avoid those centered around nose hair. But I got it- and so do you if you&#x27;re here, am I right? Got ear hair? Ditto here. ELIMINATED!!!!!!!! This is the one, boys and girls. Buy it!&lt;br /&gt; Ladies, does your man turn you off because of the twin tarantulas projecting from his nostrils? YOU BET HE DOES! IT&#x27;S DISGUSTING! Do you run every time he buys you flowers and puts on a Jerry Vale record? OF COURSE YOU DO! WHO WANTS TO LOOK AT THAT?!?&lt;br /&gt; Guys, you&#x27;ve tried everything from flowers to Jerry Vale. And you ask yourself- &#x27;&#x27;Who&#x27; s Jerry Vale?&amp;#34; FOCUS, MAN!!!&lt;br /&gt; But I digress...&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s your nose hair. Probably. Maybe your breath, too, but we&#x27;re not going there in this review. STAY WITH ME!!! Buy this wonderful little device and, with the exception of your horrible taste in music, your troubles with a certain someone will vanish- just like this mother-of-all-nose-hair-trimmers will do to the inside of your nostrils and ear canal. What&#x27;s that? You can&#x27;t hear me? CLEAN OUT YOUR EARS!!! It works great on them there jug handles!&lt;br /&gt;OK, I think my work here is done. Time for a nap...</li>
            <li> Only used twice so far but being Metal it feels very secure and easy to handle, cuts very well (don&#x27;t use light, cut by sound), and the cutting head with blade is easy to clean. No switch problems yet but it doesn&#x27;t matter because I pull  the battery after use anyway. Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used and would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I had tried several nose trimmers some years ago and was never really satisfied with the outcome... they just plain didn&#x27;t trim hair very well at all. So far, I&#x27;ve only used it twice but am thrilled with the results... it actually works! Trimming nose hair was becoming tedious (and possibly dangerous) using my small Barber scissors because my hands tend to shake a little. But, this little gadget has saved the day... and probably my nose! Previously, for ears, I used my beard trimmer, but this instrument is not only easier but does a much better job. I trim my moustache and beard once a week using my electric beard trimmer and have found this trimmer great for mid-week touch-ups for my upper lip (below my moustache). As I said previously, I&#x27;ve only used it for two weeks; however, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used my new Toilettree nose hair clipper the other day for the first time and it worked great, but unfortunately it would not shut off unless I loosened the battery.  I called the company and they immediately offered to send me a new unit, which arrived 3 days later.  I am impressed by the clippers, but even more impressed by a company that stands by their product.</li>
            <li> So far have been happy with the nose/ear hair trimmer. Great little tool and safer than using scissors. Easy to clean, so hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband, and he, who does not give stars casually, says this deserves five stars. He says it works, you&#x27;re not going to cut yourself with it, it&#x27;s easy to use, the light is directed right where he needs it, and it doesn&#x27;t pinch.  That is high praise from this man!  And from my perspective, I must say that his nose looks great!!  I should have ordered it long ago.</li>
            <li> Trimmer looks like advertised. Seems sturdy and has done a great job so far.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and ready to go instantly. Very useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Hard to find product.  Bought for my husband and he used it immediately after a battery was put in.  First time in years I don&#x27;t have to look at the \\&quot;forest\\&quot; in his nose!</li>
            <li> excellent product.  I have used many trimmers like this one.  So far after three weeks, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works great!</li>
            <li> This product is EXACTLY what I was hoping it would be. (And nothing like another brand, that I threw out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precisely as one person posted, it does not grab hairs. So you can push it your nose or ear without worry. That really makes all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning instructions are illustrated and precise. We should be lucky that all products were documented this well! The method of cleaning is reasonable and not difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really one of those products that deserves 5+ stars!</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time getting the battery cover back on. I called the number for ToiletTree &amp; got an answering machine I left a message THREE times. Never heard from anybody. Needless to say I am not PLEASED. I will not do business with them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and it&#x27;s probably the best I&#x27;ve had.  Still works perfectly and most importantly, it never pulls out my nose hair in any painful way whatsoever.  It gives me a close/clean trim, just as I like it.</li>
            <li> Great quality product!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t eat up batteries. It&#x27;s pain-free. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products. And this one is frankly a little embarrassing. But I&#x27;m not getting any younger and my nose hairs aren&#x27;t getting any shorter.  I&#x27;ve had cheaper trimmers before that mostly pulled the hairs out. Not fun. Not a good way to get ready for a night out. For years I&#x27;ve been using little scissors. Ever nick the inside of your nostril with a pair of scissors?&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer was immediately head and honker above the rest. I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long. Smooth, surgical, quick and quiet.  5 stars.</li>
            <li> This works great!  I&#x27;m very happy with it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> perfect. works very well.</li>
            <li> Great product. It really works good and it lived up to its description. Recommend it to anybody who is the market for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Even has a headlight!</li>
            <li> I have tried many similar nose hair trimmer over the years and would rate this one overall near the top. This unit seems to have a solid build. It has a metal feel to the body. I don&#x27;t like the on/off switch, which feels cheap and will most likely be the first thing to break on the unit. It does cut well.</li>
            <li> Top notch. Best of over ten tried. Lives up to description.</li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve had in my life. It worked fine but then once a week I would twist off protective cover and the whole trimmer would fall apart. This time I can&#x27;t get it to work again.</li>
            <li> it was delivered timely and works like a charm.  i asked the distributor a question via email form. i got a helpful answer literally minutes later.</li>
            <li> Looked to be exactly what I wanted. I put the batteries in and it started and would not stop.  The On/Off switch did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it for a refund. Amazon return policy and procedures were great.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this unit very long but so far so good.  Does exactly what I was looking for around my ears especially.  Feels like quality. Easy to assemble (like put the battery in it duh) and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and got in less than 36 hours (Prime). It worked great, in fact so well it wouldn&#x27;t shut off. I emailed customer service and got a new one in less than 2 days. If only all companies had this kind of customer service. I haven&#x27;t tested the waier resistance yet but I plan to.</li>
            <li> This thing works great. It makes my Wahl trimmer look and feel like a toy. I especially like the light.</li>
            <li> Had it one week. Large, but easy to handle. Easy to clean. Nice job on the regular spots (nose and ears). Also gets those hairs along the ear a barber never seems to find. No use for the light though.</li>
            <li> It functions quite well and does not pull out hairs.  It is easy to clean.  The only issue that I have had with this trimmer is the on/off switch is quite &#x27;sticky&#x27;.  Sometimes it functions quite smoothly and others...not so much.</li>
            <li> Product works great, high quality.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic stopped working after a few years despite me taking perfect care of it, so I ordered this one and am very pleased so far - it seems better constructed and trims with less vibration. The light is very handy.</li>
            <li> I can blame my hair problems on my parents and that would do nothing to solve the ear and nose hair problem.  This trimmer takes care of both with ease.  The product is intuitive to use and really cuts through the hair without any problems.  I am impressed.  On top of that, the price is right.  When those two things align, you have to give the product 5 stars.  Bravo!</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised (Prime).  Easy to use, clear instructions, no danger of pulling or injury, easy to clean.  I much prefer its AA-cell battery operation to the inconvenience of having to accommodate a(nother) recharging station.</li>
            <li> Better than any I have owned before. Being 70 years old I have a big need for these things.  This one is great.</li>
            <li> An Excellent High Quality nose trimmer.  I have owned 3 and this one is the BEST !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this trimmer, fast shipping and excellent customer service.  It trims better than any I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this would work as good as it did. My hair is migrating from my head to the rest of my body. It cuts nose hairs with ease. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Does the job at a good price and although not water proof, I use it in the shower without any problems.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy duty as it makes it out to be. Cuts just as well/bad as those cheaper ones out there. Works decent for 6 months than the blades dull. Light is sorta neat I guess but I don&#x27;t find it helps any unless I was going to cut my nose hairs at night or during a power outage?</li>
            <li> When I ordered, I really wan&#x27;t focused on the light.  However, first time I used this trimmer, I LOVE THE LIGHT.  It makes a big difference in the act of grooming.  The trimmer seems to have a lot of power, too.  This item is really worth your time and money.</li>
            <li> I received your trimmer in the mail, installed the battery, turned it on and the top flew off and a blade ejected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent it back and got a full refund.</li>
            <li> Great nose hair remover. It works great.</li>
            <li> Finally found a trimmer that actually works. I love this item and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the performance. Gone are the days of difficult attempts with scissors or ineffective electric trimmers that do nothing. If this one wears out I will buy another without hesitation. A+++</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like it so far and it works fine. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days and used it once. I&#x27;m a bit confused by the LED light. I&#x27;m trimming the nose hairs not tunneling for gold. I hardly need a light. LOL</li>
            <li> I love it. It meets, maybe even exceeds my expectations. I would be very likely to recommend it to someone.</li>
            <li> The last trimmer I purchased a few years ago cost me $35.00 and can&#x27;t compare with this one. Cuts close with no pulling of hair (nose or ear) and a true bargain for the price. I use it regularly and think it is the best on the market -- and especially for the substantially low price.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and expected.  Though I have only used it one time, I feel like it will be around and in working order for many years.</li>
            <li> Trimmer does not work at all, cannot even be powered up. Brand new batteries were used. Threw this product in the trash.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I survived without this gem.  Easily removes all those unwanted, unsightly hairs around your ears and nose.  Easy to clean too.  Thanks Toilet Tree.  Five stars.</li>
            <li> It really works great for me!</li>
            <li> It has a nice thick handle and does not smell as metallic as the others I had when trimming nose-hair. It does not cut any better as a dollar store one nor does it make any less noise. The only difference is that it looks a little more substantial and holds better in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good device but nothing worth that price.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Feels nice in the hand, trims perfect and easily.  Easy to clean.  Great service from the seller.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Fast  delivery.  Works really well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s good quality, works well and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Light is not useful, not bright enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reached the age where I&#x27;m turning into a werewolf. I&#x27;m sprouting hair in places I never thought possible. It&#x27;s always the full moon with me. And there&#x27;s nothing romantic about it (ask my wife). Definitely not Twilight Saga. A razor can take care of most of it. But what&#x27;s to be done about the biggest thing on a person&#x27;s face that nobody ever notices unless there&#x27;s Spanish moss hanging out of it? Time to call out the nose trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me here. I&#x27;ve tried just about all of the trimmers on the market, but none of them did a satisfactory job. This one does. It&#x27;s very similar in design to those you can buy at a big box store, but whereas those go through the motions they just don&#x27;t deliver. I grew tired of standing there for five minutes with a noisy little gadget up my nose and still seeing those ugly hairs sticking out. But this one gets the job done in no time. I&#x27;m still getting used to the tiny headlight that illuminates my nostrils as I trim. It&#x27;s kind of like being in a dark mine with a headlamp -- you never know what you&#x27;ll run into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if only they&#x27;d invent a trimmer I could use in my ears that didn&#x27;t sound like an armored division grinding up a steep hill.</li>
            <li> My tree trimmer broke so I used this wonderful nose hair trimmer in it&#x27;s place. And, it still cuts through hair like nobody&#x27;s business. I absolutely recommend this trimmer to people with unwanted facial hair as well as landscape companies and jungle explorers alike.</li>
            <li> Built solid, works great and the added light is a nice feature. Better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried that are built cheap and fall apart after time.</li>
            <li> It works okay - it could be sharper</li>
            <li> It is better than what I had before.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have no complaints. It works better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Better than expected-I&#x27;d recommend this Nose Clipper to anyone- A true value .</li>
            <li> Good delivery time. Works well, no snagging or pulling. Steel tip, plastic body.</li>
            <li> Very heavy duty and does the trick very quickly.  Love the LED light near the tip, makes the product above all the rest!!</li>
            <li> For a device that should be so simple, many nose hair trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased&lt;br /&gt;over the years have failed to do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit blows the others away!  The construction is metal, much better than the ones&lt;br /&gt;you see in gift idea section of department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guarantee you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product has met all expectations. It seems well built and doesn&#x27;t pull hair as it cuts. I expect it to live a long and productive life.</li>
            <li> Works well. satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> easy to use,precision and simple clean-up, everything clicks into place;well-engineered!I&#x27;ve used nose/ear cleaner since 1965 and this is my personal best!</li>
            <li> I have used panasonic and remington trimmers previously. This one is the best by a margin. It does the job fast and well, no nicks and it is sturdy. It&#x27;s easy to use and to store, the cap fits tightly and is actually useful in protecting the head. The light is a nice touch but I don&#x27;t find value in it. I wanted a trimmer I don&#x27;t have to spend time on and does the job well and fast - this one does it, It&#x27;s an excellent buy.</li>
            <li> Work great, a solid product.  Not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer is well designed and easy to use.  It does exactly what it should do and what I wanted. I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Does the job just fine... but then again I don&#x27;t have a jungle up in my nose...</li>
            <li> The battery was hard to get in, I had to squeeze on the on switch real hard to get it to turn on, and keep pressure applied to it, took 2 hands to squeeze. It worked maybe 3 times and then died. Buy something else.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product.  It doesn&#x27;t cut quickly, but it does the job.  It seems like it is a little difficult for the hair to get caught (and cut) by the blades.  The light is nice but it isn&#x27;t that helpful.  The cutting end gets a little warm, but it hasn&#x27;t gotten too hot to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first unit shipped had not been quality checked carefully enough and had to be returned.  The metal part that completed the electrical connection that sits in the bottom of the end cap was omitted so the device would not work.  Amazon returned our money and I bought a second one which is the one reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the device.  It does what it says it will do and does it satisfactorily.</li>
            <li> Good quality, good speed...great product</li>
            <li> ToiletTree Products emailed me immediately after I wrote a negative review and offered a replacement.  The replacement works fine and gives no evidence of the problem I had with the first trimmer I received.  What more could one ask for in terms of customer support?  As for the trimmer, it works as advertised, and I no longer worry about cutting the inside of my nose with a scissors.</li>
            <li> Good quality,I&#x27;m happy the on/off switch works well, It&#x27;s well designed and easy to use, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Came as expected. Responsive customer service.</li>
            <li> Like other nose trimmers. Yet to experience something unique.&lt;br /&gt;But steady.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any guy needing to trim out the nose hairs...no pulling or pain with this precision instrument!</li>
            <li> I used a Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer for a year until it would no longer operate. This is far better. The motor is much more powerful. And it is more efficient using power. A great step up!</li>
            <li> Showed up super quick, works great, no complaints, thanks!</li>
            <li> The product looked good, however, when it arrived it had only one cutting blade instead of two. Amazon&#x27;s product return would only allow returning it for a refund and did not allow shipping a replacement product. I went to the ToiletTree web site to see if I could return it to them for a replacement. They have no telephone number anywhere on their site so you can&#x27;t call them via telephone. I then tried sending them an email message, but that didn&#x27;t work either. After three attempts, I gave up and just returned it to Amazon for a refund which worked great. I have since ordered a different brand from Amazon. I decided that a lifetime product warranty was worthless if there is no way to either call or email ToiletTree if there is a problem.</li>
            <li> The last trimmer you will ever need!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Love it that it is water resistant and feels so heavy duty when you hold it.</li>
            <li> works well, but it is very hard to get the battery door back on after switching out the batteries!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  I hardly know if it is cutting hairs in my nose.  However, I can tell by the sound that it is working properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Jerry Yuke</li>
            <li> Vendor was very prompt with delivery. The product is of good quality, works very well, and is easy to control. I would recommend this product to all perspective customers.</li>
            <li> This is a decent quality trimmer. It does the job for which it was intended quite well.  I find the LED light helpful.  My old trimmer (different brand) which was at least 10 years old was getting dull, and pulling hairs instead of cutting them.  So it was time for a new one.  I chose this new trimmer not because of the trimmer itself,  but because I was already sold on the company ToiletTree.  They proudly stand behind their products.  I purchased one of their oral irrigators which after 2 years wasn&#x27;t working properly, so I gave them a call.  A friendly,  live,  English speaking human being answered the phone.  No hold time.  He immediately expressed his apologies that I was experiencing difficulties with one of their products, and sent me a replacement at no charge.  Wow!  You cannot go wrong with buying any ToiletTree product.  They have won me as a customer for life. Keep up the good work ToiletTree.</li>
            <li> Solidly built, not too loud, and provides the closest trim I&#x27;ve ever experienced with such a product. The light does not add much to the trimmer but it would make an excellent product even better if the trimmer could incorporate the self-cleaning capability (\\&quot;Vortex Cleaning System\\&quot;) found in the [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer]].</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great item, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> no complaints from dad yet!</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer is the Mercedes-Benz of nose hair trimmers.  It is solidly built of quality components.  It can be used in the shower and is easy to clean, just pop off the top and rinse it out, then pop it back on.  The foil blade spins around without endangering one&#x27;s skin but slices off unwanted hairs quickly and painlessly.  It&#x27;s the only trimmer I&#x27;ll put up my nose from now on.</li>
            <li> My husband has only used the nose and ear hair trimmer once, but he was quite pleased.  He said it actually worked.  I have gotten him several other ones in the past, and they did not work - one pulled rather than cutting and I believe the other one would only work part-time.  Thanks again for a great product.  I&#x27;m glad we finally found one that works!</li>
            <li> Works well and delivered in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> This clipper is far better than the one I had.  This one actually cuts the hair inside the nose and ears.</li>
            <li> All in all, its a great trimmer. I have had trouble with nose trimmer in the past eventually crapping out on me, and so far, this one is good.  It&#x27;ll be a test of time to see if it can work for the forseeable future, but that said, so far I am happy.</li>
            <li> build well and works great. Lifetime Warranty. Time will tell but happy so far. Painless removal. Would recommend. Thank you.</li>
            <li> How are you supposed to use the light it has. You put the thing in your nose then the light just shines on the outside of your nose. you cant even see inside your ear so whats the point? should have left it off and reduced the SRP even more. loses 1 star for an otherwise good product. doesnt pull on your hair, cuts clean.</li>
            <li> Works great and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great Little Trimmer For The Money !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my son and he likes it. He claims it does not hurt to use and keeps the nose hairs trimmed.</li>
            <li> This was for my 89 year old dad and it works great! It gets the hair out without discomfort and does a clean job.</li>
            <li> Works great. Best trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Used if a couple of times and it seems to perform very well.  Hopefully there are no future issues.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly right out of the box. Takes care of nose and ear hair easily. No tugging or pulling and easy to maintain. Well worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> Without question, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.  I was devastated when I dropped and subsequently broke my old trimmer, but in retrospect, I&#x27;m glad I did.  This trimmer got hair out of my nose I never even knew I had.  Amazing!  And it even has a light!  Bottom line on this is...it works really, really good.  I&#x27;m fairly certain I can breath better because of this gadget.</li>
            <li> thank you. I&#x27;m very happy with the product. it does not do too well on the ears.however I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, much better than last trimmer</li>
            <li> Nice quality product, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> If you want a fantastic NOSE and inside EAR hair trimmer, get this product! It works beautifully for both. No pulling of hairs, can be inserted without fear, and cuts close. After only 1 minute of use, no more hair in either place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, for the love of mercy, DO NOT USE these trimmers for facial hair and expect them to work well. Use a FLAT head trimmer or freaking razor for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want your mangina nose and ears trimmed? Use the round one like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well built, works great and the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one more thing, don&#x27;t expect this (or any other trimmer known to man) to last more than a year with normal use. If it does, great. It&#x27;s less than $20. Get a new one every year if need be. Geez some of you will pay $150 a MONTH for cable tv but will tell the whole world how angry you are that your precious little $20 nose hair trimmer conked out in 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like to talk about my nose hair. Some things are better left private, but sometimes you have to help people out. Hopefully this review will help others with unsightly nasal hair growth. So here goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this little trimmer last week and I&#x27;m impressed with it.  I&#x27;ve owned several nose hair trimmers over the years. A year or so ago I purchased a Wahl trimmer:  [[ASIN:B0015KHMLE Wahl 5567-200 Ear Nose and Brow Dual Head Trimmer]] from Amazon. It worked okay, but it left a lot of noticeable hair behind. It never seemed to get it all, and I&#x27;m talking about some visible hair, not just out-of-reach, hidden growth.  I was never able to manipulate the thing to get it all. Believe me, I tried, and I was using it nightly in the hope that regular use would eventually take care of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this trimmer based on the reviews. I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It&#x27;s just about perfect. I&#x27;m amazed at how much better it worked. I could immediately hear it clipping hair. No more visible growth peeking out, but better yet, everything \\&quot;up there\\&quot; felt smooth and clean. Nice!  Now, it&#x27;s not perfect. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a little stubble somewhere, but next to filling my nose with Nair, I think that this is the best that it&#x27;s going to get.  I generally use it daily or every other day, just to keep on top of the situation. The little LED light is handy if you want to take a quick peek up there to see if everything looks clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be better if it had a rechargeable battery, but I&#x27;ll put up with battery replacement because it works so well. Some reviewers had a problem with the on/off switch. This has not been an issue for me so far, so I assume the problem has been fixed.  Nevertheless, the company appeared to resolve the issue with people who experienced the problem, so I wasn&#x27;t worried about getting stuck with a lemon. I took the chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No regrets here. It&#x27;s a great purchase. I&#x27;ll be looking at more products by ToiletTree in the future.t more products by ToiletTree in the future.</li>
            <li> While the little led light is lacking in usefulness, I find the trimmer to be great overall. Gets rid of pesky hairs fast</li>
            <li> Does a good job of cutting ear and nose hair without pulling on them. Strongest motor I have used.</li>
            <li> though it does the job, my husband complains it gets very hot so quickly. I guess it does not feel good when trying to turn around the trimmer inside your nose when it is &amp;#34;very hot&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it seems to be well  designed and it worked fine. It uses 1 AA battery.</li>
            <li> Toilet Tree products shipped me a new, replacement trimmer at no cost after reading and responding to my review below. Please note I didn&#x27;t hint, suggest or ask that they do so. Outstanding customer service. The replacement unit works as advertised. Smiling faces all around&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased three trimmers in the last few years. My expectations are very low, because 2 out of the three didn&#x27;t work straight out of the box. This unit was no different. The bottom piece (you take it off to insert the battery) didn&#x27;t screw back on. Just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t nuts, I had three different people of various dexterity try to get it back on. Didn&#x27;t happen. I get that one gets what one pays for, but I actually spent 5 bucks more on this item (vs. comparable items at Amazon). I am not sure why. I am sure the manufacturer will declare their defective rate is less than 1% and I just happen to be the lucky recipient. I wish a vendor would offer a trimmer that actually worked (and could last). I would pay for a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same day I wrote this review, which I stand by 100%, the President of the company was kind enough to respond and offered a simple solution to my problem. It is possible, and highly likely, that I inserted the battery in the wrong direction on my initial set up process. If that happens, the cap must be reshaped or it will not screw back in. My contention is that a customer should not have to do a backflip to make a new product work, but the fact this gentlemen took the time to correspond with a faceless customer deserves praise. Furthermore, he told me design changes have been implemented to correct the issue. He offered to replace the item at no cost to me, but as a prime customer the shipping was \\&quot;free\\&quot; and Amazon is great about issuing credit quickly.</li>
            <li> The light is not as bright or effective as I had suspected but the trimmer does the job well and runs quietly.</li>
            <li> I found the unit works well, is easy to clean, and is waterproof as advertised.  I purchased a popular brand trimmer which lasted less than two weeks and simply stopped working for no apparent reason.  It was never in water, and the battery was replaced to no avail.  I will not buy that brand ever again.</li>
            <li> It you&#x27;re tired of using scissors or other trimmers that either pull hairs or other ill issues try this model. You can use it not only to trim nose hairs but your ear hairs as well. I can tell you I&#x27;ve gone in the ear and nose canal like I would with scissors and haven&#x27;t had the first pull or &amp;#34;mishap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Just got the trimmer.  Inserted battery and won&#x27;t turn off.  Just noticed many other similar comments, obviously the seller knows it is a piece of junk and they continue to sell it.  Shame on them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 2 months ago.  I have used it several times and it does the job well.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> The best ever! It gets even the smallest hairs, and doesn&#x27;t pull. It&#x27;s very sharp. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a couple of these type products in the past and been totally underwhelmed by the flimsy trimmer that I received.  This one is a very sturdy and useful trimmer and I love finally getting a product that I can use.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat that price. Works like a charm. No more sticking scissors into my nostrils!</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t say I have a forest of hair in my nostrils, I have noticed that several individual hairs have transgressed a length that would be considered proper by men&#x27;s grooming standards.  So, naturally when I know what I want, but not exactly which product, I head to the world&#x27;s largest marketplace, Amazon.  This particular nose-hair trimmer was well reviewed.  The features many users liked were the metal handle and the solid build quality.  I will agree, this is comfortable to hold and is feels well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During operation, the trimmer technology operates like a dry-shave electric razor, like Norelco or Panasonic branded ones.  It spins around blades at high RPMs while a slotted (perforated) metal tip, the part of the trimmer that looks like a bullet jacket, gets your hairs stuck inside the little holes to then be cut by the spinning blade.  This technique allows for convenient operation; however, you have to run it for at least a minute or two to get decent nose-hair cutting to result.  Because, the nose hairs have to enter the small holes in the tip in order to be cut - this is something that cannot be controlled so you have to keep moving the trimmer around your nose quite a bit.  While being used in this manner, the motor&#x27;s energy transmitted to the spinning blade tends to make the slotted tip quite hot to touch - and you can feel it get hot in your nostril.  In conclusion, it works.  It&#x27;s decently made and it is very simple to use and clean.  It is not very efficient at cutting hairs and can get hot enough during use that you have to stop operation to let it cool down.  It is a tad bit more expensive than some other nose hair trimmers that seem to have a lot more frills and features.  It does remove hair with time - and heat - though I was hoping it would be more effective at removing hair so it would take less time.</li>
            <li> My husband was in need of a new trimmer and this one is just great and easy to use. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Honestly wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect, purchased this for my husband. He continues to use it, so well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> It does the job well. I have course hair and it works.  It&#x27;s a clean trimmer as it sucks the hair in while you trim.</li>
            <li> This little product is the best I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I have only had it for 2 weeks, but it out performs the other three I had owned.&lt;br /&gt;So I cannot talk about product life yet, but this trimmer outperforms any I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is designed well, easy to hold, battery compartment easy to get to. and the light is an advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jjriolo@aol.com</li>
            <li> Cleans the Forest us exactly what I mean. This groomer does an outstanding of getting rid of unsightly hair.</li>
            <li> Well well well.  Here we are. I finally found a product to eradicate the hair animals living in my husband&#x27;s nose.  And what a product it is!  You wanna know why?  Because it doesn&#x27;t hurt him and make him run away from me like a sissy girl!  It&#x27;s all true!  I love this little gadget!  He said it tickles a little and he still whines and blubbers, but he isn&#x27;t crying or running!</li>
            <li> Replaced a junk panasonic. (why should something that is used for a total of 30 minutes over 3 years die?) This seems well built, has an LED light (modern) and has good power.  like it.</li>
            <li> Glad I selected this one, a few $ more but worth it. Had others &amp; was very disappointed. great product</li>
            <li> Product was purchased as a gift.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I really like the light feature. It even comes wirh a little brush to clean it.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly, it was picked up for return quickly, and a refund was grated quickly. That is the only nice thing that can be said about the trimmer. Upon its arrival I took off (per instructions) the back of the trimmer and incerted a new batery. The trimmer&#x27;s back would not reattach. I tried to reattach it without a batery, and at every angle that I could concieve, however it would not reattach. Junky crap, and of course, made in China. I should know better, spend a little more and get quality, or get use to the fed x man coming for a  return.</li>
            <li> Why are nose hair clippers so weak and unreliable/stop working so quickly?  Probably to prevent injury/liability by working too well :(.  Have tried em all, repeatedly, all the top rated, etc.  This is the only one with power, and durability/life span.  Not the greatest, but better than all the other weak s## out there.  Don&#x27;t waste money on anything else.  Prepare to pay for batteries.  A plug in unit would be nice ToiletTree.  Let&#x27;s stop polluting the earth with batteries no one recycles.  Thx.</li>
            <li> It works very well, the only problem I have with it is its very noisy, other wise its a excellent product!</li>
            <li> only have used it a couple times, but it seems great.&lt;br /&gt;at this point, i&#x27;d buy another if i lost it.</li>
            <li> Excellent power, good grip with helpful built in light.</li>
            <li> It works so much better than my old one and that means that I use it more often. Also makes less of a mess. It feels very solid and sounds well made.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Seems kind of flimsy, and the light is pretty useless for me, but it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Worked well for a while, then completely died. Tried new batteries to no avail. :(</li>
            <li> This is one excellent product. It feels solid in the hand and does a great job of trimming. No regrets.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Works just as described. So far very satisfied with product. Light on top is a nice feature. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Unit would not turn on.  End battery cap that holds the battery in the base broke the second time that I removed it.  I had to send the entire unit back.  Not very well made.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product that I recommend with no reservations. The vendor is highly responsible and the packaging was excellent.</li>
            <li> Works very well and good quality</li>
            <li> Works wonderful. This is the second Toilet Tree Product we have bought and we are very pleased with all of them.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great! I&#x27;ve had other brands, but this one seems well made and the older I get I need one I can count on...darn hairs are growing very fast! :-)</li>
            <li> works well so far , love the light feature</li>
            <li> Works great and is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer never turned on and the battery cap was nearly impossible to put back on. I strongly do not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> Toilet tree products are nice and this is no exception.  Works very well, pain free nose hair clean up.  Also works well on ears.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Like the lifetime guarantee.</li>
            <li> I like the way it trims and the light is a neat feature. Unfortunately the first time I put the battery in the one little plastic thingy that holds the battery end on, broke and now I have to hold it with both hands to get to work as the end has to be fully closed to work. So I would not recommend it at all. It&#x27;s entirely possible that it&#x27;s my fault, but I was trying to be careful. I just think the battery end cap is poorly designed. I didn&#x27;t contact the company. It was not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> This is a device that is a must in every household.  The price is good, shipping fast, and a necessity to keep my husband well groomed.</li>
            <li> I really liked the look of this trimmer for my husband and thought I would buy him top-of-the-line.  It appeared to be just what we wanted when we opened the package but when we went to put the battery in the endcap would not fit back on regardless of our efforts.  It seems something was out of spec.  I would love to have this trimmer and would try another to see if it was just an anomaly so I will try again.</li>
            <li> The light would be better placed closer to the tip, but considering the way these trimmers are built that&#x27;d be rather difficult to do. Either way it&#x27;s a good nose hair trimmer that&#x27;s sturdy enough to be dropped in the shower without consequence.  Not much else to say. It&#x27;s a nose hair trimmer, and only a nose hair trimmer. It does the job well enough that you should pick one up if you have errant hairs irritating your nose.  Update: the blade cracked in half, and despite it being a single removable part I can&#x27;t find a replacement for it. Something to consider, since with a failed blade I&#x27;m back to using scissors.</li>
            <li> i am so glad to have a nose/ear hair trimmer that works. i have had a few and they weren&#x27;t much good but at wasting time. i haven&#x27;t had it long, but so far it is really working well. so i like it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I need to return it to the company</li>
            <li> My fiance has been needing a nose hair trimmer for quite a while - he was a little nervous about using this, but he after the first use, he thought it was great. I think he&#x27;s a little sad about saying goodbye to his nose hairs (i am not...) but this trimmer works great and is user friendly.</li>
            <li> Solid, quality product.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The light was especially helpful. Because there was no pain and very little sensation I wasn&#x27;t sure that the product was working. Sure enough most of those troublesome nose hairs were gone. There were some stubborn hairs that I was unable to remove (I tried on separate occasions), therefore I rate this product with four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> I have tried every trimmer out there over the years only to be disappointed.  Other trimmers tend to pull which I would endure if need be but I also find they don&#x27;t work -AT ALL.  So after my wife started looking at me like a caveman I started doing my research and came across this trimmer.  Not only doesn&#x27;t it pull the results are outstanding. I also like the fact it has the feel of high quality instrument and not some plastic junk.  Don&#x27;t pay attention to the negative reviews.  You just found the only trimmer you need.</li>
            <li> at first i liked it.  it worked well and i even bought another one for a xmas present.  his hardly worked at all and mine also quit working.  changed batteries but it doesn&#x27;t turn on at all.  very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Husband loved it! The LED light is a great feature!</li>
            <li> This thing works perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had purchased THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY a LONG time ago.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. It is a great little trimmer and much quieter than others that I&#x27;ve owned. Would purchase again if needed.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. It is not that noisy and it has a light. It is a bit big but it really does the job.</li>
            <li> I like it! Works as advertised, doesn&#x27;t pull and is actually quiet! I would definitely purchase again and recommend.</li>
            <li> This was not my first trimmer. My initial device was of good quality but had a price to match. The ToiletTree trimmer is better quality and cost half the price. Great deal.</li>
            <li> There are dozens of fine-hair trimmers on the market, and I&#x27;ve used several different brands over the years.  Most of them did a certain amount of pulling, along with the cutting, making the experience not very pleasant -- and the pulling got worse as the trimmer got older.  I can&#x27;t say anything about the long term yet, but the first couple of times using this trimmer were surprisingly easy and painless, so it&#x27;s off to an excellent start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retailer provided very quick service -- fast delivery, and the trimmer was packaged nicely and safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend both the trimmer and the retailer.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, quickly and painlessly. And how nice to have a lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li> Not really wanting to talk too much about a nose trimmer but it works way better and quieter than any I have had before.  So highly recommend to anyone with more hair in your nose than on your head.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer and I have bought a lot of these before this really does a great job of trimming unwanted hair and seems to be very sharp.</li>
            <li> Functions as described.</li>
            <li> WOULD BUY AGAIN&lt;br /&gt;WORKS VERY WELL</li>
            <li> It does a clean cut, neat, clean and does not pull.  The light is a plus.  Better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> The trimmer did not work properly.  After the battery was installed the trimmer would start but the switch would not stop the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and he is very pleased with it. As he has had different trimmers over the years, his review is based on comparisons of the ones he has used and he loves it. So we would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as gifts, chose this model after reading several reviews on other brands that didn&#x27;t seem to have longevity. So even though I gave this to my husband, he said I could have it. I have never used a those trimmer before and was scared it would pull and hurt. This doesn&#x27;t at all and I love it. Does a fantastic job and no pulling or anything. Its also pretty compact compared to others I have seen in store.</li>
            <li> I received this unit on time and works as advertised.  I do not believe you could find another trimmer that will do a better job! Hands down better than my old Braun.</li>
            <li> I have not used one of those for sometime now, in fact it has been years.  I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with ones I&#x27;ve used in the past due to the hairs being pulled and anyone who has experienced thst knows just how painful it can be and the apprehension in using another.  I Found myself using scissors but they were lacking as it hard to get in there.  The device arrived very quickly and I immediately put it to the test.  I inserted a AA battery as one did not come with it.  Turned it on and it worked.  I was nervous and slow putting it in my nose but soon realized that my eyes were tearing up but not from pain.  The device actually tickled my nose.  Needless to say, the only sound I heard was the sweet sound of hair being cut and no pinching or pulling of any sort and the tickling sensation went away once I got use to it.  The device worked 100 time better than I would ever have imagined.  It was smooth and powerful; I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.  As for those worried about left over cut hairs in your nasal passages, just blow your nose.  It works like a charm.  Happy clippings to you.</li>
            <li> The light feature isn&#x27;t needed and diminishes the battery life a bit but other than that it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this nose hair trimmer.  Won&#x27;t buy another one but will request replacement.  Am glad it has a lifetime replacement guarantee.</li>
            <li> as a woman getting older I was noticing nose hair and this did the trick.  Very easy to use and I didn&#x27;t worry about nose hair any longer</li>
            <li> A great company and this trimmer is  working exactly as described.  My husband loves the fact that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34;. It is quiet and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I usually purchase brand name items. The reviews are what made me purchase this product.  10 Stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer and have used it for over a month and it does a great job.It helps with ear hairs and trimming eyebrows.As I gotten older there is more hair hair growing in places where I don&#x27;t need it than places where I do need it and this trimmer helps with that.</li>
            <li> So far I used it once ever since I got it and it was easy to use and works as described in the product details. Doesn&#x27;t come with the battery, it uses a since AA battery.</li>
            <li> No better than the the less expensive panasonic model. The tip gets very hot.</li>
            <li> As described...I&#x27;ve tried all types of trimmers from expensive scissors to electric and all failed miserably. These really do mow it down on the first pass and don&#x27;t pull the hairs, with easy clean up.  Highly recommend :-)</li>
            <li> I like this item a lot. The price is reasonable. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if was a little lighter.</li>
            <li> My paintings are a lot better now</li>
            <li> A great product. Really works well. Better than other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Replaced a Panasonic that is a pain in the neck because the battery contacts don&#x27;t connect well.  Very quiet, powerful and well made</li>
            <li> By far the best nose hair trimmer I have owned. Very well priced for an awesome job. Had a problem once with the blade and I thought they would just send me a new blade, but they sent me a brand new one.q</li>
            <li> My wife convinced me to get a nose hair trimmer about a year ago.  I&#x27;d been through four (five if you count her using tweezers against my will) before I found this one.  By the time I got to this guy, I wanted a trimmer that focuses on nose hair trimming -- not other stuff that sounds nice but I don&#x27;t really need, like sideburns or eyebrows.  This one does just that.  It is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried because it doesn&#x27;t pull or cause annoying pain, it&#x27;s pretty quiet, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and, to my surprise, the light is actually a very useful feature.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who, like me, has nose hairs pointed out at least once a month by a significant other and plans to use a trimmer going forward.</li>
            <li> Bought for husband.He likes the LED light that is included. Didn&#x27;t think it would have made a difference that it came with one,but did. He says it feels like its better made than previous one he had, that cost more.</li>
            <li> After going through several trimmers over the years, this Toilet Tree trimmer knocks all the competitors down &amp; out. You can tell by the way this is made, not cheap plastic like most of them, but sturdy housing &amp; the battery goes inside direct, not on a plastic sleeve. Way to go Toilet Tree &amp; thanks for making superior products!</li>
            <li> Should have bought a trimmer years ago.  Works great.  It clips hair and does not pull.  It just takes seconds.  Use it every other day.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful easy to use produce at a vary low price.&lt;br /&gt;I had a nose hair trimmer that has a flat blade and you has to be on the right plane to cut the hair.&lt;br /&gt;This one has a round blade. It is quieter and gets all the nose hair with little effort.</li>
            <li> I  recommend this Product to all my friends and family it&#x27;s a great item to have I give it a 5 rate cause the product I have  purchase from Toilet Tree is one of the best  trimmer that I have brought works great..</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Just perfect especially with the lighted end;  I have no complaints and am glad I CHOSE THIS PRODUCT. you would be happy with&lt;br /&gt;this product also.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to others. Works a sdescribed, and I&#x27;m really impressed with the LED light feature.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a bit heavier than my Panasonic one, and a bit bigger. However, it works quite well, doesn&#x27;t pull hairs, and seems solidly and professionally built.</li>
            <li> Well made, solid item. Performs very well. Easy clean. Suggest might need Lithium batteries to get better power and longer last.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty design to last and trims great.</li>
            <li> well built unit ,works great,fast shipping,thanks A+++++</li>
            <li> Best in class, a sturdy effective trimmer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Happy with it and recommend this one highly!</li>
            <li> Functional and easy to clean - great price for a fine product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s made very well and is very sturdy compared to others that I have purchased in recent years.  I expect to get a lot more use out of this product.  I think the round, rotating blade is much more efficient than the flat blades that so many other companies have on the market.  Shipping was fast and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for at least three weeks and it has worked very well.  It doesn&#x27;t pull or snag.  Looks also pretty maintenance free as well.</li>
            <li> It is awesome. It has life time warranty, so do not have to worry about it. I have another one from same brand but this is very different. Few dollars more is worth.</li>
            <li> Product as described would do business with again!</li>
            <li> I just love that he has this to keep those hairs from sticking out of his nose all the time</li>
            <li> This is a great grooming tool. Sharp, easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works much better than trimmers than have blades that move side to side - at least for nasal hair.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Works as described, so far.</li>
            <li> Very good. Used it right away with great results.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works quite well.  It&#x27;s easy to use, quiet, and trims closely.</li>
            <li> Excellent service.  Exactly as promised. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like the way it works and the light too.  It seems substantial and not flimsy.  It is also easier to clean inside than my last one, since you only have to remove one part.  It is brand new so I can&#x27;t speak to how long it has lasted - we will see.</li>
            <li> Came super fast, was exactly what I wanted, and my husband loves it. He says it works perfectly. Literally can&#x27;t think of anything other than positive to say about this product. If you are thinking of purchasing a nose trimmer, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and works as advertised.  My husband was pleased with this easy to use purchase.</li>
            <li> This works well, as advertised. A quality product and not a piece of plastic junk like most stuff nowadays. Cuts well. Does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while now and it works great.  It does a great job of trimming the hair and not pulling them.  The metal body adds some nice weight to it and the light makes things go much smoother.</li>
            <li> Works well. Hubby does like this and the fact thay it has not knicked him, jammed or stopped working yet.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is the best. I checked out all reviews and this was the best.&lt;br /&gt;Husband loves it and has already used it. Works well on ears. I will use on him&lt;br /&gt;to get to the hard places. Love the light works very good and is bright.Great all around.&lt;br /&gt;It is so much better then all the last ones we had. Also works on ears.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> This personal trimmer works very nicely at trimming those pesky nose and ear hairs that plague us older folks.  A single AA battery powers the motor that painlessly and neatly removes hair in sensitive and hard-to-reach places.  Very solidly-built and very smooth and quiet operation.  Recommended for all who need this type of gadget.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is the best I have ever owned, right up until the time I tried to pull the protective cap off to use it and the entire trimmer pulled apart destroying itself in the process. While it&#x27;s made of metal on the outside, the innards are black plastic and obviously flimsy as I am not that strong.  Everyone should believe that Steve Parisi and ToiletTree products truly care about their customers.  I just received a replacement in the mail within 4 days of writing my review, no questions asked. This is a company I will NOT hesitate to do business with in the future.</li>
            <li> Very good product!  Got it for my Dad and this one is not flimsy like the others I bought him.  Very easy to use and clean and it has a light on it too to show where you are aiming.  Definitely recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a better trimmer than the plastic and under-powered one I had been using.  This one is solid, quiet and works really well. If I had to buy again, I would buy this one. Quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> what can I say great little product well maid I like the little led light built in to the trimmer very comfortable to hold clean up is easy it actually works better then I thought it would. up date 07/13/2016 my trimmer gave up the ghost so I ordered a new one . just for the sake of argument I called toilet tree products boy was I surprised they are sending me a new one it has been over a year and they replaced my old one I think they won a customer for life</li>
            <li> This product did a great job and was so quiet and smooth, I wondered if it was even working!</li>
            <li> As described and very well built. Have bought many cheaper versions and this one is worth the extra money. Been using for 1 month and found painlessly cut without missing hairs. Quick, clean cuts. Highly recommend for the quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Prior to buying the product, I owned a Panasonic model.  It was an older one that worked great. I then dropped it and it broke.  I loved it so much, I bought Panasonic&#x27;s newest model of the same model I had.  Not so good as the old one.  In search of a new one, I decided to try this one by ToiletTree.  I already had good experience with their oral irrigator and the company.  I owned one of their older irrigators and the battery prematurely  went bad after the warranty ended.  I called them and they replaced it with their newest model irrigator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice thing about this product is its size.  A lot of trimmers are pencil thin in diameter and I found them hard to hold.  The diameter of this product is larger so it makes it easy to hold and adjust in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found this one to be more powerful than my Panasonics although both use the same size battery (AA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer also has a locking switch which means it is less likely to get turned on your toiletry bag while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also confident that if anything goes wrong within a reasonable time with the product the company will stand behind it.</li>
            <li> Very nice, compact, sturdy, good quality.</li>
            <li> best nose trimmer on market fast ship great price</li>
            <li> Total inferior quality. It cut my ear and when I went to clean the unit the blade fell out. NO THANKS. Please issue full credit.</li>
            <li> Nice!  So glad it has a light-makes it a lot easier to see.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year. It continues to function well, and I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I think it&#x27;s incredibly stupid that they put a light in these things (many manufacturers do) because you can never position it where it&#x27;s truly useful and it&#x27;s never enough light to be useful. I just hold a flashlight up in front of a mirror.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought a rechargeable nose trimmer from a local store. It did not perform well, it just didn&#x27;t seem to get my nose hairs trimmed and did a lot of painful pulling. Also the long cord was annoying and messy and the charger base increased the room that it took up. I like that this trimmer uses a AA battery which I am sure will last a long time. It has a nice weight to it and it trims my nose hair without doing any pulling. I did have to go around a couple times to do a thorough job. The instructions tell you to insure that the battery cover is tight and then rinse under running water to clean the unit each time you use it. I did trim my ear hairs with this also, but was not real happy as it did not seem to get them trimmed that well. Perhaps that is something that I am going to have to have some more practice with though. I do think that this trimmer is designed and built as well as is possible.</li>
            <li> The very first time I closed the battery compartment cover after installing the battery a retaining tab broke off so that now I have to hold the cover on with tape in order to get the device to reliably operate.</li>
            <li> these are one of the best nose trimmer that i  have got</li>
            <li> Motor seems strong, cuts cleanly--much much better than the cheap Wahl trimmer I bought at our local big box store (the Wahl jammed up after 15 seconds use, so I just pitched it--who wants to return a used nose hair trimmer?).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, pleased with the Toilet Tree trimmer.</li>
            <li> Product works as promised, the light is an added plus when using.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is for the size, it is a bit heavier than it looks</li>
            <li> Great Quality compared to other similarly priced trimmers.  Performs with consistent results every time.  Worth the investment for what it is.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the battery compartment cap to screw back on.&lt;br /&gt;I will return it and try again.&lt;br /&gt;2nd time lucky?</li>
            <li> Initially received a malfunction unit with a bad on/off switch, but the seller quickly sent a working replacement within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself works fine, I like the aluminum handle, and decent customer service.</li>
            <li> Nice to have one of these that seems like it will last, not be replaced in three months. Nice, solid feel. When they say \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; it refers to the construction...the motor doesn&#x27;t seem to be significantly more powerful than the \\&quot;cheepies\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Powered trimmers have all but fallen off the map where I live. The unit works very well, they must have fixed the switch issue.&lt;br /&gt;the one thing for me is that it is very bulky in the hand. If you or you know a hairy guy this is a life saver.</li>
            <li> Think it might have been good if wasn&#x27;t broken. My husband asked that I wait, and we will look again.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ&lt;br /&gt;Fast and powerful enough so it DOESN&amp;#34;T stall and pull&lt;br /&gt;Yes I can recommend it to a freind</li>
            <li> After trying several $10 trimmers over the years that didn&#x27;t work I got this trimmer for Christmas from my wife and it really works. Its well made and even has an LED to help light things up. I am very happy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the trimmer specifically for trimming nose hairs. It trimmed the hairs quickly and was easy to clean. I also own a Panasonic trimmer and this one worked as well or better. Neither trimmer is built like a Swiss watch but it does the job, though a Swiss quality nose trimmer is still on my bucket list.</li>
            <li> The on off switch has a smooth surface and is difficult to turn on or off. For my use the light is unnecessary and just uses battery power, otherwise it is an ok unit.</li>
            <li> Although I have found this product to be solidly constructed and work well, I wanted to share my experience with the company that distributes this item.  They provide a life-time warranty, but I am always dubious about under what circumstances such a warranty will be honored.  In the present case, I had an unfortunate case of the trimmer falling on the floor. Although it is solidly constructed, the cap feel off, and when I reassembled the cap, it was no longer working properly.  I sent an email to the company and very rapidly received a response from the company president.  After several back and forths, it was determined that I was missing a part in the cap, so Steve was going to send out a new cap.  Two days later, a package arrived and it actually contained a completely new unit. Steve had decided there was a risk of the cap being dismantled during shipping, so just sent a complete replacement.  I offered partial payment for that, but he declined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say?  It would be wonderful if all companies stood behind their merchandise like this!&lt;br /&gt;I hope they do well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Does not pull the hair in either your nose or ears. I would get this for all the men in my family.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days but he claims that there is no pulling on the hairs like some others he has owned.  He claims that it does a better job too.  Does tend to get a little warm the longer it runs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other trimmers that barely did the job and came to this one.  This really is a very well thought out and useful trimmer. It has a good weight to it, so the control is more precise. The built in light helps a man to see how deep the forest has become and is helpful finding those odd hairs that want to curl or avoid being cut. The motor is hearty and fairly quiet. Cutter blade is sharp and doesn&#x27;t seem to pull at all ( unlike the others I&#x27;d used and found would tug a hair out when I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.)&lt;br /&gt;  I give it high marks, because it does a consistently good job of grooming, again and again.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m nearly blind, I gauged the volume of hair actually being cut on my last trimmer by the distinct sound it made when hacking through the thicket. I don&#x27;t hear the same sound with these, which made me wonder if it was doing the job, but upon close inspection, it seems to mow right through without making the same sound. The light isn&#x27;t as bright as I had hoped, but as I mentioned, I&#x27;m nearly blind. This is a fine trimmer. I&#x27;m glad I replaced my old one with it.</li>
            <li> It works great for your nose however not so great for the ears. It doesn&#x27;t cut close enough on the ears.</li>
            <li> Appliance arrived on time and works as advertised. The company followed w/ a message checking on status and satisfaction. Good appliance. Good company.</li>
            <li> Do not buy - It worked fine at first, then died.  New batteries did not work, nothing.  The LED light is bothersome and fails to help.  Now I have a broken &amp;#34;lifetime&amp;#34; product and hait jetting from my nose.  Buy another.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of using trimmers that don&#x27;t work well.  This thing does a fantastic job in only a few seconds!  It trims nose hair closely so I don&#x27;t need to trim it again for 3-4 weeks.  I love this product!  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it does it very well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. The fact that it truly is painless sets it apart from all other products I have used.</li>
            <li> it trims hair, doesn&#x27;t pull it out</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of an oily smell, but it seems to work OK.</li>
            <li> works great-am quite pleased</li>
            <li> Trimmer seems to work nicely.  Seems that when guys grow old, hair tends to migrate.  This product solves the problem.</li>
            <li> It does okay. I would say it gets most hair but cannot tackle the really long ones. I don&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
            <li> This device is easy to use and it cuts your hair very gently without pulling. I have mit used it in the shower yet but it&#x27;s well made so I have no doubt that it wouldn&#x27;t hold up. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Only used it once, but seems to work just fine</li>
            <li> Great product.  This is the second personal grooming product I have purchased from Toilet Tree products.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the quality and reasonable price from this brand.  I have only used the clippers once, but they are quick and painless.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wipe it well before the first use, run it, wipe, run it, wipe. Until the tissue is clear. Turned the entire inside of my nose black!</li>
            <li> I have tried several nose hair cutters. This one is the best by far for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. High quality build and works better than I thought it would. I will also buy other products from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> This is working well, I&#x27;m able to clean it ok and remove residue.  Don&#x27;t know how often I will have to buy a replacement, but I would recommend this tool at this time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many nose hair trimmers I have purchased, only to be thrown into the trash after a couple weeks use;  so much so, I can say, that I was quite leery about purchasing this one. I have gone through several of the Panasonic (top rated) as well as a number of others that were also highly touted.  So, it was with high skepticism that I purchased this one.  I must admit that I&#x27;ve been doing my best to test this thing as rigorously as possible because I wanted to be able to return it to Amazon if it failed like all the others.  However, THIS MACHINE IS SOLIDLY BUILT!!!  The motor is much stronger than the competing &amp;#34;best-rated&amp;#34; trimmers I have used and it seems to be of a quality that will actually last a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
            <li> The first trimmer I ordered would not turn off without removing the batteries. I contacted ToiletTree and they immediately sent me a replacement trimmer. So far, my husband has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine. I love it.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer to replace the Panasonic trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ER-GN30-K-Vortex-Facial-Trimmer/dp/B0049LUI9O/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1392630928&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;panasonic+nose+hair+trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved the Panasonic trimmer but two of them broke after dropping it a single time.  I haven&#x27;t dropped this one yet, but it seems sturdier than the Panasonic one (it&#x27;s thicker and metal-covered instead of plastic).  It works really well for nose, ear, and random facial hair.  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because I feel the Panasonic one trimmed a little more precisely, but I&#x27;m totally happy with this one.  Also, it has a light, whereas the Panasonic does not.  I don&#x27;t really use the light, but I guess it&#x27;s nice if you need it.</li>
            <li> This is the best nose trimmer I have ever owned. It makes me feel years younger not having annoying hairs hanging out of my nose.</li>
            <li> great product from a seller who truly cares</li>
            <li> I tried with brand new batteries would not turn on.. beyond a quick flash of the led light very disappointing as I was excited for this product</li>
            <li> this was sent as a gift, the person who received it loved every thing about it!&lt;br /&gt;think i wil order one for myself!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is not bad for the money.  It does not hurt to use which is a plus.  The on switch is hard to push and the trimmer does not cut accurately or close enough to my liking.</li>
            <li> Was very surprised at how quickly it arrived and also surprised at how good its works! I have only used it twice but with great results.</li>
            <li> I bought this over the very popular Panasonic because of the reviews about customer service. I am happy with the product but feel it runs a little slow and would work better with a faster/more powerful motor in my opinion. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as short as my previous Remington one perhaps because of a better guard system.. I like the product and there is nothing wrong with it, a good product and a good price... it just didn&#x27;t make me say wow that is the best ever..</li>
            <li> The trimmer is excellent. It is safe, easy to use, and cleaning is no problem.  I highly recommend this. Reathe easy and stay trim.</li>
            <li> The one thing I did notice right away was that this trimmer did pull any of the hairs your were trying to use it.... so it is honestly the best one Hubby or I have tried.</li>
            <li> this is a great nose trimmer.  no hair pulling just plain old great cutting and nice&lt;br /&gt;nasal hair nares.  Thanks a million...so nice to have a product that does what&lt;br /&gt;it says it will dol</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sturdy trimmer and it seemed to meet that criteria out of the box. However, it wasn&#x27;t more than 2 months before I noticed that the tip (which houses all of the moving parts, blades and removeable tip) was very delicate to handle during cleanings and the plastic molding that had grooves for the tip to screw into splintered and no longer held the tip in place. I just threw the whole thing away as I had discarded the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of $$ until they can improve the tip design and make that match the perceived sturdiness they profess in their marketing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the  money!</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have literally tried about 20 other brands, options, and none of them have lasted.... This works, and it works with ease.... I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this product. The last time I bought a nose hair trimmer from a different company, it was made very poorly, and never worked well at all. I read some of the reviews for this model, and decided to give it a try. First thing I noticed was its solid construction, this was nothing like the flimsy piece of junk I had previously. I was concerned that this unit wouldn&#x27;t have decent power because it ran on batteries. I was pleasantly surprised about the amount of power it put out when I flipped the switch. Now for the true test, how is it at removing nose, or a little bit of ear hair. Before answering that question, I wanted to use it for a bit. I&#x27;ve used it about 5 or 6 times now, and it has worked great for me every time. The trimmer cuts quickly with no hair pulling, and the power remains consistent at all times. It even has a little light for you to see better. This is definitely the trimmer I would personally recommend to anyone. I&#x27;m hoping it lasts me a while.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked as expected.  Feels substantial, works quickly, and stores easily.  Will buy another one for my son.  The LED light is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> Stocking Stuffer Time Everyone!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is your hubby or boyfriend, Grandpa, Father.....etc.... in need of a useful gift this Holiday Season?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If so, after having the opportunity (or should I say my husband) to review a great product by TolietTree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend the TolietTree Nose &amp; Ear Trimmer.  But this is not your ordinary trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you more about it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a Professional ...Water Resistant...Heavy Duty Steel Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer with LED light by ToiletTree Products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I think the best part is that this product is backed by a Lifetime Guarantee!  It is not very often you find items are are guaranteed for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if you or a loved one owns a nose trimmer...but if you do...go take a look at it.  I bet that is probably is made with a cheap plastic body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well TolietTree Products has created such a high quality trimmer it is made with a steel casing.  We were amazing on how sturdy this trimmer felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband really loves the water resistant feature.  So he is use it in the shower and it is easy to clean and rinse off.  It even comes with its on little cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the super bright LED light that is built in is genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has only had praises for the TolietTree Nose &amp; Ear Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It think one of the reasons is the rotary cutting system which allows hairs to enter the trimmer tip from the top and also from the sides which is very helpful for stray hairs not only in the nose but also on eyebrows, beards and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are made of high quality stainless steel.  They allow for a clean smooth cut.  So no more pinching and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer only takes one AA battery.</li>
            <li> Trimmer gets hot immediately. I wonder if it is faulty. Informed amazon about  this item</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to put the battery cover on.  I gave this as a gift to my father and he could not figure out how to get the battery cover on.  The instructions are very cryptic and are of no help.  After struggling with the cover for about 15 minutes and trying every possible position to screw on the cover, it finally went on.  I don&#x27;t know what I did to make it go on.  There is nothing on the case matching up the correct position of the cover to the unit so I painted a line on the trimmer so that we could line it up next time.  However, I&#x27;m not sure that will help because I had to use a lot of force to screw on the cover.  The trimmer works well but the struggle with the battery cover is not worth it.  I would not recommend this product for that reason.</li>
            <li> So far, now that i finally got this, it is working better than any nose trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i first ordered this, amazon used it&#x27;s UPS  USPS combo, [which I&#x27;ve had some trouble with on several orders] it went to a post office several towns away,  sat there for a week, then went to Ohio.&lt;br /&gt;then i had another strange mis- shipment,  but Mr. Parisi contacted me directly and completely fixed the problem, and it got delivered.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for several weeks now, and i&#x27;me quite happy  NO pain, and better trimming.&lt;br /&gt;This device is much sturdier than my previous trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;This may cost a bit more  [and really not that much more]  but i&#x27;d have to say this is totally worth it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I happy with this purchase. Prior to buying it, I had tried all sorts of razors for my nose hair but this one has been the most efficient in getting them out without sneezing and &amp;#34;snarling&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Works well, like the light.  As others have noted, sometimes when changeing battery the bottom part is tricky to close properly so device with work, have to work at getting it on/closed for a while before I was sussessful.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, great size for a man&#x27;s hand, and easy to use. This trimmer provides great results, too, and the little light is helpful.</li>
            <li> This item attracted my attent because my, 10 year old, American Made, trimmer was finally dieing. Even new batteries failed  to help: It was just worn out. This on looked a bit like my old one had a lifetime warranty,  and Amazon, thank god, stood behind it. All the glowing reviews also made me confident that it had to be a great product. It arrived in a fancy box well packed and I read the instructions and proceded to open the unit put  in a battery, (Std AA eveready) and then the fun started. I could not reclose the unit. I checked to insure the plus of the battery was toward the trimmer, and still no luck. I removed the battery and found no approach could reattach the base to the unit. After 45 minutes, I decided it must be a dud and returned it. If any product gets by basic inspection of its mechanical function, IT SHOULD BE REJECTED, not allowed to reach a customer in useless condition. I guess I will just have to continue searching for a replacement that actually works and can match my old unit for reliability and price. Too bad: I started with 5 stars for design, box, and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - - PLEASE READ THIS !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the above review, I heard from  the company itself via email.They offered a new unit to try out and, since I had already sent my original purchase back too Amazon and received a full refund, I agreed. The new trimmer arrived today and it even had a battery installed. I tried it out right away and it worked fine. I WANT TO THANK THE FOLKS AT TOILET TREE FOR OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TAKING THE TIME TO CORRECT THE INITIAL BAD IMPRESSION I HAD.  I would recommend the product and the company to all of you. Mr parisi, President of Toilet Tree Products, has won my confidence in both this product and his company. Again: THANKS FOR OUTSTANDING SERVICE AND A GREAT PRODUCT. I will likely buy another soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leon</li>
            <li> Well Made and works well. I am happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Seriously- I have bought them all...this is SIMPLY the best! Period. (:))</li>
            <li> Great quality made product.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever owned.  Does a great job keeping my ears neat as well.</li>
            <li> An outstanding product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After using 5 or 6 times, the head keeps falling off.  Never dropped, never misused.  Would not suggest buying this product</li>
            <li> I had to return this item.  It did not turn on/off without taking it apart and manipulating it.  The LED light was either on or off but not consistently on with the trimmer.  The &amp;#34;stainless&amp;#34; is more &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; than actual stainless construction.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Does a great job cutting hairs, the LED really does nothing, very dim and when using the nose trimmer up your nose you cant see the light.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it 5 stars because I didn&#x27;t get it for the LED I got it for the trimmer and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> It did not seem to work for me so I returned it. bought another brand</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and it is much heavier in a good way. Others I&#x27;ve had were lighter and seemed flimsy and didn&#x27;t trim nose hair very well. This one does a very good job and I&#x27;m pleased with it. The vendor has an extremely admirable policy of addressing and solving any issue with this product.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND REALLY DOES THE JOB REMOVING NOSE AND OTHER UNSIGHTLY HAIRS.&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME IN PERFECT CONDITION AND WORK WELL THE FIRST TOME I USED IT.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY AND READILY ENDORSE PRODUCTS MADE BY TOILET TREE !!</li>
            <li> Only Lasted about 6 months - is this really guaranteed for Life?  I threw the device out  Needless to say, I would not buy another.</li>
            <li> Trims hairs without pain and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looked promising, but when I inserted the battery and turned it on, it sounded fine, but then it would not turn off. Defective switch I suppose. Another reviewer had the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Mr. Parisi, President of ToiletTree personally contacted me and offered to send me a working trimmer, which he did.&lt;br /&gt;I rec&#x27;d. It today and it works great. That&#x27;s what I call great customer service. Thank you Mr. Parisi.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than the old trimmer I had; I&#x27;m glad the other one broke.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Best nose hair trimmer i have tried.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these products from different manufacturers and this is by far the best one. The LED light was a pleasant surprise !</li>
            <li> Product works but the on and off switch does not work. It has to be turned on by taking the batteries in and out. I know this was inexpensive but I feel the on and off button should work.</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer that has worked.  From the first time I used it, it preformed.  It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Got the product today and used it.  Very pleased with the performance and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This does a great job and is totally painless, unlike some that tug and pull. The light really doesn&#x27;t do much for me, but I have been very happy with the unit overall. This is the third one I&#x27;ve had in a year, so I&#x27;m hoping, because this feels substantially made, that it will last long for me.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve used!  Get one and make your nose happy!  Even has a light!</li>
            <li> Just as described - works well - feels substantial in the hand - guess is, it will last, and do its job, a long time</li>
            <li> Every  other one has quit working in a matter of months... this one has been very dependable and doesn&#x27;t just yank out the hair.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the nose trimmer, even though it came with no battery! It does come with a little brush and I like the light. The shape is good for standing up on counter. Have not tried it yet since I used old one this morning. Will followup if it does not work!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and have not used it myself.  But I did ask the recipient how he liked it and he swears it is the best one he has used.</li>
            <li> Works like a dream!  Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is, by far, the most durable, powerful trimmer available.  This item gets Five Stars!!</li>
            <li> So far it does what&#x27;s supposed to do. It&#x27;s easy to clean up and use. I would like it to trim shorter hairs but it seems to be a good product overall.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the reviews are so good for this trimmer. I noticed right away it doesn&#x27;t cut very well and I find myself going over and over the same area. It also doesn&#x27;t cut the hair as tight as my old $10 trimmer which I would&#x27;ve kept but the light quit working. Which brings me to the next disappointment. The light isn&#x27;t bright at all and is barely worth having..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Best nose trimmer I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> It works great; I love it!</li>
            <li> Very pleased. It doesn&#x27;t pull and is very easy to clean. At the price it&#x27;s sold for I feel I got my moneys worth and then some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always just used a sissors but this istaking it to a new level. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product, my husband said it&#x27;s the best nose trimmer he&#x27;s ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Good product made of strong material.  Works well and shipped out right on time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, better than using scissors.</li>
            <li> a great product. It does exactly what its suppose to do.  Looks and feels great also.</li>
            <li> Great product. I only wish it didn&#x27;t need a battery, like I purchased from a different manufacturer before</li>
            <li> This is the best hair trimmer I have used.  Very quick and smooth...yep I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used.  Hope it holds up.</li>
            <li> What a bargain! You cannot beat this trimmer for the $$!!! Works smoothly without any hair pulling. You can&#x27;t go wrong :)</li>
            <li> Have used it several times and does a great job. No more nicks to my nose while trying to trim as close as possible with a scissors.</li>
            <li> It cuts like most of the ones I have but the light is of great value</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several trimmers of this sort in the past.  This is by far the best... more solid and effective.  I&#x27;ve only had it a week now, so I can&#x27;t speak to how long it will last.  It arrived in proper condition and on time.</li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews, so I decided to order this trimmer. The reviews were correct this works better than any of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Great value. Seems like quality product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure the product I received is made of metal, let alone heavy duty steel. I bought this model because it said it was steel. Other than that the product is adequate for the job. Does not seem any better than either of the cheaper ones I have.</li>
            <li> This product was a good choice. Easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Well constructed and designed.  Trims ear and nose hairs very efficiently.  I have not tried in a wet environment as I use it when sitting at my desk or watching TV.  Much better quality than Norelco version that failed me.</li>
            <li> Works very well, great price</li>
            <li> My old nose trimmer stopped working (even though I changed the batteries and it seemed to function, it actually wasn&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to get a really fine one this time, and boy am I happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a trimmer this good. It just does a better job than any other I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who is very happy with the purchase.  He had used others in the past but they break down easily, so we love the warranty this one has!</li>
            <li> this trimmer has a plastic tip, i thought it was supposed to have a stainless steel tip. other than that it works fine so far.update, after having used this trimmer 3 or 4 times now it has gotten to where it does not start when you turn on the switch, have to tap it on counter top a couple times and then it comes on. changed battery made no difference still had to tap on counter top. would no longer recommend this product. also i will not enter an opinion on any product purchased without having used the product a sufficient amount of time to be passing on creditable information to others.i don&#x27;t know if you can change the number of stars after first review but i would now give this trimmer (1) star.</li>
            <li> Arrived today whereupon I installed the battery only to quickly realize that the trimmer cannot be switched off--unless the battery is removed. Apparently, the off position does not do what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs like several of the other trimmers!  Just exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This was great for a little over a year, but no longer works. We emailed the company about the lifetime guarantee and received no response.</li>
            <li> An excellent purchase. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Product works great , good price and received very quickly after ordering...</li>
            <li> Very nice just what I have been looking for .The price was even better.</li>
            <li> Came when expected was packaged properly and works fine,.</li>
            <li> performs as advertised</li>
            <li> HEAVY DUTY  feels right in your hand  solid  sturdy  wish it rechargeable but  I just use rechargeable batteries and this should last a very long time!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised no problems.</li>
            <li> It may not come with battery but is well worth the purchase. High quality and light is added extra.</li>
            <li> My trimmer just arrived yesterday. I had held off my trimming for a while just to give it a good test on arrival. I have only used it once, both nose and ears, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with a trimmer. It does everything the ads say it will do and does it well. As mentioned by a few other reviewers the tip does get warm but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem. I&#x27;m not as enamored with the light as some because it don&#x27;t seem to be of any benefit but not a deal breaker. Overall the best trimmer I have ever had and much more convenient than using tweezers and scissors. The unit seems to be well made and has a solid feel. I&#x27;m hoping this indicates it&#x27;s well made and of good materials. This unit may die tomorrow but on first impression I am well pleased. Now just to see how well it holds up.</li>
            <li> This is the first such product I&#x27;ve owned, so I don&#x27;t have anything with which to compare it.  But then, I&#x27;ve never been an old geezer with hair growing in weird places until fairly recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it works as advertised and seems to do the (rather disgusting) trick quite well.  I&#x27;m not that pleased about needing it, but considering the alternative, I&#x27;m happy I could buy this.</li>
            <li> Great service &amp;amp; a great product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!  It is just as described by the seller.  I would highly recommend buying this product (and recommend buying from this seller)!</li>
            <li> Much better than I have had before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best built of any nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve tried.  You can drive a car over this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Blades spin quickly and cut without a lot of pulling.  It easily rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few quibbles:&lt;br /&gt;- I Wish the cap fit more tightly, it comes loose in the drawer all the time.&lt;br /&gt;- The cutting cap that holds the blade in place is also kinda loose fitting.  I kept trying to twist it harder to see if it would stay in place and ended up breaking both the blade cap and the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;-BUT-&lt;br /&gt;They have a GREAT lifetime warranty.  Just call them with your Amazon order number and they send you a new blade or a new unit if need be.  That you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly and I&#x27;ve only used it once but it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> The first trimmer I have tried that didn&#x27;t just magically die after a few months. My only complaint is that the base is so wide it prevents you from reaching far up in your nose.</li>
            <li> This trimmer replaced a Sharper Image trimmer that broke after several years of usage (I was moving from one home to another and the Sharper Image trimmer was accidentally crushed under a heavy moving box). This new trimmer works well for nose and ear, and unlike the Sharper Image trimmer, I&#x27;m delighted that it doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to tear when I use it. Gain without pain!</li>
            <li> I have purchased many of these over the years.  I am thrilled with it so far.  BEST YET!  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It gets extremely hot during use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE. IT WORKS VERY WELL AND IS EASY TO CLEAN. I TRIED IT IMMEDIATELY AND WAS HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer today after returning a Panasonic trimmer that would not work.  The first thing I noticed after removing the item from its packaging was that is not made of plastic and is very sturdy.  I put one AA battery and turned it on and used it.  The trimmer cut the hairs easily with no pull and no pain while removing them.  It is a fantastic product and be assured that I will recommend Professional Water Resistant Trimmer to my friends and family.  Keep up the good work in producing a product that really works and is easy to use.  Many thanks to you!</li>
            <li> Very well made, high quality trimmer.  Purchased this mainly to use on hair around my ears, but works well on eyebrows &amp; nasal hair also.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully well. As advertised</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Having had the opportunity to purchase better known brands (Panasonic and&lt;br /&gt;Phillips) I decided on yours after reading other favorable reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Product is well made and performs flawlessly. I&#x27;ll spread the word!.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of months. It works great. It does not get dull and start ripping out the hairs instead of cutting them like a couple of others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Mr. Steve Parisi stands behind his product. I had trouble with the battery cover and returned the trimmer and gave it one star. Mr. Parisi got in touch with me and asked if I would like a new trimmer free of charge to try out. I did and received it promptly and must say it works just as described. I have been using this trimmer since Oct. 2014 and have no complaints, only compliments. I highly recommend this trimmer as it does as stated. And the company has proven it stands by the product.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used! Works well especially in the ears.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing it lacks that my others had is an eye brow trimmer but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product and quick service.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THE PRODUCT, MAYBE 5 TIMES, ONLY  TO HAVE IT STP WORKING.  I CHANGED THE BATTERIES AND IT STILL WILL NOT LIGHT UP OR RUN?  HOW  DO I CRRECT THIS PROBLEM.  IF I BOUGHT IT AT CVS I COUD JUT TAKE IT BACK.  I BOUGHT &amp;#34;ON-LINE&amp;#34; AS I HAVE RECENTLY HAD A STRKE AND CAN&#x27;T GET AROUND VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> it works good and doesn&#x27;t pinch but it broke some reason it has a weak spot on it cheap plastic</li>
            <li> Like all other Nose Trimmers, seems to be under powered even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> I have use many nose trimmer in the past and this one is one of the best in the market. 95% of all the nose trimmers cost around $9.99 and you think that you are getting a good deal but believe me they will break on you and won&#x27;t do the job like this one. Very easy to control and very gentle and soft feeling when you are using it. I highly recommended and after the first use you will feel like you did make the right choice in purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Fast delivery. Better than expected.</li>
            <li> very good performence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a couple months now and am very happy with it. I bought this metal trimmer to replace other plastic trimmers that seemed to break or just stop working after a few short months. This trimmer continues to work very well and seems to be holding up much better than its competitors. I&#x27;d recommend this trimmer over any and all plastic trimmers. Don&#x27;t even waste your time looking at other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Cheap.  Battery cap would not securely go back on after first time being removed.  Product never even turned on once.  Cheap design and build.  Waste of time buying.  Quality control not there.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Best nose trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product two weeks and it works well and I have used it several times and it was a pain free, quick and easy experience. Cleaning the thing is easy too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. Had much better quality. Was disappointed to be honest.  Don&#x27;t understand the great reviews personally.  Not terribly bad. Just not great.</li>
            <li> The base is not closing properly and the item is not turning on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to need to return this item to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product - works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I received my unit today and was impressed with the look of the unit and the appearance of a quality product. Unfortunately, like many reviewers here, I received a unit that will not turn off due a defective on/off switch. I picked this trimmer over other brands because of the commitment to quality, which I&#x27;m sad to say just doesn&#x27;t hit the mark because paying money for a defective unit should NOT be a hoop for consumers to jump through. Hopefully Toiletree&#x27;s customer service sees this to make up for a waste of my time and money so I can update this review like many others.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best trimmer I have used! Stays sharp, this is the one to buy!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Works better than the others I have had.</li>
            <li> Solid piece of equipment. Very thorough in its hair removal. Arrived on time and in tact. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> i like it.  my former trimmer did not trim the nose hairs as effectively.  Also...no pulling which is a big improvement over my former trimmer.  thanks.  i would re-order.</li>
            <li> Simple, well thought out design. I like fact that handle is metal without being heavy. Seems well made. Trimmer works very well on different types of hair. Simple to use and I like the fact it uses a AA battery, not rechargeable type. It is also relatively easy to keep clean by just rinsing the head with water while it is turned on.  LED light is good idea but could be a bit brighter (I understand this is not a flashlight but...not super bright).  Other than, I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Works great, gets real close cut, plenty powerful and seems sturdy - so far so good</li>
            <li> Seems to function well</li>
            <li> Good nose trimmer, sturdy metal chassis, gets the job done and even has a light to see your work.</li>
            <li> If you sadly find your nostrils in need of deforestation, this is the tool for you. I looked into more expensive models, but was not ready to make that sort of investment. First step is admitting you have a problem. The second step is buying this little gizmo. Take the leap... Your coworkers will thank you, because those hairs are distracting...</li>
            <li> This would be a great product if it would shut off correctly.&lt;br /&gt;When you move the switch to shut it off, it continue to run for several seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I expect someday it will not shut off.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Previous buyers reported problems installing the battery, but this was easy. Does a good job.</li>
            <li> I had so many different trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;This one is best one I had perios</li>
            <li> Feels nice and solid. Does its job.</li>
            <li> I have another five star review for this shaver but want to add a plus and a minus.  On the plus side the shaver cuts great and the battery live is so much better than brand &amp;#34;W&amp;#34;.  I think the batteries last longer because the tolerances on the moving parts are so smooth that there is less energy required.  This also leads to what appears to be a much higher RPM.  It just plain sounds better than brand &amp;#34;W&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con (minus) is in the on/off switch.  It&#x27;s just plain difficult to move (it&#x27;s a slide switch).  I thought it would get better with use but it hasn&#x27;t.  I can turn it off and on but sometimes it takes a couple of trys and some repositioning of my thumb.</li>
            <li> I used to laugh at products like this.  Now, I&#x27;m a few months shy of 50, and let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve got a lot more hair in my nose and ears than I used to.  I stuck a battery in it ( 1 AA ), and slinked upstairs to the master bath.  My wife was at work, my daughter at school, and the dogs outside.  I didn&#x27;t want anyone seeing me do this!  I pulled off the protective cover, hit the power switch, tilted my head back and stuck it up my nose.  I used the circular motion described in the instructions.  There was no pain like when I plucked them.  No cut skin like when I tried to use scissors to trim those pesky hairs.  When I no longer heard the grinding sound of the trimmer cutting hairs, I stuck it in my ears.  Grrrrrrrrrrrrr went the trimmer!  Again, when I was getting no more cutting sounds from my ears, I shut the beast off and prepared myself for inspection.  Yes, I was in the military for over 12 years, so I looked at it like I would if I was preparing for a personnel inspection.  Let me tell you, I&#x27;d of scored and outstanding based on my lack of nose and ear hair alone!  No more plucking.  No more teary eyes or sneezing from plucking, just hairless nostrils and ears.  I hate that I need it, I&#x27;m glad that I have it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does not pull your hair and is as advertised. I received it in a timely manner and I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy and I&#x27;ve used and tried (and burnt up at one point or another) just about every kind of trimmer out there. This one stands above most for the price. Very quiet, smooth running (I&#x27;ve found most cheap ones vibrate quite a bit, never really noticed that till I tried this one) and well built, not a single pulled hair so far and the built in led lights is a very nice addition.</li>
            <li> I Love It,It&#x27;s great for nose ,ear and other places, Feels solid and handles great,the light to see in dark places, nose is a must,love that part a lot and with a life time Guarantee,That in it self sold Me,Ones cost much more than this one but they will not back there Product,Shame on them,I will Be Telling My Friends about this one. EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Son is very happy with this.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works like a charm!!! We have had a difficult time finding one that works as well as our old one that died, but this trimmer works better than any we have had! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> THIS NOSE TRIMMER ONLY LASTED 5 MONTHS ALMOST TO THE DAY.  THE LITTLE PLASTIC PARTS INSIDE STARTED TO LOOSEN AND WERE CATCHING THE NOSE HAIR WITHOUT CUTTING IT.  MY HUSBAND THREW IT OUT BEFORE HE TOLD ME ABOUT IT SO I DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO TEST THEIR &amp;#34;LIFETIME WARRANTY&amp;#34; TO SEE IF THEY WOULD REPLACE IT</li>
            <li> This is build very well, heavy and solid. The cutting part is precise and smooth metal. And, it cuts great! The motor is strong and doesn&#x27;t get bogged down. My favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Well designed.  Cuts hair easily and quickly.  Good tool for one of life&#x27;s annoying tasks.  Was not familiar with this brand but it works better than the name brand trimmers.</li>
            <li> Was unfamiliar with this name, but this is a well constructed product that works better than any of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> no problems, works like a \\&quot;charm\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;should have got this 10 years ago&lt;br /&gt;the best trimmer I have used [and I have tried at least 6 others]&lt;br /&gt;enjoy</li>
            <li> ok sounds gross but i usually just pull my nose hair. the problem is it takes awhile to get all of them and there is a lot of sneezing involved. so i searched for a cheap nose hair trimmer. i love this thing, it takes no time at all and no sneeze attacks. i just dont understand why there is a light on it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great!  I&#x27;ve had a few others over the years and this one works better than any I&#x27;ve tried.  Of course the real test will be to see how well it holds up over time but for now I am well pleased!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I put off buying a nose hair trimmer, fearing it would hurt even worse than pulling them.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, this trimmer is simply amazing!  It does NOT hurt or pull hairs in any way.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer feels very sturdy.  It is easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel ridiculous having waited so long.  I Highly recommend this model!</li>
            <li> I have several similar trimmers. They all appear to be much the same. So I was quite suspicious about why this one would be superior. Especially since it had several one star ratings. But I took a chance. I could always return it, or add it to the pile of nose hair yankers I already own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised. Different from the others was the weight and feel of this one. Having only used it once, I can&#x27;t speak for how reliable it will be. But it appears like it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for its intended purpose, not a single pull or yanked hair in ears or nostrils. It may not trim skin close, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to. It&#x27;s trimming nose hairs, so using a foil blade would be senseless. It trims close enough that it should satisfy anyone getting close enough to inspect the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite satisfied with this purchase. And if it does fail in time, the company appears to stand behind their product with a lifetime guarantee.</li>
            <li> The best Trimmer I&#x27;ve had.  The size, weight, durability, and cutting action are second to none!  Would definitely buy again, but then again it&#x27;s got a life-time guarantee, so I won&#x27;t have to.  If you need one (and who doesn&#x27;t) get this one, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Very useful tool in trimming ear and nose hairs. No pinching of hairs.  Using a scissor of any size is difficult and less functional. LED light is useful.</li>
            <li> The best yet. Got this for Christmas.  It cuts the hairs close, safely and quickly, no pulling.  Nice light so you can see what you&#x27;re doing.  Dasy to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and he loves it!!!  He said it does not pull or hurt when he uses it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works as advertised. My wife and I like it. Not much else to say</li>
            <li> Love it. Not as heavy as one would think.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Looks like somebody finally did it right. Same design as all the rest but.....the end cap that holds the battery in place locks firmly. No loose connection causing the battery to cut out. Switch has a positive on off function. Sure it&#x27;s plastic but it works. The people who designed this realized that consumers want something that performs for more than a month. Buy with confidence.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Best I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Never could have wished for a better noise hair trimmer. Fast, powerful, easy to clean, great quality.</li>
            <li> love it works the best!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love the light feature.</li>
            <li> just got this, works really well. I have owned panasonic and a couple others, this one is the best assuming it lasts for awhile. Nose and ears..as I&#x27;m getting older I&#x27;m finding ear hair grows like crazy and where there never was before. This is a great gift for a man in his late 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It works great!  True to most of the positive testimonials given.  I really haven&#x27;t much use for the light, but it illuminates very well.  Of a sturdy construction, does not pull hairs, cuts precisely and fits nicely in my nose and ears, without an extreme annoying buzz like former units.  I had two trimmers and have discarded them for this one.  A good investment!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this brand so I was a little leery about buying it, but the reviews were good and I&#x27;ve not had a lot of luck with the major brands&#x27; offerings in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it only for my nose hair and it works flawlessly. No painful tugging on hairs like some of the other brands do from time to time. Plenty of power, unlike one I just returned to my local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the LED light is useless, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I&#x27;d buy it again based on using it for a month now.</li>
            <li> light is a joke--need tolight a match to see if it is on--trimmer  part works.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just that right out of the box the on/off switch does not work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So design, functionality overall is good for the money---the issue seems to be with the QC of their Chinese manufacturing process.</li>
            <li> Works just perfectly. So much less painful than using a tweezers!</li>
            <li> Finally a better alternative to Panasonic trimmers that don&#x27;t last more than a year or two, and don&#x27;t work as well. I know because I&#x27;ve been through about 3 of them over the years. This one compared to others has a heavier, much more solid feel to it and works better - the blade seems much more effective / sharper and works without pulling.  Panasonic is junk compared to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this device about 8 or 9 times since receiving it. It is far superior to any other nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried a few, including some of the best-reviewed here on Amazon. It is the only trimmer that did not require post-trim tweezing of stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be of very sturdy construction. Furthermore, even if it were to fail, the company seems to be actively engaged with its customers, with the CEO himself interacting with customers here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to build a business for the long haul, this is how you run it.</li>
            <li> Very nice little tool.  Delivered in a timely manner as well.</li>
            <li> Good product. Well made and works as claimed.</li>
            <li> This trimmer costs about twice as much as basic trimmers and is described as heavy duty, lifetime guarantee, etc.  It is actually a total piece of crap.  It is impossible to get the cap back on once you put the battery in.  The plastic part on the outside comes off when it should be integrated into the body of the trimmer.  Little parts around the head easily fall out of place.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, can also use in the shower. It  runs on a 1.5 V AA battery.  Just a nice, compact, well designed little product that gets the job done.  Nicely protected (unlike the mini blade units that can cut you) this one is almost impossible to cut or hurt yourself!</li>
            <li> This is the second purchase of this product!  It works beautifully!   However, the first one DIED and it is in the box from this one for me to send back to you:  Advertised &amp;#34;GUARANTEED FOR LIFE&amp;#34; ...</li>
            <li> works great,so far so good.</li>
            <li> After several razors finding this one was a treat.  I&#x27;ve tried all the panasonic, samsung and others and their motors always stop working.  This one keeps going.  The LED is a nice touch.  You need to remember to put the protective cap on while travelling because I accidentally damaged the shave tip by not doing so.</li>
            <li> Better than others I have owned</li>
            <li> Just got it so not sure about longevity, but it works great. Seems to built well.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great on any piece of hair it touches. It cuts the hair short just as a trimmer should. No pulling or tugging, clean cut every time I use it. It feels very solid when it is in your hands.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it.  Now I can stop hounding him about dangling nose hairs and he says he wishes he&#x27;d started using something sooner.  Men.  No pulling, pinching or pain.  Great little tool!</li>
            <li> I have used almost every brand nose hair trimmer and so far, this is the best.  Although it tickles, that is my nose not this item LOL.  It does seem to get rid of the hair better and faster than others.  The only negative is that the light on the item is more of a gimmick than useful since it does not shine in the nose in any way that helps.  It also says in the instructions that it has a lock but I sure could not find it. Not really important since it has a protective cover.  I really like the way this works.</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer!  Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Trimmer had a promising start but the on/off switch is flawed. Sometimes doesn&#x27;t turn off, sometimes won&#x27;t turn on . Just can&#x27;t count on it. Only worked for about two weeks!</li>
            <li> Works well for both male and female. And with a lifetime warranty you can&#x27;t beat the price! I&#x27;m very pleased and recommend.</li>
            <li> Just ok. Does the job but looking for a bit more power.</li>
            <li> Works well and fast gets the job done</li>
            <li> Great product.  Surpasses the cheap ones by a mile.</li>
            <li> puffed up bio but its really no better than most others I&#x27;ve tried  hopefully the &amp;#34;lifetime&amp;#34; warranty will be in effect if it breaks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all.  They all break.  They&#x27;re all cheaply made.  I&#x27;ve only had this one for a week, but I know it will be long-lasting.  It is truly solidly constructed, and is extremely efficient and effective.  I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but this one deserves it.  If you&#x27;re looking to deal with those pesky hairs coming out of your nose and ears, this is the best solution available.  And, the light, which I thought would be a frivolous addition, is incredibly helpful.  The trimmer came quickly and without a hitch.  Thank you Toilet Tree Products.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is exactly what I wanted and is as described on the Amazon site. Packaged very well, not over done, but protected the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It does the job nicely. The tip gets very warm after a few minutes of use</li>
            <li> Works great. Just as described. No pulling or pinching. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as powerful as I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> Junk - like many others, the device doesn&#x27;t lock after putting the battery in. Didn&#x27;t get to use once and not trying another one of these awful products.</li>
            <li> I am happy and  it gets the  job done, the only thing is that you have push a little deeper in your nose.</li>
            <li> very good product..thanks for fast shipment</li>
            <li> looks good ,but stopped working after first use, so returned it .</li>
            <li> This was a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my husband, he loves it. It works great. Great buy!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I bought this because of the lifetime warranty - I was tired of other brands because I keep having to buy a new trimmer every year because the blade got dull.  Nobody sells replacement blades - probably because they know people will go out and buy a whole new unit when it gets dull.  Anyway, I hope this is the last trimmer I ever have to buy thanks to the lifetime warranty.  So far I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> As good as any that I have tried.</li>
            <li> at 70 years of age, this is a needed grooming aid and I love it. Works efficiently and reliably.</li>
            <li> My husband says the trimmer works great! Light is not too much help, though.  He likes that it is not round so it doesn&#x27;t role.</li>
            <li> Broken upon arrival.  Never worked.  Piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in perfect condition.  Very well made and feels good in my hand.  Easy to grip (and I have nerve damage in my fingers on both hands so the easy grip design was a nice surprise) and works like a charm!  This nose hair trimmer (which is what I bought this product for) works great.  Painless.  Easy to operate.  Instructions are simple and straightforward to follow (in case you&#x27;ve never used a nose hair/ear hair trimmer before).  And...I&#x27;m an older woman (55) with dark hair and have been plagued with more nose hairs than ever before since menopause.  Thank you, Menopause.  Grrrrrrr.  My old Wahl nose hair trimmer was okay but not as nicely engineered as this one.  I highly recommend this nose hair trimmer.  It will get the job done whether you are male or female.  :)</li>
            <li> The light is a great addition to an otherwise boring chore!&lt;br /&gt;Item was delivered on time and as advertised. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Finally.  Found one that husband is happy with....especially the quality!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good trimmer and works as I would have expected</li>
            <li> Cuts quick and close. Very pleased with my purchase. I thought all trimmers were pretty much the same, but this much better than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 years old and finally got tired of my HS friend being disgusted about my nose hairs. Bought this trimmer mainly because of the product description and its durable look and waterproof feature. It works like a champ and sorry I hadn&#x27;t bought one much earlier in my life. Easy to use, no hair pinching and simply....works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pjay</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves the way it handles and that it seems much sturdier than ones he has had before.</li>
            <li> A well designed product…  It has a nice feel in the hand. It operates very smoothly and cuts hair easily and quickly. Was not familiar with this brand but it works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It works fine. It does have a short tip which makes it difficult to go deep. I also used it on my ears.</li>
            <li> This is my first nose hair trimmer, and other than the fact that I now feel like an old man for owning a nose hair trimmer, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product. It cuts the hairs in the nose and around the ear quickly and painlessly, and the LED light is very helpful. The trimmer tip does get warm when in use, which was initially unsettling. But it by no means gets hot, and I guess some could find the warmth soothing. Overall, very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Good power, very effective hair removal.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer. I did not realize there could be that much difference between trimmers. This is one excellent trimmer. Installed the battery, very solid case. Turned it on and in seconds all hairs were trimmed. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This can conquer my hubby&#x27;s nose and ear hair.  Enough said</li>
            <li> My first nose electric trimmer and I have to say it works well!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for his Christmas stocking.  He says it works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week and still no &amp;#34;blue smoke&amp;#34;. All I know is people don&#x27;t stare at my face in disgust as much as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; AA Batt NOT INCLUDED.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this appliance.....fast delivery....works well.</li>
            <li> Great product and customer service! !!!</li>
            <li> I have been through many nose-hair trimmers and, so far, this one is the best I have used.  It feels very sturdy and well-made, and it works exactly as advertised.  It does a thorough job without pulling the hairs.  The motor has plenty of power.  I hope this is the last one I have to buy!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. I waited awhile before I review this product. Before I had used scissors to trim my nose hair. This gets very close, very fast. This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used: so now, it&#x27;s not a chore at all to keep the nose hairs trimmed and neat.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Does just what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This is a solid nose trimmer, constructed very well. The led light is useless as the beam doesn&#x27;t really shine directly up inside the nostril, unless you tilt the device. But I&#x27;m a gadget guy so, that doesn&#x27;t bother me. No problems with tugging or snagging. It cuts very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Works great I love it</li>
            <li> I receive my trimmer promptly and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I had my first one for a few years and loved it.  I lost it in a move and ordered an identical item.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommended</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this trimmer from ToiletTree Products and I am very pleased with the quality of it.  It&#x27;s solidly built and not cheap in quality and it works great!  Not only is the trimmer a great product, but this seller is committed to customer satisfaction and that&#x27;s a plus in my world.  So, if you&#x27;re in need of a great product, and you want to buy from a company who has your best interest in mind and not only their bottom line, then you&#x27;ve found what you&#x27;re looking for right here.</li>
            <li> Great product. Others were a complete waste of money. These remind me of a professional quality product.</li>
            <li> I was a dedicated Wahl Trimmer user, but have had numerous issues of late regarding their quality and the units needing to be replaced at my cost.  I decided, after reading the reviews, to try the ToiletTree Trimmer and have been extremely satisfied with it.  It is very easy to use and very effective in both the nose and ear areas.  I even found the LED light to be beneficial!  The lifetime warranty is a big plus for someone (like me) with bad experiences with other products.</li>
            <li> Very well designed. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> the tip of the steel heats up after use for only 10-15 minutes.  It was uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Works good and is very quiet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the quality and value of this product.  I no longer dread this periodic hygiene activity.  I&#x27;m even more impressed with the company from which I purchased it.  There was a problem with the item I received, and it was remedied within 24 hours after I contacted them.  ToiletTree Products is now bookmarked for anything I need and that they sell.  Love the unit, love the company.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works great. Cuts close too and very easy to use</li>
            <li> Not only does this product do the job well and with style, at an already impressive value, but the warranty pushes this over the top into a must have for your bathroom. They mean it when they say they&#x27;ll take care of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally dropped the blade piece from the top nozzle down my drain, and after emailing the vender, I was swiftly sent a new top piece at no charge! Very impressed with both the product and the swift customer service. :)</li>
            <li> Arrived safely. Works efficiently. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, worth the money. Cuts as described in the product review.</li>
            <li> It does a good job and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of these hair trimming products due to fact that I&#x27;ve had crappy ones in the past...this trimmer is great...its well made, trims nose and ear hair quickly and painless,and the LED light is a big plus..my only issue with it (which is not a big deal) is that you have to trim probably a little bit more frequently but as another customer stated in a review, thats probably the trade off to painless hair removal..we look at our faces everyday in mirror so I just keep it in the bathroom at the ready..</li>
            <li> I, too, had a defective switch. Once I put a battery in, the trimmer would not turn off. It&#x27;s too bad--I was looking forward to using this trimmer. Now my nose/ear hair will continue to grow while I process my return and search for another trimmer.</li>
            <li> As others indicate, this trimmer works painlessly in nose and ears. It is better than the device it replaced in at least two ways. It is relatively silent, which is important for trimming the hairs in the outer ear. It works without pulling on the hairs, and still provides very close trimming.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and have no issues in first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Quality product and fits nicely in the hand.  I had bought several of the Drug Store types with the straight blade.  They constantly plugged up and had to be taken apart to be unclogged.  This trimmer has a rotating head and the ability to clean under water.  So far - am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to return this for a refund. After removing the battery cover to insert the battery, the cover would not screw back into place correctly. No alignment would work and therefore the trimmer would not turn on.</li>
            <li> Best I have owned to date</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product! It really does work well!</li>
            <li> It arrived intact. It works great.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts clean and runs and sounds like a professional model.&lt;br /&gt;Well pleased.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this only once, but it was very efficient. I will update if a problem arises.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for. I did hours of research before buying this one on Amazon. EXACTLY what I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;I had two major qualifications:&lt;br /&gt;1) Did the tip reach far enough into my nostril to get all the visible hair, and also some of the hair farther back.&lt;br /&gt;2) Was the tip dummy proof enough that I could really root around and get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Yes and yes.&lt;br /&gt;The tip was exactly the length it should be, and reached back far enough to get all visible hair, plus a little bit more.&lt;br /&gt;The tip is indeed dummy proof. I did some pretty serious rooting around. I was able to put the tip up against the skin inside of my nostril and actually apply pressure so that I got an extra close cut. Never nicked me once no matter how hard I pressed.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my most troublesome spot is both sides of the septum (the column between your nostrils) and this trimmer cleaned it out like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely satisfied, and feel confident about using this trimmer in any position with as much pressure as I want and need to get the job done right.</li>
            <li> High quality, solid in structure, and works better than any other one I have ever had.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S FOR MY HUSBAND..HE LIKES IT JUST FINE</li>
            <li> Very good steel nose trimmer with light, better than old one, cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once. But...... as mentioned by other reviews it is very sturdy to the feel. What encouraged me most was the mention in a review of the co. President contacting one unhappy customer , and rectifying his failed trimmer. We need more of that in today&#x27;s cheaper made product, higher price world.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and it does a very good job! No pulling! Very well built! It is solid! The last one I purchased was the Remington NE-3. Not nearly as effective as this one. On top of that, the Remmy stopped working within two years. This one has a lifetime warranty. Hoping that I won&#x27;t have to exorcize that warranty. I don&#x27;t like returning stuff. So for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the ToiletTree Nose &amp; Ear Trimmer!</li>
            <li> Best personal trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve had it for many months and this trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut my skin or pull hairs. Heats up a little if used for a longer period of time, but that&#x27;s no big deal. Great, great, great trimmer!</li>
            <li> This is a great, durable replacement for those trimmers that last a few days / weeks, making you wonder why you ever bothered to get them in the first place.  This thing by ToiletTree works just great and I intend to buy more as gifts for my siblings.  Yeah, I know, we have reached the age when there&#x27;s more hair growing in our noses and ears than on our heads.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but not sure yet how will hold up</li>
            <li> My husband loved it!  Arrived quickly.........works great!</li>
            <li> Very high quality, well built product! The light is bright and useful, the body is well built and seems sturdy, and the tip seems sharp enough to tackle a nose hair jungle. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like the unit and it seems to work well.  High blade speed, relatively easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I learned the hard way not to stick it into my nostril as I have with other trimmers like the Panasonic and Wahl.  I don&#x27;t know if it pulled a hair, or actually cut me, but my nose started to bleed.  That has NEVER happened before, so I was rather surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say that I am not too happy with not being able to take the blades out for periodic cleaning.  That seems like a poor design choice for a device that is going to get stuck into my nose.  The Panasonic, which is a very similar design, lets the blade be removed for cleaning and also has a &amp;#34;flush hole&amp;#34; that allows water to flow through the nozzle.</li>
            <li> Great Product, works well!</li>
            <li> this thing works great, spins fast, no pulling of the hairs, just clips them right off!</li>
            <li> Product is awesome. It works great. I recommend this product to anyone who grooms themselves.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to trim my husbands ear hair. He seems to like it too.I bought this at the recommendation of my daughter-in-law. The price is good and it works well.</li>
            <li> These things never work...Just sayin&#x27;</li>
            <li> Second purchased in three years and without question, this is most effective, easy to use, deforester of noise and ear hairs. Slelf operated smoothly.</li>
            <li> works just as well as you would want.  Been solid for 4 months now.</li>
            <li> After opening the product the twist cap on the bottom wouldn&#x27;t twist back on so I returned the product and got a Wahl Trimmer. Much better.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but once, seems to be working well.  The true test will be my husband&#x27;s ears.  But I&#x27;ll have to wait until he is asleep to tackle that problem!  ...haha  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for about a month and then the on/off switch jammed rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> Excelent product and service.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Does a good job trimming my nose and ear hair. The round design lets me get to all the nooks and crannies without worrying about nicking. Has a solid feel. I do not use it in the shower.  Only had it about 2 months. Assuming it lasts a few years, this is a really good trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very well made and functions flawlessly. Highly recommended product. The first time I used it it was so smooth that I was sure they didn&#x27;t put a blade it in and that it was not working, but it was. This &amp;#34;instrument&amp;#34; is very well well made and is industrial strength.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;In-fact, it is made so well and is so &amp;#34;heavy-duty&amp;#34;, I am thinking of using it to replace my hedge trimmer and weed eater.  If I could figure out out how to put wheels on it, I could replace my lawn mower too!</li>
            <li> This does a very good job love it</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product. I&#x27;ve bought several nose/ear hair trimmers in the past and have thrown them all away after giving them fair trials. The Toilettree trimmer is expensive, but well worth every cent. It trims all the hair it touches, no matter the angle. Buy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality, works okay, and the light is pretty much useless. I wish they would have used a bit more horsepower in the motor but it works fine.</li>
            <li> The toilet tree nose trimmer works great. It was easy to use and does a very clean cut, without any pulling or pain.</li>
            <li> Product was received promptly, and works great.  It is efficient, painless and safe; and can be used without fear of injury.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works better than most.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be more powerful or heavy duty as it states.  Not made as well as a Wahl product that I replaced.  Oh well... It serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;All I can say is WOW! I used to cringe when I needed to trim my nose hairs. I was not expecting the clean cutting action with zero - and I mean zero, nill, nada (0) pulled hairs. This is the best trimmer I have found!! I wish I got it sooner, before I bought other named brands and specialty store brands that are inferior to the ToiletTree product!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My aversion to cutting my nose hairs has been replaced with a knowing awareness that the task is finally painless.  This unit is truly painless and effective beyond anything I have every used. larger units with more batteries can&#x27;t match the clean cuts without pulling or leaving annoying stubble.</li>
            <li> Product works well in the nose and reasonable well in the ears, It&#x27;s a good ear and nose trimmer for the money.</li>
            <li> If you would like a great trimmer, don&#x27;t settle for less and pay the few extra $$$. This is the real deal!!!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Convenient for use in the shower.  Also a lifetime guarantee .  I&#x27;ve only had it about a week, but so far, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> my son was happy with there construction and easy usage of the trimmer. it arrived as stated and was packaged properly.  will wait to see how long it lasts.  looks that the construction is suitable.</li>
            <li> This has proved to be a great buy. Had never used this type of trimmer before, but it has performed perfectly and I wish I&#x27;d made this purchase a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Works very well! I especially like the directive light to aid in seeing detail. I otherwise just don&#x27;t find this any better than the cheaper models except that over time it may prove worthy because of its being made with stainless steel!</li>
            <li> There claim was it was best trimmer on the market.  I have had three, and I believe they are correct.</li>
            <li> Great product , would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Bought for give for my dad. Loved it</li>
            <li> Opened the box, pulled it out, put batteries in it and could not get the top back on. My wife and I both tried many times. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Best nose hair trimmer out there! Doesn&#x27;t just cut close, it works like a razor. It leaves no traces of hair in your nose. NONE!</li>
            <li> Seems a little less powerful and doesn&#x27;t cut as well as some other similar products, but those all broke down quickly.  This does seem a little sturdier and the company sent an email asking how I like it, so I&#x27;m hoping it holds up or the company will follow through with its guarantee.  Unlike Panasonic who just sent me into a phone call loop nightmare when I tried to get a replacement under warranty when their trimmer broke down,</li>
            <li> ehhh..okay. it works but takes a long time to use to get everything as closely as i would have expected.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.  Feels sturdy and well-made.</li>
            <li> I really liked my Hair Trimmer. It felt like a quality product in my hand and did a really job of removing the nose hair. I also liked the lifetime guarantee which means that the trimmer is a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was very reasonable and a good value for the money paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be interested in knowing what other quality products your company sells and the prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respectfully submitted,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LaMONT F. SMITH</li>
            <li> Cuts great. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> this product does not cut hair. not worth the purchase, save your time and money. mine is being returned.</li>
            <li> My husbands old nose trimmer bit the dust and I purchased this one to replace it.  He told me that it is the BEST one that he has ever had!!!</li>
            <li> Bought by my husband. The trimmer was delivered promptly.  It works well, no pinching, and the light (unlike many other nose trimmers) is helpful.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer my husband loves the way it trims and the led light is very helpful I would recommend to anyone who wants a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Trims ear/nose hairs just fine.  Hopefully it won&#x27;t stop working like all the other brands that I&#x27;ve bought over the years.</li>
            <li> Feels solid and did a good job trimming nose hairs, but the blades quickly became uncomfortably warm.  Had to stop and let it cool down twice within a minute of use.  It might not have gotten hot enough to burn, but I didn&#x27;t wait to find out.  It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> Cuts nose hairs with the best of them.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. My husband especially loves it since the tip is round and easily inserts into the nose. When in use it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair like other models he&#x27;s used. And the LED is great.&lt;br /&gt;also want to mention what a great company this is. Delivery was fast and product arrived without a dent.</li>
            <li> This was a bit pricier than I expected but the money was well worth it as it works much better than the cheaper versions that I have purchased and thrown out in the past.  The blades cut through hairs on the first pass and this one is solidly built.</li>
            <li> ToiletTree makes really great products despite their awful (but memorable) name. This trimmer works well. It&#x27;s painless. It&#x27;s waterproof so can be rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some folks have had products that required replacement and the company did so rapidly and courteously. Although I have not had any problems with this, I did have another product where a plastic part broke. I called the company and they quickly sent out a replacement part immediately and at no cost to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good design and quality of the products, coupled with the excellent customer service have made me a happy and loyal customer.</li>
            <li> It does the job and the construction seems very solid compared to my last unit (Panasonic ER-GN30-K) which stopped working after dropping about 3 feet from the medicine cabinet into the sink.  I was a bit concerned with some of the on/off switch complaints people had, but they all seemed to be resolved quickly by the company.</li>
            <li> When removing the clear plastic cover, the head, where the blade is, easily gets loose. Then, to reinstall the head again, it is hard to get it attached to the main body while keeping the blade holder where it should be. After owning this for a year, today the blade fell off the holder and ir just can&#x27;t be reattached again.</li>
            <li> Mine did not work at all, and I am not  sure what I did with it,  I will try to locate it, and return it.  How do I do this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. I have tried several nose hair trimmers in the past from infomercials and just locating them in stores and they never worked very well. I couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked so I just started plucking them out with tweezers, tears would flow from my eyes and I would sneeze after every hair I plucked. None of that happens now. This product has exceeded any expectations I had. It usually gets every hair on the first pass. You can hear it cutting hairs, sometimes you don&#x27;t realize you had that much hair in there. It&#x27;s heavy duty steel and very durable unlike most other products. The only complaint I have is that the cap won&#x27;t stay on, (which isn&#x27;t a major deal) but I&#x27;m afraid it may get damaged if I don&#x27;t keep it on there. That is me nit picking, but it works great,</li>
            <li> Quality product that does the job.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, very good quality!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Had a cheap one once that was a waste of money but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this one. Well built, very solid.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good it you have trouble with hair in you nose or ears it will not cut you, all men need this.</li>
            <li> Bought this as it looked well made. Have used it once and really like it....just wish everything was not made in China.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using such a product.  I was hesitant to start using a trimmer after hearing issues other users have had with their trimmers.  After using my new trimmer, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product and its vendor.  Very nice experience.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Christmas present for my husband. He said it is very easy to use and gets everything all cleaned up the way it should be.</li>
            <li> Quality of hair nose trimmer is  great and water resistance. I definitely recommend the trimmer to others..</li>
            <li> My  husband loves this item. Works great</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;It works very well for trimming where we don&#x27;t like to see hair coming from.</li>
            <li> A good product that appears to be well built and works as it should.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use, and the light makes using it so much easier. Very happy.</li>
            <li> There is a burning smell.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job</li>
            <li> My husband loves this! He says it doesn&#x27;t pull hairs, or pinch, and its highly effective and comfortable.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  It worked.  My wife wants it to cut close to the nasal mucosa or is threatening to pull out the hair, so I am counting on the unit to do an outstanding job or ouch!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t walk around with hairs growing out of your nose! That&#x27;s weird and gross. You need to do something about it. This will help you get rid of those nose hairs. Does a decent job and have never pinched the inside of my nose like I have with other designs.</li>
            <li> Works well and I&#x27;m completely satisfied</li>
            <li> This is the best most reasonably priced that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I opened the package, inserted a battery, and enjoyed the experience!  Terrific product and timely delivery as well! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great Product, works well</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works well.  Sad I didn&#x27;t do this a few years ago.  It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> After trying and using several other kinds or brands of Nose Hair Trimmers over many years and finding them all to be pretty useless and/or painful, I had given up on ever trying another.  But the last one I bought must have been at least 10 years ago. Thought I&#x27;d look to see if any improvements have been made since then by reading reviews on Amazon. The reviews on this one were numerous and encouragingly positive so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Very glad I did. This one works...and it works painlessly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the feel and workmanship of this device.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this product a lot.  Exactly what he was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have had numerous nose and ear hair trimmers and nearly all say they are the best, but this particular trimmer is hands down the best I have had.  High quality, great power, and quiet.  Does the job for which is is intended and the delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> My husband was not happy with the way this trimmer worked.  The Panasonic he purchased prior to this was much better.</li>
            <li> Good product. Gets the job done fast and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I used it right out of the box when it arrived, and it worked perfectly. I had a job interview the next day, so it came at just the right time. The trimmer was smooth, and I was able to get the tip into tricky areas just fine.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband &amp; he loves !</li>
            <li> Work so much better than the other one I have.  Great produce.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, works really well. have used it for about two months now. Looks like it should hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> easy to use and I believe it will last a lot longer than other brand</li>
            <li> So far, so good. This product has a nice sturdy feel.</li>
            <li> Stylish and works well on nose and ears without discomfort.  Easy directions for cleaning.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> What an excellent and well made product.  Easy to use.  Effective and intuitive.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this type of product</li>
            <li> I ordered this product due to all the positive reviews and initially after receiving I loved it.  After only a handful of uses, it no longer works. It appears that something broke inside and now it doesn&#x27;t cut anymore. Major  bummer as I loved it when it worked UPDATE 5/4/15-I phoned the company and they sent out a replacement to me at no charge honoring the lifetime warranty.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i have any more nose hair than other men, but definitely have some to trim. this is the best nose hair trimmer i&#x27;ve ever used. it gets everything. plus the little light on the end is something i didn&#x27;t expect to really find helpful, but it actually is. great product for a very specific need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product a few days, so I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up over time.  It works very effectively and appears much more well built and substantial than similar products I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> It broke ... After one month of hardly use</li>
            <li> This is the best nose trimmer.  It does NOT pull at all.  It is very smooth and quiet.  We really like it, and we highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to purchase this and it arrived today.  It broke during the first use.  Maybe I got a bad one, however, I am returning.</li>
            <li> Good quality over some cheaper models.  Don&#x27;t really need the light but its a nice addition for those that want it.  Very pleased thus far</li>
            <li> Works OK but slow. LED Light is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!  Excellent product!  Works very well on unwanted hair!</li>
            <li> Works great, does not pull and cuts fast. Easy to use and only a single AA battery makes this a simplistic device. A+++++</li>
            <li> Needed to push the switch REALLY hard to turn on.  Went back to Amazon. Wasted my time.</li>
            <li> This product works well enough but it is very loud.  When inserted into the ear canal, the noise is painful.</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality.  Much better than most of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> on/off switch broke after less than 15 uses.</li>
            <li> No more hairy noise and ears. Yippee !</li>
            <li> Works well.  It truly is painless, or at least so far, LOL!  You can press it snugly up against your skin, including inside your nose.  Its best to clean just inside your nose first to make sure it gets the hairs and not... well,... you know!  The light didn&#x27;t do much for me, but it also isn&#x27;t like it adds anything significant to the cost either.  The base you hold is about as big around as a tube of toothpaste, so its easy to hold onto.  The part you put in your nose or ear is pretty small, maybe 1/4 to 1/3 the size of a nostril.  Its easy to insert and remove the single AA battery, and it has plenty of power (not too loud either).  Its easy to remove the tip for cleaning and also has a clear cap to protect it when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons (just barely) are that it seems most effective when using multiple passes over the same area versus pushing it against the skin, but no big deal.  The other is that the tip that&#x27;s in your nose or ear gets kind of warm.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot though, or at least didn&#x27;t during the time I needed to use it.  Its not uncomfortably warm, so I doubt it could get warm enough to actually hurt someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its an outstanding product and at an unbelievably cheap price, so even if it did break on me in the near future I would just buy another one.  I highly recommend it even if you only rarely use it.  If you&#x27;ve ever had a stubborn nose hair itch or tried to pull one, you definitely understand its value cannot be overstated!</li>
            <li> Works very well. I am an old man with hair in my ears and nose that is very annoying. This trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> Well made works exactly as advertised. Now, to find durability. Have had only two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have had a product like this from other makers and they all quit working after a (short) while.  This one appears more sturdy and has performed nicely for 60 days or so.  It does a good job of trimming nose hairs, is easy to clean and, so far, continues to work.</li>
            <li> Works great. The best one I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for an older device that quit working.  It performs as expected and he is happy.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t pull the crap out of your nose. It cleans your nose very nicely.</li>
            <li> Is has a heavy duty feel: it is easy to clean and I like its free standing design.. Would buy another</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. No problems, well designed.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, this trimmer works great and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair it&#x27;s trimming. Definitely the best trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great at keeping my thick mane of nosehair at bay. I have not had a chance to test its waterproof-ness, but it looks to be well sealed. I haven&#x27;t experienced the power switch issues others have complained about, but I would have to say that the power switch does appear to be the weakest point in quality, just judging from the feel. All in all, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Super nose trimmer!  Gets the job done better than any other products tried.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It is almost perfect.  the angled handle is great.  It doesn&#x27;t role off the counter and on the floor. The light is more of a gimick but sometimes it is useful.  I bought this a as gift for my dad after I got one.  So happy camper as now the family has 2 of them.  Dad loves it too.</li>
            <li> Cutting head is somewhat blunt and doesn&#x27;t catch some hair in nose &amp; ear channels.</li>
            <li> This item is excellently built and performs well.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the performance of the Nose Trimmer; it is easy to use and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirley Grimes</li>
            <li> Product is well made and at a reasonable price. Product works well.  LED light is very nice addition.  Would have given it five stars if it had paperwork showing lifetime warranty as stated on the Amazon website.  If it does have a lifetime warranty, there is no instructions on how to get it honored.</li>
            <li> Mine broke in like a week when trying to remove the cap. I think the plastuc that keeps the razor portion on the base is too weak.</li>
            <li> Working well so far...</li>
            <li> This trimmer has plenty of power and does a good job of trimming.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while now. It works great and doesn&#x27;t pull any hair at all. It does get warm while it&#x27;s so I just run cold water on it a few times while I use it.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.  Led light is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> A good product offered at a good price by ToiletTree Products - Thank You! I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other trimmers. Of the few I&#x27;ve tried, this is the only one worth having. I can not attest to all of the qualities/features advertised, but the bottom line is that this trimmer seems very durable and it actually works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use it that often but it has worked fine when I have.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair, cuts cleanly. Has drastically cut down on grooming time and effort!</li>
            <li> Just got it. Not working at all.&lt;br /&gt;Piece of junk!</li>
            <li> Pretty good as far as trimmers go.  The trimming blades are housed in a circular top so there&#x27;s not much exposed to nick or cut.  It even has a little light to shine on where you want to trim, if that&#x27;s important for you.</li>
            <li> Great little machine, glad I made this one my choice.</li>
            <li> Well built, sturdy and doesn&#x27;t bog down.  This unit is very easy to clean and is one of the few that I know of that comes with a cleaning brush (although I must admit that I have not opened the packages of all the others).  We&#x27;ve had two competitor models in house that both died of old age and were not covered by any reasonable warranty.  With a lifetime warranty (which was a BIG selling point for me), I no longer have this concern.  This unit is comfortable to use, well balanced and simply a terrific unit.</li>
            <li> Good size and weight and works very well.</li>
            <li> The switch did not turn on and off unless the silver housing was taken off.  It cuts fine so far...(three weeks) but boy was I upset that it needed to be disassembled in order to work.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  It is easy to use, to clean and outstanding quality.&lt;br /&gt;This product has a lifetime guarantee.  It is designed to be water resistant.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you....Toilet Tree Product.</li>
            <li> Really great product. Sturdy and works well.</li>
            <li> The cutter was very effective. I have only used it once. I have not needed to use it again yet (5 days) because it does such a good job. It seemed to take longer to cut than I expected. I just continued using it as directed until I did not hear any more of the hair cutting noise. I have cleaned with care because  of the small and delicate cutters. I will only change my review if I do not get long service out of it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Work great. Takes care of those unwanted hairs better than any of the cheaper products that &amp;#34;claim&amp;#34; to do a good job, and I have tried a couple of the less expensive products! Stick with this one!</li>
            <li> Bought for DH....he loves it.  Easy to use, clean and the best part--no painful pulling of nose/ear hairs.  Small and great for traveling.  Great item for great price.</li>
            <li> Tried several brand names and this one is clearly tops.</li>
            <li> well-made product that does the job.  Only complaint is the top cover is hard to remove if your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several hair trimmers over the years.  Some have worked better than others.  I&#x27;ve found it difficult to find good trimmers in the stores around me so I went online to see what was available.  I chose this trimmer because of the many high ratings.  I&#x27;ve used this once since it arrived.  I does a very good job an removing nose hairs.  The trimmer has a substantial feel to it.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> This product never worked.  I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it actually trims well - mine never turned on.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Very professional and sturdy and does its job.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> In Jan 2014, I purchased Toilet Tree&#x27;s Professional Water Resistant Heavy Duty Steel Nose Hair Trimmer with LED Light. This is by far the best nose hair trimmer I have ever used!! This thing is bulletproof!! It&#x27;s still going strong!! In July 2014, about six months after I made the purchase, I dropped the blade assembly down the drain of my bathroom sink while cleaning it with the included brush. The folks at Toilet Tree Products sent me a FREE replacement blade assembly AND a FREE replacement blade assembly housing!! Toilet Tree sells high quality products that come with a LIFETIME REPLACEMENT WARRANTY!! In addition, Toilet Tree provides SUPERIOR customer service!! These days, poor build quality and even poorer customer service have become the norm. Thank you Toilet Tree for providing me with a great product and a wonderful customer service experience!!</li>
            <li> Does not work as expected</li>
            <li> Good product that does a nice job. One has to be careful with these things, but a good product nonetheless.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great, I tried other ones and was very dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;I guess you do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of these over the years and this is the best one ever; quality built, ergonomic design and does a nice clean job - as it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> I have used a one with a similar tip for many years but this one seems to cut more hairs in a shorter time.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a nifty little device that I got for my husband to remove his ear hair and nose hair. I didn&#x27;t give it a great review because right out of the box the on-off switch did not work. Its a minor inconvenience that he has to take the battery out to turn it off, but it also shows the quality control on this product is not the greatest. Otherwise though, it works well and is quieter than some others, which is important when trimming so close to the ears.</li>
            <li> got this as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend. he is very happy with it, was very excited to get this. this seems like a really solid little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good quality, comfortable in the hand, a joy to use.  Wonderful metal construction.  My nose hairs have never been more svelte.</li>
            <li> Quality Trimmers... Higher quality that any others trimmer I have seen. They work very well! Better motor and a light make them east to use.</li>
            <li> Oh my. There is a lot of negative talk about nose hair trimmers. I went on Amazon to read the reviews before I purchased one, and I couldn&#x27;t believe it. The reviews are all over the place. There does not seem to be any one trimmer that all agree is good. So I just thought I would give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great. Here are all the disgusting details:  I am a female in my 40&#x27;s, I have some nose hair that grows to a point where it is within view if you are up real close and kind of looking for it. Not obtrusive hair. I am not a beast. What I find as a person with allergies, is that if I trim those hairs just inside the nostril, then buggers don&#x27;t have anything to clump on to. voila. That is it. I am not looking for a baby&#x27;s butt smooth surface inside my nose, like some posters seem to be. I don&#x27;t really examine that space, nor care that much as it is an out-of-view place. But it helps to keep the nostril free of buggers. There, I said it.</li>
            <li> ordered on Monday and received it Friday, So far trimmer working very well. No pulling nose hair like all the rest of what I owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve run through dozens of nose hair clippers through the years and this one really stands out. Solid metal casing, and it just does the job very efficiently and quietly, leaving everything nicely clean and closely cropped. I hope this little machine lasts!</li>
            <li> Update: in Jan 2016, the part with two tiny blades broke during operation. We are requesting another blade part so we can keep using this trimmer. The trimmer is still going strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: In Nov 2014, when we disassembled the parts to clean the blade, we lost the blade part to the drain. ToiletTree&#x27;s great customer service responded to our request of replacement parts and mailed us a set of the cap, blade, silver blade cover, and tapered gray cover for free upon our request. Great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We purchased this in Mar 2014.&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer helps a lot in trimming the curly nose hair of my husband. We used to use a pair of small scissor (without a safe rounded tip.... poor hubby) and the trimming experience was so scary to him. Now with this we have peace in mind and no more &amp;#34;accidental poking and ouchhhhhhhh&amp;#34; drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one looks most durable among other options at amazon. No cheap looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does better job then a pair of rounded tip scissors, I think. Cause you just need to approach the poking out hair with the tip of the trimmer, and try some different angle. In few seconds no matter how curly it is, the blade will find it. From our experience with the scissors.... you have to try more, almost like a explorer, to find exactly the spot to &amp;#34;clip,&amp;#34; in THE DARK (maybe use a flash light?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this ... no more nose hair pocking out.... no more ouchhhhh moment. Neat looking husband!</li>
            <li> This is a great nose hair trimmer.  I like that it is metal and not plastic.  I like that it is wet/dry.  I take it into the shower with me and can cut the nose hairs and rinse them away without having to get hairs all over the sink.</li>
            <li> OUt of the 7 different nose trimmer products I have purchased, this bar none is the best nose and facial hair trimmer!!!!</li>
            <li> Trims nicely without pulling. Cuts close without nicking skin. Hefty feel in your hand and the light is nice. The cutting head does get quite warm after a short time, but rinsing it while running seems to keep it from getting uncomfortable. Time will tell on battery life and getting dull etc.</li>
            <li> Good nose hair trimmers, does a good job but doesn&#x27;t seem to collect the clipped hairs in the removable head which is okay, no real equipment cleaning of the needed.&lt;br /&gt;Just nasal cleaning after using the trimmers.</li>
            <li> My husband is very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a reliable trimmer for a while. I&#x27;ve used several types including scissors but never found anything that worked well.This trimmer is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. price is right, and it came sooner than expected. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been through several nose hair trimmers and this one seems to work so far.  My problem in the past has been that they work initially but then fail over time.  So, I am reserving final judgement until I have used it for a while.</li>
            <li> Good purchase at a good value.  This product works very good. No issues with pulling hairs, it just does it&#x27;s job accurately.  I am not sure if it is a superior design compared to the product I was using that has an attachment clip on head of many for that task or if that head just gave out in terms of sharpness but it was not cutting it. (pardon the pun)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is sharp as &amp;*#^ and gets it done in 15 seconds or so.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a contentious shopper (I try not to buy ANYTHING made from China anytime I can!!! *uck China!) This product was made in the good ole USA!! Not cheap ass plastic (like in CHINA). It consist of metal, stainless steel to be exact, or maybe aluminum, idk. This is a great, quiet, quality piece of craftsmanship-ed piece of equipment. It has a light, and it cuts the hair in you nose clean, so, that when the hair grows back, it doesn&#x27;t cut, or hurt you nostrils (anyone else have that problem?). This is good anyone who cares about their appearance should get this product, because, (1) it works, and (2) its made in America!</li>
            <li> Nice product, seems more durable than the last one I had which stopped working, also does not pull on hairs and cause pain, am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  Doesn&#x27;t work very well as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Also, had a problem (which customer service tells me the company is working on) getting the bottom to close after inserting battery.  It pops the top part up and then the bottom doesn&#x27;t close.  The top cover also does not close securely and falls off.</li>
            <li> I received my nose hair and facial trimmer from ToiletreeProducts a while ago and was extremely pleased at how well it worked. Cleaned those nostrils right out to the point I could actually breath more clearly. Very pleased with thepurchase.</li>
            <li> We have never owned/used a nose trimmer before, but we saw great reviews about this product on Amazon and gave it a try.  The trimmer arrived on time and so far has worked flawlessly.  I&#x27;d reoommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The trimmer arrived earlier than expected. Used it twice and it does the job. Has a good solid feel to it which makes me believe it should last.</li>
            <li> Excellent  I got it for Christmas it feels very nice and the light is very good to</li>
            <li> comfortable to use and works better than any other product of its type we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Husband very happy with this Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Came when promised.&lt;br /&gt; Has a metal casing, is powerful and cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li> Bought in May, 2014 and was working fine until one of the blades came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In trying to contact the company, you can&#x27;t get to anyone.  The phone answering system only talks about special offers and seems to be more of a marketing pitch.  Gave up after 3 tries to find a way through their phone maze and to a real person.</li>
            <li> The product did fail again, but I&#x27;m so impressed with the service of the company, that I feel I got my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d certainly consider buying from them again.  You don&#x27;t keep in business with this type of service if you&#x27;re selling poor quality.  I believe this is a coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have to hand it to Toilet Tree Products:  The President of the company noticed my poor review and responded with a message, and, unprompted, sent a replacement, explaining that the warranty was through the seller, not the Mfg.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this after a few months, but color me satisfied with the outstanding customer service!  Anyone willing to go through these lengths to make a customer satisfied deserves a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********************************&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item about six months ago, it worked alright for a few months, but the blades became dull and shortly the blade and the guard started grinding against eachother and the whole mechanism locked up.&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT backed up by the life time guarantee as is claimed.  This cannot be returned/replaced after only a month.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer be ware!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t strong  enough power to do the job.</li>
            <li> Trimmer wouldn&#x27;t work - sent it back for full refund.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me this exactly watt I was expected.</li>
            <li> Works very well for special grooming needs.  I recommend this item for all men,</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought. I&#x27;ve had all the major name brands &amp; this is the only one&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Women, read this!  I bought this as a nose hair trimmer but I found it&#x27;s also good for trimming my mustache and long hairs around my mouth and chin.  I tweeze the darker/thicker hairs which grow around that area, but I also have in the same area, fine soft blond hair which grows very long which I used to snip with scissors.  Now I just run my trimmer over any area I want to shorten and it works fantastically!  I&#x27;ve never liked the look when I&#x27;ve seen other women shave or wax or otherwise completely remove hair from the upper lip, it looks waxy or strange.  This thing trims to just the right length.  Try it!  I&#x27;m so glad I found this other use for a very good nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer that I have ever owned and it will probably be the last one I will ever have to buy because of the excellent quality of this trimmer. It does an amazing job without any  painful hair pulling that cheaply made trimmers do. I&#x27;m glad I bought it and you will probably like it too!</li>
            <li> Finally, one that works. I had the original Sharper Image for a Looooong time. Still worked but yanked and pulled. I purchased 2 others from the big names. Worthless. This is the best and smoothest I have ever used. Everything as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great quality product, which is rare on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I should have bought one of these 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> It works!  I no longer look like a Walrus!</li>
            <li> It is not a Bad product but I had a difficult time getting it to work.  I tried several batteries with no success.  The light would come on but no trimmer.  Finally I gave it a &amp;#34;Good Smack&amp;#34; and it started working.  This is something I need to do almost every time.  Once it is working it does a Wonderful job.  I was thinking about returning it but since it does such a good once it is running I can put up with the occasional hitting it to get it to start I take back what I said Above Unbelievable   It Broke.  I have tried everything to make it work.  Finally I tossed it.    I would NEVER buy this product again</li>
            <li> Works well.  Runs on a single AA battery. I would recommend it to a hairy friend.</li>
            <li> LOVE this thing!!!  Works MUCH better than my previous one and I LOVE the cleaning method - thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> I’ve had a hard time finding a decent nose hair trimmer. I tried a manual one (didn’t work, only caused pain), an electric one by Panasonic (inconsistent speed) and another cheap one (quickly quit working). This trimmer is the best one so far. I appreciate the all metal construction and it certainly appears to be better made than most other trimmers. It also has a lifetime guarantee which is comforting. It has consistent trimming speed but the cutting power and closeness could be better. Also, the light is unnecessary and actually somewhat distracting. My search for the best nose hair trimmer isn’t over but so far this one is easily the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this trimmer a 1 star rating and a scathing review since it had failed on reliability after ~ 8 months.  However this unit does indeed have a lifetime guarantee as stated on it&#x27;s product page.  Seeing my review on Amazon, Steve Parisi the President of ToiletTree, sent me a new nose trimmer at no cost to me.  I am very happy and this trimmer as I was with the first one and without a doubt it is the best nose trimmer I have ever owned.  Although I did has some issues my initial unit, the performance of this unit is so outstanding along with excelent Customer service I feel compelled to restore this review to a full 5 stars.  Thanks ToiletTree!</li>
            <li> Does the job, well made. May buy another one for second home.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised. Well worth my money. I&#x27;m always surprised by how powerful it feels/sounds, and not once have I had an unpleasant tug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this nose trimmer and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a real good trimmer. I can&#x27;t say much about the led light but it trims very well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Outstanding price and superior operation.</li>
            <li> The best trimmer I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I have bought 6 of these great trimmers for my family. I am buying more of them this week. The trimmers do not hurt at all when removing nose hairs. My plucking days are over , yeah. One AA in bottom of trimmer and your good to go.Sunlight really shows the hair you don&#x27;t see in the house, so I keep one in the car. Best buy I made all year. No germ spreading when everyone has their own trimmer. Thanks, Paula</li>
            <li> Very happy with this trimmer, description of product is accurate 😊</li>
            <li> My husband said it is really excellent!</li>
            <li> Stronger motor then the others I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  LED light is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Well, in theory I love it-but it isn&#x27;t for me-my husband actually told me he needed a new nose hair trimmer. so I found this one and it had the best rating. Came fast. Looks very sleek.</li>
            <li> So far, love it.  It&#x27;s perfecdt!</li>
            <li> I had a great Panasonic trimmer years ago that finally wore out; it never pulled a hair. I replaced it with another Panasonic, which also never pulled a hair, but it wore out much much faster. So this time, I researched the reviews and opted for the ToiletTree trimmer. First thing I noticed was a couple pulled hairs; just a couple, and scary at first because I had to wonder if it was going to keep doing that until it brought tears to my eyes, but it didn&#x27;t, and so turned out to be not bad. If this lasts for years, and if a couple of pulled hairs does not increase to a lot, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sturdy powerful trimmer that could handle the rigors of traveling for work. This is the right beast for the job! It feels solid in your hand, the light is bright, and the cut is superb. The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t have an eyebrow attachment, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve such products over the years and they were ALL so so.  But when I tried this one I knew as the wine taster said when he found the perfect one &amp;#34;EST! EST! EST!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Cheap construction. Cap difficult to screw on.</li>
            <li> We have gone through many nose trimmers over the years.  They did not work well at all, didn&#x27;t cut well, pulled and tugged, didn&#x27;t last.  Thought we&#x27;d try one more.  This one is the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; we have ever had.  Cuts beautifully in one sweep, no tugging at all, made really well, no plastic, and we should have it for years.  Great for either men or women!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other nose/ear hair trimmers before.  Some just drove me crazy with the noise in my ear, others just pulled and tugged the wrong way.  This one does a nice job, but solely for the nose and ear regions.  I don&#x27;t like using it to trim my stache.  It isn&#x27;t comfortable in that department.  But it&#x27;s flawless in the ears and nose.</li>
            <li> My husband is very satisfied with this product.  Well built.  Easy to use.  Quiet.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the fantastic reviews on Amazon and in particular the evidence of ToiletTree&#x27;s commitment to quality customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After further investigation, I have some reason to doubt the legitimacy of some of these reviews and believe that the company may be falsifying information to improve their image. However, the doubt is just doubt and I have no air-tight proof behind this claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most important, the product has worked great so far. It is quiet and painless and the trimmer took care of some unsightly hairs that have been plaguing me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did not like: the trimmer came in unsealed packaging, which made me wonder if it had been used. I thoroughly cleaned the unit before use but am still a little creeped out at the possibility that someone else had my trimmer up their nose.</li>
            <li> The delivery to our home was speedy. After trying several other brands previously, this one so far has exceeded our expectations.</li>
            <li> Great product. The light is a wonderful feature.</li>
            <li> Finally, a reasonably priced good trimmer. I&#x27;ve had a couple of trimmers the last few years, but not one that would last. This trimmer is all it advertises.</li>
            <li> It works well, the problem is that it cannot be used for eyebrows, sideburns or other facial hair.  Its design is only for ear and nose.  No problem with the switch but I do not use it that much.  Either I did not read the product description closely enough or it did not specify that it was only for ears and nose.</li>
            <li> Pulled nose hair a little bit but not horribly bad but other than that it worked great.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> one of the better products in this category, previous comments helped me choose this and am not disappointed at all</li>
            <li> This is one great trimmer. My last one (died on me, don&#x27;t even remember brand) was just fair but I just love this.&lt;br /&gt;Light makes things so much easier and zip, zoom and you are done.</li>
            <li> Took it out of the package and took off the battery cap and it wouldn&#x27;t go back on. Had to get a refund. Very disappointed after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Got here on time, works.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but so far I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks and see nothing that turn&#x27;s on any LED lights.</li>
            <li> just recieved the unit, inserted the battery and the unit came on and will not go off.  Works good but will not turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Just received an email from the mfgr and they are sending me another one.  Very prompt response!  Already can see it will be better than any trimmer I have had before.</li>
            <li> The product works well and seems to do the job just right. The light is useful as well and allows you to see fine hairs. It&#x27;s very easy to clean. I got no complaints. Why only 4 stars? Well it&#x27;s a hair trimmer for the ears and nose right. I can&#x27;t get to overly excited about having a lot of ear and nose hair to be trimmed. LOL</li>
            <li> As indicated by other reviewers, this product is as advertised and is superior to other nose trimmers I have owned in the past.  It is quality workmanship at a reasonable price.  I am more than satisfied with the purchase and will likely shop this brand again.</li>
            <li> Excellent performance and build quality, much better than the plastic big name brand I&#x27;m replacing.</li>
            <li> Nice unit, smooth running, I am all about quality as expected. This replaced a Braun unit that was junk. I hope it holds up.</li>
            <li> The product is great at everything except what it&#x27;s supposed to do, cut hair close.  The construction is solid, the light is nice, the blades work and cut hair, but it doesn&#x27;t cut close.  The reason you buy the device is to shave/cut the hair so it&#x27;s not noticeable, and this product doesn&#x27;t do that... I feel that if I have to grab my cuticle scissors afterwards and re-cut the hair so it&#x27;s short and not noticeable, then the product isn&#x27;t working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am 77, long past the age where hair starts growing from your ears and nose. I use to use a small scissors to cut them out when they got thick and long. This was tedious, awkward and sometimes I cut myself. This trimmer does the job lickity split in no time at all and without any danger of getting cut.</li>
            <li> Very good- love the led light.</li>
            <li> Dependable, sleek, and efficient.</li>
            <li> After reading all the glowing reviews I was really looking forward to something above average.  Sadly that was not the case.  The battery compartment cover is a really cheap, chinsy BAD design.  It broke removing it to put the battery in.  Seems I am not the only one to have problems with the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the unit looked and felt solid,  It looks like the battery cover was an afterthought.  Really poor design and material choice on that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have the return label printed from Amazon.  I thought about buying a new one, figuring I just got a lemon. But that crappy design on the battery cover has this problem built right in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cover should thread on, not that bayonet design.  On top of that the lugs are way too small for the soft flexible plastic the manufacturer decided to use if they are going to go with the bayonet design.</li>
            <li> Being a married mom of 3 sons and 2 daughters, I was looking for a facial hair trimmer that we all could benefit from. I had one of those small &amp;#34;As seen on tv&amp;#34; gadgets (facial hair trimmer) that worked great for us girls. It was actually designed to be used by women, for getting rid of those peach-fuzz patches (like around the cheekbone areas), unsightly chin hairs, and &#x27;female mustaches&#x27; (many dark- AND light- complected females deal with this) -- the design featured a comb-like trimmer; which, when using, you&#x27;d just &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; down an area to get rid of the facial hair. It also worked nicely as a nose- and ear-hair trimmer, for the guys. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t take no time for that small gadget to fall apart (it was cheaply made). Needless to say, I went searching for a different trimmer and happened upon this one, the &amp;#34;Professional Water Resistant Heavy Duty Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer&amp;#34; by ToiletTree Products. We&#x27;ve never used a trimmer like this type before, and since it said &amp;#34;and Facial Trimmer&amp;#34;, I thought I would give it a try. The price was quite attractive, and after reading the positive reviews relating to it&#x27;s durability, I figured this would be a great grooming tool for the entire family (except our youngest, she&#x27;s only 12, and has no use for it - as of yet). It&#x27;s a perfect trimmer for trimming nose hairs and ear hairs (the guys seem to really like it), as well as trimming an unsightly chin hair (or more, if you have them). As for trimming that &#x27;female&#x27; cheeky peach fuzz, it&#x27;s not quite as EASILY effective - hence the *4-star* rating. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an even possible modification for this tool, but if there were a micro-comb attachment that could be used, to get rid of cheeky peach fuzz, this tool would be perfect! It&#x27;s very sturdy and well-made - it&#x27;s holding up nicely to my 2 teen sons&#x27; and husband&#x27;s use, thus far (and they&#x27;re not exactly &#x27;gentle&#x27; with how they use things lol).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  Followed directions, used a fresh battery, but motor doesn&#x27;t work.  Customer service number printed on package is invalid.  Had to look up customer service number-left a message with no return call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shoddy product and shoddy customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: so as you&#x27;ll see in the comments, the company was nice enough to contact me and offer to ship me a new unit.  It arrived today.  Used it once-within 20 seconds heard a rattling noise.  Opened the lid-the blade had broken and fallen off.&lt;br /&gt;So, ANOTHER defective unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seem like nice guys, but they should find another company to build these for them.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if this thing has a metal body so do I!!!!!!!!  I bought this item thinking it was going to be far superior to and more heavy duty than other trimmers I have owned and still own but this thing is nothing special and the metal body?????  Seems like a cheap piece of plastic to me.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does what the other reviews state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have very slight pulls, they were not nearly as bad as my previous trimmer (which did so much pulling that I was left in tears after two seconds of use, at which point I had to quit). This trimmer allowed me to have a hairless nose without even a single tug strong enough to make me tear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a purchase if you have a sensitive nose, as I do.</li>
            <li> So far this trimmer has been doing exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do without any trouble.  It trims my nose hairs without getting stuck and is easy to clean.  It uses one AA battery which is easy to gain access to.  The slider switch is easy to operate and you can feel a notch when you slide it on and off.  The clear cap protects the blade from collecting dust, which is actually pretty smart yet simple.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so time will tell if this device will last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only little caveat I have is the LED.  I don&#x27;t use it, and I don&#x27;t like the somewhat bright LED in my eye.  I just cover it with a finger while holding it and all is good...or I try not to stare at it while it&#x27;s shining in my eye, lol.</li>
            <li> I have bought several trimmers for my husband.  They just don&#x27;t last.  They&#x27;re flimsy, made of plastic and fall apart.  But this trimmer is well-made and solid.  The blades cut the hair well but do not nick his skin.  We have only had it a little while but it should last.</li>
            <li> It showed up on time but it looks more cheaply made than I thought it would and it doesn&#x27;t turn off....you must take the battery out for it to shut off....other than that it works</li>
            <li> The product itself is very impressive, as others have stated it feels like a quality product in your hand and it trims quickly and cleanly without pulling or yanking any hairs. But perhaps best of all those few who have reported encountering any issues with the product have received immediate attention and resolution to their issue. It is a great relief to know there still are companies like this one that put out quality products and stand behind them.</li>
            <li> I tried my new trimmer and I found it exceeding my hopes and expectations.  It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything worked perfectly on the trimmer. With a lifetime Guarantee I got a great trimmer with no concerns for possible future problems.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing in your hand, like a real man&#x27;s nose hair trimmer should. I&#x27;ve used this twice and to say that it clears the nasal passage of forests and underbrush is an understatement. I love the fact that it&#x27;s battery powered. I haven&#x27;t found much use for the LED light other than to use it to look up my nostrils to admire the fine workmanship it provides. Well worth the money spent. Best damn nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I look forward to using this well into my golden years!</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have purchased so far, but none of them seem to be powerfull enough for me. I am hopeful the small electric motor will last a few years. It is a quality product  but would be even better with a bigger, more powerful electric motor.</li>
            <li> It could be a lot stronger.  It does the job but not easily!  Have to do it several times to be satisfied</li>
            <li> I was looking for a trimmer that would last. I think I found it. Seven months after purchase, I had to replace the battery, but the trimmer is working just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that with a simple twist I can remove the top portion, run water through it, rinse it with soap and water, and put it back. It seems more hygienic than the other trimmers I have had that did not let you remove the actual trimmer to clean it throughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a solidly build product. I can&#x27;t think of anything that I do not like about it.</li>
            <li> was non-operational upon delivery.  item returned</li>
            <li> one of these trimmers will not turn off when battery is connected.  when off it still runs.  I have to disconnect battery when not in use&lt;br /&gt;also there is  black oil oozing out of the head when using and gets on hands and face.  what do you suggest???</li>
            <li> My nose hairs were like small tree trunks. I was tired of ripping them out with my Gerber Multitool. This guy grinds em down like a tiny little weed whacker. So far, so good. Keeps the nasal passages free from pesky hairs and keeps the ladies happy.</li>
            <li> I have used a similar device in the past, and this one is much quieter, yet works very well. The light is also a nice feature.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement and this is a much better product.The material appears to be very good and very solid.Would recommend this without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Great Product, great price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and the LED light is brilliantly fantastic. I highly recommend this item, it cuts/trims the hair just as I like and the trimmer is very easy to use. I have had no problem with the battery or anything else that others might have mentioned, I can only speak to my own experience. We are probably going to purchase another one of these items as our former trimmers of other brands always break down.</li>
            <li> Quality not quite there but it is reflective of the price.  The warranty makes the purchase worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. He loves it because of the led light and because it has steel blades. He said it&#x27;s the best nose hair trimmer he&#x27;s used in a long time. It&#x27;s great because it is backed by a lifetime replacement warranty and the price was decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products but this one REALLY works.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;More products with this great quality and value....please!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Has yet to pull a hair out or knick my skin!  It works great, even started using it on my ears - oh, the joys of getting older.  But seriously, I&#x27;m not a fan of the single LED or its aim.  The clippers require an awkward angle to shine on what you&#x27;re aiming for.  I&#x27;d like to see a ring-type LED 360º around or 3+ smaller LEDs consistently spaced versus one, non-helpful LED.  I wouldn&#x27;t complain if it were rechargable either.  Overall though, it gets the job done and does a great job doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  my only other experience is with the small, manual, twist-type trimmer (that supposedly has great reviews) and I was not a fan at all.  So, this review is not from someone who has tried a lot of other brands and styles...though I heard plenty about trimmers pulling out nose hairs, hence my intro to this review.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is maybe my sixth or seventh one.  It is, by far the absolute winner!  The trim head is very gentle but accurate.  The lighted head is great for better view.  The price is also competitive, considering the quality.  Nice product - thanks.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Better than anything I have tried in the past. I e-mailed them about their warranty and here&#x27;s what they said:  &amp;#34;Thanks for contacting us! We always stand 100% behind all of our products. If for some reason, this unit stops working, just contact us and we will have a new unit shipped out at no charge. Please let me know if you need anything else!&amp;#34;  Sounds like a heck of a deal to me, especially since other trimmers I purchased in the past stopped working a few months in.</li>
            <li> So far so good. These things usually don&#x27;t stand the test of time though. But it is supposed to have a lifetime guarantee.</li>
            <li> Good product. No complaints. Great service from Tiolet Tree.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bind. Works great</li>
            <li> Excellent Item and Fast Shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works great and is painless</li>
            <li> JUST RECIEVED PRODUCT AND SO FAR SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for two weeks and have used it several times. It is much more powerful than the cheap $9 versions sold at the grocery store. It is sturdy and does what it is suppose to. Well worth the extra bucks and I assume will be much cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> Works great for my nose hair cutting !!!</li>
            <li> This little tool works great.  As we seniors grow older we have lots of hair growing from our ears.  Trimming with sissors is difficult. This trimmer does a great job and I can do it myself.  Nose hair is taken care of quickly and effeciantly.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer feels like a quality product.  It passes my test!</li>
            <li> This works great - my husband needed it!!!</li>
            <li> Having used similar for many years I am delighted with the features of this clipper. Best yet! Many thanks for a great problem solver.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Does not pull nose hairs at all!</li>
            <li> It works well, better than my last one.  It was delivered ahead of schedule. I would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to trim that (gulp) unsightly nose and ear hair that we get as we age. I had a Whal model that worked wonderfully but doesn&#x27;t operate very well anymore (years of use) and after several battery changes purchased this. Well, it runs about like the Whal model now and cuts about the same.</li>
            <li> Use it once a week good product</li>
            <li> Nice replacement from my ood unit.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby to keep a nice trim nose without the risk of pulling. He said this little guy does the trick nicely.</li>
            <li> Amazing trimmer...you hear it cutting, you see less and less (nose or ear) hair as you use it, but you do not feel a thing...</li>
            <li> Amazing item, great service from ToiletTree Products. I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Fantastic nose hair trimmer. Quiet. Precise. Can&#x27;t ask for much else!</li>
            <li> My son Was pleased with this gift!!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great trimmer. It has a nice heft and the texture and feel when holding in your hand is nice.  It has a nice grip to it.&lt;br /&gt;It runs smooth and cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to be a bit careful when cleaning.  The parts in side the cutting head are delicate and you can really mess them up if have a heavy touch.</li>
            <li> First off this thing is bigger than I expected, a bit unwieldy.  But fortunately I have big hands.  I started using it and quickly noticed a brown goo building up in my nose.  I was thinking what is bile doing leaking from my nose?  Then the smell hit me and I realized this is just grease.  It wasn&#x27;t really doing a great job on the hairs so I pressed a bit harder and it took off a chunk of skin and drew blood.  Ouch, very painful.  I give up I&#x27;m going back to scissors and tweezers.</li>
            <li> Sturdy design, have used multiple times with no issues</li>
            <li> Works well, but do NOT leave the battery inside, it will drain.</li>
            <li> It was defective. Switch Was broken. I returned it and will be buying from a different company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few trimmers in the past and I must say this is the highest quality trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but it worked great.  Time will tell but I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li> reas comments related to the product not working properly.  I received mine (I accidentally ordered two)... But the device does not turn off.  When I turn the switch to the off position it will turn off for just a second and the it comes right back on.  I was forced to take the battery out to keep it off.  I didn&#x27;t check the other one, as I want to be able to return it for a refund.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my order. The shipping was extremely quick and the company&#x27;s support during the process has been phenomenal. The trimmer itself is powerful, yet simple. The instructions are clear and the trimmer is easy to take apart and clean. ToiletTree seems like a terrific company determined to make a buyer&#x27;s experience a positive one.</li>
            <li> My trimmer worked so well people say I&#x27;m stuck up because now I walk around with my nose in the air, without a care or hair in the world.</li>
            <li> Gift. They really love it. The light makes a difference and the quality is excellent. Smooth operation and feels nice in hand. I can see many years use from it.</li>
            <li> We had an issue with the first trimmer, but was promptly promised a replacement by ToileTree Products. Their customer service is as outstanding as Amazon&#x27;s (that&#x27;s saying a lot if you&#x27;re familiar with Amazon). I&#x27;m not sure if ToilTree Products offers other products, but I&#x27;ll certainly take a look and would recommend doing business with them for anything they offer. Up to the point the original trimmer worked, it was great. It could have been compromised during manufacturing, who knows. If for some reason, this replacement doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll post here. However, I can&#x27;t imagine ToileTree so willingly offering a replacement if they didn&#x27;t have confidence in their product. It&#x27;s nice to see a company truly standing behind a \\&quot;Lifetime Guarantee\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William H</li>
            <li> So far it seems like a great product.  I&#x27;ve used several and they never seem to perform well, but so far this one seems excellent.  No pulling or fighting to get an errant hair, this one just cuts what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Seems so simple, but so hard to find.  Also feels like it&#x27;s constructed well.  I&#x27;ll report back if I have any problems, but I&#x27;m hopeful that this will be a keeper for a good long time.</li>
            <li> Works excellently and painlessly.  Great customer service from Toilet Tree Products as well.  No regrets.</li>
            <li> Works better than described!</li>
            <li> Best of the three that I have used so far.  It cuts clean and doesn&#x27;t pinch.  I&#x27;d say try it-You&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Solid little trimmer, doesn&#x27;t pull like others!  Update (6 months).. the trimmer slowed down a little bit, I found that I had not been cleaning it well enough.  I pulled the blade out and used a q-tip to clean out inside then oiled the blade with some of the oil for my hair clippers and it is back to new!</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to. No issue with water. Cleans up reasonably well.  Light works but it seems pretty useless / ineffective (for me at least)</li>
            <li> This trimmer stopped working less than three months after purchase and light use (once a week). I tried replacing the battery but this was not the problem. I purchased this more expensive trimmer because i thought it would last. the build quality seemed good - it was heavier than cheap trimmers.</li>
            <li> Definite upgrade from previous Panasonic I had although it looks almost identical when you break open the cutting head end. Seems to cut more efficiently and painlessly and the light is a definite advantage for seeing nasal hairs but I haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to use it on my earlobe.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I had to throw away a &amp;#34;Panasonic&amp;#34; one that was really bad ! I used it twice and it looks like it does a decent job . I hope it lasts unlike the &amp;#34;Panasonic&amp;#34; that I had to throw away after few uses.</li>
            <li> Product performed as expected. It has a sleek design and it is quiet. Construction appears to be quality. The end.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my boyfriend and he loves it.  The best part is that I love the look.  Only used it once  so I  can&#x27;t comment on the durability of the product.</li>
            <li> A nose trimmer that does what it says and does it job. I like the light if you need to trim in the dark or I guess if you have really deep nasal cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Built very well, sturdy and well weighted in hand. Cleaning is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this trimmer and performs very well. The best trimmer I&#x27;ve come across and would recommend highly. I feel also good qualtiy for the price.</li>
            <li> The business end looks like other nose trimmers however it works so much better than others I&#x27;ve used. Trimming is very fast and thorough. Easy to clean under a faucet. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Have used a few other brands before, but this is the best.</li>
            <li> Great device&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this easy-to-use, effective machine. I like the fact that it is battery powered and it small size means that I can take it with me when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;My interaction with the seller has been excellent.</li>
            <li> This product seems heavy duty and well constructed. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times since purchasing it. So far, I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> The unit worked but the off switch did not...could not turn unit off. I am forced to choose a Star but that does not mean I recommend the item!</li>
            <li> The best nose hair trimmer I have ever used and I have owned a few.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Product is true to its description.  Arrived in good condtion and there have been no issues.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Does not do a close cut, but that is expected on something that will not yank hairs out by the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the problem that all the hair on my head seems to have decided to grow out of my ears and nose (and back) rather than my skull... This means I have those wicked daddy long legs creeping out that need to be cut down.  Trying to hit on the ladies whilst having danglies coming out of the ears and nose, just aint Kosher in this player&#x27;s mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after much searching I settled on the heavy duty steel nose trimmer...  Overall not bad.  Heavy, solid build, cuts well.. not close, but well with zero pulling.  this just means I need to trim a bit more often.  NO big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose my only complaint is the LED is not very bright to illuminate the cutting area.  Also the size and shape is a bit strange.  It is big in the hand and a little tougher to maneuver around.  Perhaps, it has a larger motor with all that size.  It&#x27;s not very elegant looking, but that is only a personal preference.  This is Function over form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how it does a few months down the line.  I want something that will last.  Hopefully this will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;dinged 1/2 star for not so bright LED, and weird shape.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Product works great!  I would buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Very high quality &amp; gets the job done without any pain!</li>
            <li> This item did not work at all and had to be returned.</li>
            <li> The delivery was on time (or before scheduled!). And the tool is as I was looking for (and as it looks like): a pro instrument, solid, strong, elegant. The LED is handy. And it  realy trims hair in your nostrils and ears.YES I will recommend it to other buyers</li>
            <li> Easy to use and store. Simple to replace battery and the blades are effective at removing unwanted hair without removing wanted flesh. Reasonably priced and effective.</li>
            <li> A decent product after a month of use. Handles nose and ears well and the led light is useful.  The noise level is reasonable.  Glad I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> For a relatively low cost trimmer, this product does just fine. If I had to improve it further, I would have it come standard with a rechargeable battery and I would give the cap some texture. It is hard to remove the cap with wet hands, which I would think to be typical when you are grooming and preparing for work. Other than that I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> works great! the light is very helpfull.</li>
            <li> Solid trimmer, definitely worth the price that it comes for</li>
            <li> I was not going to review this product, but since the vendor actually had the gall to request a review, I couldn&#x27;t resist. In a word &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34;. It is vey under powered and the light might as well not be there at all for all the good it does. However I have to admit, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for 17 bucks, but the light feature intrigued me. My fault I&#x27;ll eat this one. Don&#x27;t buy this it is a piece of junk. I don&#x27;t want any refund or anything like that, I will suffer my own stupidity for buying it in the first place. Ta Ta. Amazon should be a little more careful with the products that are sold on their website.</li>
            <li> .... when it comes to noses, that is. My darling husband has been sprouting wirey hairs from within his nose but he&#x27;s too far sighted to see them. I searched Amazon for a trimmer with good reviews and settled on this one. It really does the job! His nose is clean as a whistle, thanks to the ToiletTree trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works very well and lasts much longer than the major brand models. after a few months woh this, it is still going strong, the light is useless but it does what it is supposed to and is very durable.</li>
            <li> Solid and very smooth cutting blade. Good price, too.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased this item from Toilettee, I did do my research and while I compared prices, reviews and overall customer satisfaction I decided to go with this product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the item arrived it was very easy to open and insert the 1 (AA) battery it needs, my item worked flawless and performed amazing once slid the power button up and the LED turned on, I was saving some work for it (to test it out) and I am delighted to tell you that this little thing performed great!, no hair pulling, no failures of any sort, just worked, like the way it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did contact their customer support for a question not related to the performance of the item since I rely on my own self experience for that, needless to say though, their Customer support were absolutely courteous, kind and this is what I praise about companies like Toilettree, to please have good customer support to back their products and Toiletree didn&#x27;t disappoint me there one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received personal commucation from Kelly Parisi and I will definitely recommend this products to my friends and family, You definitely earned a return customer here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and I hope this honest review helps others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor JT.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for an even greater price. My husbands tried several different brands and none of them were cheap. This is by far the best trimmer he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> Great item. It is exactly how it looks in the picture. Very happy with the product. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as advertised. I love the product. Works great. Rotating head gets a bit warm after awhile, but not enough to cause any discomfort or alarm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used in once but that experience went perfectly. No pain, simple...  I had never used one of these type of products before and found the overall design to be pleasant and the functionality was perfect.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Poor design, plastic hooks to hold battery in place did not catch right out of box.  After two attempts, the plastic was stripped and rendered the unit inoperable.  Returned the same day it arrived.  .</li>
            <li> Great working machine out of the box. Hoping it lasts the test of time. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few use and it didn&#x27;t do a great job anyway.  Guess I&#x27;ll stay with the nose trimmers that cost less and do a better job.</li>
            <li> Battery cover was real hard to put on the first time but this unit does a fine job seems real professional</li>
            <li> Compact but powerful and easy to use.  Light is a nice added features. Like the shape since it does not roll when you lay it down.  Other trimmers have rolled onto the floor and broken - so nice design touch.</li>
            <li> best of the kind which I have tried</li>
            <li> This was what my husband needed to get rid of some wayward hairs.</li>
            <li> If I saved all the money I spent on nose trimmers I would be a millionaire by now. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve been blessed with nasal hair that has the strength of carbon fiber ... no match any of the devices I used in the past. The ToiletTree product has exceeded my expectations. Very powerful, no hair pulls ... the light is an unexpected bonus. Highly recommended ... would give this device 6 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Works great. The little light seems to be a gimmick more than anything. I don&#x27;t see how it much helps. But that does not matter. The trimmer does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it does it very well.  And it&#x27;s a cinch to clean. The head looks almost identical to a Panasonic trimmer I bought many years ago. I almost bought another Panasonic, a newer version, instead of this one, but reviews of the newer version of the Panasonic were iffy. People said it was not as good as the older version. So I came here instead, and bought this, and I&#x27;m glad I did. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Getting old sucks, I have hair growing wild in my ears, my nose... This trimmer helps to keep the ugliness down. Simple to use simple to clean and good battery life.</li>
            <li> Only had it a month, but, so far so good. Works as it claims and does not feel like water boarding when you use it.</li>
            <li> I just got it today. It feels cheap. The &amp;#34;steel&amp;#34; on it feels like plastic. However, its functionality and lifetime warranty make up for it.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer started to work erratically with slower speeds which did not cut as well.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a replacement and am very satisfied.  It works well and very quickly..</li>
            <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer I have ever used.  Results last for weeks!  I would highly recommend it everybody.</li>
            <li> This is a Great product with great value.&lt;br /&gt;It is well made and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Works fabulously.  It&#x27;s a little loud in the ear, but the quality of the cut is great!  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This item did the job with no pulling. It fast and easy to clean. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for nose and ears, I have tried a couple before but was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;bt bot nose hair trimmers b4, but this one is agreat.  Nohing worse whan an old guy with hair growing out his nose.  Gr8 servicce, gr8 gproduct, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Well Made - Solid Feel</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very smooth and works well dry or wet with shave cream.  I like the fact that the switch wont accidentally go on when packed away in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> The item was received quickly and appears at first use to be just what I hoped for.  I&#x27;ve had these devices from other makers in the past and have found them very short-lived.  Hoping this one is as good as it&#x27;s started out.</li>
            <li> Was just what was needed!&lt;br /&gt;Completely Satisfied!</li>
            <li> first personal groomer that I like and works well</li>
            <li> wait.  wait up.  there&#x27;s a light that shines into my nose while i weedwhack those gnarly spider leg looking hairs.  HOW AWESOME IS THIS THING??!?!?!?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so far it feels sturdier than the name brand nose hair trimmers i&#x27;ve had in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, my nose hairs are now nice and short and i can do this during a power outage now thanks to the built in light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10, would trim again.</li>
            <li> At first blush, this is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it twice. Great trim. No pulling or pain.  I almost didn&#x27;t buy this product because the blade appears to be the same as another that was not satisfactory. This one is great.  The best feature might be that the blade parts disassemble for easy cleaning, drying and re-assembly.</li>
            <li> Received within 4 days and works great. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Having tried another trimmer which was about the same price but failed after the first use, my husband was skeptical about this one.&lt;br /&gt;However, he has been very pleasantly surprised with the ease of use and cleaning of it...and most importantly, the reliability of it.  The lifetime guarantee is also something that is not found very often on moderately priced grooming tools.</li>
            <li> It has met my expectations!  Works well with no issues!  I strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> I got sick of tweezing my nose hairs and thought I&#x27;d try something a little more humane. Well this didn&#x27;t work so well for me. I still have to tweeze here and there and ended up just going back to tweezing all together. I&#x27;d pass on this personally.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used! Don&#x27;t waste your time trying another brand.</li>
            <li> Great design which will last me a life time. Very easy use for unwanted hair, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer built with metal case and not cheap plastic - trims hair cleanly and easily. Best I&#x27;ve ever owned. Don&#x27;t hesitate to get one of your own!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with other trimmers (specifically Remington) that simply died and replacing the battery did not work. This trimmer is sturdy, well made, and does an incredible job at a task not many want to talk about. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  The best trimmer I have used.  Fast, painless, and powerful.</li>
            <li> Best nose clipper in the game. I mean absolutely kills it. Water proof and durable, it&#x27;s better all the others that my nose hairs wore out.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 &amp;#34;Professional Water Resistant Heavy Duty Steel Nose Trimmer with LED light&amp;#34;.  One for my son at college and one for my husband.  It is a great product and my son has called to say thank me for the purchase, because he had been requesting a nose trimmer.  My husband definitely needs a nose and ear trimmer.  He has not had the chance to use his yet, but I&#x27;m sure that this will do the trick.  I love that it comes with the LED light on the tip.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer.. no pulling.. quick and easy and fits well in the hand. Great product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I received my trimmer today. I don&#x27;t usually review something so this is my impressions on the unit. Pulling the unit out the box it seemed to be very solid in my hand and well built. I grabbed a AA battery and put it in and the battery cover maybe because it is so new i had a some trouble getting the cover back on the unit, took me a few minutes. I ended up removing the battery and twisting the cover on it a few times to break it in, i but the battery in and this time the cover went on fine. I was in business it turned on right away, which is a good thing but it was in the off position. I read some of the reviews from others and they had this problem. Well after toying with it some to see what was up with this thing and hoping mine wasn&#x27;t defected it eventually fixed itself. When turned off it seemed like it was really trying to turn off make a slower deeper noise. I ended up taking out the battery and just turning the switch on and off for a minute, then i put the battery back in and still it was running while it was off, but this time even slower so slow that the light wasn&#x27;t even powering on. I then banged on the battery case with the palm of my hand and some kind of magic then happened and it shut off. It is now working like it should, i&#x27;m not sure what was up with it but seems to be working just fine. I gave it its first test on my nose. The thing works very well i&#x27;m very happy with it and would recommended it to anyone. I&#x27;ll update this review in a few weeks and see is the thing starts acting up again. I would of 5 stared this unit if it worked out of the box like it should of.</li>
            <li> does not work, once I unscrewed the bottom to put in battery it will not go back on again!!</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product. It is more substantial and works better than my previous trimmers. The LED light is helpful, as well. I&#x27;m hoping that it will also last longer than most. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Excellent product does a great job exactly as described.</li>
            <li> perfect. exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent nose trimmer that works fast and well.</li>
            <li> works well  pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> I like this product. I just wish it cut a little closer. It does have a good strong motor, lite and easy to use</li>
            <li> Just received but appears to be good quality product.</li>
            <li> Good. Well made. Don&#x27;t know why the extra light...well maybe if I have my wife do the trimming it would be useful. Works extremely well to clip ear and nose hair.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband needed for those unsightly hairs on his face. Perfect product for facial grooming.</li>
            <li> Works great. Seems more powerful than other brand I replaced it with.</li>
            <li> I have owned several different ones over the years. This is a Heavy Duty quality trimmer. The jury is still out on how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, easy to use and no undesirable features. Would certain;y recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great - no complaints!</li>
            <li> I like the quality of this shaver.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t turn on from the very moment I received it. I returned it to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price. I feel it fell short in that on the order ad it states LIFETIME WARRANTY.&lt;br /&gt;On the instructions that come with the trimmer, there is no mention of the warranty. This seems strange to me.</li>
            <li> Seems far better than the crappy Panasonic cheaper ones I&#x27;ve purchased in recent years. I love the little LED light---great touch. However, I reserve the right to revisit my review if it deteriorates after a 12 month period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;d like to know: Why not build these things to last, like most all American products once were built, and merely require customers to purchase replacement blades? The biggest problem with the nose hair choppers I&#x27;ve bought in the past is that their blades dull too fast. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the motor is still humming away: The sharp blades always dully within a year or so and require a repurchasing of the product. I HOPE TO GOD that this is not the case with the &amp;#34;Professional Water Res. Heavy Duty....&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer for ear hair that i have owned. Very pleased with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li> This is the first nose trimmer I&#x27;ve used, so I had no idea what to expect.  I read several reviews on different nose trimmer products and this one was the leader.  I am impressed - construction is sturdy, and it is easy to use and clean.  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about lacerating the inside of my nose using a scissors.</li>
            <li> The Nose Trimmer is very solid built, I use it in the shower without any problem.</li>
            <li> did not work, , so i took out the blade and put it in my old one.</li>
            <li> This is the way to go if you need to remove those pesky nose and ear hairs.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool trimmer.  Works great. The last one I had was from sharper image. Same design but larger C cell battery.  This one is lightweight and works as well if not better.  I am happy.  Thanks. .</li>
            <li> The product works effectively, but does take a little bit of time to get use to how it operates best.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied to finally get a nose trimmer that works very well!!  I used to use the WAHL nose trimmer and quite frustrated it.  This product from ToiletTree will not disappoint ;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of crack they are smoking to say this thing is quality, but mine is dog poop. The screw in base is plastic, and it screws in to plastic. Or should I say is supposed to screw in to plastic. Mine is stripped, or manufactured wrong. The end cap is impossible to attach. Made in China is clearly marked on the product. What else is new. Now I have to go through the hassle of exchange.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about the problem with the on off switch not working right out of the box. But I thought with that many problems with the switches that they would have it fixed by now. BUT NO I had to send it back! No problem getting a refund just a waste of time. Best  to just skip over this one until someone from the company post a note saying that they have it fixed.</li>
            <li> I have had several other less costly, cheaply made nose/ear hair trimmers in the past from various companies which worked OK, though did not last long....however, I needed a new one &amp; decided to go with this product from ToiletTree Products....I am extremely satisfied with this trimmer...it is well constructed, heavy duty &amp; works like a charm &amp; the light is a nice extra feature...it is a great value &amp; I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Beats the panasonic hands down.</li>
            <li> I tried as soon as it arrived.  It worked perfectly!!  Does not pull hair. Uses 1 AA Battery. The led light is OK,  but not really needed.</li>
            <li> Best of the four that I have had. Appears to be quality and does a great job.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my old clipper. What a difference. Love this one. I highly recommend it. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this one for a long time (over 10 years). it is time to replace and so I bought one. I bought a couple of other brands, but they never worked to my expectation. Only this one did.</li>
            <li> These are fast, efficient and painless—a real first for same-purpose products purchased over the years.  Thanks for a superior product that actually does what it&#x27;s meant to do and lives up to the claims made by the manufacturer!</li>
            <li> This product is top quality and we are very pleased with it.  This is the second  trimmer that we&#x27;ve purchased and we will be buying more as birthdays and Christmas come along  Fred D. Barton</li>
            <li> had this for months now and still works fine, the little light is helpful. not very noisy at all</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and construction. Very smooth with no tugging. Beats the heck out of the Panasonic that I broke by banging on it to get the very last out of a battery. Oh well, this one is infinitely better.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well.  I do wish it had a moustache and side burn trimmer but I knew it didn&#x27;t going in</li>
            <li> Just received my trimmer and it doesnt work ..put battery in nothing ..very disappointed...though i wont reorder because my wife gave me a wahl as a gift ... however i can say the trimmer is heavy and looks better than the trimmers i have used before... i may order in future</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  It does a great job without pulling hair.  I liked it so much, that I had one sent to a good friend and he is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good trimmer &amp; the LED light is a great idea.</li>
            <li> This nose/ear trimmer actually works. I have bought several other products in the passed. None work as well as this. And the distributor &#x27;ToiletTree Products&#x27; is a 1st class company. Customer service is VERY responsive and goes their extra mile to satisfy their customers</li>
            <li> It works as described. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;m very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well.</li>
            <li> great product. great customer service. I lost the tip blade because it fell into the sinkhole as I was trying to clean it up. I called the customer service and they mailed me a new head within a day.</li>
            <li> The body is steel but the cutter end cap is plastic. The twist threads wore out, so now I can&#x27;t tighten the plastic cap to the steel body. This is the week link. Also the cutter slots are narrow. Very hard to catch coarse hair in the narrow slots.</li>
            <li> item stopped working the moment I turned it on.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is good but no carrying caseor cover included?  My previous trimmer had a velvet &amp; zippered cover at least&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  In less than a minute of use I had heavy hair removed that my old trimmer wouldn&#x27;t touch and got bogged down.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great unit.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my nose and ears</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim as well as the Panasonics and is a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> Product is as described, hubby likes it, doesn&#x27;t pinch or tickle</li>
            <li> I expected this to hurt or tickle, it doesn&#x27;t at all. Easy to use and clean and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Very Handy little trimmer. I love it</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Good design. Gets in those hard-to-reach areas of the nostril with no pulling. I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li> I like that i can run it under water to clean it, or use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I hope it will last longer than the Panasonic brand</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; prompt shipping</li>
            <li> Unlike a different nose trimmer I purchased years ago with unsatisfactory results, this one really does the job in those hard-to-reach areas.  The handle is comfortable and working parts quite letting one hear the hairs being trimmed away.  I&#x27;ve since purchased a second one for my brother-in-law knowing there isn&#x27;t a better choice</li>
            <li> Just got it but it appears to be much better made than anything I could have purchased locally. The light is a silly add on that will help kill a battery faster but it does cut well without pulling and feels industrial strength sturdy in the hand.</li>
            <li> Verify handy, smooth operating.</li>
            <li> Very good nose trimmer</li>
            <li> Weak motor.  Not a very close cut.  LED lamp is next to pointless.</li>
            <li> this product works good for the first time. i put a brand new battery and use it one time, i turned it off. A week latter i wanted to use it again i had to put another new battery.</li>
            <li> Gift.. brother says works fine.</li>
            <li> This trimmer really works! So much better than a regular trimmer. Ogie</li>
            <li> This is a particularly fine item.  Works just as it is supposed to.  I had some dealings with Toilet Tree Products.  They are a great company that backs up what they say.  When they say they have a lifetime guarantee you can count on it.</li>
            <li> Works well, cleans up great.</li>
            <li> Great product! Solid in weight &amp; feel. Octagonal shape keeps device from rolling off the counter.Needs only 1 battery &amp; the spot light id great for tackling nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I have looked &amp; looked for something to work*&lt;br /&gt;This is the one *.</li>
            <li> Works great and beats a pair of scissors. You don&#x27;t need the little LED light. A bit expensive but does the job well.</li>
            <li> Works well, well constructed, not the ultimate but works very well.....</li>
            <li> Functions as advertised.</li>
            <li> Wo9rks mlike a charm!  The LED light is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, sturdy, well-lit and excellent cutting performance. I replaced my 15-year old Sharper Image trimmer that had served me well over many years, but finally broke.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a well made product that has great power. This is my third trimmer and most of them simply dont have enough juice and you can hear the variability in the &amp;#34;motors&amp;#34; power. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Replaced old Panasonic trimmer that I thought was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; .. it&#x27;s rotary blades always had to &amp;#34;rev up&amp;#34; to get to running speed (which I realize now was actually just &amp;#34;walking&amp;#34; speed, compared to the new trimmer) before it could work.  This trimmer is off and running at top speed as soon as it is started, and it gets everything.  Should have figured it out a long time ago.... haven&#x27;t heard that I need to take care of the problem anymore ... &#x27;cause it does its job so well.  Still pretty new to me, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Strong, sharp, does not pull hair. Like the light. Heavy and well made. So far give it a five star. Will give it a few months to see if it is durable and write again.</li>
            <li> I had this product for close to a year but last month is stopped working the product itself is a 5/5</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received the trimmer and tried it for the first time. After using two or three previous trimmers I found the ToiletTree superior. Its operation cuts hair without any pulling and it gets all of it. I&#x27;ve never had much luck with nose hair and so I was very surprised that it did the job in just a few seconds cutting my hair cleanly. It allows easy removal of the cutters for cleaning and it lets you rinse the cutting blades in water. Then it goes back together with ease. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of times so far, but so far so good. Does a great job of trimming nose and ear hair ( a necessary job for us older folks. Great item and good value.</li>
            <li> Use it every other morning. It gets the job done and only have to do a once over, maybe twice (unlike other nose hair trimmers) before I&#x27;m looking good and nose hair free. Great product. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this and the fact that you can use it in the shower is great. This is a wonderful product and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works very well. Excellent product</li>
            <li> I love it.  My nose looks great now!!</li>
            <li> Fast service, nice product</li>
            <li> I find it a bit silly leaving a review a week after I get a product. Asking nme in 6 months or a year would be a much better indicator of quality. However, it did arrive on time and seems to be working fine out of the box. Not much more you could ask for at this stage of the game. The main reason I chose this over the Panasonic is that the owner of the company made an extraordinary effort to respond to all negative reviews and comments. He certainly went the extra mile to ensure that customers felt that they had made the right choice. Unfortunately, I had a piece break off when it dropped. Contacted the manufacturer, they sent me a brand new one immediately. What else can I say?</li>
            <li> It pinches the inside of my nose and does not satisfactorily remove the hair</li>
            <li> Purchased this nose trimmer 3 months ago ...it works excellently on nose and ears. I had a problem with the off/on switch. I called Toilet Tree and they replaced it immediately. More importantly they explained that to turn the switch on you have to depress the small white strip on the switch. This is a safety device to prevent accidental turn on. Apparently I broke the switch by pushing too hard without depressing the white strip. Excellent customer service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the flimsy plastic ones for the last time.  This thing is tough, easier to hold, does a better job, and easy to clean.  Enough said?</li>
            <li> Very effective - Quality construction - Fair price......</li>
            <li> Though it does not come with vacuum cleaning system, I like its water resistant heavy duty steel and lifetime guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for trimming both nose and ear hair. It is very easy to use and quiet while using.  It will be nicer if a carring case is included.</li>
            <li> The best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the product. Very sharp and light a big help.</li>
            <li> I put a battery in &amp; the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t shut off... I played w/ it alittle &amp; still wldn&#x27;t shut off.  I called customer service &amp; they were extremely nice &amp; said they would try 1 &amp; send a new 1 right away to me.  I rec&#x27;d the new 1 very quickly at no charge.  It works GREAT!  love the led light &amp; doesn&#x27;t hurt by pulling hairs.  Nice product &amp; wonderful customer service.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> As good as advertised.</li>
            <li> The package was obviously opened. I didn&#x27;t think and used it and the next day had a sore in my nose. Not good!!</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s a bit weak even with a full set of batteries, but it does the job and it&#x27;s quite painless.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband.  He loves it, especially the light.</li>
            <li> Much better and sturdier than the product that I previously used.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product that does exactly what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but takes some working with to trim all nose hairs. Product could be improved with more horsepower and sharper cutting.</li>
            <li> Works quietly and efficiently. Removes unwanted, unsightly hair easily.  Good product, glad I purchased it, but only time will tell. so far, would recommend.  Any trouble and I&#x27;ll revisit this post.</li>
            <li> It works great and is worth the money.if I ever need to get another one I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I expected a good product; however I received a great product!  Very sharp and picks up hairs quickly.  Could not be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Easy to clean, pretty solid.  If there was anything I wish was better, I wish it would cut a little closer.  But if having five o&#x27;clock shadow in my nose and having to trim a little more often than I did with my last trimmer (which was crap by the way) is the worst thing that could happen to me, then I&#x27;ll be alright..&lt;br /&gt;One of the main reasons I bought this particular model was the response from Toilettree whenever anybody reported a problem with their products.  If a customer review had a complaint or a malfunction, there was a response within a day in most cases from the manufacturer trying to make it right.  That&#x27;s impressive.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap. broke after only a few uses. Plastic end wears way to fast and refuses to shut now. Would not ever recomend product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Does the job, great product!</li>
            <li> Very nice product and the price was very reasonable fast shipping and i will buy other products from this company</li>
            <li> Very sturdy product and the light actually works better than other brands with lights that I have own.  I cannot say anything about longevity, but so far the item works great!</li>
            <li> Led light really helps. Inexpensive item and so far cuts nicely</li>
            <li> Works great, more complete job than the reciprocating model from the drugstore.  I was worried about the rotating blades because of past experience with inferior products which snagged and pulled hairs, but this one has no such issue.</li>
            <li> It was an appreciated gift.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my Dad.  He wears hearing aids and had been having issues with the hair in his ears causing the aids to pop out.  He is thrilled with the trimmer.  He claims he is hearing better and doesn&#x27;t have to keep reseating the hearing aids every few minutes.  He was becoming very concerned that he was going to lose them if the earpiece kept coming loose and with the cost of hearing aids that is a very frightening proposition.  So glad I researched the product and made the obvious correct choice.</li>
            <li> The trimer came before i expected and works better that expected.</li>
            <li> This item worked perfectly. I had no problem with the switch. It is the only clipper I&#x27;ve used that cut hairs without pinching. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Simply works okay.  I bought this expecting more than what I got because of the fantastic reviews, but for a trimmer at this price, I can&#x27;t complain.  It gets rid of all of my unwanted nose hairs, it just takes longer to get rid of them than I was hoping for.  It also requires quite a bit of maneuvering to get rid of everything.</li>
            <li> This professional nose &amp; ear hair trimmer is everything it claims to be.&lt;br /&gt;Very sturdy. Gentle on the mucous membranes of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The LED light is a wonderful help.&lt;br /&gt;This purchase replaced my &amp;#34;TV infomercial&amp;#34; trimmer from about 10 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;It was made of plastic and the part that did the trimming looked like a fine-toothed comb.&lt;br /&gt;It scratched the nasal lining but did cut the hairs very short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Water Resistant Heavy Duty Steel Nose Trimmer does not cut the hairs quite as close as my older one did - however - the safety factor of not scratching the nasal tissue is worth the need to trim a bit more frequently. I expect this trimmer will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> You do have to be a little more aggressive with it than what the directions state, but I think it works great and doesn&#x27;t go through batteries all that quick.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing such a product, so real alternative experience to compare it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt, its quick, it does the job, nice design, good price. Doesn&#x27;t really get in there as much as I anticipated, but its enough to get what needs to be gotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the inside of my nose doesn&#x27;t itch all the time. I can break out of the habit of rubbing my nose all the time.</li>
            <li> Good quality item at a fair price.  Works as advertised.  Have nothing negative to report.  Would definitely recommend this trimmer to others.</li>
            <li> Works great. Doesn&#x27;t pull on hairs. Only complaint is it&#x27;s a little hard to clean...the blade is hard to get out.</li>
            <li> As I grow older, I find more unwanted all the time. I have found this trimmer to be the best I&#x27;ve owned. Believe me, I&#x27;ve owned quite a few nose hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> It seems to work quite well.  I liked the idea of the light for my husband to see what he is doing.</li>
            <li> It looks like it should be a lasting relationship.  Good product.</li>
            <li> GARBAGE!  Does not work at all-  Will not even close..  10 minutes wasted of my life fooling with this piece of crap!</li>
            <li> Very well made and trims just great.  Finally a nose and ear trimmer that does what it is supposed to!</li>
            <li> best one I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t convinced yet, that this was a way of showing that I care for him, but I sure hope he likes it!</li>
            <li> Like the nose trimmer very much. Does a very good job. No pinching whatsoever. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for years and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The system works well when it decides to power up to full mode.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if mine is defective or not. but it takes a while for the motor&lt;br /&gt;to get going. I would give it five stars if the power up was better.</li>
            <li> it does what its suppose to do and the light  is great for seeing what you are doing. Update on my review 9/19/26. Mine had stopped working also because of the faulty switch . I am looking for another  brand to try . Don&#x27;t think this one is worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. The cutters are sharp and the device is durable. I just wish the head was a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Very solid feeling holding it, unlike other nose trimmers I have used. The light is useful if one is trimming someone else&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. It is easy to use even without a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;So far it does a great job without any difficulty &amp; clean results!</li>
            <li> Previously Had a more expensive nose trimmer that lasted only a few years. This is lighter and stronger.  Great value. Thanks!</li>
            <li> No frills.  Works as described and expected.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this trimmer.  Works smooth without pulling the hair.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my husband for Christmas and he was very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> The best trimmer I owned.. It is high quality, and looks like it will outlive me.</li>
            <li> We received this product timely and it was as described.  We have also used the hair trimmer and have found it easy to use.  My husband put a battery in it and did not have any difficulty with that, as we have seen in other reviews.  We like the light and the trimmer did not pull the hairs like other trimmers we have used.  It was also easy to clean by running the tip under water.  As of now, we are delighted with this product although we have only used it once.  Should our opinion change, we will update this review.</li>
            <li> I turned it on and there was NOT much Power and it looked like it had been used already.  I returned it immediately</li>
            <li> It works great. Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> All that it was described and more.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good product, Hope</li>
            <li> Nose Trimmers work great!</li>
            <li> Great product! Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
            <li> Works well, no pulling, cuts close but not too close to cause cuts.</li>
            <li> Just got it,easy to use,,like the led light,does a excellent job.I also like the price</li>
            <li> Bottom screw-on base not go back on!  The bottom cap that opens to insert/remove the battery did not go back on!!</li>
            <li> My first nose trimmer. Only used it twice. Works. Feels rugged enough.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; I really think this is a high quality product and it works perfectly &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> So far so good, nothing fancy</li>
            <li> Well-made product. I have purchased others in the past and they were cheaply made. This product is solid and durable.</li>
            <li> This thing is sweet. By far the highest quality nose trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say it great that all I can say</li>
            <li> Great product. Much heavier build quality than I expected, and so much better than the other two brands that I have had before, a Remington and a Wahl. Those two just did not last, and I didn&#x27;t use them very often. They both gave up after only a couple of years of infrequent use. This trimmer is built to last, from what I can see.</li>
            <li> delivered on time and as described</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for...works well.</li>
            <li> Light, straightforward, easy to maintain, effective...what more can one expect from a simple ear/nose trimmer?  This does everything it is supposed to do, without complication.</li>
            <li> Works well, light not as helpful as expected</li>
            <li> Works very well. Indeed this seems to be a very well built product. With a lifetime warrantee, how can you lose?</li>
            <li> Had for a day, battery cover broke, wouldn&#x27;t run. Sent it back for a refund. Not even worth 1 star This is my 2nd review of the product. The President of ToiletTree Products actually contacted me after my 1st review of their product. Long story short they sent me a new one free of charge. I had bought a Braun trimmer after I sent the original broken ToiletTree trimmer back and was some what satisfied with the  Braun until I received the new ToiletTree trimmer. The ToiletTree trimmer is light years better than the Braun. The original broken ToiletTree trimmer must have been a fluke  Also WOW a company that goes out of it&#x27;s way to satisfy a customer! By the way Amazon&#x27;s return policy is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my husband and although he&#x27;s only used it once he is very pleased with the nice job it does.  Much easier than plucking and painless.</li>
            <li> I have had more than a few disappointments in the &amp;#34;sounds great, doesn&#x27;t work all that well&amp;#34; category. I travel all the time to speak. In a big screen, big audience setting, people can see clear to the moon up your nostrils. And like other aging men, what I lose on top, reappears magically out my ears and nose. I&#x27;d given up on my Brookstone nose clipper. I didn&#x27;t find it very effective. Maybe the slots were slightly too small. Or, hey, maybe my nose hair&#x27;s just not fine enough for the Brookstone class of customer. I have thick hairs. I&#x27;ll take the blame. The ToiletTree nose clipper WORKS in my thickly hairy nose. It cuts my thick nose hair, just as promised. Both nostrils are now as clear and clean as a trumpet&#x27;s bell. I compared the slots on the ToiletTree device with the slots on the Brookstone ... and yes there was a difference in design. And that made all the difference in performance. I am delighted. And I LOVE the light. It&#x27;s a HEADlight. Haven&#x27;t you wondered what the inside of your nose actually looks like? And it helps you spot those errant, fugitive hairs that pop out at the most embarrassing moments.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Efficient hair removal.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...searched for years and bought all of the trash the market had to offer. Finally found this product. One of the best $20 bills I&#x60;ve ever spent !</li>
            <li> Excellent seller. Very happy with product, shipping and packaging. Highly recommended. Thank you. I especially like the light feature, the fact that it successfully removes both nose and ear hairs and can be used in the shower. After researching other nose trimmers going with this vendor was an easy choice.</li>
