            <li>MY GOODNESS, YOU WILL LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>This is becoming my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>:) I thought the price was also quite fair, particularly for the size bottle you get!</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful scent that lasts throughout the day without becoming strange or funky as it happens with some fragrances.</li>
            <li>It was what I expected, and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it, not to mention, the delivery time was excellent.  </li>
            <li>Based on the positive feedback, and the fact that my mother sold Avon products for years, I bought this scent for my wife who loves good perfumes like Shalimar, Chanel No. 5, etc.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume because it is sophisticated and elegant, and yet it is fresh and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>its a soft woodsey scent great for a night time pampering.</li>
            <li>fast shipping good item</li>
            <li>Very light clean and somewhat floral scent.  </li>
            <li>However, I have gotten multiple compliments about how good I smell when I wear this!</li>
            <li>A bit strong for me</li>
            <li>It smells strong when you spray it on your skin.</li>
            <li>it strong smelling</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked the smell since buying it the first time two years ago.</li>
            <li>A favorite light airy clean scent.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>I love this freshly showered scent.</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>Does stay lightly fragrant in clothes in closet (when not laundered out, of course).</li>
            <li>This is such a great smelling perfume I had to order this again.</li>
            <li>I need to get my supply at the most economical price...</li>
            <li>and I love how fresh it is.</li>
            <li>But I was so surprised at how unique,fresh and good this smells</li>
            <li>Great to find such a nice price with fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li>Love this sooooo much that i ordered 3 more</li>
            <li>Smells so good and last through the day.. a favorite from Avon</li>
            <li>Very fresh scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like strong perfumes that &amp;#34;make a statement.&amp;#34; My ideal perfume smells clean and soapy, maybe a little floral.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase, original product in the box, and way cheaper than Avon, usually at $23.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY how I remember it. :)</li>
            <li>Recommend to all who likes sweet and light perfume.</li>
            <li>Came very quick and is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Smells clean and fresh, no one ever suspects its from Avon!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, feminine, long-lasting and never overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Avon Haiku almost exclusively for many years with positive comments from friends and coworkers.  </li>
            <li>i have loved this perfume for years, it is clean smelling and very proficient of lasting most of the day.</li>
            <li>and I still have almost a full bottle</li>
            <li>but it was economical and I have  free shipping.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s true when they say there is no accounting for taste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautifully layered so that as the day goes on, a bit of the \\&quot;flowery\\&quot; scent is lost, but the base is so delightful that I don&#x27;t mind a bit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a more lighter fragrance, not a heavy or strong smell.</li>
            <li>A little heavier than I would have liked, but still nice.</li>
            <li>such a refreshing scent  LOVE</li>
            <li>/&gt;Haiku is lovely and personal; I wear it for myself, and hope sincerely that no one else ever smells it on me.</li>
            <li>Mild scent.</li>
            <li>Recieved perfume quickly.</li>
            <li>Beautiful white floral fragrance, very fresh &amp; vibrant for Spring, very feminine.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, it stays pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>I love this scent so much, I&#x27;m going to look into purchasing the whole line- body powders, lotions, and whatever else they make.</li>
            <li>Once it settles, it&#x27;s soft but just ok for me.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume by far.</li>
            <li>so I bought 2 and received it super fast!</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and has the right price tag.</li>
            <li>The smell is moderate as in not too strong, and not too light.</li>
            <li>Its very feminine,soft and sweet.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery</li>
            <li>She wore it on our first date</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this as soon as it gets low.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the future.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>It has been my favorite for over ten years now.</li>
            <li>I first got this perfume in a mini sample bottle for christmas and did not like it at all...</li>
            <li>Will definitely by buying again! :]</li>
            <li>and it last longer then most parfum.</li>
            <li>It has a strange under tone of what smells like melon but the longer i wear it there is more of a floral tone to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much a subjective issue, I suppose.</li>
            <li>and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li>The smell turns me on, a very seductive scent.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper here then at Avon.</li>
            <li>THANKS SO MUCH</li>
            <li>Would not purchase again, I will pass it on as a gift and hope someone else really likes it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buying from the seller here on Amazon was very convenient</li>
            <li>I also tried out the lotion and found that the purfume and lotion layer very well without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>The packaging is really adorable and the smell is green, fresh, and floral.</li>
            <li>Defiantly different and unique smell .</li>
            <li>but other then that love the smell of the perfume.</li>
            <li>Came in super fast, and smells the same.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll continue to buy this as long as its available.</li>
            <li>This is definitely not a girly perfume as it does not have a sweet sugary smell to it.</li>
            <li>When I firs spray it, there&#x27;s a very strong scent, but it does not last for long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, not the best smell not the worst.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet and fresh ( if it&#x27;s possible ) at the same time .</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it when I got a sample from Avon when I was little.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite everyday cologne</li>
            <li>This has become my new signature scent.</li>
            <li>So if someones looking for a new scent to attract a mate, may I recommend this one.</li>
            <li>To be honest,Avon fragrances being pretty much the same,I  didn&#x27;t expect much of this perfume,and especially  at this low price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting and semi-complex, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Still last a whole day !</li>
            <li>Be aware that products not purchased from an Avon Representative are likely expired, stolen or counterfeit.</li>
            <li>Perfume scent will seem strong at first but only for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert when it comes to scents and my nose isn&#x27;t as good at detecting specific scents like other people, so read other reviews if you want an idea of what it smells like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product arrived intact and no indication that it is so old that the fragrance has deteriorated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who has a mature type of personality who embodies grace and elegance.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of Anais Anais, but just slightly different, perhaps a touch more green.</li>
            <li>It has very special and delicate perfume.</li>
            <li>She had several kinds, but one of them (which was the smallest plant) had a particularly strong scent with the few flowers it had.</li>
            <li>Avon has a very long lasting smells - you like it or not , so use a little bit with caution :-) .</li>
            <li>I will buy directly from Avon next time.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this perfume and assumes I spent a ton on this product.</li>
            <li>But I can tell you that my girlfriend wears this and it drives me crazy, in a good way.  </li>
            <li>and they were expensive but not as nice.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the normal concentration that other bottles I&#x27;ve purchased from Avon reps locally</li>
    </ol>

            <li> :) I thought the price was also quite fair, particularly for the size bottle you get!</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful scent that lasts throughout the day without becoming strange or funky as it happens with some fragrances.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected, and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it, not to mention, the delivery time was excellent.  </li>
            <li> Based on the positive feedback, and the fact that my mother sold Avon products for years, I bought this scent for my wife who loves good perfumes like Shalimar, Chanel No. 5, etc.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume because it is sophisticated and elegant, and yet it is fresh and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> its a soft woodsey scent great for a night time pampering.</li>
            <li> fast shipping good item</li>
            <li> Very light clean and somewhat floral scent.  </li>
            <li> However, I have gotten multiple compliments about how good I smell when I wear this!</li>
            <li> A bit strong for me</li>
            <li> It smells strong when you spray it on your skin.</li>
            <li> it strong smelling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the smell since buying it the first time two years ago.</li>
            <li> A favorite light airy clean scent.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I love this freshly showered scent.</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> Does stay lightly fragrant in clothes in closet (when not laundered out, of course).</li>
            <li> This is such a great smelling perfume I had to order this again.</li>
            <li> I need to get my supply at the most economical price...</li>
            <li> and I love how fresh it is.</li>
            <li> But I was so surprised at how unique,fresh and good this smells</li>
            <li> Great to find such a nice price with fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li> Love this sooooo much that i ordered 3 more</li>
            <li> Smells so good and last through the day.. a favorite from Avon</li>
            <li> Very fresh scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like strong perfumes that &amp;#34;make a statement.&amp;#34; My ideal perfume smells clean and soapy, maybe a little floral.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase, original product in the box, and way cheaper than Avon, usually at $23.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY how I remember it. :)</li>
            <li> Recommend to all who likes sweet and light perfume.</li>
            <li> Came very quick and is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Smells clean and fresh, no one ever suspects its from Avon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean, feminine, long-lasting and never overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Avon Haiku almost exclusively for many years with positive comments from friends and coworkers.  </li>
            <li> i have loved this perfume for years, it is clean smelling and very proficient of lasting most of the day.</li>
            <li> and I still have almost a full bottle</li>
            <li> but it was economical and I have  free shipping.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s true when they say there is no accounting for taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautifully layered so that as the day goes on, a bit of the \\&quot;flowery\\&quot; scent is lost, but the base is so delightful that I don&#x27;t mind a bit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a more lighter fragrance, not a heavy or strong smell.</li>
            <li> A little heavier than I would have liked, but still nice.</li>
            <li> such a refreshing scent  LOVE</li>
            <li> /&gt;Haiku is lovely and personal; I wear it for myself, and hope sincerely that no one else ever smells it on me.</li>
            <li> Mild scent.</li>
            <li> Recieved perfume quickly.</li>
            <li> Beautiful white floral fragrance, very fresh &amp; vibrant for Spring, very feminine.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it stays pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> I love this scent so much, I&#x27;m going to look into purchasing the whole line- body powders, lotions, and whatever else they make.</li>
            <li> Once it settles, it&#x27;s soft but just ok for me.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume by far.</li>
            <li> so I bought 2 and received it super fast!</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and has the right price tag.</li>
            <li> The smell is moderate as in not too strong, and not too light.</li>
            <li> Its very feminine,soft and sweet.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery</li>
            <li> She wore it on our first date</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of this as soon as it gets low.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the future.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> It has been my favorite for over ten years now.</li>
            <li> I first got this perfume in a mini sample bottle for christmas and did not like it at all...</li>
            <li> Will definitely by buying again! :]</li>
            <li> and it last longer then most parfum.</li>
            <li> It has a strange under tone of what smells like melon but the longer i wear it there is more of a floral tone to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much a subjective issue, I suppose.</li>
            <li> and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li> The smell turns me on, a very seductive scent.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper here then at Avon.</li>
            <li> THANKS SO MUCH</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again, I will pass it on as a gift and hope someone else really likes it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buying from the seller here on Amazon was very convenient</li>
            <li> I also tried out the lotion and found that the purfume and lotion layer very well without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> The packaging is really adorable and the smell is green, fresh, and floral.</li>
            <li> Defiantly different and unique smell .</li>
            <li> but other then that love the smell of the perfume.</li>
            <li> Came in super fast, and smells the same.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll continue to buy this as long as its available.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not a girly perfume as it does not have a sweet sugary smell to it.</li>
            <li> When I firs spray it, there&#x27;s a very strong scent, but it does not last for long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, not the best smell not the worst.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sweet and fresh ( if it&#x27;s possible ) at the same time .</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it when I got a sample from Avon when I was little.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite everyday cologne</li>
            <li> This has become my new signature scent.</li>
            <li> So if someones looking for a new scent to attract a mate, may I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> To be honest,Avon fragrances being pretty much the same,I  didn&#x27;t expect much of this perfume,and especially  at this low price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting and semi-complex, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Still last a whole day !</li>
            <li> Be aware that products not purchased from an Avon Representative are likely expired, stolen or counterfeit.</li>
            <li> Perfume scent will seem strong at first but only for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert when it comes to scents and my nose isn&#x27;t as good at detecting specific scents like other people, so read other reviews if you want an idea of what it smells like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product arrived intact and no indication that it is so old that the fragrance has deteriorated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who has a mature type of personality who embodies grace and elegance.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Anais Anais, but just slightly different, perhaps a touch more green.</li>
            <li> It has very special and delicate perfume.</li>
            <li> She had several kinds, but one of them (which was the smallest plant) had a particularly strong scent with the few flowers it had.</li>
            <li> Avon has a very long lasting smells - you like it or not , so use a little bit with caution :-) .</li>
            <li> I will buy directly from Avon next time.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this perfume and assumes I spent a ton on this product.</li>
            <li> But I can tell you that my girlfriend wears this and it drives me crazy, in a good way.  </li>
            <li> and they were expensive but not as nice.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the normal concentration that other bottles I&#x27;ve purchased from Avon reps locally</li>
            <li> There is no better smelling scent (other than clean laundry).</li>
            <li> It is definitely strong at first, but once it breathes a bit it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I waited a long time to try this fragrance</li>
            <li> Totally recommend as an everyday low cost smell that last.</li>
            <li> Now, I have used this spray a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it on for a few hours and the smell has faded considerably.</li>
            <li> In fact, I tried to give it away to some of my cousins and they all turned up their noses, so here I am with a full bottle of a perfume that is useless to me...</li>
            <li> It is so lite and soft doesn&#x27;t hit hard.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> She has only worn it a few times.</li>
            <li> I toyed with other fragrances thinking I&#x27;d settle for one of them</li>
            <li> Its not worth the hassle returning it.</li>
            <li> Ill keep it since it was only $12 total.</li>
            <li> I love the mid notes and base notes!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this perfume for a few months, and loves it; and so do I</li>
            <li> Not strong at all..</li>
            <li> There was a small problem in shipping, I received a phone call on a Sun night a Sun night to straightout.  </li>
            <li> I was thankful to the Lord for small wonders.</li>
            <li> money wasted!</li>
            <li> so I have to keep towel under it which sucks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear perfume, so I took a chance on this one based on the reviews it&#x27;s gotten (and the price!).</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this product and using it everyday!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not overpowering, but subtle and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this perfume.</li>
            <li> When it arrived we both decided to sample it and for me the smell was terribly off-putting, my wife didn&#x27;t like it either, nor my adult daughter.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a x-mas gift for someone who has expensive tastes.</li>
            <li> I went home sad that I couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> You want go wrong by getting this cologne.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell artificial or astringent like at all.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on it all the time and people are always shocked that it&#x27;s an Avon product.</li>
            <li> This stinks!</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this scent ALL the time and people are always shocked that it&#x27;s an Avon product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> such a refreshing scent  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love this freshly showered scent. I receive compliments all day, even when I don&#x27;t smell it any more. Love it!</li>
            <li> Haiku smells too good to be an Avon perfume. I really love wearing it. No matter what time of the day, it&#x27;s always appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;To clarify - I don&#x27;t like strong perfumes that &amp;#34;make a statement.&amp;#34; My ideal perfume smells clean and soapy, maybe a little floral. Haiku is pretty close to that ideal. It&#x27;s interesting and semi-complex, but not overwhelming. Of course, I don&#x27;t douse myself with it either, nor would I ever, ever wear ANY perfume to the gym.&lt;br /&gt;Haiku is lovely and personal; I wear it for myself, and hope sincerely that no one else ever smells it on me. If someone else smells your perfume, it&#x27;s TOO strong! Be considerate of those who suffer from migraines, asthma, and allergies, please!</li>
            <li> This product has a very nice fragrance and not overbearing.  Love it  L. Linscott</li>
            <li> The person I gave it to loved it. Mild scent. Beautiful bottle.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this scent ALL the time and people are always shocked that it&#x27;s an Avon product! Three squirts top and you are ready to go. It&#x27;s a more lighter fragrance, not a heavy or strong smell. I spray it on my chest and hair and I guess it lasts all day because I&#x27;ve gotten compliments at various times. I love this scent so much, I&#x27;m going to look into purchasing the whole line- body powders, lotions, and whatever else they make. The frosted bottle is cute and stands about 3/4 size of my hand for the 1.7 Fl. Oz.  *I have not purchased this from this seller.</li>
            <li> Awesome perfume. Smells so good. Glad i can find it at an affordable price. Shipping was delayed by a couple days. . But that still didn&#x27;t affect my experience with the seller : ) really refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> Avon has a very long lasting smells - you like it or not , so use a little bit with caution :-) . It&#x27;s a sweet and fresh ( if it&#x27;s possible ) at the same time . Defiantly different and unique smell . A bit strong for me so I spray it in the air and walk through it . Still last a whole day !</li>
            <li> Love it and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I have ordered a lot of this perfume and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This has become my new signature scent. I absolutely love it! It smells so nice and light, yet it lasts all day.  I get compliments on it all the time and people are always shocked that it&#x27;s an Avon product. I&#x27;ve started lying about what perfume I&#x27;m wearing, because I don&#x27;t want everyone I know copying me lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did not purchase from this seller.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Reminds me of Anais Anais, but just slightly different, perhaps a touch more green. Beautiful white floral fragrance, very fresh &amp; vibrant for Spring, very feminine.</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous. Recieved perfume quickly.</li>
            <li> The parfume smells wonderful exactly how I remember it. I would definitely repurchase and recommend it. I will also be buying all the matching products.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s clean, feminine, long-lasting and never overpowering.  It&#x27;s beautifully layered so that as the day goes on, a bit of the \\&quot;flowery\\&quot; scent is lost, but the base is so delightful that I don&#x27;t mind a bit.  The bottle is attractive too, if anyone cares about that.  :)  Five stars in my book.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.It does not smell like jasmine.It smells like Calyx perfume by prescriptives.Ill keep it since it was only $12 total.Its not worth the hassle returning it.It smells strong when you spray it on your skin.Once it settles, it&#x27;s soft but just ok for me.Im not in love with this scent.I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> A favorite light airy clean scent.  Must last since people have commented on it in stores and public places.  But I don&#x27;t smell it on me after about fifteen minutes.  Does stay lightly fragrant in clothes in closet (when not laundered out, of course).</li>
            <li> Just as expected.Good price.</li>
            <li> This has been my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; scent for many years and I still get complements on it. I know that chemistry has a part to play in how it smells on each person, however this scent is perfect for me. I love it.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite fragrance. i get compliments on it all the time. i&#x27;ll continue to buy this as long as its available.</li>
            <li> Lovely! Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you what this is made of, the city it was made in, or anything specific like that.  But I can tell you that my girlfriend wears this and it drives me crazy, in a good way.  She wore it on our first date and I think that&#x27;s the reason I fell in love with her.  The smell turns me on, a very seductive scent.  I always make sure she NEVER runs out.  So if someones looking for a new scent to attract a mate, may I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, and enjoying item with NO problems :)</li>
            <li> Loved the price.  Will buy from store again.</li>
            <li> Great price with free shipping! Smells great would buy again :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely  love  that perfume</li>
            <li> I was very happy with order and received item very quick. Will be ordering again</li>
            <li> This is such a great smelling perfume I had to order this again. Not too light and not to strong just a perfect scent to wear anytime. I will be ordering more of this as soon as it gets low.</li>
            <li> Its hot a wonderful flowery clean scent and I fell in love with it when I got a sample from Avon when I was little. Its a great smell. Much cheaper here then at Avon.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product. It is one of my favorite scents for spring time and its cheap! Boyfriend approved :-)</li>
            <li> When I firs spray it, there&#x27;s a very strong scent, but it does not last for long. I will buy directly from Avon next time.</li>
            <li> The product is a special aroma just beautiful, although i have to say the customer service is excellent.  There was a small problem in shipping, I received a phone call on a Sun night a Sun night to straightout.  Talk about CS.</li>
            <li> Smell siuper good i love it i will continue. Buying it</li>
            <li> Nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> LOVE this perfume...it just smells so good on.  I left it for awhile tried others but this one just is my signature scent!  This is the lowest price I found it for so I bought 2 and received it super fast!</li>
            <li> Haiku is the best&lt;br /&gt;I smell so good all day long&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again&lt;br /&gt;(That&#x27;s my Haiku poem ;)</li>
            <li> THANKS SO MUCH, I&#x27;VE ALWAYS LOVED THIS SCENT FROM AVON. SO GLAD I HAVE IT NOW FOR MY PERFUME COLLECTION.</li>
            <li> I love jasmine and getting this perfume for a cheaper price was amazing. It smells great and it lasts a while. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear perfume, so I took a chance on this one based on the reviews it&#x27;s gotten (and the price!). I&#x27;m so glad I did! It smells wonderful and stays on for a while. It is definitely strong at first, but once it breathes a bit it isn&#x27;t bad. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance from Avon.Its very feminine,soft and sweet.Not strong at all..Just the perfect fragrance if you want something soft and understated.</li>
            <li> I waited a long time to try this fragrance but I can&#x27;t say that i like it. It has a strange under tone of what smells like melon but the longer i wear it there is more of a floral tone to it. Would not purchase again, I will pass it on as a gift and hope someone else really likes it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite everyday cologne so I use lots of it in a short period of time. I need to get my supply at the most economical price...what I got from ordering on Amazon was just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived intact and no indication that it is so old that the fragrance has deteriorated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not overpowering, but subtle and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a perfect mixture of scents, some being pomegranate, lily, fig and musk, this perfume  just smells lavish and great for day or evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very romantic scent!</li>
            <li> This is becoming my favorite perfume. It has a wonderful scent that lasts throughout the day without becoming strange or funky as it happens with some fragrances.</li>
            <li> This summer, my mother placed some jasmine flowers in our sun room. She had several kinds, but one of them (which was the smallest plant) had a particularly strong scent with the few flowers it had. It smelled so good and I guess that summer memory led me to find a jasmine-scented perfume. I love the smell of this perfume because it is sophisticated and elegant, and yet it is fresh and not overpowering. I love the mid notes and base notes! The bottle is also very beautiful. It reminds me of the historical Japanese houses. This is definitely not a girly perfume as it does not have a sweet sugary smell to it. I recommend this to anyone who has a mature type of personality who embodies grace and elegance.</li>
            <li> Very fresh scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Definitely best scent out there...just love the smell!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume!! Lovely smell and cute bottle!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and she loved it! Came in super fast, and smells the same. Plus its cheaper, than the $23-25 price tag from the avon store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be getting more.</li>
            <li> Wow. what a lovely smelling perfume. Bought it for my friend for Christmas... Might have to buy some for myself too!  lol Package is very pretty and the bottle is just as attractive.</li>
            <li> the product came damaged on the packaged and the product was leaking. but other then that love the smell of the perfume.</li>
            <li> I have been using Haiku for 5 years now and I love how fresh it is. Very happy with this purchase, original product in the box, and way cheaper than Avon, usually at $23. And delivery before scheduled time.</li>
            <li> Very light clean and somewhat floral scent.  Not overpowering, but noticeable.  Have received compliments.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume spray for years. Love the price of this product and the availability. Will order it again and again.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected, and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it, not to mention, the delivery time was excellent.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the future.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly, and smells great! I just wish I didn&#x27;t go through it so quickly though!! LOL :) I thought the price was also quite fair, particularly for the size bottle you get!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It has been my favorite for over ten years now. Whenever I wear it, I always get compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying from the seller here on Amazon was very convenient and I got it cheaper than I could have by ordering from a representative (unless it&#x27;s on sale, which isn&#x27;t often).</li>
            <li> I love it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> I remember when My mom would to sale and wear the perfumes from Avon and this one was our favorite. I didn&#x27;t know until I searched amazon for this brand. it strong smelling and I still have almost a full bottle so that&#x27;s not going anywhere anytime soon!</li>
            <li> This perfume is great</li>
            <li> I first got this perfume in a mini sample bottle for christmas and did not like it at all... But once i gave it another try I just FELL IN LOVE with the smell and couldn&#x27;t go a day without it! I would get complimented of the smell DAILY. The best way I could describe this scent as is being sophisticated, elegant, graceful, and mysterious. It&#x27;s definitely not a scent that screams &amp;#34;I SMELL LIKE A ROSE/FLOWERS.&amp;#34; Also I can only smell it for maybe an hour but still get complicated MANY hours after I could no longer smell it. I also tried out the lotion and found that the purfume and lotion layer very well without being overpowering. Perfume scent will seem strong at first but only for a few minutes. I&#x27;m no expert when it comes to scents and my nose isn&#x27;t as good at detecting specific scents like other people, so read other reviews if you want an idea of what it smells like. I will keep buying this product and using it everyday!!</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this perfume. Gave it away.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom as a Mothers Day gift. She liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> Smells clean and fresh, no one ever suspects its from Avon! Totally recommend as an everyday low cost smell that last.</li>
            <li> Haiku is the best. My favorite perfume by far. I would recommend it to anyone. If you&#x27;ve never tried it, you should. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Came very quick and is exactly what I wanted! I love the powdery/clean smell that comes from this product. Will definitely by buying again! :]</li>
            <li> This sent smells amazing. Another great Avon product.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance the body butter lotion is great,as well</li>
            <li> To be honest,Avon fragrances being pretty much the same,I  didn&#x27;t expect much of this perfume,and especially  at this low price.But I was so surprised at how unique,fresh and good this smells,that I have to say  that I am super impressed.This perfume  has woodsy,tender,ephemeral smell,like a Japanese garden,it&#x27;s nothing like I ever smelled before.Also it&#x27;s staying power is superb.So far this is my best value for money buy and I will definitely be buying Haiku again.I am amazed that Avon discontinued this perfume,it is one of their best products.Thank You,Amazon.One very happy customer.</li>
            <li> There is no better smelling scent (other than clean laundry). I have been trying to remember the name of this product for like 10 years - finally remembered it and ordered it. Super fast delivery and it smells EXACTLY how I remember it. :)</li>
            <li> Nice.  Can&#x27;t keep my hands off her.....</li>
            <li> Now, I have used this spray a long time. I sent this bottle to my daughter, and wish I had ordered one for myself.</li>
            <li> Great frangrance, will get you a lot of compliments, will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a x-mas gift for someone who has expensive tastes. She absolutely loves this perfume and assumes I spent a ton on this product. If she only knew...</li>
            <li> good stuff great smell</li>
            <li> I love the product, I really loved the price, and most of all, I love how quickly I received it!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent for day or night.  I have been using Avon Haiku almost exclusively for many years with positive comments from friends and coworkers.  Great to find such a nice price with fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this perfume for a few months, and loves it; and so do I, that&#x27;s why I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> THIS HAS SUCH A SPRINGIE SMELL.  HOPE YOU ARE GONG TO KEEP SELLING THIS PERFUME.  THIS WILL GO S LON</li>
            <li> Brought it as a gift for my wife. A little heavier than I would have liked, but still nice. She has only worn it a few times. I&#x27;ll update this once I&#x27;ve made up my mind.</li>
            <li> fast shipping good item</li>
            <li> Excellent price, fast service</li>
            <li> This stinks! This perfume smells nothing like the prescriptive perfume. I gave mine away.</li>
            <li> While visiting my mom I awoke to a beautiful smell. It was coming from the bathroom where my mom had sprayed the perfume on the hand towels. I asked her about it and she told me it was Haiku. When I got home I went to the perfume counters of a bunch of stores and asked for it. No one knew where I could find it. I toyed with other fragrances thinking I&#x27;d settle for one of them and they were expensive but not as nice. I went home sad that I couldn&#x27;t find it. I thought I&#x27;ll try Amazon.com. And low and behold it was an Avon product and only about 10 dollars. I was thankful to the Lord for small wonders. I lost my bottle on vacaton and bought another.</li>
            <li> Good price for my favorite perfume!  I always get compliments on this perfume, too!</li>
            <li> i have loved this perfume for years, it is clean smelling and very proficient of lasting most of the day. however this bottle leaks so I have to keep towel under it which sucks bc I like to have it in my purse.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this scent. Great price!</li>
            <li> It is against Avon policy for representatives to sell products on websites like Amazon, or to sell them to someone knowing that it is their intent to sell on websites like Amazon.  Be aware that products not purchased from an Avon Representative are likely expired, stolen or counterfeit.</li>
            <li> Great perfume! Smells wonderful!  Great price! Smells similar to Japanese blossom lotion from bath and body works! Love this buy!</li>
            <li> Smells divine, product arrived timely.</li>
            <li> I liked this product! It has very special and delicate perfume. Also it was shipped on time. Recommend to all who likes sweet and light perfume.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the normal concentration that other bottles I&#x27;ve purchased from Avon reps locally but it was economical and I have  free shipping.</li>
            <li> i love this parfum. it smell so good and it last longer then most parfum. i really do love it</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it stays pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> I wear all different types of scents but I never any compliments. However, I have gotten multiple compliments about how good I smell when I wear this! The packaging is really adorable and the smell is green, fresh, and floral. It doesn&#x27;t smell artificial or astringent like at all.</li>
            <li> It smell very good. Just like I like it to smell on me. And I recommend it to anyone who would love to wear it.</li>
            <li> Love this sooooo much that i ordered 3 more</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume it goes with skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used to get it from Avon but I&#x27;m happy to know that u guys sell it also.</li>
            <li> I feel like the Lone Ranger here with everyone else giving this product 5 stars. I guess it&#x27;s true when they say there is no accounting for taste. It&#x27;s pretty much a subjective issue, I suppose. Based on the positive feedback, and the fact that my mother sold Avon products for years, I bought this scent for my wife who loves good perfumes like Shalimar, Chanel No. 5, etc. When it arrived we both decided to sample it and for me the smell was terribly off-putting, my wife didn&#x27;t like it either, nor my adult daughter. In fact, I tried to give it away to some of my cousins and they all turned up their noses, so here I am with a full bottle of a perfume that is useless to me...money wasted!</li>
            <li> Excellent smell of perfume for a reasonable price. I&#x27;ve always liked the smell since buying it the first time two years ago. The smell is moderate as in not too strong, and not too light.</li>
            <li> Its good but not like what I remember I don&#x27;t I want the original one it was so good</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this and I loved it but did not want to pay $23 PLUS tax and shipping. I&#x27;m glad I checked Amazon! The delivery was on time and it&#x27;s a great daytime scent. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume. It lasts all day and has the right price tag. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne it has been for a many of years. You want go wrong by getting this cologne.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful once it&#x27;s had time to sit on your skin but the staying power isn&#x27;t great. I&#x27;ve had it on for a few hours and the smell has faded considerably. I don&#x27;t mind reapplying it, though. Most perfumes give me migraines but this one hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, not the best smell not the worst.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and last through the day.. a favorite from Avon</li>
            <li> Perfume does not have same strength as regular Avon perfume</li>
            <li> i love this perfume and the body wash and the lotion its a soft woodsey scent great for a night time pampering.</li>
            <li> Love, I have been wearing this since 9th grade, lol</li>
            <li> bought this for a gift and my friend was just so pleased...</li>
            <li> smells really nice, you will enjoy this scent. i wish there was a much bigger bottle though</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume i have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a baby and everybody love it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it just to try by just looking at its bottle. And loved it. I recommend to buy.</li>
            <li> I ALREADY BOUGHT 2 FROM AMAZON.COM, CHEAPER AND THE SMELL, OH MY GOODNESS, YOU WILL LOVE IT.  TRY IT, HAS THEM SCENT OF THE ORIENTAL COUNTRIES.</li>
            <li> I get complements every time I wear the parfum. Everyone ask what it is and where I got it. It is so lite and soft doesn&#x27;t hit hard.</li>
