            <li>Not too sweet all in all a good product...</li>
            <li>However, the rose note in this one was a bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this perfume.</li>
            <li>I usually love Woodsy types of perfumes.</li>
            <li>it is simply adorable.</li>

            <li>for being a knock off and the low price, this is awesome.  </li>

            <li>I love it and will continue to buy it</li>
            <li>Actually I bought three more for my friends!!!!!!!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I was just looking for something to wear occasionally when I went somewhere nice, and I&#x27;d heard great things about Katy Perry&#x27;s \\&quot;Purr\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, light scent to it, floral and vanilla-y, doesn&#x27;t smell cheap at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice light sweet flowery and not too strong would definetly reorder.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.....</li>
            <li>amazing--- and shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li>Came in a pretty bottle and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Its sweet which I like :)</li>
            <li>The perfume is very nice the scent is full, lush and it lingers a bit..</li>
            <li>I doubt it stays as strong as the original would</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap which is a concern with perfumes that are cheap in price.</li>
            <li>While this is not a bad smell it is a bit strong for me to handle.</li>
            <li>The smell is really nice and soft, unlike those strong aromas out there.</li>
            <li>I have never smelled the original Katy Perry perfume</li>
            <li>so I cannot compare it to the original.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it smells like the original, but it is very woodsy and has a prominent ros√© note.</li>
            <li>Has a sweet smell to it...</li>
            <li>Oh well hopefully I will find my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Pretty bottle too!</li>
            <li>This one doesnt smell right, the clear bottle version smelled much better.</li>
            <li>It does have a very similar smell to it&#x27;s original inspired version however it smell even better than</li>
            <li>if that appeals to other readers, this is a good fragrance for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>This one is to strong and smells like old women.</li>
            <li>This is what I like when it is a impression of a popular scent, I have never experienced Katy Perry-Purr, but it must be really nice because this one meets all my expectations for an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast, arrived 2 days after it was shipped.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Plus the shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li>What a pretty scent.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really remember what the origional smells like, but I am thinking  about maybe buying one for myself :) And the it lasts for hours and the scent doesn&#x27;t fade away for a long time-</li>
            <li>I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>Thank you for fast shipping....</li>
            <li>I dunno what the real one smells like</li>
            <li>came in fast to.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how the original  would smell, but this it is amazing, plus the price is very low.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really a lovely little scent.</li>
            <li>OK long story short.</li>
            <li>The smell didn&#x27;t smell like Katy Perry&#x27;s Purr whatsoever, it took me right back to 8th grade.  </li>
            <li>My first experience with this perfume was when I purchased it from a Big Lots in my town.</li>
            <li>Well, that one had a clear but identical shape bottle to the one I bought from here.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my nine year old daughter</li>
            <li>the fragrance has grown on me, but I did give the perfume to my 8 year old daughter to wear.  </li>
            <li>Well, after using it the first time, it became a regular part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>So I first bought this at big lots last christmas.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in the cute bottle like Katy perry&#x27;s line does</li>
            <li>all in all I actually bought four bottles so far.</li>
            <li>The friend who I gave this to as a Christmas present totally ditched her old perfume and started using this one instead!</li>

            <li> smelled strongly of cinnamon, I hate that smell like and do not like the image of the box on the product has characteristics that has no perfume so that gives me doubts about the quality of this, I can not say anything because is the first time I use it ...</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pin down what it smells like, because I don&#x27;t find that it&#x27;s powdery or flowery, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like \\&quot;old lady perfume\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I bought this sort of blindly and was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> but whateve, I saved 1/2 off what I usually pay and no one can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> If I hate it, no real loss.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It smells like an expensive perfume</li>
            <li> Dirty water in a used bottle</li>

            <li> I LOVE this perfume. It was a gift for my friend, and it smells absolutely AMAZING!!!! I can&#x27;t really remember what the origional smells like, but I am thinking  about maybe buying one for myself :) And the it lasts for hours and the scent doesn&#x27;t fade away for a long time- In a good way! Good for gifts and it smells amazing--- and shipping was so fast! I TOTALLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I usually love Woodsy types of perfumes.However, the rose note in this one was a bit too strong for me.While this is not a bad smell it is a bit strong for me to handle.I wanted to like this one it is simply adorable.Oh well hopefully I will find my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells good, at a good price! However the scent doesn&#x27;t last long..have to keep respraying......boo! Still a good deal if you just want to try it!</li>
            <li> My first experience with this perfume was when I purchased it from a Big Lots in my town. I was just looking for something to wear occasionally when I went somewhere nice, and I&#x27;d heard great things about Katy Perry&#x27;s \\&quot;Purr\\&quot;. So, I saw it and thought, \\&quot;What the heck? It&#x27;s only $5. If I hate it, no real loss.\\&quot; Well, after using it the first time, it became a regular part of my daily routine. It has a really great smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering or too \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;, which is a huge plus for me. It&#x27;s hard to pin down what it smells like, because I don&#x27;t find that it&#x27;s powdery or flowery, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like \\&quot;old lady perfume\\&quot;. It&#x27;s a very subtle, modern scent, and I really like it. So does my husband, so that&#x27;s always a good thing. ;) I think if you&#x27;ve used or just smelled \\&quot;Purr\\&quot;, liked it, and would like to get a good quality alternative without spending $30+, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, smells very expensive &amp; last long.... Wonderful for ppl on a budget &amp; great Christmas gift...All :)</li>
            <li> This perfume impression of Katy Perry&#x27;s Purr arrived promptly and in great condition.. The perfume is very nice the scent is full, lush and it lingers a bit.. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice fruity spicy sweet musk this one is it!! and it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap which is a concern with perfumes that are cheap in price. It smells like an expensive perfume it&#x27;s just alot easier on your pocketbook. It does have a very similar smell to it&#x27;s original inspired version however it smell even better than Katy Perry Purr it&#x27;s a really a lovely little scent.</li>
            <li> for being a knock off and the low price, this is awesome.  im wearing it now! I doubt it stays as strong as the original would but at the end of the day I can still smell it on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I bought this sort of blindly and was pleasantly surprised! It has a nice, light scent to it, floral and vanilla-y, doesn&#x27;t smell cheap at all. This will be great to wear to work and school. Pretty bottle too!</li>

            <li> I just love it. Thank you for fast shipping....&lt;br /&gt;Smell so good ...</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter as a Christmas gift and I wanted to keep it for myself, this perfume smells delightful and this was not overpowering it has a nice scent that lingers for hours</li>
            <li> Someone got this for my sister for Christmas and I had to have it. It smells so nice! I love how the scent stays with you all day.</li>
            <li> o....m...g lol this was a very nice scent. I dunno what the real one smells like but this is freaking perfect. came in fast to. all in all I actually bought four bottles so far. its a really good buy to be honest.</li>
            <li> OK long story short. Shipping was super fast, arrived 2 days after it was shipped. The smell is really nice and soft, unlike those strong aromas out there. Its sweet which I like :) The friend who I gave this to as a Christmas present totally ditched her old perfume and started using this one instead!</li>
            <li> I love my perfume.  I think all of fragrance smell good.</li>
            <li> I got this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter (who loves all things girly). The bottle is really cute and the smell is wonderful. I&#x27;ll probably be buying more once she&#x27;s gone through this one.</li>
            <li> This was awesome and smells amazing I love it and will continue to buy it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it smells like the original, but it is very woodsy and has a prominent ros√© note. if that appeals to other readers, this is a good fragrance for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful I was unsure about buying this product but I am totally satisfied with it!!! Actually I bought three more for my friends!!!!!!!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I gave this to my friend and she loved it and so do I. I am not sure how the original  would smell, but this it is amazing, plus the price is very low. this was a great gift for my friend..</li>
            <li> I thought this would not even smell like it, to my surprise it does! My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in the cute bottle like Katy perry&#x27;s line does but whateve, I saved 1/2 off what I usually pay and no one can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> very good product, excellent fragrance</li>
            <li> My daughter luved so did I it&#x27;s nice light sweet flowery and not too strong would definetly reorder.Valerie luved it 3rd grader.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having this product! I knew I couldn&#x27;t afford to splurge on Katy Perry&#x27;s perfume, and my sister had been eyeing Meow for a while, so I feel very lucky that I stumbled across this gem! She ended up loving the smell, although I can&#x27;t comment on the quality of the perfume/how it fades etc.</li>
            <li> Dirty water in a used bottle</li>
            <li> I have never smelled the original Katy Perry perfume so I cannot compare it to the original. But, I can say that this Kitty Girl perfume smells wonderful! My husband loved it too!</li>
            <li> The smell didn&#x27;t smell like Katy Perry&#x27;s Purr whatsoever, it took me right back to 8th grade.  I rated it with a 4 because to be quite honest the fragrance has grown on me, but I did give the perfume to my 8 year old daughter to wear.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, unless it was for her.</li>
            <li> el producto llego en  excelentes condiciones, llego en el tiempo pactado y lleno mis expectativas sobre el producto. los recomiendo. very good</li>
            <li> U guys were awsome .I&#x27;m very happy for the results .I got it unopened so id give u a job well done .look forward to ordering from u again soon .thanks</li>
            <li> smelled strongly of cinnamon, I hate that smell like and do not like the image of the box on the product has characteristics that has no perfume so that gives me doubts about the quality of this, I can not say anything because is the first time I use it ...</li>
