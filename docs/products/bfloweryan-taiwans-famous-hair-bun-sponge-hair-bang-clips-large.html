            <li>Anyway, I sent it off to Good Will.</li>
            <li>and I was good to go.</li>
            <li>Works well and is good quality.</li>
            <li>but the price was too good.</li>
            <li>and I could not get my hair to look good</li>

            <li>Very happy with my first and will be giving this one as a gift this Christmas.</li>
            <li>I love the product but this company does not send it in plastic!  </li>
            <li>But works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>And every easy to use happy with the item.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and makes great buns</li>
            <li>it is amazing</li>
            <li>It is kind of big/bulky though.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I just can&#x27;t do it on my own</li>
            <li>I do suggest having one or two bobby pins handy.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need Bobby pins or anything to hold it in place which is nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>it really does make an almost perfect bun.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice product.</li>
            <li>and it did not come with rose hair pin</li>
            <li>This makes it super easy too get a perfect bun in seconds.</li>
            <li>A lovely hair do you can wear with any occasion, and very light weight!</li>
            <li>I tends to stick in my hair and not slide very easily.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure when my layers grow out it will work much better for me!</li>
            <li>love it, it makes  a nice neat bun and hasn&#x27;t fallen off</li>
            <li>It works great (if you use it right)</li>
            <li>SO EASY to use!</li>
            <li>However, if you are good with fixing your own hair, this is an extremely useful tool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very cheap material, and if you use it a lot the wire inside</li>
            <li>It is an okay product for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>and I cannot even return it because it would cost more to return it than to just keep it.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these, then I bought 4 more.</li>
            <li>So i&#x27;m satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I am so happy this was a very inexpensive item.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of them when needed.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>its okay, wish it came with instructions on how to use.  </li>
            <li>so I would be able to wrap more hair around it but its not.  </li>
            <li>And for the price I will buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li>but my hair in a bun, and this works better than the donut sponge.</li>
            <li>WELL guess I won&#x27;t be ordering more boo hoo boo hoo</li>
            <li>I love this for my hair , it helps me a lot.</li>
            <li>she can take them out by herself and she gets Cute curls.</li>
            <li>You can put your hair up in so many ways</li>
            <li>Better off buying those donut hair things ..</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It makes you look like you have a lot more hair than you do and makes a really clean bun!</li>
            <li>This item is ok, it is not that easy to use.</li>
            <li>yes it was just what I expected I am very happy with the product  </li>
            <li>ok kinda cheap</li>
            <li>this is ok, its cheap</li>
            <li>fast shipping and good product,thank you</li>
            <li>AND, when I take my hair down, it leaves beautiful CURLS so that I can restyle! :)</li>
            <li>in the picture looks realy easy to put on but its not.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>it gets destroyed easily.?.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s very quick.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use I can do it</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t easy to use</li>
            <li>It is not that easy for me to wrap my hair around the sponge when I am forming the bun.</li>
            <li>This will give you the flawless bun, and curl your hair for when you take it down after work.</li>
            <li>it stays totally fine and keeps your hair up.</li>
            <li>Sent me some cheap, unusable piece of junk.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply done, it does not hold well</li>
            <li>Much easier than the clip kind of bun maker and stays in all day.</li>
            <li>Its a great concept but this individual product does not work.</li>
            <li>easy!&lt;br /&gt;*Bobby pins are important to hold the bun in place.</li>
            <li>It was cheap and did not even work period.</li>
            <li>The tool itself is light</li>
            <li>and i wish if they make it longer than this to fit all my hair .</li>
            <li>Thank god it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I never received a free flower clip though.</li>
            <li>It was cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>cant complain it was cheap</li>
            <li>It quick and easy</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast, and came in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was easy to order and came in quickly, but am concerned it will break after using it repeatedly.</li>
            <li>There is no way this holds any significant amount of hair on place.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I ordered this.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I recieved it.</li>
            <li>I thought with the fabric it would hold good, but no such luck with me.</li>
            <li>It has a good size for a bigger bun</li>
            <li>its good if you have short hair</li>
            <li>I had previously owned this bun contraption and loved the many hairsyles I could do.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, you dont even need to put a pony tail in first -</li>
            <li>I probably should have been aware since it is such a cheap product, but them&#x27;s the shakes -- learn from my experience and get something better!</li>
            <li>and it holds all the hair in a great round</li>
            <li>Its nice but should have some clip to hold it in the back</li>
            <li>It worked right away, and my 10 year old is very very pleased with it, and so is my normally picky spouse.  </li>
            <li>if you want a nice round bun, stick with sock bun, or those other kind made from some kind of mesh material.</li>
            <li>so I tried it right away.</li>
            <li>is still trying to get it looking right .  </li>
            <li>I got it right</li>
            <li>The product doesnt work on my hair, which is funny because I imagine it was made originally for asian hair (taiwan&#x27;s famous?)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a fun, functional, easy to use piece!</li>
            <li>Love the fact that this allows me to do my favorite summer hairstyle with ease and less than a fraction of the pins i used to keep the bun in place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that even though I have really, really blonde hair, the black device doesn&#x27;t show through my hair, which is great!</li>
            <li>It looked pretty good other than the bottom</li>
            <li>I would only wish the ends hooked together closing the bun more efficiently, but two pins work well also.</li>
            <li>I first put my hair in a pony tail with a hair tie first</li>
            <li>Bought for grand daughters birthday present.  </li>
            <li>It just became a big fat ball and didn&#x27;t look cute at all.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Still using the first one we took out of the package.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and worth the price</li>
            <li>These work well to roll up my hair in hot weather&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They cost more, but they actually work.</li>
            <li>and I have used it to put the not shown here on top of my head and on the back of my head and of course added flowers around it.</li>
            <li>I have long hair, which i love, but sometimes you just have to get rid of it for a while, right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it on both of us at least fifty times by now, and I can not make a successful bun with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sponge material on the outside is an appropriate description, but what I expected to be bendable wire inside feels more like metal strips that will break at any momnent.  </li>
            <li>I will order more for friends with long hair</li>
            <li>I thought it would be fun to try some new hair styles and see if I could add some volume to my bun.   </li>
            <li>Easy directions, especially simple to do if you start off with a ponytail.</li>
            <li>My 11 yr old daughter uses this for her dance class to do a quick, neat looking bun.  </li>
            <li>I guess it would work for finer hair, however, the bun would not be fuller if you want to supplement with scrungies to make it large.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair like me you will need to put gel on your hair or hairspray so the stray hairs won&#x27;t fall from the bun (which is likely to happen after some moving around).  </li>
            <li>The second problem is that my hair is really fine and sticks to this thing a lot.</li>
            <li>and it certainly has made my life much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if they sold a light brown color since my hair is blonde.</li>
            <li>There was enough length of the wire to overlap, which should have provided a secure hold, but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it makes a really neat style bun...</li>
            <li>There was no guide to determine which size to buy based on how much hair you have.   </li>
            <li>I really did not like this product.</li>
            <li>but I need tons of extra hair pins and spray to hold it in place because it has no pin to secure it with.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really hold your hair ...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold the bun very well but it will get you the shape.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I know that these will slowly break from normal wear and tear, which is why I own 5!</li>
            <li>I WILL BE ORDERING MORE BUN SPONGES FOR OTHER GROUPS AND PARENTS.</li>
            <li>I have used geniune ones before, this simply has a wire inside, once it take a shape it doesnt comeback to original form</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair (about 3ft in length), so thought I would try out this ...</li>
            <li>but as long it works, im fine</li>
            <li>so you need to have a lot of hair or very long for it to look fine</li>
            <li>You really only need one, but I like to use 2.&lt;br /&gt;*Besides from being able to make a bun, you can also make a french twist!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes and thought for the price why not give it a go.</li>
            <li>I wear it straight, or sometimes I let it curl naturally.</li>
            <li>Its a great concept but only if you dont have a lot of hair, if your hair is thick, or if you&#x27;re looking for a professional bun.</li>
            <li>I have to buy a few more in case</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely long(passed my waist) and the sponge just wouldn&#x27;t fit into my hair.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I might just buy a couple to keep on hand when it eventually breaks - so far it has not!</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty thick and long, so it doesn&#x27;t quite meet all the way around, but I can still make a nice bun and pin the excess parts into place.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and this actually works.</li>
            <li>The first problem is that I clearly don&#x27;t have enough hair for this size.</li>
            <li>the first try and it stays in without problem with only the aid of a few bobby pins to secure where the hair is brought together.</li>
            <li>My hair is super straight and layered so it always looks a bit messy in this.</li>
            <li>the picture on the ad doesn&#x27;t do the bun justice as in real your hair will be tighter around your head (that&#x27;s what I prefer) and the bun much bigger.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no clip at the ends to complete the bun</li>
            <li>The picture shows black with no other color options available to choose from, that I saw.  </li>
            <li>She has long hair and loves trying out new styles and really likes buns and twist.  </li>
            <li>this thing wouldn&#x27;t close all the way, and it didn&#x27;t create a nice round bun, its not worth it.</li>
            <li>, that is why I ordered the large and its about 9&amp;#34; long, I thought it would be longer</li>
            <li>Even though this was relatively cheap you could still probably do just as well if not better with a sock bun.</li>
            <li>it was fast shift, good quality, everything came as how I expected, and there was nothing wrong on this products</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit of practice, but after that, it&#x27;s super</li>
            <li>At least it was a cheap way to try it out.</li>
            <li>I mean, come on, fifty cents and free shipping.</li>
            <li>That means, after you made your hair bun, some part of clip is still outside of the bun and is not completely hidden in hair.</li>
            <li>(When it&#x27;s curly it&#x27;s a little more messy, but still cute!)&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li>While the concept of the hair bun sponge is great, in actuality it fails to deliver for heavy, Asian hair.  </li>
            <li>I am looking for one that rolls up and is long enough to fold completely around itself.  </li>
            <li>I have long &amp; very heavy hair &amp; prefer to usually wear in up-do and this really helps to get the task done easily.</li>
            <li>A possible reason is my hair is not long enough?</li>
            <li>It ok but a little hard to get use to using</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very happy with my first and will be giving this one as a gift this Christmas.</li>
            <li> I love the product but this company does not send it in plastic!  </li>
            <li> But works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> And every easy to use happy with the item.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes great buns</li>
            <li> it is amazing</li>
            <li> It is kind of big/bulky though.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I just can&#x27;t do it on my own</li>
            <li> I do suggest having one or two bobby pins handy.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need Bobby pins or anything to hold it in place which is nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> it really does make an almost perfect bun.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product.</li>
            <li> and it did not come with rose hair pin</li>
            <li> This makes it super easy too get a perfect bun in seconds.</li>
            <li> A lovely hair do you can wear with any occasion, and very light weight!</li>
            <li> I tends to stick in my hair and not slide very easily.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure when my layers grow out it will work much better for me!</li>
            <li> love it, it makes  a nice neat bun and hasn&#x27;t fallen off</li>
            <li> It works great (if you use it right)</li>
            <li> SO EASY to use!</li>
            <li> However, if you are good with fixing your own hair, this is an extremely useful tool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very cheap material, and if you use it a lot the wire inside</li>
            <li> It is an okay product for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> and I cannot even return it because it would cost more to return it than to just keep it.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these, then I bought 4 more.</li>
            <li> So i&#x27;m satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I am so happy this was a very inexpensive item.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of them when needed.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> its okay, wish it came with instructions on how to use.  </li>
            <li> so I would be able to wrap more hair around it but its not.  </li>
            <li> And for the price I will buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li> but my hair in a bun, and this works better than the donut sponge.</li>
            <li> WELL guess I won&#x27;t be ordering more boo hoo boo hoo</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair , it helps me a lot.</li>
            <li> she can take them out by herself and she gets Cute curls.</li>
            <li> You can put your hair up in so many ways</li>
            <li> Better off buying those donut hair things ..</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It makes you look like you have a lot more hair than you do and makes a really clean bun!</li>
            <li> This item is ok, it is not that easy to use.</li>
            <li> yes it was just what I expected I am very happy with the product  </li>
            <li> ok kinda cheap</li>
            <li> this is ok, its cheap</li>
            <li> fast shipping and good product,thank you</li>
            <li> AND, when I take my hair down, it leaves beautiful CURLS so that I can restyle! :)</li>
            <li> in the picture looks realy easy to put on but its not.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> it gets destroyed easily.?.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s very quick.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use I can do it</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t easy to use</li>
            <li> It is not that easy for me to wrap my hair around the sponge when I am forming the bun.</li>
            <li> This will give you the flawless bun, and curl your hair for when you take it down after work.</li>
            <li> it stays totally fine and keeps your hair up.</li>
            <li> Sent me some cheap, unusable piece of junk.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply done, it does not hold well</li>
            <li> Much easier than the clip kind of bun maker and stays in all day.</li>
            <li> Its a great concept but this individual product does not work.</li>
            <li> easy!&lt;br /&gt;*Bobby pins are important to hold the bun in place.</li>
            <li> It was cheap and did not even work period.</li>
            <li> The tool itself is light</li>
            <li> and i wish if they make it longer than this to fit all my hair .</li>
            <li> Thank god it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I never received a free flower clip though.</li>
            <li> It was cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> cant complain it was cheap</li>
            <li> It quick and easy</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast, and came in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was easy to order and came in quickly, but am concerned it will break after using it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> There is no way this holds any significant amount of hair on place.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered this.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I recieved it.</li>
            <li> I thought with the fabric it would hold good, but no such luck with me.</li>
            <li> It has a good size for a bigger bun</li>
            <li> its good if you have short hair</li>
            <li> I had previously owned this bun contraption and loved the many hairsyles I could do.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, you dont even need to put a pony tail in first -</li>
            <li> I probably should have been aware since it is such a cheap product, but them&#x27;s the shakes -- learn from my experience and get something better!</li>
            <li> and it holds all the hair in a great round</li>
            <li> Its nice but should have some clip to hold it in the back</li>
            <li> It worked right away, and my 10 year old is very very pleased with it, and so is my normally picky spouse.  </li>
            <li> if you want a nice round bun, stick with sock bun, or those other kind made from some kind of mesh material.</li>
            <li> so I tried it right away.</li>
            <li> is still trying to get it looking right .  </li>
            <li> I got it right</li>
            <li> The product doesnt work on my hair, which is funny because I imagine it was made originally for asian hair (taiwan&#x27;s famous?)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a fun, functional, easy to use piece!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this allows me to do my favorite summer hairstyle with ease and less than a fraction of the pins i used to keep the bun in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that even though I have really, really blonde hair, the black device doesn&#x27;t show through my hair, which is great!</li>
            <li> It looked pretty good other than the bottom</li>
            <li> I would only wish the ends hooked together closing the bun more efficiently, but two pins work well also.</li>
            <li> I first put my hair in a pony tail with a hair tie first</li>
            <li> Bought for grand daughters birthday present.  </li>
            <li> It just became a big fat ball and didn&#x27;t look cute at all.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Still using the first one we took out of the package.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and worth the price</li>
            <li> These work well to roll up my hair in hot weather&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They cost more, but they actually work.</li>
            <li> and I have used it to put the not shown here on top of my head and on the back of my head and of course added flowers around it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, which i love, but sometimes you just have to get rid of it for a while, right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on both of us at least fifty times by now, and I can not make a successful bun with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sponge material on the outside is an appropriate description, but what I expected to be bendable wire inside feels more like metal strips that will break at any momnent.  </li>
            <li> I will order more for friends with long hair</li>
            <li> I thought it would be fun to try some new hair styles and see if I could add some volume to my bun.   </li>
            <li> Easy directions, especially simple to do if you start off with a ponytail.</li>
            <li> My 11 yr old daughter uses this for her dance class to do a quick, neat looking bun.  </li>
            <li> I guess it would work for finer hair, however, the bun would not be fuller if you want to supplement with scrungies to make it large.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair like me you will need to put gel on your hair or hairspray so the stray hairs won&#x27;t fall from the bun (which is likely to happen after some moving around).  </li>
            <li> The second problem is that my hair is really fine and sticks to this thing a lot.</li>
            <li> and it certainly has made my life much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if they sold a light brown color since my hair is blonde.</li>
            <li> There was enough length of the wire to overlap, which should have provided a secure hold, but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it makes a really neat style bun...</li>
            <li> There was no guide to determine which size to buy based on how much hair you have.   </li>
            <li> I really did not like this product.</li>
            <li> but I need tons of extra hair pins and spray to hold it in place because it has no pin to secure it with.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really hold your hair ...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold the bun very well but it will get you the shape.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I know that these will slowly break from normal wear and tear, which is why I own 5!</li>
            <li> I WILL BE ORDERING MORE BUN SPONGES FOR OTHER GROUPS AND PARENTS.</li>
            <li> I have used geniune ones before, this simply has a wire inside, once it take a shape it doesnt comeback to original form</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair (about 3ft in length), so thought I would try out this ...</li>
            <li> but as long it works, im fine</li>
            <li> so you need to have a lot of hair or very long for it to look fine</li>
            <li> You really only need one, but I like to use 2.&lt;br /&gt;*Besides from being able to make a bun, you can also make a french twist!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and thought for the price why not give it a go.</li>
            <li> I wear it straight, or sometimes I let it curl naturally.</li>
            <li> Its a great concept but only if you dont have a lot of hair, if your hair is thick, or if you&#x27;re looking for a professional bun.</li>
            <li> I have to buy a few more in case</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely long(passed my waist) and the sponge just wouldn&#x27;t fit into my hair.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I might just buy a couple to keep on hand when it eventually breaks - so far it has not!</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick and long, so it doesn&#x27;t quite meet all the way around, but I can still make a nice bun and pin the excess parts into place.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair and this actually works.</li>
            <li> The first problem is that I clearly don&#x27;t have enough hair for this size.</li>
            <li> the first try and it stays in without problem with only the aid of a few bobby pins to secure where the hair is brought together.</li>
            <li> My hair is super straight and layered so it always looks a bit messy in this.</li>
            <li> the picture on the ad doesn&#x27;t do the bun justice as in real your hair will be tighter around your head (that&#x27;s what I prefer) and the bun much bigger.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no clip at the ends to complete the bun</li>
            <li> The picture shows black with no other color options available to choose from, that I saw.  </li>
            <li> She has long hair and loves trying out new styles and really likes buns and twist.  </li>
            <li> this thing wouldn&#x27;t close all the way, and it didn&#x27;t create a nice round bun, its not worth it.</li>
            <li> , that is why I ordered the large and its about 9&amp;#34; long, I thought it would be longer</li>
            <li> Even though this was relatively cheap you could still probably do just as well if not better with a sock bun.</li>
            <li> it was fast shift, good quality, everything came as how I expected, and there was nothing wrong on this products</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of practice, but after that, it&#x27;s super</li>
            <li> At least it was a cheap way to try it out.</li>
            <li> I mean, come on, fifty cents and free shipping.</li>
            <li> That means, after you made your hair bun, some part of clip is still outside of the bun and is not completely hidden in hair.</li>
            <li> (When it&#x27;s curly it&#x27;s a little more messy, but still cute!)&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li> While the concept of the hair bun sponge is great, in actuality it fails to deliver for heavy, Asian hair.  </li>
            <li> I am looking for one that rolls up and is long enough to fold completely around itself.  </li>
            <li> I have long &amp; very heavy hair &amp; prefer to usually wear in up-do and this really helps to get the task done easily.</li>
            <li> A possible reason is my hair is not long enough?</li>
            <li> It ok but a little hard to get use to using</li>
            <li> have long hair (down to the bottom of the small of my back), and this thing refused to hold any kind of tension as  I rolled it up my ponytail, no matter how tight I kept it</li>
            <li> Not super thick, or fine.</li>
            <li> Styling long hair can strain your arms, neck and upper back.</li>
            <li> This product will not create a bun sufficient enough to hold in place for long.  </li>
            <li> This really only works for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> even tried it on my roommate (whose hair is only down to the middle of her back) and had the same problem as I did using it on myself.  </li>
            <li> Takes nearly a week and a half to get here</li>
            <li> I put them in her hair when it&#x27;s almost dry from her shower and the next morning</li>
            <li> I think the hole at the center of this sponge is short compared with the total length of the sponge.</li>
            <li> Does not hold my hair which is pretty thick and very long.</li>
            <li> Honestly, for the price it isn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> I am looking for this kinda product for long time</li>
            <li> Then I think this one fits for someone with \\&quot;really\\&quot; long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I have layered, long hair.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it said it would work with long hair (my hair is longer than my waist)</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, long and layered</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have long hair</li>
            <li> have given them away to friends with long hair.</li>
            <li> but if you have long hais i dont recomended. . . . ..</li>
            <li> This particular product is about half the size of the one I previously owned.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 11 with very long hair and she loves having curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long</li>
            <li> for such a simplistic item, i have had alot of fun with it.....</li>
            <li> You can do the bun on top of your head, but I prefer the bun near the base of my neck.  </li>
            <li> the sides were loose and falling out.</li>
            <li> When I did close it, my hair would not come together to form a bun; the sides were too loose to fall neatly and cover the sponge ends, if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, i was hoping it would do great for me for my my schools military program</li>
            <li> The package arrived quicker than expected</li>
            <li> Also, after following instructions on making the bun, you might need to attach the bun to your head with a few bobby pins.  </li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It looks just like the picture, but you need to bobby pin the hair closed to make it stay together for dance.</li>
            <li> Its also much harder to put it on....</li>
            <li> unlike the pic it does not stay closed after you&#x27;ve managed to put it on .</li>
            <li> its a waste totally.</li>
            <li> This is such a waste of money...</li>
            <li> So I ended up not really even using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard people use socks to duplicate the effort of this simple hair product, and have no idea why anyone would waste their time.</li>
            <li> i received it faster then expected i got it in 2week</li>
            <li> Does not come with the flower thing like I expected.</li>
            <li> Product does not hold bun as it says very loose even though I tried to squeeze the heck out of it for it to hold it</li>
            <li> Took a little long to get it though.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s past my shoulders) and this is way too big.</li>
            <li> This was not exactly the Hairdini I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> Once the wire gets broken, it&#x27;s kinda back to the same ole thing with hairpins again.</li>
            <li> it is a little harder to do than what I thought</li>
            <li> Hard to put in, only works at the nap of the neck.</li>
            <li> it even make a bun on my hair and its hard to twist.. in short this is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> It is not very sturdy and the clip looses its shape after few uses.</li>
            <li> If you have hair past your shoulders and it has any kind of thickness to it, this product is worthless as it won&#x27;t hold the weight of your hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick Middle Eastern hair this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> and I have long thick hair to my waist.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this item if you got long and thick hair, which would require something like the one on the picture, which does exist, but not in this link.</li>
            <li> The metal inside doesn&#x27;t blend well, and cannot hold my hair tightly.</li>
            <li> I was pretty mad when i recieved my order in the mail.</li>
            <li> at first, i was afraid that the metal inside the fabric would break, but so far, it hasn&#x27;t failed me.</li>
            <li> I really feel bad for people like me who got curious and just wasted money for this.</li>
            <li> It fells like after bending it a few times it will break.</li>
            <li> your still having trouble in how to use this products I found YouTube video that shows you how to use it.</li>
            <li> (no, i&#x27;m not her) and its called \\&quot;Everyday</li>
            <li> Dont waste for you time or money.</li>
            <li> Holds in place firmly with one bobby pin.  </li>
            <li> bought it for whenever i wan to</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Ive owned this for a few years</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, so this bun sponge is too small to fully connect.</li>
            <li> have long (mid-back) thin hair</li>
            <li> I received it the past few days and it was ripped and had holes in it, it doesn&#x27;t close at all when you try to close it :/&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I have long (26 inch) thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Hard to twist and the black wire covering rips every time I use it.</li>
            <li> when you try to use it it will not even hold its shape a little bit!</li>
            <li> but it is a little hard to handle it at the beginning.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on this it sucks.</li>
            <li> Not really sure how to use it but its for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> i like it , i got small ones too for my baby girl .&lt;br</li>
            <li> i had the hair bun which looks like this in the picture thats why i ordered this, and when i received it, its just a piece of sponge with wire inside, too small</li>
            <li> The product is flimsy and probably will be broken soon due to the metal wiring inside it.      </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to work with it.</li>
            <li> and I had a hard time putting it in myself.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for hard to use</li>
            <li> But my hair is quite thick.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out since my hair is not that thick.</li>
            <li> The bun that this one creates isn&#x27;t as thick or as even</li>
            <li> Does not work on thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and layered, so I was worried the buns wouldn&#x27;t come out well</li>
            <li> have thin hair fir thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair to my bottom, and this was worthless, didn&#x27;t hold even small strands of hair</li>
            <li> poor poor quality.</li>
            <li> Maybe because it&#x27;s like a thin sponge with a metal inside.</li>
            <li> The quality is poor and it cant even hold my hair.</li>
            <li> This was humongous and poorly made..</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not great.  </li>
            <li> The qaulity was so poor.</li>
            <li> a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and trying to get it all in the slit before rolling is impossible.  </li>
            <li> and when it does it is useless.</li>
            <li> Every time I tried to use it (and failed), I&#x27;d lose a lot of hair when trying to remove it.   </li>
            <li> I have never been so wrong.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time using the donuts</li>
            <li> its fake.</li>
            <li> It came in a very thin piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> U need thick hair for this clip !!!</li>
            <li> Horrible don&#x27;t waste your money !</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after being frustrated with a sock bun donut.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly disappointed in this purchase</li>
            <li> and she was disappointed as well.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed as soon as I took it out of the package.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with directions as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> the clips inside the sponge are crap, and so is the sponge aswell for that matter.</li>
            <li> and then I roll my hair up, wrapping the sponge around the base of the pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work but they have a very unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> so I am very disappointed in your line of work</li>
            <li> Awful, flimsy, piece-of-poo</li>
            <li> Read reviews saying it was horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not so great! Can&#x27;t hold the bun on to the head once the bun is form.</li>
            <li> It ok but a little hard to get use to using</li>
            <li> Good price . I seen them for 7$ at the swapmeet so definitely a good buy ! But I would only buy of u have thin hair fir thick hair you should just use the sock bun</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after being frustrated with a sock bun donut. I have long, fine hair and this actually works. The package arrived quicker than expected so I tried it right away. Easy directions, especially simple to do if you start off with a ponytail. Just put your hair through, roll it up, and curl it into a bun! I would give it 5 stars if they sold a light brown color since my hair is blonde. Nonetheless this is a great deal and I will probably buy another!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t figure out how to make it work</li>
            <li> Sent me some cheap, unusable piece of junk. It was nothing like the item pictured. The return process keeps sending you to a dead-end screen so you are stuck with it.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me, it refused to come together when I tried to curl the ends together. There was enough length of the wire to overlap, which should have provided a secure hold, but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair (down to the bottom of the small of my back), and this thing refused to hold any kind of tension as  I rolled it up my ponytail, no matter how tight I kept it the sides were loose and falling out. When I did close it, my hair would not come together to form a bun; the sides were too loose to fall neatly and cover the sponge ends, if that makes any sense.  It looked pretty good other than the bottom showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried it on my roommate (whose hair is only down to the middle of her back) and had the same problem as I did using it on myself.  I&#x27;ve tried it on both of us at least fifty times by now, and I can not make a successful bun with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to have to return it.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this allows me to do my favorite summer hairstyle with ease and less than a fraction of the pins i used to keep the bun in place. I would only wish the ends hooked together closing the bun more efficiently, but two pins work well also.</li>
            <li> It is an okay product for the price you pay. It is not very sturdy and the clip looses its shape after few uses.</li>
            <li> It works well, but I have shoulder length hair and it doesn&#x27;t cover it all the way. But for 48 cents and ree shipping, when I ordered it, is a great price. It is kind of big/bulky though.</li>
            <li> I am not an expert with hair, so this is not the product for me.  However, if you are good with fixing your own hair, this is an extremely useful tool.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair (about 3ft in length), so thought I would try out this ...Hair Bun Sponge... and see if it&#x27;s easier than making a regular bun and not feeling the weight of all the hair accessories that goes with the bun.  I loved it!  I think it makes a really neat style bun...the picture on the ad doesn&#x27;t do the bun justice as in real your hair will be tighter around your head (that&#x27;s what I prefer) and the bun much bigger.  You can do the bun on top of your head, but I prefer the bun near the base of my neck.  If you have fine hair like me you will need to put gel on your hair or hairspray so the stray hairs won&#x27;t fall from the bun (which is likely to happen after some moving around).  Also, after following instructions on making the bun, you might need to attach the bun to your head with a few bobby pins.  The bobby pins will be unnoticeable as they will be under the bun.      A lovely hair do you can wear with any occasion, and very light weight!</li>
            <li> This product will not create a bun sufficient enough to hold in place for long.  The product is flimsy and probably will be broken soon due to the metal wiring inside it.      Thoroughly disappointed in this purchase and I cannot even return it because it would cost more to return it than to just keep it.</li>
            <li> For me, this is one of the best items I have discovered.  It allows me to have the bun style hair do without all the hassle.  It quick and easy and it certainly has made my life much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Its a great concept but only if you dont have a lot of hair, if your hair is thick, or if you&#x27;re looking for a professional bun.</li>
            <li> I am looking for this kinda product for long time and i finally find it here. it works well but it is a little hard to handle it at the beginning.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTE waste of money. might as well buy the qwickbun. I was pretty mad when i recieved my order in the mail. poor poor quality. the clips inside the sponge are crap, and so is the sponge aswell for that matter. dont waste your money on this it sucks. now im just going to have to order the qwickbun from its official website instead. Very disappointed, i was hoping it would do great for me for my my schools military program</li>
            <li> This hair bun thing is not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  Once you get it rolled and worry about whether it will stay put, there is no place to insert the hairpins.  I am looking for one that rolls up and is long enough to fold completely around itself.  I have two of those and can&#x27;t find replacements.  Once the wire gets broken, it&#x27;s kinda back to the same ole thing with hairpins again.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply done, it does not hold well, it&#x27;s hard to work with it. I would not make the same choice again.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.  It fells like after bending it a few times it will break. The sponge material on the outside is an appropriate description, but what I expected to be bendable wire inside feels more like metal strips that will break at any momnent.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.  At least it was a cheap way to try it out.</li>
            <li> a little disappointed. I&#x27;ve used a hair bun sponge before. But this one doesn&#x27;t work well for me. The metal inside doesn&#x27;t blend well, and cannot hold my hair tightly. I think the hole at the center of this sponge is short compared with the total length of the sponge. That means, after you made your hair bun, some part of clip is still outside of the bun and is not completely hidden in hair. A possible reason is my hair is not long enough? But my hair is quite thick. Then I think this one fits for someone with \\&quot;really\\&quot; long hair.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, you dont even need to put a pony tail in first - i never do- it stays totally fine and keeps your hair up. I have long hair, which i love, but sometimes you just have to get rid of it for a while, right? This bun is perfect! I would recommend this to everyone.Takes 2 seconds to do your hair and it stays all day. TOTALLY awesome. I have to buy a few more in case I lose this one or my dogs get it.</li>
            <li> While the concept of the hair bun sponge is great, in actuality it fails to deliver for heavy, Asian hair.  The bendable wire inside the sponge is a bit flimsy and does not withstand the weight of my hair when rolled up into a bun.  Perhaps this would work well for someone with thinner hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m really pleased with this product! at first, i was afraid that the metal inside the fabric would break, but so far, it hasn&#x27;t failed me.</li>
            <li> This is a really great buy! It makes you look like you have a lot more hair than you do and makes a really clean bun! I&#x27;ve found that even though I have really, really blonde hair, the black device doesn&#x27;t show through my hair, which is great! It&#x27;s such a fun, functional, easy to use piece! It should be in every girls hair care regime!</li>
            <li> If you have hair past your shoulders and it has any kind of thickness to it, this product is worthless as it won&#x27;t hold the weight of your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried over and over to get my hair in a bun with this item.  I can&#x27;t do it.  I have really thick hair and trying to get it all in the slit before rolling is impossible.  I even tried to just roll it without using the slit and that didn&#x27;t work either.  I thought with the fabric it would hold good, but no such luck with me.</li>
            <li> Awful, flimsy, piece-of-poo</li>
            <li> The picture shows black with no other color options available to choose from, that I saw.  When it arrived, it was bent and was unpackaged in a 3 x 3 envelope with no instructions, and was BRIGHT PURPLE!  How do you hide that??!!  Change my hair color to purple, I guess.  Anyway, I sent it off to Good Will.</li>
            <li> My 11 yr old daughter uses this for her dance class to do a quick, neat looking bun.  It works well she has med length hair.  It looks just like the picture, but you need to bobby pin the hair closed to make it stay together for dance.</li>
            <li> This makes a very nice looking bun.  Much easier than the clip kind of bun maker and stays in all day.</li>
            <li> Its a great concept but this individual product does not work. There&#x27;s no clip at the ends to complete the bun and my hair ends up folding out.</li>
            <li> I bought this item but like 3 weeks later it ripped. Maybe because it&#x27;s like a thin sponge with a metal inside. Its also much harder to put it on.... in the picture looks realy easy to put on but its not.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these, then I bought 4 more. I mean, come on, fifty cents and free shipping. That&#x27;s just awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros/ Tips:&lt;br /&gt;*I have layered, long hair. Not super thick, or fine. I wear it straight, or sometimes I let it curl naturally. It works with my hair no matter how I have it styled. (When it&#x27;s curly it&#x27;s a little more messy, but still cute!)&lt;br /&gt;*I looked up on YouTube how use this, watched one video and I was good to go. It takes a little bit of practice, but after that, it&#x27;s super easy!&lt;br /&gt;*Bobby pins are important to hold the bun in place. You really only need one, but I like to use 2.&lt;br /&gt;*Besides from being able to make a bun, you can also make a french twist! (Look that up on YouTube as well)&lt;br /&gt;*I feel like a lot of people are having issues because they use JUST the hair bun sponge. I first put my hair in a pony tail with a hair tie first and then I roll my hair up, wrapping the sponge around the base of the pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*I know that these will slowly break from normal wear and tear, which is why I own 5!</li>
            <li> This item is ok, it is not that easy to use. Does take some work and getting used to. I tends to stick in my hair and not slide very easily.</li>
            <li> A easier way to make a bun.  I&#x27;m not one of those folks who is good at making hairdos, this is a great self gift for people like me.</li>
            <li> It was cheap and did not even work period. If you have long hair don&#x27;t buy it. Save yourself some change.</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast, and came in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, it makes  a nice neat bun and hasn&#x27;t fallen off and I have long thick hair to my waist.  So i&#x27;m satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;If your still having trouble in how to use this products I found YouTube video that shows you how to use it. Youtube video is by bebexo (no, i&#x27;m not her) and its called \\&quot;Everyday Perfect Bun Hairstyle Updo Hair Tutorial\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This was easy to order and came in quickly, but am concerned it will break after using it repeatedly. But works great and is easy to use. Great item lets hope it holds up to the continued use.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all!  I probably should have been aware since it is such a cheap product, but them&#x27;s the shakes -- learn from my experience and get something better!</li>
            <li> my hair at the back of the bun would come out bc this thing wouldn&#x27;t close all the way, and it didn&#x27;t create a nice round bun, its not worth it. if you want a nice round bun, stick with sock bun, or those other kind made from some kind of mesh material.</li>
            <li> I am so happy this was a very inexpensive item. I have long hair to my bottom, and this was worthless, didn&#x27;t hold even small strands of hair so it went into the trash. Dont waste for you time or money.</li>
            <li> unlike the pic it does not stay closed after you&#x27;ve managed to put it on . its a waste totally.</li>
            <li> Second one I have purchased.  Very happy with my first and will be giving this one as a gift this Christmas.</li>
            <li> Takes nearly a week and a half to get here and when it does it is useless. Doesn&#x27;t hold hair doesn&#x27;t do a thing</li>
            <li> No instructions. he child who it was for is still trying to get it looking right .  No clips came.</li>
            <li> It works but it is very big so you need to have a lot of hair or very long for it to look fine</li>
            <li> My hair is super straight and layered so it always looks a bit messy in this.</li>
            <li> yes it was just what I expected I am very happy with the product  I will order more for friends with long hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Hard to twist and the black wire covering rips every time I use it. I thought maybe I just can&#x27;t do it on my own so I had my friend do it for me and she was disappointed as well.</li>
            <li> They work but they have a very unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it. Cause i don&#x27;t know how. Lol</li>
            <li> Bought for grand daughters birthday present.  She has long hair and loves trying out new styles and really likes buns and twist.  This has been a great tool.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it said it would work with long hair (my hair is longer than my waist) but it didn&#x27;t. It just became a big fat ball and didn&#x27;t look cute at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this item if you got long and thick hair, which would require something like the one on the picture, which does exist, but not in this link.</li>
            <li> Hard to put in, only works at the nap of the neck.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Exactly what I was looking for.  I have to put my daughters hair in a bun every week for her ballet class.  I ordered 6 of these just to have backups on hand.  Still using the first one we took out of the package.  No tears.  Holds in place firmly with one bobby pin.  I do put in extra just in case.  I will be buying more of them when needed.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is such a waste of money... I really feel bad for people like me who got curious and just wasted money for this. It basically does nothing.... it gets destroyed easily.?. Lowest quality...</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out since my hair is not that thick. I thought it would be fun to try some new hair styles and see if I could add some volume to my bun.   The first problem is that I clearly don&#x27;t have enough hair for this size. There was no guide to determine which size to buy based on how much hair you have.   The second problem is that my hair is really fine and sticks to this thing a lot. Every time I tried to use it (and failed), I&#x27;d lose a lot of hair when trying to remove it.   I really did not like this product. I&#x27;ll probably throw it away or give it to my sister. She probably has enough hair for it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and worth the price</li>
            <li> I have long &amp; very heavy hair &amp; prefer to usually wear in up-do and this really helps to get the task done easily.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even figure out how to work this thing came with no instructions! But I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> Great product. Took a little long to get it though.</li>
            <li> Tried it and it doesn&#x27;t work. I had high hopes and thought for the price why not give it a go. I have never been so wrong. The quality is poor and it cant even hold my hair. If you have thick Middle Eastern hair this is not the product for you. Do yourself a favor buy a Tangle Teaser and move on with life. I was disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> I had previously owned this bun contraption and loved the many hairsyles I could do. This particular product is about half the size of the one I previously owned. I have long thick hair, so this bun sponge is too small to fully connect. I guess it would work for finer hair, however, the bun would not be fuller if you want to supplement with scrungies to make it large.</li>
            <li> ere is no possible way to make a bun with this product! when you try to use it it will not even hold its shape a little bit! Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time using the donuts but this is a god-send. I had not idea how to make buns before this wonderful do-dad.&lt;br /&gt;I have long (mid-back) thin hair and it holds all the hair in a great round shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with no instructions but all you have to do is follow the steps in the picture above and viola! I do suggest having one or two bobby pins handy.</li>
            <li> its okay, wish it came with instructions on how to use.  I know I can look it up online.</li>
            <li> This item did not make it to my house so I am very disappointed in your line of work</li>
            <li> Not really sure how to use it but its for my daughter.  She&#x27;ll figure it out</li>
            <li> I received it the past few days and it was ripped and had holes in it, it doesn&#x27;t close at all when you try to close it :/&lt;br /&gt;Very upset about this.</li>
            <li> I have long (26 inch) thin hair.  This is perfect as it adds thickness and make a perfect bun every time.  Also it&#x27;s very quick.  The tool itself is light so no added weight to your hair, and I don&#x27;t need Bobby pins or anything to hold it in place which is nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but it just wasn&#x27;t for me. My hair is extremely long(passed my waist) and the sponge just wouldn&#x27;t fit into my hair. So I ended up not really even using it.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use and looks great every time.  My hair is pretty thick and long, so it doesn&#x27;t quite meet all the way around, but I can still make a nice bun and pin the excess parts into place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very cheap material, and if you use it a lot the wire inside it will become all tangled up, but it will do the trick.  I have a lot of hair, long and layered, that is why I ordered the large and its about 9&amp;#34; long, I thought it would be longer so I would be able to wrap more hair around it but its not.  It does the trick for me but I need tons of extra hair pins and spray to hold it in place because it has no pin to secure it with. If I were you I would stick to the sock bun it works just as well.</li>
            <li> for such a simplistic item, i have had alot of fun with it.....it really does make an almost perfect bun.</li>
            <li> This really only works for people with long hair. I have medium length hair (it&#x27;s past my shoulders) and this is way too big.</li>
            <li> The product doesnt work on my hair, which is funny because I imagine it was made originally for asian hair (taiwan&#x27;s famous?) but it simply can&#x27;t hold my hair up at all.</li>
            <li> It arrived within the 2 - 3 week window in an envelope.  It worked right away, and my 10 year old is very very pleased with it, and so is my normally picky spouse.  In seconds, it makes a unique/pretty looking bun for my daughter&#x27;s dance classes.  I might just buy a couple to keep on hand when it eventually breaks - so far it has not!</li>
            <li> Item is just as described, however larger than I thought it was be. Works well and is good quality. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> it was fast shift, good quality, everything came as how I expected, and there was nothing wrong on this products</li>
            <li> This item is great. And for the price I will buy more as gifts. And every easy to use happy with the item.</li>
            <li> i like it , i got small ones too for my baby girl .&lt;br /&gt;i have long hair and i wish if they make it longer than this to fit all my hair .</li>
            <li> bought it for whenever i wan to but my hair in a bun, and this works better than the donut sponge.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product. Ive had this for about 4 years and it still works.</li>
            <li> The wire will not hold the weight of my hair.</li>
            <li> i had the hair bun which looks like this in the picture thats why i ordered this, and when i received it, its just a piece of sponge with wire inside, too small it even make a bun on my hair and its hard to twist.. in short this is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard people use socks to duplicate the effort of this simple hair product, and have no idea why anyone would waste their time. This will give you the flawless bun, and curl your hair for when you take it down after work.</li>
            <li> U need thick hair for this clip !!! OH WELL guess I won&#x27;t be ordering more boo hoo boo hoo</li>
            <li> it is a little harder to do than what I thought&lt;br /&gt;but it is a great idea . It has a good size for a bigger bun</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s because I couldn&#x27;t read the directions, but I prefer the sponge-like bun maker that I got at walgreens than this one. The bun that this one creates isn&#x27;t as thick or as even and I had a hard time putting it in myself.</li>
            <li> Does not work on thick hair. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair , it helps me a lot. I do not dislike anything I think it is great, I would recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> OUR DANCE GROUP LOVE THIS TO MAKE PERFECT BUNS!!!! I WILL BE ORDERING MORE BUN SPONGES FOR OTHER GROUPS AND PARENTS.</li>
            <li> Is good and cute, all is good I like this product, is handy, to my friends all person because is good</li>
            <li> a littel more complicated to create than what i thought - i find a sock bun easier but my sister loves it so i gave it to her</li>
            <li> ok kinda cheap you get what you pay for hard to use and it did not come with rose hair pin</li>
            <li> Does not work if you have layers in your hair.</li>
            <li> Would give a zero star if I could. This was humongous and poorly made.. Thank god it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Read reviews saying it was horrible but the price was too good. Just got it yesterday and it is amazing I don&#x27;t even need a bobby pin.</li>
            <li> DO NOT EVEN BOTHER! This is a piece of junk, it was a waist of money and time. when i try putting it on looked like a birds nest. CHEAP AND TRASH!!!</li>
            <li> Its nice but should have some clip to hold it in the back</li>
            <li> It works great (if you use it right) My hair is in layers so it doesn&#x27;t work great for me! But I&#x27;m sure when my layers grow out it will work much better for me!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. My daughter is 11 with very long hair and she loves having curly hair. I put them in her hair when it&#x27;s almost dry from her shower and the next morning she can take them out by herself and she gets Cute curls.</li>
            <li> You can put your hair up in so many ways and it&#x27;s so easy. Styling long hair can strain your arms, neck and upper back. This takes out the pain and shortens your styling tome. Good stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> i received it faster then expected i got it in 2week so thats a plus but it doesn&#x27;t have a hook so it doesn&#x27;t really hold your hair ... i wouldn&#x27;t suggest this just save your money</li>
            <li> I am in the Air Force and I have to wear my hair in a bun every day.  I saw this and figured I&#x27;d go ahead and give it a try.  Honestly, for the price it isn&#x27;t too bad but it&#x27;s definitely not great.  It doesn&#x27;t hold the bun very well but it will get you the shape.  I had to use extra hair ties wrapped around the bun to keep it in place.  Even though this was relatively cheap you could still probably do just as well if not better with a sock bun.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use. I got it right the first try and it stays in without problem with only the aid of a few bobby pins to secure where the hair is brought together. I only wish that it were maybe an inch or two shorter to keep from overlapping itself when bent into a circle.</li>
            <li> Eh it does the trick...I never received a free flower clip though.</li>
            <li> Such a flimsy piece of spongy material. There is no way this holds any significant amount of hair on place. I was so excited when I ordered this. I was sorely disappointed as soon as I took it out of the package. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> its fake. I have used geniune ones before, this simply has a wire inside, once it take a shape it doesnt comeback to original form</li>
            <li> These work well to roll up my hair in hot weather&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I have given them away to friends with long hair.</li>
            <li> Does not hold my hair which is pretty thick and very long. I could not get the bin to stay in place it just kept falling out</li>
            <li> I bought one of these, but not on amazon.  It does not work at all if your hair is medium length.  I tried it because I had used an EZ-Bun, because it worked so well.  I am taking my money back to Ezbun.com.  They cost more, but they actually work.</li>
            <li> its good if you have short hair but if you have long hais i dont recomended. . . . ..</li>
            <li> This does nothing but bend and fall.  There were no instructions on how to use it, although it should be self-explanitory.  Why is there is nothing works?!</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I recieved it. I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with directions as shown in the picture. It came in a very thin piece of plastic. It would have been a 5 had I the directions.</li>
            <li> This makes it super easy too get a perfect bun in seconds. Ive owned this for a few years and I still use it all the time!</li>
            <li> Horrible don&#x27;t waste your money ! Item did not work .. Better off buying those donut hair things .. Never again</li>
            <li> fast shipping and good product,thank you</li>
            <li> Does not come with the flower thing like I expected. And it does not work, when I get it to work finally it does not stay</li>
            <li> SO EASY to use! AND, when I take my hair down, it leaves beautiful CURLS so that I can restyle! :)</li>
            <li> The qaulity was so poor. It was cheap and flimsy. As soon as I took it out the packaging I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time. I love the product but this company does not send it in plastic!  GROSS</li>
            <li> Makes a perfect bun, I love it! My hair is thick and layered, so I was worried the buns wouldn&#x27;t come out well but it still works in giving me the perfect bun and its so easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes great buns</li>
            <li> Product does not hold bun as it says very loose even though I tried to squeeze the heck out of it for it to hold it but I&#x27;ll find some way to use it I&#x27;ll manage</li>
            <li> this is ok, its cheap but it does work.... cant complain it was cheap but as long it works, im fine</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and I thought I would have to have help us8ing this. It is so easy to use I can do it all my myself. I love it and I have used it to put the not shown here on top of my head and on the back of my head and of course added flowers around it. It&#x27;s everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t easy to use and I could not get my hair to look good, I tried it two times then gave up on it.</li>
            <li> It is not that easy for me to wrap my hair around the sponge when I am forming the bun.</li>
            <li> This was not exactly the Hairdini I was hoping for.  It serves the purpose but not the quality I had hoped for.</li>
