            <li>This item has proven to be great for myself as a deployed soldier.</li>
            <li>this is a great bag, I bought it for my boyfriend, it is very nice looking, the pictures don&#x27;t do it justice.  </li>

            <li>but this one he LOVED.  </li>
            <li>Nicely made - looks great for a guy</li>
            <li>Well made, ;looks good.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m good with it regardless.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase which he what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>It is also a great case for scrapbookers to hold adhesives or creative memories oval and circle cutters.  :-)</li>
            <li>Nice color.  </li>
            <li>Nice material inside and out of the kit.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the leather is not as nice as the pics.     </li>
            <li>Just a good, well made bag that opens and closes easily.</li>
            <li>and this one is the best I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also nice looking and it is easy to carry by the strap.  </li>
            <li>Overall an excellent shaving/dop kit, but wish there was a more organized design on the inside.</li>
            <li>I love this item.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s already got 12 days of travel on it and there are 36 more scheduled this year--including Europe.</li>
            <li>For the price, I think it is an outstanding value.</li>
            <li>This bag should not have been more than $15 tops.</li>
            <li>I love it and will be using it for myself.</li>
            <li>and I was able to just rinse it out</li>
            <li>better than in the picture</li>
            <li>Bought for a gift, satisfied with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Most shaving kits have too many pockets to suit his needs.  </li>
            <li>Handsome, rugged look.</li>
            <li>So, I looked for a suitable bag that fit the no leather critera.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It was a great size, quality leather, and liked the double zipper opening.</li>
            <li>Great updated my old bag.</li>
            <li>It is very well made and a good price for the value.  </li>
            <li>Good quality and is very well made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this bag and in fact, it&#x27;s a much nicer material than it looks in the photographs, so I concur with the Dec 07 review from another buyer in that sense, but I also agree that it should have had more pockets and more ability to separate different items.</li>
            <li>It is easy to zip and has a lot of room.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, durable and stylish.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been through a half dozen styles and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>so it gets plenty of wear and tear and has held up fine.  </li>
            <li>Nice looking and large.  </li>
            <li>one color available (not</li>
            <li>I filled it with desk &#x27;essentials&#x27; (chap stick, Lysol wipes, hand sanitizer, band aids, gum, breath spray, hand lotion, twenty bucks for when he would eventually forget to bring his lunch, etc.)</li>
            <li>Material somewhat cheap,.</li>
            <li>The quality is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>While only one pocket, it has held up very well and has suited my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I&#x27;ll give the product its props and convey that it is definitely a handsome bag.</li>
            <li>We took it sailing (8000 miles), so it did get a bit beaten up, but it still looks great, works well, zippers are like brand new - and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I went from having my own bathroom to sharing one with my wife and 4 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>Good looking bag and is durable enough.  </li>
            <li>Great for traveling because it is soft and not hard.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many shave kits in the past and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Quality product delivered quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like being able to zip back the top to a box.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for many years and no issues so far.</li>
            <li>I fly nearly once enough</li>
            <li>I like how the toothbrush holder is seperate, the double zipper opens up to the entire contents so things are easy to find, and the thickness and quality of the leather is outstanding, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using this for 10 or so years.</li>
            <li>Everything is right there.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size-really like the material used.</li>
            <li>This way he can open the whole top and get to his things easily.  </li>
            <li>When you zip it open there is a nice large opening to access the contents inside.  </li>
            <li>I now use it as a first aid kit that we keep in the hallway closet.</li>
            <li>The price is way too much for what you get, but since my last travel bag finally gave out (after 20 years LOL)</li>
            <li>The zipper is well made and opens up the entire top</li>
            <li>I wanted leather at first</li>
            <li>This is exactly as it looks.</li>
            <li>we love the way it opens all the way up with the double zippers.</li>
            <li>My last one lasted 10 years and this one is better quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got enough room for all of the essentials and some plastic sleeves in the top for a razor or toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It seems pretty durable</li>
            <li>The construction is first class and it contains anything thtat I might need.</li>
            <li>A little smaller than I thought it would be, but my husband is happy with it.</li>
            <li>As a result, I had to wrap a bungee cord around it to keep everything from falling out and really didn&#x27;t use the zippers anymore because it was easier to reach straight in through the eight inch gap in the side.</li>
            <li>Oh, and you bet your a** lunch in NYC can easily, really, and truly cost twenty friggin&#x27; bucks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so you can really rummage around in there.     </li>
            <li>It has held up very well.</li>
            <li>If the bag starts filling with items and weighs a bit too much</li>
            <li>I did notice some CHEAP PLASTIC SLEEVES inside the flap that perhaps refers to the extra compartments.    </li>
            <li>This kit has proven useful to replace my old ( and molding) shaving kit.  </li>
            <li>I gave this to my husband for Christmas he absolutely loves it</li>
            <li>This kit is well made; very roomy and just what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Nice the way it opens up completely opposed to the kind with a single zipper down the middle making it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just not worth it any more.  </li>
            <li>Husband loved it - and he is very hard to please.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend the kit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this shaving kit...</li>
            <li>For a few bucks more get one that it monagrammed and leather.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaving bag as a gift for my husband when he started a new job eight years ago.</li>
            <li>It still looks fairly new after all these years.</li>
            <li>I had no choice but to get a new one.</li>
            <li>and this still looks new.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bought a new travel kit in years.</li>
            <li>The material looks just like leather and it is very soft.  </li>
            <li>it is wide enough for his hand and the zippers work freely.</li>
            <li>Very functional &amp; sturdy (excited)&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size for short or extended travel</li>
            <li>Desiring a completely non-cluttered space I decided to start using a shaving kit like my stepfather who undoubtedly picked up the habit from his time in the Marines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem being, I don&#x27;t like using leather products if I don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li>Pulling the strap opens the whole damn thing, so you have to be really careful to lift this bag ONLY from one side of the bag in just the right way, or else it opens.</li>
            <li>I like and got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This item is large enough to hold all your daily needs.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t imagine it will come apart any time in the near future.</li>
            <li>Two zippers open to a single large cargo space and slots for toothbrush in flap.</li>
            <li>I wish it was about half again as large as it is but like to look of the bag&lt;br /&gt;rustic</li>

            <li> Two zippers open to a single large cargo space and slots for toothbrush in flap.</li>
            <li> I wish it was about half again as large as it is but like to look of the bag&lt;br /&gt;rustic</li>
            <li> Shaving kits like this one have really been hard for me to find.  </li>
            <li> Also, it allows for an extra wide opening to get to what you need.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to its wear or long term durability.</li>
            <li> Wanted a bag I could open wide for my swim cosmetics and equipment, to dry out.  </li>
            <li> which is where my last shaving kit broke down.  </li>
            <li> I just wish I could find it a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a kit that provided access and took up minimal space on hotel room counters--this is IT.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The item was a lot nicer than i expected.  </li>
            <li> My only problem with it is that it doesn&#x27;t have little compartments inside to hold things separate from each other.</li>
            <li> As stated in other reviews it could&#x27;ve used an inside compartment.</li>
            <li> Has holders in upper zipper for toothbrush, razor and other small items.</li>
            <li> Pointless double zipper.</li>
            <li> I agree with other posters that it could do with some compartmentalization</li>

            <li> Bought this for my father, who has had the same shaving kit for at least 35 years.  </li>
            <li> Set off on an extended trip with this item in tow and it lasted less than 60 days before the leather hanging strap on the end snapped at the rivet and the stitching on one of the two zippers came undone.</li>
            <li> But between the crappy leather, the plastic sleeves, and the useless double zippers that open the bag</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the color was so dark it was hard to distiguish it from black.</li>
            <li> The item is roomy and holds quite a few items.</li>
            <li> have (3) small elongated plastic compartments attached to the inside of the zippered cover&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else one could ask for.  </li>

            <li> Very functional &amp; sturdy (excited)&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size for short or extended travel (excited)&lt;br /&gt;Durable inside &amp; out (excited)&lt;br /&gt;Water resistant interior (excited)&lt;br /&gt;Suede looking leatherette exterior&lt;br /&gt;Only one zippered compartment (not excited)&lt;br /&gt;Only one color available (not excited)&lt;br /&gt;Does have (3) small elongated plastic compartments attached to the inside of the zippered cover&lt;br /&gt;The item description matched the item when I received.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I&#x27;ll give the product its props and convey that it is definitely a handsome bag. Its design is terrific as well. So, if you want to sit at home and admire it, you&#x27;re all set. In contrast, my travels called for the item to actually be used. Set off on an extended trip with this item in tow and it lasted less than 60 days before the leather hanging strap on the end snapped at the rivet and the stitching on one of the two zippers came undone. As a result, I had to wrap a bungee cord around it to keep everything from falling out and really didn&#x27;t use the zippers anymore because it was easier to reach straight in through the eight inch gap in the side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this bag and in fact, it&#x27;s a much nicer material than it looks in the photographs, so I concur with the Dec 07 review from another buyer in that sense, but I also agree that it should have had more pockets and more ability to separate different items. There isn&#x27;t even a partition. Overall an excellent shaving/dop kit, but wish there was a more organized design on the inside.</li>
            <li> great gift...good quality.  good looking</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving bag as a gift for my husband when he started a new job eight years ago. I filled it with desk &#x27;essentials&#x27; (chap stick, Lysol wipes, hand sanitizer, band aids, gum, breath spray, hand lotion, twenty bucks for when he would eventually forget to bring his lunch, etc.) for him to keep in a drawer at work. Oh, and you bet your a** lunch in NYC can easily, really, and truly cost twenty friggin&#x27; bucks. Crooks. Anyway, the looped handle with double zipper to open and close it is wide enough for his hand and the zippers work freely. They don&#x27;t catch. Also, it allows for an extra wide opening to get to what you need. This bag stayed in his drawer for about five years until they moved office spaces and he brought it home. I now use it as a first aid kit that we keep in the hallway closet. It still looks fairly new after all these years.</li>
            <li> Quality product delivered quickly</li>
            <li> I love this item.  It is very well made and a good price for the value.  It is easy to zip and has a lot of room.  I recommend this product.  It is also a great case for scrapbookers to hold adhesives or creative memories oval and circle cutters.  :-)</li>
            <li> While only one pocket, it has held up very well and has suited my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a kit that provided access and took up minimal space on hotel room counters--this is IT.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been through a half dozen styles and this one is perfect. It&#x27;s already got 12 days of travel on it and there are 36 more scheduled this year--including Europe. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good quality and is very well made. Serves the purpose well.</li>
            <li> Nice color.  It&#x27;s vinyl but it has a suede texture to it. When you zip it open there is a nice large opening to access the contents inside.  For the price, I think it is an outstanding value.</li>
            <li> Like the bag a lot. Very nice bag</li>
            <li> Material somewhat cheap,.</li>
            <li> This is a quality shaving kit.  Two zippers open to a single large cargo space and slots for toothbrush in flap.</li>
            <li> The item was a lot nicer than i expected.  The fabric felt much more expensive than i thought it would be.  My only complaint was that the color was so dark it was hard to distiguish it from black.</li>
            <li> The item is roomy and holds quite a few items. As stated in other reviews it could&#x27;ve used an inside compartment. I just put items in smaller plastic bags to keep them neat. The quality of the bag is mediocre, probably won&#x27;t last for years for frequent travelers. The price is way too much for what you get, but since my last travel bag finally gave out (after 20 years LOL) I had no choice but to get a new one. This bag should not have been more than $15 tops.</li>
            <li> this is a great bag, I bought it for my boyfriend, it is very nice looking, the pictures don&#x27;t do it justice.  The material looks just like leather and it is very soft.  The zipper is well made and opens up the entire top so you can really rummage around in there.     My only problem with it is that it doesn&#x27;t have little compartments inside to hold things separate from each other.</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest ones that I have found  Thank you for the product and I would recommend this one to either man or woman.  I love it and will be using it for myself.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my father, who has had the same shaving kit for at least 35 years.  He was very happy with this as a gift.</li>
            <li> This bag is well made.  I just wish I could find it a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I had some liquid soap that leaked into the kit and I was able to just rinse it out and this still looks new. Great!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to carry my overnight items. Has room for three toothbrushes and tooth paste,  plus hair brush, electric razor, etc.</li>
            <li> I wish it was about half again as large as it is but like to look of the bag&lt;br /&gt;rustic</li>
            <li> After six months the zipper stitching unraveled, the leather strap broke off of one side, and the inside pocket for my razor separated from the cover.</li>
            <li> This shaving kit was just as it was advertised. Very nice quality and attractive, (in a manly way). I bought it for my husband for Christmas. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Husband loved it - and he is very hard to please.  He&#x27;d looked at tons of these types of things, and nothing made him happy - but this one he LOVED.  We took it sailing (8000 miles), so it did get a bit beaten up, but it still looks great, works well, zippers are like brand new - and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> better than in the picture</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a new travel kit in years. This one is the perfect replacement. Has holders in upper zipper for toothbrush, razor and other small items. Plenty of space for all my toiletries. Nice material inside and out of the kit. Highly recommend the kit.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought it would be, but my husband is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Had it for years.  It has held up very well.</li>
            <li> Great updated my old bag. It was a gift for Christmas. Great for traveling because it is soft and not hard.</li>
            <li> Just a good, well made bag that opens and closes easily.</li>
            <li> I use it for travels.  It&#x27;s clean, durable and stylish.  I&#x27;m not sure what else one could ask for.  The quality is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve had this for many years and no issues so far.</li>
            <li> I just got this so I haven&#x27;t used it or abused it so I can&#x27;t speak to its wear or long term durability. However I can say it&#x27;s the perfect size and the feel is great.  I wanted leather at first but it&#x27;s just not worth it any more.  This is perfect! love it!</li>
            <li> This is exactly as it looks. It&#x27;s a suede type feeling material on the outside. And it&#x27;s just one big pocket, no extra dividers or anything. I like and got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Nicely made - looks great for a guy</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for our son. Well made, ;looks good. It fits his on teh go lifestyle. Roomy enough for everything he needs to take with him.</li>
            <li> It was a great size, quality leather, and liked the double zipper opening. Bought for a gift, satisfied with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this to travel.  we love the way it opens all the way up with the double zippers.</li>
            <li> CONS:    1. Pointless double zipper. The strap is connected to BOTH zippers. If the bag starts filling with items and weighs a bit too much then it unzips as you grab the handle to lift it.  Pulling the strap opens the whole damn thing, so you have to be really careful to lift this bag ONLY from one side of the bag in just the right way, or else it opens. I can&#x27;t imagine this being any type of travel bag because who has time to think about holding the bag in the correct direction all the time?    2. The entire inside is one big compartment. There are no extras with this bag. I did notice some CHEAP PLASTIC SLEEVES inside the flap that perhaps refers to the extra compartments.    3. Additionally, the leather is not as nice as the pics.     This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my dad. But between the crappy leather, the plastic sleeves, and the useless double zippers that open the bag so all your stuff can fall out, this is an embarrassing and ugly gift to give to anyone.         PROS:    I returned it to Amazon.</li>
            <li> He loves it. Very nice bag&lt;br /&gt; Roomy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lot&#x27;s of these over the years and this one is the best I&#x27;ve had so far. I like how the toothbrush holder is seperate, the double zipper opens up to the entire contents so things are easy to find, and the thickness and quality of the leather is outstanding, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using this for 10 or so years. My last one lasted 10 years and this one is better quality. Highly recommend this shaving kit...</li>
            <li> Nice looking and large.  For a few bucks more get one that it monagrammed and leather.  I wasn&#x27;t blown away with the quality of the material, it&#x27;s a faux suede look.</li>
            <li> We moved from a 3 bath home in Houston to a 1 bath Apartment in Chicago.  I went from having my own bathroom to sharing one with my wife and 4 year old daughter.  Desiring a completely non-cluttered space I decided to start using a shaving kit like my stepfather who undoubtedly picked up the habit from his time in the Marines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem being, I don&#x27;t like using leather products if I don&#x27;t have to.  So, I looked for a suitable bag that fit the no leather critera.  This one looked rugged and manly with it&#x27;s bomber jacket faux leather looks and I figured I&#x27;d try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good.  I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.  It&#x27;s got enough room for all of the essentials and some plastic sleeves in the top for a razor or toothbrush.  I agree with other posters that it could do with some compartmentalization but I&#x27;m good with it regardless.  It seems pretty durable and I don&#x27;t imagine it will come apart any time in the near future.</li>
            <li> Excellent! This was a birthday gift and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase which he what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This item is large enough to hold all your daily needs. Not refering to the travel size products. This item has proven to be great for myself as a deployed soldier. I have purchased many shave kits in the past and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This kit has proven useful to replace my old ( and molding) shaving kit.  The construction is first class and it contains anything thtat I might need.</li>
            <li> My husband works 1 week on and 1 week off, out of town so he has to transport his medications and grooming items often.  Most shaving kits have too many pockets to suit his needs.  This way he can open the whole top and get to his things easily.  You just use the strap to unzip both zippers.  It&#x27;s like being able to zip back the top to a box.  Everything is right there.  He loves this kit.&lt;br /&gt;It is also nice looking and it is easy to carry by the strap.  Perfect design for someone who hates searching through a bunch of pockets.</li>
            <li> Wanted a bag I could open wide for my swim cosmetics and equipment, to dry out.  Double zipper opening is the answer.  The faux suede is absorbent, but it&#x27;s not a problem.  Handsome, rugged look.</li>
            <li> Good looking bag and is durable enough.  I fly nearly once enough so it gets plenty of wear and tear and has held up fine.  Nice the way it opens up completely opposed to the kind with a single zipper down the middle making it so you have to dig for what you want.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband for Christmas he absolutely loves it</li>
            <li> Shaving kits like this one have really been hard for me to find.  This kit is well made; very roomy and just what I needed.  The zipper looks like it will hold well which is where my last shaving kit broke down.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Just the right size-really like the material used.</li>
