            <li>Smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I have bought more and will continue to support this wonderful product and company.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want all that attention, but that&#x27;s what you get when you smell really good.</li>
            <li>I thought that this would be a good option for me because it is a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>if you like rose, this is a great perfume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;M GOOD FOR THE DAY.</li>
            <li>Awesome fragrance, quick delivery, good price.</li>
            <li>Love this.. great smell.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and would order again.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell!</li>
            <li>love this scent !</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s best to smell a perfume before buying:&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li>, it smells about 40% baby powder, 45% rose and 15% citrus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product photo is not of the Persian Rose fragrance, but that is the scent I am reviewing here.    </li>
            <li>On me, this reminds me of rose turkish delight without the powdered sugar [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Hazer Baba Turkish Delight with Rose, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)]].    </li>
            <li>My grandmother wore rose scent and this reminds me of her.</li>
            <li>and it is nice.  </li>
            <li>IF you like the scent of rose, you will like this.</li>
            <li>Just like a rose garden.</li>
            <li>Persian Rose is unlike most rose perfumes that you may have.</li>
            <li>I find It to be perfect as an office fragrance, in that it is light and fresh and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I love the [[ASIN:B004NHN0W6 Pacifica Persian Rose Body Wash]] to layer for all day longevity.</li>
            <li>I was elated to see that they carried a rose-smelling perfume and even more overjoyed after spritzing it on me and realizing that it smelled JUST LIKE a rose and</li>
            <li>This is a very light and refreshing rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you love rose, you&#x27;ll love this one.</li>
            <li>On first spray, a bright citrus note mixes with the Bulgarian rose.</li>
            <li>And most have toxins in them anyway.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day and the lingering smell is just refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>I Love love love this.</li>
            <li>and it is safe for my 3yo to wear</li>
            <li>BUT SOMETHING MORE.  </li>
            <li>i HAVE BEEN ASKED MANY TIMES</li>
            <li>THEY LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I really do love the way these fragrances smell, and am hoping that I might just be a rare case, which is why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars!</li>
            <li>Did I mention the cute little bottle that&#x27;s perfect for travel?</li>
            <li>This is available at Wholefoods, which is where I used to purchase it, but since I&#x27;ve moved to NM, the nearest outlet is two and a half hours away, so I was very happy to find it online, and at a better price.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, beautiful and natural and not overpowering like most perfumes, I would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>I love this scent...very pretty!</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a perfume that reminded me of my grandmother (who always smelled like roses) but each one I looked at weren’t cruelty free and vegan.</li>
            <li>The one issue I had is that the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t make it with a cap, which seems bizarre to me.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t change very much except for the citrus top notes burn off after about an hour</li>
            <li>love love love Pacifica, this perfume, and their entire line!</li>
            <li>This is not too sweet, not too strong and is romantic and dreamy, making the scent bright and uplifting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many positive comments from people</li>
            <li>I sometimes have mild allergic reactions to perfumes, fragrances, etc.</li>
            <li>I love their fragrances, and love that they really last all day.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly and undamaged.  </li>
            <li>THIS SCENT IS UNIVERSAL IN THAT MOST PEOPLE LOVE ROSES.</li>
            <li>If you have a choice (which... I should hope you do), get the solid for a much more natural and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who love the scent of roses.</li>
            <li>THIS perfume remained consistent in smell &amp; lasts ALL DAY &amp; NIGHT!  </li>
            <li>But this perfume is light and airy, like it came straight from the roses themselves.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remind me of hippie rose oil from the local head shop either.    </li>
            <li>You can nearly smell the roses, I do love the brand</li>
            <li>smells exactly like fresh roses</li>
            <li>So my first review was very low because of the very strong citrus scents this perfume has when first putting it on, I don&#x27;t like citrus scents so thats why it didn&#x27;t earn 4 stars.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt; Still not a very &#x27;strong&#x27; or &#x27;true&#x27; rose scent in my opinion</li>
            <li>Not bad smelling, but strong and reminiscent of a telegraph head shop.</li>
            <li>People like to travel with their favorite perfume, and while I initially bought the roll on, I found that somehow the scent wore off super fast.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a fresh rose scent but this smells like a mixture of other scents.</li>
            <li>One or two spritzes a day is more than enough!</li>
            <li>The scent is natural and light.</li>
            <li>Fragrance of real roses with a nice long staying power.</li>
            <li>On me, the top notes are other scents, but the bottom lasting note is a classic \\&quot;antique\\&quot; rose note.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this review should be taken to heart for everybody, but if you are a sensitive person looking for a mild fragrance, I would consider trying the Pacifica roll on first.</li>
            <li>The true fragrance of old garden roses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very green like tea rose, nor is it a sweet rose jelly, nor a cold bitter rose.</li>
            <li>THIS IS ROSE IN AN OBTUSE WAY,NOT THE TYPICAL TEAROSE</li>
            <li>This particular fragrance has at first a very fruity smell along with the scent of roses.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to put on too much for it to be affective</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most conventional perfumes on the market.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad thing necessarily, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear this to work.</li>
            <li>Normally perfumes don&#x27;t do that to me, but something in this perfume did not get along with my body.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same product that my Whole Foods used to sell.  </li>
            <li>I live the spray</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but not exactly what I had expected...</li>
            <li>Then it tones down to giving off the scent of roses primarily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sharp and friendly, but it fades leaving a smoky rose that mixes with dusty violets.  </li>
            <li>AS SOME PERFUMES DO, PARTICULARILY THE HEAVY OR SWEET SCENTS.  </li>
            <li>arrived in a barely padded manila envelope and no packing slip)</li>
            <li>I bought this a couple of years back at Whole Foods and I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little too strong and about half way through the day</li>
            <li>It is not super sweet like some of pacificas other scents.  </li>
            <li>and other high end perfumes and they always change on my skin and never last through the day.</li>

            <li> This item has a long lasting scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> On me it lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time...</li>
            <li> One day, I happened to walk down the “beauty” aisle in my local Sprouts and found the brand Pacifica.</li>
            <li> The fragrance stays fresh, no mustiness or becomes stale.</li>
            <li> I do not care for the other fragrances from this brand.  </li>
            <li> But the other reviewer was correct, the citrus does fade after about half hour-ish of wearing</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottle does not have a cap, and it does evaporate over time.  </li>
            <li> Not too expensive so it wouldn&#x27;t be a total waste, and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; so it might be less likely to get in your nose.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Creed ($800/bottle!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously getting this as gifts for my mom and girlfriends.</li>
            <li> fragrance, which I unfortunately could not use.</li>
            <li> Ended up just discretely putting it among my wife&#x27;s stuff instead of telling her, because it failed to impress me.  </li>
            <li> This perfume was vey strong-and had the &#x27;tinny&#x27; smell of perfumes that use artificial fragrance-a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I used this product 3 or 4 times and had to stop because it gave me a really bad headache.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed that this perfume gives me a headache/allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked!</li>

            <li> So my first review was very low because of the very strong citrus scents this perfume has when first putting it on, I don&#x27;t like citrus scents so thats why it didn&#x27;t earn 4 stars. But the other reviewer was correct, the citrus does fade after about half hour-ish of wearing it.&lt;br /&gt; Still not a very &#x27;strong&#x27; or &#x27;true&#x27; rose scent in my opinion, it smells about 40% baby powder, 45% rose and 15% citrus.&lt;br /&gt; Its enough to not bother returning, and I&#x27;ll probably wear it sometimes but I am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;(also arrived in a barely padded manila envelope and no packing slip)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent ever since I got it.  If you love rose, you&#x27;ll love this one. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on how great I smell, what is it and where can they buy it every day since I started wearing it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! smells exactly like fresh roses and it last a long time. Definitely ordering this again!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, beautiful and natural and not overpowering like most perfumes, I would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most conventional perfumes on the market.  And most have toxins in them anyway.  But this perfume is light and airy, like it came straight from the roses themselves.  Beautiful scent.  Highly recommended for those who love the scent of roses.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells just like roses and the frangrance literally lasts all day.  Perfect for spring and summer. I do not care for the other fragrances from this brand.  I think this is the strongest scent they offer.</li>
            <li> This is a very light and refreshing rose fragrance. It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t change very much except for the citrus top notes burn off after about an hour and I can then begin to smell a hint of spicy cloves. I find It to be perfect as an office fragrance, in that it is light and fresh and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The product photo is not of the Persian Rose fragrance, but that is the scent I am reviewing here.    Persian Rose is unlike most rose perfumes that you may have. It&#x27;s not very green like tea rose, nor is it a sweet rose jelly, nor a cold bitter rose. It doesn&#x27;t remind me of hippie rose oil from the local head shop either.    On first spray, a bright citrus note mixes with the Bulgarian rose. It&#x27;s very sharp and friendly, but it fades leaving a smoky rose that mixes with dusty violets.  On me, this reminds me of rose turkish delight without the powdered sugar [[ASIN:B001EQ59W8 Hazer Baba Turkish Delight with Rose, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)]].    This is not too sweet, not too strong and is romantic and dreamy, making the scent bright and uplifting.  I love the [[ASIN:B004NHN0W6 Pacifica Persian Rose Body Wash]] to layer for all day longevity.</li>
            <li> I love this scent...very pretty!</li>
            <li> Love this.. great smell. Not over powering. Last all day</li>
            <li> love this scent ! a friend referred it and now i always get lots of compliments on it when i wear it.</li>
            <li> who doesnt wanna smell like roses all day?</li>
            <li> This particular fragrance has at first a very fruity smell along with the scent of roses. Then it tones down to giving off the scent of roses primarily. It really is a wonderful scent to try. Throughout the day the smells lingers when sprayed on body and on clothes in my experience.</li>
            <li> People are actually nicer to me when I wear this fragrance, because they want to smell me. I don&#x27;t want all that attention, but that&#x27;s what you get when you smell really good. If you purchase Persian Rose, you&#x27;re gonna have to deal w/ popularity issues, lol!</li>
            <li> You can nearly smell the roses, I do love the brand but this one will not be purchase from me.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a perfume that reminded me of my grandmother (who always smelled like roses) but each one I looked at weren’t cruelty free and vegan. One day, I happened to walk down the “beauty” aisle in my local Sprouts and found the brand Pacifica. I was elated to see that they carried a rose-smelling perfume and even more overjoyed after spritzing it on me and realizing that it smelled JUST LIKE a rose and my grandmother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only perfume I wear. One or two spritzes a day is more than enough! It lasts all day and the lingering smell is just refreshing. It is also not overpowering like some flowery scents in the market. But the best thing about this product is that no animals had to suffer for our vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love Pacifica, this perfume, and their entire line! I have bought more and will continue to support this wonderful product and company.</li>
            <li> The true fragrance of old garden roses.</li>
            <li> I always smell like roses! This is available at Wholefoods, which is where I used to purchase it, but since I&#x27;ve moved to NM, the nearest outlet is two and a half hours away, so I was very happy to find it online, and at a better price.</li>
            <li> I adore this perfume.  My grandmother wore rose scent and this reminds me of her.</li>
            <li> I used this product 3 or 4 times and had to stop because it gave me a really bad headache.  Normally perfumes don&#x27;t do that to me, but something in this perfume did not get along with my body.  The smell is nice but not exactly what I had expected...it has a muskiness to it... just know my dislike overall is from the wretched, send me to bed headaches and not the actual smell.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed that this perfume gives me a headache/allergies. I sometimes have mild allergic reactions to perfumes, fragrances, etc. I thought that this would be a good option for me because it is a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product. When I tried it out at Whole Foods it didn&#x27;t bother me, but after a few uses I had to stop. It&#x27;s just a little too strong and about half way through the day I have a headache and sneezing/coughing. Before I realized that it was giving me allergies, my boyfriend bought me the &amp;#34;Lilac&amp;#34; fragrance, which I unfortunately could not use. I don&#x27;t think this review should be taken to heart for everybody, but if you are a sensitive person looking for a mild fragrance, I would consider trying the Pacifica roll on first. Not too expensive so it wouldn&#x27;t be a total waste, and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; so it might be less likely to get in your nose. I really do love the way these fragrances smell, and am hoping that I might just be a rare case, which is why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars!</li>
            <li> if you like rose, this is a great perfume.  On me, the top notes are other scents, but the bottom lasting note is a classic \\&quot;antique\\&quot; rose note.  On me it lasts all day long.  It is not super sweet like some of pacificas other scents.  Sometimes i wear it with the orange blossom perfume pacifica makes and it is nice.  My only complaint is that the bottle does not have a cap, and it does evaporate over time.  so use it often!</li>
            <li> IF you like the scent of rose, you will like this. The scent is natural and light. The product stays all day. It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance, quick delivery, good price.</li>
            <li> This item has a long lasting scent that is not overpowering. I&#x27;ve had many positive comments from people I don&#x27;t even know who like the perfume.</li>
            <li> I Love love love this. Perfume  It smells great! I live the spray and I xarry the roll-on in my bag</li>
            <li> Best quality perfume I&#x27;ve ever bought! I&#x27;m shocked! I usually buy Creed ($800/bottle!) and other high end perfumes and they always change on my skin and never last through the day. THIS perfume remained consistent in smell &amp; lasts ALL DAY &amp; NIGHT!  I&#x27;m so impressed with the price, smell, and quality! I only use 2 sprays - once on back of my neck &amp; once on my wrist (then rub them together) Did I mention the cute little bottle that&#x27;s perfect for travel? I&#x27;m seriously getting this as gifts for my mom and girlfriends. So so happy with this perfume!!!</li>
            <li> I love their fragrances, and love that they really last all day. The one issue I had is that the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t make it with a cap, which seems bizarre to me. People like to travel with their favorite perfume, and while I initially bought the roll on, I found that somehow the scent wore off super fast.</li>
            <li> This perfume was vey strong-and had the &#x27;tinny&#x27; smell of perfumes that use artificial fragrance-a disappointment. I guess it&#x27;s best to smell a perfume before buying:&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of years back at Whole Foods and I have absolutely no complaints. You don&#x27;t have to put on too much for it to be affective and it is safe for my 3yo to wear and she loves it too. The fragrance stays fresh, no mustiness or becomes stale. I even sometimes use it in the dryer as a freshener.</li>
            <li> Not a bad thing necessarily, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear this to work. I was hoping for a fresh rose scent but this smells like a mixture of other scents. Not bad smelling, but strong and reminiscent of a telegraph head shop.</li>
            <li> Great seller.  Product came quickly and undamaged.  It&#x27;s the exact same product that my Whole Foods used to sell.  This is not a knockoff.  I am very pleased and would order again.  Fragrance of real roses with a nice long staying power.</li>
            <li> THIS SCENT IS UNIVERSAL IN THAT MOST PEOPLE LOVE ROSES. THIS IS ROSE IN AN OBTUSE WAY,NOT THE TYPICAL TEAROSE BUT SOMETHING MORE.  IT DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO OFFEND PEOPLE AS SOME PERFUMES DO, PARTICULARILY THE HEAVY OR SWEET SCENTS.  EVERY MORNING I SPRAY THE NSIDE OF MY BRA AND I&#x27;M GOOD FOR THE DAY. i HAVE BEEN ASKED MANY TIMES AS TO WHAT THE SCENT IS THAT I&#x27;M WEARNG. THEY LOVE IT.  ME TOO.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!!!! Smells AMAZING! Just like a rose garden. Lasts a very long time...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife based on a friend who uses the solid version of this.  Ended up just discretely putting it among my wife&#x27;s stuff instead of telling her, because it failed to impress me.  If you have a choice (which... I should hope you do), get the solid for a much more natural and pleasant scent.</li>
