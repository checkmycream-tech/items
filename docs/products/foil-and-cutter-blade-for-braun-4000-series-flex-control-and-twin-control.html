    <ol>
            <li>Great value and works great.</li>
            <li>Great product made by panasonic.</li>
            <li>When I did realize, I contacted the vendor was told it was just as good</li>
            <li>Quite good.</li>
            <li>What more needs to be said.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t fit!</li>
            <li>The ítem was perfect but the delivery time has been long.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick with no problems.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaving is fine though, and that&#x27;s what matters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>Buy the original.</li>
            <li>It still works great as long as I can get the Foil and Cutter Blade for it.</li>
            <li>Works exactly like original parts!</li>
            <li>These cutters fit fine, but seem to tug at the hair too much.</li>
            <li>The plastic protector from the real foil won&#x27;t quite fit and clip on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I glad that Amazon.com has this, as the shaver is getting quite old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was super fast too, even across the border.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>But since the razor is getting old, I may just replace the whole unit.  </li>
            <li>I replace it every year with a new one.</li>
            <li>It does not work as well as the much more expensive foil and cutter made by the original maker.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re similar to my old ones, and can actually be attached to the head, but they don&#x27;t fit properly and seem to rub against each other, causing the shaver to gradually slow to a stop.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this shaving head because of the cost of Braun.  Bad idea!  It takes at least five passes over your beard to get a close shave and that&#x27;s with a beard softener.  Don&#x27;t short change yourself.  Buy the original.</li>
            <li> Great value and works great. I replace it every year with a new one.</li>
            <li> I glad that Amazon.com has this, as the shaver is getting quite old. It still works great as long as I can get the Foil and Cutter Blade for it. Amazon.com to the rescue!</li>
            <li> Great product made by panasonic. It&#x27;s the quality you would expect from panasonic. What more needs to be said. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works exactly like original parts!</li>
            <li> The plastic protector from the real foil won&#x27;t quite fit and clip on.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving is fine though, and that&#x27;s what matters.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was super fast too, even across the border.</li>
            <li> These cutters fit fine, but seem to tug at the hair too much. I may go with the factory cutter heads next time. But since the razor is getting old, I may just replace the whole unit.  Shipping was very quick with no problems.</li>
            <li> Works just fine. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The blade is ok, but the foil was damaged within a few uses and scratched my neck up horribly.  I didn&#x27;t realize this wasn&#x27;t an actual Braun replacement part when I ordered.  When I did realize, I contacted the vendor was told it was just as good and that he had no complaints, so I went ahead with the order.  Buyer beware...you get what you pay for in this instance!</li>
            <li> Shipped back, wrong size, my fault</li>
            <li> Quite good. The ítem was perfect but the delivery time has been long.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit! Dont&#x27; get it....</li>
            <li> I have no additional comments. No comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no additional comments. No additional comments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no additional comments</li>
            <li> In spite of what it says in the description of this product, the cutter and foil I received do not fit my Braun 4504. They&#x27;re similar to my old ones, and can actually be attached to the head, but they don&#x27;t fit properly and seem to rub against each other, causing the shaver to gradually slow to a stop. A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Item did not fit. I checked my razor&#x27;s numbers and checked item numbers multiple times before ordering and when it arrived it did not fit properly thus making it unusable.</li>
            <li> Note that this an aftermarket item. It does not work as well as the much more expensive foil and cutter made by the original maker.</li>
            <li> Installation of the cutter and foil restored my shaver&#x27;s effectiveness. Works fine-within my expectations. They arrived within the specified time.</li>
