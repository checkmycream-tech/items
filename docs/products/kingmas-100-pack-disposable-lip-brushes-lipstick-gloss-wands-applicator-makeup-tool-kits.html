            <li> Disgusting,  they turn green after a few months, had to throw them out!</li>
            <li> I use these in my professional makeup kit. The quality is great and so is the price. I love them</li>
            <li> THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT IS OKAY BUT IT TOOK ALMOST 2 MONTHS FOR THE PACKAGE TO ARRIVE.</li>
            <li> The majority of the white tips of the lipstick wands we lightly stained yellow...not sure if I&#x27;d like to use this when the tip is supposed to be white. If I were to use this on someone they would think its dirty or just super old. The overall make of the wands are good but what killed it was that they were stained.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of liquid lipstick...the type that doesn&#x27;t come off until you take it off.  I saw these and thought that using them would be an excellent way to increase the shelf life of the lipstick.  These are a great buy!!!  I also bought the thin liquid eyeliner brushes from the same company.</li>
            <li> These are great as a lipstick/gloss disposable applicator or as eye cleaning tools for a pint free alternative to Qtips.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought ? I bought these and other makeup wands and brushes when I decided q tips just weren&#x60;t enough. I wanted something that wouldn&#x60;t pull off their handle and not leave the q tip fuzzies behind. BINGO! Please check some of my other reviews for other cosmetics I ordered and used for the same purpose. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my new palette, so I don&#x27;t have to use the same brushes for the different shadows and different lipsticks.</li>
            <li> They did not look clean so I returned them.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my lip painting needs in my face painting business</li>
            <li> I use these brushes often, easy to use and disposable so I don&#x27;t have to worry about cleaning brushes between clients, just toss when used.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Only downfall, white tip wasn&#x27;t really white. A bit yellowish.</li>
            <li> Indispensable for makeup artists!</li>
            <li> The wands work fine, no breakage or detachment of the fuzzy part, helps me in my business demonstrations and my customers are impressed.</li>
