            <li>The company very honest in stating can take up to 6 months to see maximum results.  </li>

            <li>This cream is amazing!  </li>
            <li>jojoba / avocado oil are extremely good oils for aging and moisturizing skin, and rosehip oil is great for scars and discolorations.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do toobad picking this out on my own!</li>
            <li>want to say the thing that has me impressed the most is that this product has not caused a Rosacea flare up for me.  </li>
            <li>Merry even sent an email outlining how to get the most of the product, which I always find impressive for a retailer to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is one of the Best.  </li>
            <li>Loving this!</li>
            <li>did get this for a review, but my opinion is 100% honest!</li>
            <li>It also has a really pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I have found it refreshingly pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of this neck cream applied to my under-chin, neck, chest, and shoulders is really pleasant.</li>
            <li>I am using it almost 3 weeks now, and I can see pleasant change.</li>
            <li>but I gave it 5 stars for price, packaging, easy application, excellent communication with instructions and again...</li>
            <li>I bought is specifically for my neck but also use it on my face to tighten and get rid of fine lines, and it also smells great!  </li>
            <li>It felt really good</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>, I really loved the scent and the moisture it provided</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a good 2 weeks now and the results have been so good</li>
            <li>It feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li>Absolutely loved this product... for my face!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is really good stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells as good as it feels.  </li>
            <li>a good neck cream, I can afford.</li>
            <li>This is good.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel good.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal for the product, I will buy again.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look good like that.  </li>
            <li>really good cream for the neck.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as Avon&#x27;s tightening product, which I can no longer find.</li>
            <li>Has a good smell.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly I like it</li>
            <li>I thought that this was great because this company honestly took an interest in me and how the cream was working for me.</li>
            <li>The smell is fairly innocuous, unlike some firming creams that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>There is a good scent.</li>
            <li>The price  is good.  </li>
            <li>Good moisturizer, but no tightening of the neck as product claims.</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>and I’d say that my neck is still looking good.</li>
            <li>I have had really good luck with all the Body Merry products.</li>
            <li>I found something good that is cheaper than Nectufirm!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>On the good side: the scent of this cream is a combination of cocoa and flowers.</li>
            <li>Loved  it,just reordered another</li>
            <li>I loved this product and I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>I will keep using This Rich and Delicious Moisturizer as  my Night Cream that tends to make me hungry!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product at great price!</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used, so I&#x27;m very interested to learn how it will affect my skin after two months.  </li>
            <li>Great product, very light scent and hydrating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with my Age Defense Neck Cream.</li>
            <li>Great product - use about three times a week and am getting better results than when I used coconut oil.</li>
            <li>but this is an amazing product that makes your skin look so good.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and feels so great !  </li>
            <li>Most anti-aging products seem like a gimmick so we were happy this one seems to work.</li>
            <li>I have been using Strivectin products for years and was for the most part, happy with them.</li>
            <li>She is very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>win situation, for sure.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m a very satisfied paying customer.  </li>
            <li>We forget to cover it up, or to moisturize it with the best neck cream, and we rarely put sunscreen on it.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and smells good.</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness, I love this!</li>
            <li>I like it better to StriVectin!</li>
            <li>I love it !</li>

            <li>This product has so many what i call skin food in it.</li>

            <li>Smells like cucumbers &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I LOVE body merry products.</li>
            <li>what can I say love this cream</li>
            <li>The neck cream works well but better on top of the hyaluronic acid dew serum.</li>
            <li>I purchased three more bottles.</li>
            <li>do however have to say that I love the cellulite cream they make, I will continue to buy that, and I will also try the stretch marks cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for two weeks and love the difference I see.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all in the premise of &amp;#34;prevention is better than cure&amp;#34; - something to that effect.</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>After using this for several weeks, this has made a wonderful improvement.  </li>
            <li>I really love that while it&#x27;s treating my skin</li>
            <li>I feel like there may be some lifting and firming going on, but I can&#x27;t be sure yet.  </li>
            <li>Used this cream for about 3 weeks and can see visible results already, the skin on my neck has become way smoother &amp; tighter, even my chin has tightened, very happy with this cream &amp; can&#x27;t beat the price; dear women, do not miss the back of your neck when applying any cream, it&#x27;s aging as well.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I feel this product is helping, and probable with more time will increase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to return so many neck serums due&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they charged a lot more $$ than this product.  </li>
            <li>I think many of those reviews are biased in some cases.  </li>
            <li>i received a free sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>and the new easy tops on the container makes it more pleasant to use!</li>
            <li>The bottle dispenses just the right amount and the cream feels so good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>

            <li>which both calming when inhaled and good for skin, Rose which meets the plant qualification but smells amazing, or even something more food plant-like such as vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Lotion is super hydrating and smells wonderful with all the natural ingredients it includes.</li>
            <li>After your face, your neck is the next most visible part of the body, and in order to keep it looking youthful, it’s important to find the best neck cream to tighten sagging skin in the area.</li>
            <li>But it is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>This cream seems to provide what it claims &amp; is a worth while purchase!!</li>

            <li>Merry has developed a very nice moisturizer specifically for our necks - Age Defense Neck Cream.</li>
            <li>But short-term, I&#x27;d say that Body Merry has again developed a very nice product.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see more results with my continued use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy that the cream is moisturizing the area around my neck that is most noticeable.</li>
            <li>I personally have paid much more for products that don&#x27;t perform as well upon application, so the price is great in my book.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin very soft and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>This cream is not expensive but it is effective.  </li>
            <li>At first I was kind of upset</li>
            <li>They discontinued the neck cream I normally used and loved</li>
            <li>I just turned 66 years last month and look very good my age, as I am always told when folks hear my true age.</li>
            <li>Received product in a timely manner, was packaged fine.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>So instead I continued use on just my face and that was fine.</li>
            <li>Many would willingly pay any difference there might be if the glass bottle cost the seller more than plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>For men, it&#x27;s fine and not feminine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Results are seen quickly!</li>
            <li>very first sniff, I was able to discern that this product is plant-based and chemical-free.</li>
            <li>because there definitely is a scent to the cream (which I found to not be really pleasant, but it&#x27;s not awful) -- it reminds me of the smell of grass and tea -</li>
            <li>They were nice about it and said that they can&#x27;t be certain if I would have any problems and that to try a test area and see</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this product it smelled like Chocolate!</li>
            <li>Super excited!</li>
            <li>I have been using a month, and I can&#x27;t say I see a huge difference, but I plan to stick it out to see if I get results.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a HUGE difference yet, but I like the product.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this product and wants me to buy her one for her birthday( LOL)</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product and I feel that I am seeing results.  </li>
            <li>I have not been paid or offered free products for this review.</li>
            <li>I emailed them with a question on what order I should apply my products in, and they responded within an hour with detailed instructions.</li>
            <li>I like that it odor free.</li>
            <li>received a free sample in order to make an informed review</li>
            <li>feel not too greasy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have been using the serum, but the neck cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li>At the end of 2 weeks of using this product twice a day on my neck, I wrote a review that was complimentary, but after a month, gee whiz, I happened to look at my reflection in the mirror in my doctor&#x27;s ladies room; it was even better than before.</li>
            <li>In a world where creams are a dime a dozen, this neck cream actually does what is says it is going to do, at a great price.</li>
            <li>Product goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and leaves my face feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It is what I would describe as a medium thickness that feels like a light weight cream once</li>
            <li>my neck is firm and looks great!!!</li>
            <li>Seems to smooth skin, but not experiencing the firming or tightening that I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>but when I got this for free compliments of Tomoson I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I found this one from Body Merry where it was only 19.00, had great reviews</li>
            <li>This neck cream seems to be helping smooth my neck wrinkles.</li>
            <li>.....seems to smooth out the neck</li>
            <li>and if I had any questions to feel free to ask.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more economically feasible then</li>
            <li>In fact, I liked it so much that I purchased the antiage serum to use underneath it.  </li>
            <li>Works great under makeup and you need to use a makeup or moisturizer with SPF if going to be outside, since body berry neck cream doesn&#x27;t have it in it.  </li>
            <li>Shipped promptly, great communication, money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li>You can in no way win the actual competition towards period, although we can discover goods in which guide us all in the process.</li>
            <li>will continue to improve the look of my skin and keep it looking great at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;*regardless of getting this Age Defense Neck Cream for free</li>
            <li>The wrinkly appearance of turkey  neck is gone after 3 weeks and double chin is improving I am happy to say this product does work for me.</li>
            <li>As a part of a product trial through Tomoson, I got to try for free, the #BodyMerry Neck Firming and Tightening Cream , which I have also been using for over a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely a welcome addition to my wife&#x27;s daily skin regimen.</li>
            <li>It is a fabulous product</li>
            <li>For such a great price this neck firming cream is AH-MAZING.  </li>
            <li>but it attracts me to it like a moth to light</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light creamy not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li>Oh by the way, I have not received this product free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I received this free product to review.</li>
            <li>This made my neck so smooth.</li>
            <li>You can feel a light tingling sensation, and then it wears off after about five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally found a great neck cream.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a cream that will smooth the skin around your neck and jawline area, then</li>
            <li>I am not yet done using this complimentary product I received from one of my favorite skin care product manufacturer, Body Merry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this free as part of a promotion</li>
            <li>So far so good, awesomeroduct.</li>
            <li>I have not see clear resout yet but it feel good.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying it and believe it can only do good to my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Too early for long-term effects, but my early review would be excellent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good</li>
            <li>So far so good....</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>My neck looked better right away and continues to improve.  </li>
            <li>The neck cream produces firming results immediately, I saw a difference right away &amp; am looking forward to seeing even better results as time goes on.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product that is WELL worth the price!</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied with this product!!!</li>
            <li>To be completely honest my neck looks pretty good, but I like to use products like Body Merry Age Defense Neck Cream to prevent any sagging in the future.</li>
            <li>My neck is very smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li>There sure isn&#x27;t very much in the bottle.</li>
            <li>They are as effective as more expensive products, but at a much more attractive price point.</li>
            <li>Thanks Body Merry for such apparently good products at such great prices!</li>
            <li>used religiously morning and night, It does smell good and l liked that it was not greasy, it absorbs really well, which is nice specially at night if you are going straight to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The good thing is it&#x27;s not as strong as some of the other Body Merry products I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m glad that they are improving the scent.</li>
            <li>Rich and creamy but soaks in and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I was thinking of spending $60.00 on another cream, but I thought I would give this more affordable product a try first.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, my neck looks better, I use it on my hands and they definitely look better.</li>
            <li>I was getting some significant neck &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; and these are softening.</li>
            <li>I did not see a significant difference and decided to search for neck creams on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Never used any Body Berry products before and so far I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect much, despite the reviews, but I could see some difference even after the first night!  </li>
            <li>Light airy fragrance being all natural is just perfect for me, i cant wait to see a flat chin</li>
            <li>and wow, I was very impressed with how it minimized the larger lines at the edges of my mouth,</li>
            <li>It has a light scent, absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Now with further use of this amazing product I have miraculous hopes :-)</li>
            <li>And this vendor delivered quickly and hassle free.  </li>
            <li>so it’s safe to say it is safe for sensitive</li>
            <li>Although I have been using it only a week I find this cream is moisturizing and firming and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>After so many positive reviews for this product I decided to try it out myself.</li>
            <li>It makes my neck nice and soft!  </li>
            <li>So far, I love it!</li>
            <li>I am certainly going to continue to use their product and plan on ordering more.</li>
            <li>Great product , very pleased due to not being greasy like others or causing a rash either since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Most of the high ratings were those who received the product for free for an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to the seller or their future customers to say it&#x27;s a dream  </li>
            <li>come true since I just started using it....</li>
            <li>Customer Service is TOP NOTCH they really care about there customers.</li>
            <li>Don’t use too much, results will not increase with the more product you use.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this lotion, but I have been using it for about a month now and have noticed no difference in my neck.  </li>
            <li>but it takes 6-8 weeks for the full affect</li>
            <li>Although, I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin, I recently started getting the lines on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; from side sleeping.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly pleased with this neck cream as a whole.  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a problem with my neck per se, but it has become more moist and supple.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad at all...</li>
            <li>It has a lovely and rich feel to it, and if it helps to ward off more wrinkles in the future, I will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just as great as every other product I&#x27;ve used by Body Merry.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product due to the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Not too heave and absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time and the moisturizing this product delivers is great!</li>
            <li>At first it seemed like it was working, but the effects did not get better over time, it seemed to stop working after the first week.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about this product is the 90 day 100% Satisfaction Guarantee, so it is completely risk free to try the product.  </li>
            <li>and luckily it does not linger.</li>
            <li>More than pleased with initial experience.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly - item just as described.</li>
            <li>This neck cream is creamy colored with mild scent.</li>
            <li>but I love how it goes on and how smooth and soft my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t super noticeable, but it was to me</li>
            <li>after using this cream for about 7 days, I saw some tremendous results that will literally leave you speechless.</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle cream, but I try many creams in my quest to defy the appearance of age, and this is my second bottle, which means that I&#x27;m happy with the performance, and after running out of the original bottle, I noticed its absence.</li>
            <li>I should also mention that it is super creamy and has a nice subtle smell to it - kind of like cucumber, very mild.  </li>
            <li>Makes neck smooth and pretty again.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I like that very much!</li>
            <li>so I was interested in this Age Defense Neck Cream that I got for free* to try and review.</li>
            <li>I recognize the ingredients, and the smell, which is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>The new packaging is much better</li>
            <li>Works well, great moisturizer, does leave a slightly sticky texture but seems to work well.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, the product has a strong smell of cucumber, which I really didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>I am a very young looking 47 and most people guess my age at about 36.</li>
            <li>This one REALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li>The first time I applied, I noticed a tightening (and moisturizing!).  </li>
            <li>Love this cream-makes my neck so soft!</li>
            <li>My skin looks great, feels hydrated and some of those very fine lines that middle aged ladies start finding on their d&amp;eacute;colletage have been reduced.</li>
            <li>The overall texture of my skin on my neck is amazing.  </li>
            <li>That makes me happy to know as I do not want any harsh chemicals on my skin.</li>
            <li>All this make for a very different and effective cream for the neck.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>: I received a complimentary product from Body Merry to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li>However, it boasts some quality ingredients, so it is worth</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleased with all of the Body Merry products that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>So they were nice enough to send me the product to test and review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding this useful with the Retinol Surge to fade the sun damage on my neck.</li>
            <li>Love the fact it is natural as well.</li>
            <li>This cream is light it gets absorbed into her skin really fast</li>
            <li>I am waking up with fresh skin that glows.</li>
            <li>I am 41 years old and nobody guesses my age :-)</li>
            <li>Along with rosacea, I have extremely sensitive skin, yet I was able to immediately start with twice a day applications and had no reactions.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That change was nice, but not enough of an improvement that it made me feel I hadn&#x27;t overpaid for the cream.</li>
            <li>Wow, I don&#x27;t remember when I was as pleased with a product as I am with this.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This product is truly worth checking and purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The cream isn&#x27;t at all oily or sticky, it&#x27;s well absorbed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I was sent the Body Merry Age Defense Neck Cream complimentary for review purposes.</li>
            <li>It is very good at making my neckskin  look more toned and less dry.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase the Body Merry Neck Cream and plan to purchase other Body Merry products since they are all so reasonably priced and all have great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if I will buy again because there are other products out there which are just as good</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin, I&#x27;ve had skin sensitivities with lots of other items.</li>
            <li>As always, she was right.</li>
            <li>I used a bronzer on my face and legs, and I can see that I did the right things.</li>
            <li>It feels just right.  </li>
            <li>I will buy it again right away</li>
            <li>Well, this product delivered noticeable results right away.</li>
            <li>In just a month with eating right and losing weight I almost there.</li>
            <li>and I am seeing it work right away.</li>
            <li>I have tried several new serums and creams and found that this product had the most satisfying results.  </li>
            <li>Slight cucumber smell is interesting and refreshing.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great in times like this where customer service seems to be a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>There are fewer vertical lines in my neck and it generally looks more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased overall with the price and the results and highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li>as I said, I&#x27;ve only used it 6 times, but I got a discount for writing an honest (and timely) review, so I&#x27;m on here, reviewing without giving it much of a chance.  </li>
            <li>this is a wonderful company that stands behind their product, I first tried it for 6weeks and received an email from the company wanting to know how it was working, I really didnt see a difference</li>
            <li>The pump is easy to use and makes no mess.</li>
            <li>I saw this neck cream at a very reasonable price and thought that I would try.  </li>
            <li>I recommend trying this product for yourself since the price is very reasonable and it has the Satisfaction</li>
            <li>I recommend trying this product for yourself since the price is very reasonable and it has the Satisfaction</li>
            <li>so you can be sure the proper stuff is in the cream .</li>
            <li>This one works just as well, although I was concerned that I hadn&#x27;t seen any results after the first week.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results, but I love the way it feels and how it is quickly absorbed, leaving skin a bit tighter and more refreshed.</li>
            <li>But also on my face and then use my regular face lotion on top of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still too early to tell if it really works, but so far it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>Her neck and chest looked much smoother!</li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough yet to be able to tell if there is an improvement from using the product yet, but overall, great product</li>
            <li>No real smell which is nice.</li>
            <li>My neck feels a lot firmer and my double chin isn&#x27;t as prominent anymore.</li>
            <li>When I used it, it made my neck feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>it seems like there is a wax or something in it that seems to tighten the neck at first, but then stops woring for some reason.</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate it!  </li>
            <li>I am 55 years old and the neck area is an important area for me.  </li>
            <li>I was using Revision Nectifirm at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, I&#x27;ll remember to send an update ;-)</li>
            <li>If it exceeds that expectation, it will be a real deal!  </li>
            <li>Nervous that I simply wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it, and hopeful that since it is so ¨natural¨ that I would have a product that I can use without hiding for days</li>
            <li>I would also add the option of a glass bottle in lieu of plastic since so many people are eliminating plastic from their daily routines in both household supplies and product containers.  </li>

            <li>I use Hyaluronic Acid cream first then add Neck Cream.</li>
            <li>Really like this product!  </li>
            <li>Southern weather-- Better for me in the Winter.</li>
            <li>Almost done my first bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing better the last couple weeks using it 5-6 out of 7 days</li>
            <li>Using it twice a day and have come back for more.</li>
            <li>I have noticed visible improvements, which is exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li>I have been consistently using this cream and noticed some improvement.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with &#x27;slowly&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as the reviews stated.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as  I expected.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have been using it for a Month and no longer use any of my Lancôme facial product, because this product is so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you buy this neck cream, do not give up hope if you don&#x27;t see changes in the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Evidently the person in the video was an employee.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am trying this product, I don&#x27;t see any change yet  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products and this is the first one that has made any difference.</li>
            <li>Recommended to all seeking wrinkles relief and firming results - absolutely without hesitation!</li>
            <li>Of ALL of them, this one gives the most results and almost instantly.  </li>
            <li>But I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk the damages that sunlight could have caused with this cream on my skin.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning and again just now before bed.</li>
            <li>After this morning&#x27;s first application, I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>either which is a big deal to me because so many products do.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first night.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased and will continue to use daily.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid thirties and I love incorporating Anti Aging Products into my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I feel my neck soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my chin and face: the perfect substitute for expensive night creams.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Neck Cream morning and night and the skin on my neck is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>firming my neck is a monumental challenge thanks for trying!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I put it on the first night</li>
            <li>There is a bit of a funny smell with the neck cream.  </li>
            <li>I feel good that Body Merry incorporates sustainable practices, never tests on animals, and never uses harsh chemicals or added fragrance in their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long, however, it goes on smoothly and lightly.  </li>
            <li>Nice thick cream glides on easily and is not sticky.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is not full of smelly chemicals which I&#x27;m sensitive to.</li>
            <li>NOW, however, I am very pleasantly surprised that the skin looks tight and the lines in my neck from sleeping, etc., are greatly diminished and the skin appears fuller.  </li>
            <li>Nice light scent, thick cream</li>
            <li>I really love this product, I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much because I would like to use it on my entire face!</li>
            <li>It helps to neutralize the harmful free radicals that are one of the major causes of aging.</li>
            <li>The bottle has a pump and it is easy enough to use (aside from getting the product to come out at the first use).  </li>
            <li>; Anyway, the positive reviews about this product made me give it a try.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t take before/after pictures, but I believe there&#x27;s been some positive improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Positive reviews were  posted by customers pain to try product.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>love the long list of natural &amp; organic ingredients inside the pump tube (which dispenses just the right amount --- no shooting out &amp; wasting product!)</li>
            <li>I swear it&#x27;s pretty much gone now.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy the consistency of the cream with it not being too thick or heavy on the skin, and I also love the light scent that makes it suitable for men and women.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because of the online reviews I found - I needed something that worked fast and well because my daughter was getting married in about a month, so I pretty much started from ground zero with this.  </li>
            <li>So far so good only been a little more than a week</li>
            <li>I will certainly be getting more and plan to use this neck cream for a long time.  </li>
            <li>This product is great because it shows visible results the first time you use it- not staggering results, but the neck area definitely looks less crepey.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much addicted to this stuff, this company always has great</li>
            <li>I am very particular about my skin regimen and often receive compliments about my skin.</li>
            <li>All of the easily visible wrinkles and lines will start to diminish as you apply the cream on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It was a total plus that it didn&#x27;t have a strong overpowering smell and didn&#x27;t leave my neck and chest looking or feeling like a grease factory.</li>
            <li>an instant tingling (not unpleasant) and tightening feeling going on (again, not unpleasant, just feels like</li>
            <li>While CoQ10 also helps the skin by acting as a strong antioxidant.</li>
            <li>I will certainly order again.</li>
            <li>For women who may not want to &#x27;mess&#x27; with their scent (perfumes, etc.), I would say that the scent is nice, but by no means overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comparable to creams that are 3 times more expensive, and I have tried many!  </li>
            <li>My mom started using this cream too, and love it as there is a significant and dramatic difference on her neck after she religiously started using her own bottle that I bought for her.</li>
            <li>The saggy skin really gets tighten up in  a week usage and the results are very much visible .a highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>Seems to smooth fine lines and firm up the neck a bit.</li>
            <li>I will give it a little more time before I make a final judgement though :-)</li>
            <li>I enjoy pulling my hair back since the skin on my neck looks so much</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.in</li>
            <li>Non greasy and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li>It is very nourishing and moisturizing.</li>

            <li>Goes on really smooth and skin is left feeling that way.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable, 100% guarantee and it works</li>
            <li>For the price you really need to try it.</li>
            <li>Unsure if this is really helping.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working really well.</li>
            <li>My neck feels so much tighter and firmer since using.</li>
            <li>It is really off putting, however it disappears after an hour.</li>
            <li>We often pay so much attention to our faces</li>
            <li>It is a reasonable price and dispenses sparingly.</li>
            <li>Very noticeable difference</li>

            <li>and it really works for her.</li>
            <li>additional positives are that the cream is free of chemicals such as Parabens, Sulphates or Phthalates , and it isn&#x27;t tested on animals  </li>
            <li>I wake in the day, and the lines are starting to smooth out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much prefer Olay&#x27;s Regenerist.</li>
            <li>I never thought neck cream would do much</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>My husband said this really works.</li>
            <li>she uses this every night and gives it high praise!</li>
            <li>I started using it under my night time moisturizer, and it really seemed to step things up.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very earthy, I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s one of those things I don&#x27;t always notice on myself when looking straight into a mirror or in photos when I&#x27;m facing the camera.....</li>
            <li>Absolutely not - I&#x27;ll keep using it for sure-</li>
            <li>Absolutely not - I&#x27;ll keep using it for sure-</li>
            <li>This cream will easily smooth the skin tissue and rejuvenate it in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Your skin will become much tighter and your skin will start to regain its firmness.</li>
            <li>However I didnt notice much of a change will continue to use til I see results.</li>
            <li>I am currently using this product for free as a review.</li>
            <li>Every time I see myself, I can&#x27;t believe how much improved my neck and chest are.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance notes are reminiscent of a fresh salad or freshly sliced cucumber</li>
            <li>many years ago it left me with ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>She loves to try skin products but rarely finds one that really works for her, she has sensitive combination skin and has been using this product for some weeks now</li>
            <li>Mother has diligently used the neck cream for about a month, and so far she is rather pleased with the current results.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>Only been a few days but happy thus far!!</li>
            <li>This is a rich cream that actually works!</li>
            <li>Better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>while results take time, the first two weeks of application yield results which far exceeded any expectations!</li>
            <li>If you have severe turkey-neck, this product will obviously not work as well, but it is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the results of the Body Merry for my mother, and I even plan on taking a look at some of their other products for myself.</li>
            <li>this product was amazing the usual scent from body merry</li>
            <li>so I figured I&#x27;d try this since the reviews were all good not saying that the product is not good</li>
            <li>My skin definitely holds its moisture longer after using this and looks more firm and smooth.</li>
            <li>overall not a bad product.</li>
            <li>But after a couple days I started to see a difference my skin was firmer and so much softer even more toned and tight.</li>
            <li>This statement let me know that it was OK for me to use it with the Dermagist neck cream that I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li>I have great respect for a company that stands behind their product and is made in the god old USA.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;This product contains an alpha hydroxy acid that may increase your skin&#x27;s sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn.  </li>
            <li>It was just my lucky guess, since everyones skin is different.</li>
            <li>Not only is the product comparable to the bliss neck cream and serum, I feel it actually works better.</li>
            <li>She is practically 42 in addition to wanted a program this way one particular.</li>
            <li>Because as everyone knows, even if you may look many years younger than your actual age, the neck tends to betray one&#x27;s age.&lt;br</li>
            <li>an over all high rating because of how well it has worked upon initial application, and I look forward to see how it performs over the next 30-60 days since any sort of firming cream typically has even greater results over greater periods of time.  </li>

            <li>Once I realized it was doing what it was supposed to do, which was get rid of the old dead skin to uncover the smoother younger skin underneath, I really liked it!  </li>
            <li>Smells good , goes on nicely not greasy!</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>So embarrassing that I wore high collars and turtle necks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both products...</li>
            <li>I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews I got high hopes</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have to admit when I purchased this product I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream and now my friends are all going to order this too.  </li>
            <li>Had so much high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>If you keep on applying the cream first thing in the morning and before you go to sleep, you will see tremendous results in just a few days after the first time you have applied this cream.</li>
            <li>I have one particular crease on my forehead above my right eye that I have noticed improvement in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not how much improvement there can be on the neck of an old lady, but I like the feeling of the cream on my neck.  </li>
            <li>So far, this cream is working very well.</li>
            <li>So far I really like it .</li>
            <li>This one really works on mature 50+ skin.</li>
            <li>more firm, and diminishes lines as well.  </li>
            <li>More importantly it is a heavy cream that doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb, it also makes me look greasy.</li>
            <li>If I get the same level improvement every night for a week and maintain it, it will be worth the expense.  </li>
            <li>I love that the product is not tested on animals and does not contain harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I hope that my skin will firm more as I continue to use this neck cream.</li>
            <li>I will update after I use the product a few more times.</li>
            <li>Also, i must mention that it will also hydrate the skin, bring back its elasticity and make it look fresh and silky.</li>
            <li>Lovely texture and does seem to help my neck area without heavy scent</li>
            <li>When applied it does not feel sticky or oily and has a nice thick yet creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>I normally have issues with breakouts when trying new products</li>
            <li>But after using this cream in the pump container, be careful, it comes out fast, twice daily and massaging in gently for about 2 minutes Mon-Fri and 3 times on weekends, the results are really,  honestly fantastic.</li>
            <li>we forget the other important parts of our bodies.  </li>
            <li>It never hurts to try something new...</li>
            <li>Body Merry is my new indulgence.</li>
            <li>received  this cream from manufacturre for testing and review as part of the introduction of this new product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>received  this cream from manufacturre for testing and review as part of the introduction of this new product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I felt immediate results and though there is no cure for fat under chin (unless surgically removed/or the new shots they have now)</li>
            <li>This is like getting a new hairstyle and when you see yourself in the mirror, it takes you a minute.  </li>
            <li>I have religiously used so many of their products and repurchased some of their creams because they worked so well on my sensitive and perpetually problematic skin!</li>
            <li>never really thought about moisturizing my neck and haven&#x27;t noticed that my skin was aging as I am only 29, but it&#x27;s better to be proactive.</li>
            <li>The neck is my new obsession when it comes to wrinkles, I just realized that  I&#x27;m getting old and stuff is not like it used to be there!  </li>
            <li>Although I have very sensitive skin, I did not experience any problems.</li>
            <li>It has not irritated my sensitive skin, and keeps the moisture level high.</li>
            <li>They are extremely professional and go over and above to assist you with what will work right for you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shocked at how much my mother loved this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user of this brand of neck cream, eye cream and facial moisturizer</li>
            <li>I was really surprised!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually read the ingredients before pumping some out, so my first reaction was, huh...cucumber.  </li>
            <li>Recommend every other night to start; I got excited about it and used it every night</li>
            <li>Just okay, I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell to continue to use this.</li>
            <li>The neck, decolletage and back of hands is supposedly the first to show age.</li>
            <li>and I had pretty low expectations.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it has not only the necessary ingredients such as glycolic acid and the CoQ10, but has organic ingredients in it also....</li>
            <li>I am 49 and have always had a double chin thanks to genetics!</li>
            <li>so the first thing I always look for in any skin product is how my skin initially reacts to it.</li>
            <li>The first thing I notice, is that it takes about 10 pumps until you actually see the product coming out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Fragrance was not my favorite :/</li>
            <li>I was a bit startled and worried, but then I remembered that the Seller had been good enough to follow up my purchase a few days later with an email that explained how the cream worked and how to use it.</li>
            <li>Stretched out, sagging skin right under my chin.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the slight fragrance and the pump dispenser</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a fragrance I enjoy, but I don&#x27;t think it lingers around long enough to be too bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; area are smooth and less crepe.</li>
            <li>I tend to listen less to those who have been sent free product for a review</li>
            <li>I will come back and add a note at the end of the month, but so far, it looks like the real deal!</li>
            <li>and i notice my double chin taking off, becoming smaller and smaller.</li>
            <li>love using it when I&#x27;m about to go out for an extra lift, so long term effects are still up in the air, but I definitely temporary improvements.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love using it when I&#x27;m about to go out for an extra lift, so long term effects are still up in the air, but I definitely temporary improvements.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very light almost melon smell, not watery or thick.</li>
            <li>I like to rub it into my neck and chest when I dry off right after showering.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect it to turn back time, but it certainly helps to improve the appearance of my neck.</li>
            <li>Hope to get jump start on preventing the dreaded chicken neck LOL.</li>
            <li>Hopefully you can clearly see what has and has not changed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this product for a few days, I have no problems with my sensitive skin and it feels smooth.</li>
            <li>I developed a double chin that made me very self-conscious.</li>
            <li>one is professional strength so please use it with a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am a 62 year old grandmother of 10.  </li>
            <li>It does have a tea like odor to it, so those who are sensitive to smells, you may want to consider that.</li>
            <li>Like it so far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Verdict: I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready to commit to using a neck cream on the regular.</li>
            <li>So very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and I do then find it keeps my neck soft yet taught throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairy young and don&#x27;t have an aging neck.</li>
            <li>I would add an additional plant material or two to this cream to change the scent since it does have a natural plant smell instead of no smell at all.  </li>
            <li>I would add an additional plant material or two to this cream to change the scent since it does have a natural plant smell instead of no smell at all.  </li>
            <li>I am 59 yrs old with a wrinkled neck and not looking to do surgery.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen anything as far as results go yet after a month.</li>
            <li>I have oily combo skin soo far not a blemish.</li>
            <li>After using the cream for about 2 weeks I can see a marked difference in the elasticity of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I concentrated on this area and it is almost completely toned.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have young skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice the gradual change, but when I thought to look for a difference today, I noticed an obvious tightening of the skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Before using this cream, I would look at my neck in my car&#x27;s rearview mirror and be horrified at how old my neck appeared.  </li>
            <li>There are no harsh ingredients or fragrance that might irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li>Like the cream so far.</li>
            <li>It is completely odorless and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>It does not make my sensitive skin break out</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m close to 60 years old.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>This cream is a moisturizer that can be applied to the neck and chest area to firm, smooth and improve the skin.</li>
            <li>After just one application, I found that my skin felt firmer and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Ahhh, the old turkey neck.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find any harsh ingredients, chemicals, parabens, or phthalates inside, which is important to me when looking at skin care products.  </li>
            <li>The cream is based on a lot of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that can be used on sensitive skin then this will work for you.</li>
            <li>But it has helped to firm up the area, and I have noticed that my neck looks smoother and better -- and I&#x27;ve been using it for only a month!</li>
            <li>I love that this product  has no fragrances or harsh chemicals such as Parabens, Sulphates or Phthalates.</li>
            <li>Of course, one can only judge the true effectiveness of a product when used over a long period of time.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a helpful product ~ at least as good as Nectifirm and certainly not as pricey.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is light, moisturizing, slightly greasy but not so bad that it bothers me, lovely light cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>I do like the high amount of natural ingredients and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>started using the eye cream and have the same high hopes for my under eye crinkles and crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a complete fix (yet), but now I feel like the product really is working, so I plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth for hours, but is very heavy and sweaty in humid summer</li>
            <li>This is going to be part of my new daily regiment.</li>
            <li>I also like that the formula is free from harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulfates, and phthalates</li>
            <li>The cream immediately absorbed into my skin and had a slight scent of a sunscreen to it, nothing</li>
            <li>Like all our products, the formula is free from harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulfates and phthalates.</li>
            <li>all of their products, this is formulated free from harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulfates and phthalates.</li>
            <li>ItIt&#x27;s not too heavy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The consistency is thick, but is easily applied to my neck.  </li>
            <li>I returned this bottle as soon as I received it because it very clearly states on the back to avoid sunlight.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this cream has made my skin very soft and moisturized and the crepey look has definitely diminished.</li>
            <li>I guess my skin is more sensitive than I thought, because when I first tried it, instead of smoothing my skin like I had expected, it actually made it really rough for a few days...  </li>
            <li>A reaction includes burning sensation, my face and eck turn Corvette Red, is hot to touch like a fever for hours, and the following day the redness has subsided leaving what looks like acne bumps but are actually part of my Rosacea flare up.  </li>
            <li>Have I seen any major improvements?</li>
            <li>For the first two weeks or so, the only change I noticed was that the skin on my neck wasn&#x27;t as dry as it had been.</li>
            <li>It is not strong and does fade fairly quickly</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell a difference that my skin feels more moisturized, instead of feeling tight and rough.  </li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>I do not see any firming thus far, but I am also 67 years old and haven&#x27;t used the product that long.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a definite firming action going on.</li>
            <li>early Mother&#x27;s Day present,</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old and will definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33 years old and over the last year I have noticed the beginnings of a waddle neck.  </li>
            <li>With one pump, this cream should last you for a month or two and it is at such a reasonable price that there is no reason that you should not continue to use it for youthful looking skin as you enter into the future.</li>
            <li>As a result to that, everyone can use this cream, even people who have sensitive skin that is prone to blackheads, acne and red blemishes.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I followed the directions and only use it once a day.</li>
            <li>It is also supported by powerful natural and organic ingredients such as Plant Derived Hyaluronic Acid, Propolis, Royal Jelly, Cocoa Butter, Jojoba Oil, Green Tea, Avocado Oil, Licorice, Lemongrass and Rosehip Oil, to name just a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Sagging appears not to have gotten worse but doesn&#x27;t quite seem noticeably better.</li>
            <li>It goes on light but its a thick cream.</li>
            <li>but the skin has a much more firm look and they are less noticeable after using this for one month.</li>
            <li>I have definitely seen a slight improvement in the contour of my jawline and possibly a slight improvement in the firmness of my neck, it appears a bit more toned.</li>
            <li>I think I am about half way through the bottle because it&#x27;s pretty concentrated.</li>
            <li>I have used other neck firming and tightening creams in the past and am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>The loose, turkey skin on my neck is my least favorite part of aging...</li>
            <li>I will absolutely order it again and will be looking for other products from them</li>
            <li>product hasn’t done much to change my skin, other than moisturizing it well.</li>
            <li>and I am finding that my neck is looking a little more firm.  </li>
            <li>I am 65 years old and nothing short of cosmetic surgery can bring back the hands of time.  </li>
            <li>However, I did break out a little the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I got this for my mom as she has been starting to see sagging in her skin and after a week of use she started to notice a major difference.  </li>
            <li>So then I started &amp;#34;bothering&amp;#34; to put on makeup which led to dressing a little better and you know how you feel when people who have not seen you in a few years actually are startled and say &amp;</li>
            <li>The first morning after applying the previous night,  my skin looked NOTICEABLY younger on my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage areas!  </li>
            <li>My skin feels moisturized yet doesn&#x27;t appear super shiny like it did after applying different firming cream in the past.  </li>
            <li>Oh I had been cheating and simply using a general lotion on my neck..</li>
            <li>I use it at least every other day and love the way it penetrates and fills in the lines in my neck.</li>
            <li>No strange side effects on skin or breakouts either.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for a few weeks and the sagging skin is pretty much gone, along with the lines on my neck being less visible.  </li>
            <li>I find that as long as I am completely dry where I am putting it that it absorbs into my skin, not leaving any kind of film behind.</li>
            <li>and I can tell it really helps to shape the skin under my neck and make it feel less</li>
            <li>The texture is thick and creamy but does quickly absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li>Since I had spent so much on the Dermagist cream, I could not waste it and decided to use both neck creams together, especially since I found the Body Merry cream slight drier that the Dermagist cream.</li>
            <li>This is important as I really dislike lotions and creams that leave a dirty or greasy</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I gave this a try!!</li>
            <li> The company very honest in stating can take up to 6 months to see maximum results.  </li>

            <li> This is an amazing product!</li>

            <li> amazing!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing!  </li>
            <li> jojoba / avocado oil are extremely good oils for aging and moisturizing skin, and rosehip oil is great for scars and discolorations.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do toobad picking this out on my own!</li>
            <li> want to say the thing that has me impressed the most is that this product has not caused a Rosacea flare up for me.  </li>
            <li> Merry even sent an email outlining how to get the most of the product, which I always find impressive for a retailer to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is one of the Best.  </li>
            <li> Loving this!</li>
            <li> did get this for a review, but my opinion is 100% honest!</li>
            <li> It also has a really pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I have found it refreshingly pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of this neck cream applied to my under-chin, neck, chest, and shoulders is really pleasant.</li>
            <li> I am using it almost 3 weeks now, and I can see pleasant change.</li>
            <li> but I gave it 5 stars for price, packaging, easy application, excellent communication with instructions and again...</li>
            <li> I bought is specifically for my neck but also use it on my face to tighten and get rid of fine lines, and it also smells great!  </li>
            <li> It felt really good</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> , I really loved the scent and the moisture it provided</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a good 2 weeks now and the results have been so good</li>
            <li> It feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this product... for my face!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells as good as it feels.  </li>
            <li> a good neck cream, I can afford.</li>
            <li> This is good.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal for the product, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look good like that.  </li>
            <li> really good cream for the neck.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as Avon&#x27;s tightening product, which I can no longer find.</li>
            <li> Has a good smell.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly I like it</li>
            <li> I thought that this was great because this company honestly took an interest in me and how the cream was working for me.</li>
            <li> The smell is fairly innocuous, unlike some firming creams that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> There is a good scent.</li>
            <li> The price  is good.  </li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, but no tightening of the neck as product claims.</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> and I’d say that my neck is still looking good.</li>
            <li> I have had really good luck with all the Body Merry products.</li>
            <li> I found something good that is cheaper than Nectufirm!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> On the good side: the scent of this cream is a combination of cocoa and flowers.</li>
            <li> Loved  it,just reordered another</li>
            <li> I loved this product and I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I will keep using This Rich and Delicious Moisturizer as  my Night Cream that tends to make me hungry!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product at great price!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used, so I&#x27;m very interested to learn how it will affect my skin after two months.  </li>
            <li> Great product, very light scent and hydrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with my Age Defense Neck Cream.</li>
            <li> Great product - use about three times a week and am getting better results than when I used coconut oil.</li>
            <li> but this is an amazing product that makes your skin look so good.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and feels so great !  </li>
            <li> Most anti-aging products seem like a gimmick so we were happy this one seems to work.</li>
            <li> I have been using Strivectin products for years and was for the most part, happy with them.</li>
            <li> She is very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> win situation, for sure.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a very satisfied paying customer.  </li>
            <li> We forget to cover it up, or to moisturize it with the best neck cream, and we rarely put sunscreen on it.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and smells good.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, I love this!</li>
            <li> I like it better to StriVectin!</li>
            <li> I love it !</li>
            <li> This neck cream performs better than Strivectin!  </li>
            <li> and I love the results!</li>

            <li> Opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li> I think it can be just as effective to use a face moisturizer and apply that to your neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; as part of your beauty routine.  </li>
            <li> This item really works and the delivery was excellent.</li>

            <li> It will take more use to see more results.  </li>
            <li> Smells like cucumbers &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I LOVE body merry products.</li>
            <li> what can I say love this cream</li>
            <li> The neck cream works well but better on top of the hyaluronic acid dew serum.</li>
            <li> I purchased three more bottles.</li>
            <li> do however have to say that I love the cellulite cream they make, I will continue to buy that, and I will also try the stretch marks cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two weeks and love the difference I see.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all in the premise of &amp;#34;prevention is better than cure&amp;#34; - something to that effect.</li>
            <li> Will buy more.</li>
            <li> After using this for several weeks, this has made a wonderful improvement.  </li>
            <li> I really love that while it&#x27;s treating my skin</li>
            <li> I feel like there may be some lifting and firming going on, but I can&#x27;t be sure yet.  </li>
            <li> Used this cream for about 3 weeks and can see visible results already, the skin on my neck has become way smoother &amp; tighter, even my chin has tightened, very happy with this cream &amp; can&#x27;t beat the price; dear women, do not miss the back of your neck when applying any cream, it&#x27;s aging as well.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I feel this product is helping, and probable with more time will increase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to return so many neck serums due&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they charged a lot more $$ than this product.  </li>
            <li> I think many of those reviews are biased in some cases.  </li>
            <li> i received a free sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> and the new easy tops on the container makes it more pleasant to use!</li>
            <li> The bottle dispenses just the right amount and the cream feels so good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>

            <li> which both calming when inhaled and good for skin, Rose which meets the plant qualification but smells amazing, or even something more food plant-like such as vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Lotion is super hydrating and smells wonderful with all the natural ingredients it includes.</li>
            <li> After your face, your neck is the next most visible part of the body, and in order to keep it looking youthful, it’s important to find the best neck cream to tighten sagging skin in the area.</li>
            <li> But it is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> This cream seems to provide what it claims &amp; is a worth while purchase!!</li>
            <li> I am beyond excited that this worked for me!</li>
            <li> The consistency of the cream is really nice and it quickly absorbs into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastic love this product</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy so far, hopefully it will keep improving my skin.</li>

            <li> Merry has developed a very nice moisturizer specifically for our necks - Age Defense Neck Cream.</li>
            <li> But short-term, I&#x27;d say that Body Merry has again developed a very nice product.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see more results with my continued use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy that the cream is moisturizing the area around my neck that is most noticeable.</li>
            <li> I personally have paid much more for products that don&#x27;t perform as well upon application, so the price is great in my book.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin very soft and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This cream is not expensive but it is effective.  </li>
            <li> At first I was kind of upset</li>
            <li> They discontinued the neck cream I normally used and loved</li>
            <li> I just turned 66 years last month and look very good my age, as I am always told when folks hear my true age.</li>
            <li> Received product in a timely manner, was packaged fine.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> So instead I continued use on just my face and that was fine.</li>
            <li> Many would willingly pay any difference there might be if the glass bottle cost the seller more than plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many would willingly pay any difference there might be if the glass bottle cost the seller more than plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For men, it&#x27;s fine and not feminine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Results are seen quickly!</li>
            <li> very first sniff, I was able to discern that this product is plant-based and chemical-free.</li>
            <li> because there definitely is a scent to the cream (which I found to not be really pleasant, but it&#x27;s not awful) -- it reminds me of the smell of grass and tea -</li>
            <li> They were nice about it and said that they can&#x27;t be certain if I would have any problems and that to try a test area and see</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this product it smelled like Chocolate!</li>
            <li> Super excited!</li>
            <li> I have been using a month, and I can&#x27;t say I see a huge difference, but I plan to stick it out to see if I get results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a HUGE difference yet, but I like the product.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this product and wants me to buy her one for her birthday( LOL)</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and I feel that I am seeing results.  </li>
            <li> I have not been paid or offered free products for this review.</li>
            <li> I emailed them with a question on what order I should apply my products in, and they responded within an hour with detailed instructions.</li>
            <li> I like that it odor free.</li>
            <li> received a free sample in order to make an informed review</li>
            <li> feel not too greasy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum, but the neck cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li> At the end of 2 weeks of using this product twice a day on my neck, I wrote a review that was complimentary, but after a month, gee whiz, I happened to look at my reflection in the mirror in my doctor&#x27;s ladies room; it was even better than before.</li>
            <li> In a world where creams are a dime a dozen, this neck cream actually does what is says it is going to do, at a great price.</li>
            <li> Product goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and leaves my face feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li> It is what I would describe as a medium thickness that feels like a light weight cream once</li>
            <li> my neck is firm and looks great!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to smooth skin, but not experiencing the firming or tightening that I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> but when I got this for free compliments of Tomoson I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I found this one from Body Merry where it was only 19.00, had great reviews</li>
            <li> This neck cream seems to be helping smooth my neck wrinkles.</li>
            <li> .....seems to smooth out the neck</li>
            <li> and if I had any questions to feel free to ask.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more economically feasible then</li>
            <li> In fact, I liked it so much that I purchased the antiage serum to use underneath it.  </li>
            <li> Works great under makeup and you need to use a makeup or moisturizer with SPF if going to be outside, since body berry neck cream doesn&#x27;t have it in it.  </li>
            <li> Shipped promptly, great communication, money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li> You can in no way win the actual competition towards period, although we can discover goods in which guide us all in the process.</li>
            <li> will continue to improve the look of my skin and keep it looking great at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;*regardless of getting this Age Defense Neck Cream for free</li>
            <li> The wrinkly appearance of turkey  neck is gone after 3 weeks and double chin is improving I am happy to say this product does work for me.</li>
            <li> As a part of a product trial through Tomoson, I got to try for free, the #BodyMerry Neck Firming and Tightening Cream , which I have also been using for over a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely a welcome addition to my wife&#x27;s daily skin regimen.</li>
            <li> It is a fabulous product</li>
            <li> For such a great price this neck firming cream is AH-MAZING.  </li>
            <li> but it attracts me to it like a moth to light</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s light creamy not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li> Oh by the way, I have not received this product free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I received this free product to review.</li>
            <li> This made my neck so smooth.</li>
            <li> You can feel a light tingling sensation, and then it wears off after about five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally found a great neck cream.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a cream that will smooth the skin around your neck and jawline area, then</li>
            <li> I am not yet done using this complimentary product I received from one of my favorite skin care product manufacturer, Body Merry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this free as part of a promotion</li>
            <li> So far so good, awesomeroduct.</li>
            <li> I have not see clear resout yet but it feel good.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying it and believe it can only do good to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Too early for long-term effects, but my early review would be excellent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good</li>
            <li> So far so good....</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> My neck looked better right away and continues to improve.  </li>
            <li> The neck cream produces firming results immediately, I saw a difference right away &amp; am looking forward to seeing even better results as time goes on.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great product that is WELL worth the price!</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied with this product!!!</li>
            <li> To be completely honest my neck looks pretty good, but I like to use products like Body Merry Age Defense Neck Cream to prevent any sagging in the future.</li>
            <li> My neck is very smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li> There sure isn&#x27;t very much in the bottle.</li>
            <li> They are as effective as more expensive products, but at a much more attractive price point.</li>
            <li> Thanks Body Merry for such apparently good products at such great prices!</li>
            <li> used religiously morning and night, It does smell good and l liked that it was not greasy, it absorbs really well, which is nice specially at night if you are going straight to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The good thing is it&#x27;s not as strong as some of the other Body Merry products I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m glad that they are improving the scent.</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy but soaks in and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of spending $60.00 on another cream, but I thought I would give this more affordable product a try first.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, my neck looks better, I use it on my hands and they definitely look better.</li>
            <li> I was getting some significant neck &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; and these are softening.</li>
            <li> I did not see a significant difference and decided to search for neck creams on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Never used any Body Berry products before and so far I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect much, despite the reviews, but I could see some difference even after the first night!  </li>
            <li> Light airy fragrance being all natural is just perfect for me, i cant wait to see a flat chin</li>
            <li> and wow, I was very impressed with how it minimized the larger lines at the edges of my mouth,</li>
            <li> It has a light scent, absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Now with further use of this amazing product I have miraculous hopes :-)</li>
            <li> And this vendor delivered quickly and hassle free.  </li>
            <li> so it’s safe to say it is safe for sensitive</li>
            <li> Although I have been using it only a week I find this cream is moisturizing and firming and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> After so many positive reviews for this product I decided to try it out myself.</li>
            <li> It makes my neck nice and soft!  </li>
            <li> So far, I love it!</li>
            <li> I am certainly going to continue to use their product and plan on ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great product , very pleased due to not being greasy like others or causing a rash either since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Most of the high ratings were those who received the product for free for an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to the seller or their future customers to say it&#x27;s a dream  </li>
            <li> come true since I just started using it....</li>
            <li> Customer Service is TOP NOTCH they really care about there customers.</li>
            <li> Don’t use too much, results will not increase with the more product you use.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this lotion, but I have been using it for about a month now and have noticed no difference in my neck.  </li>
            <li> but it takes 6-8 weeks for the full affect</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin, I recently started getting the lines on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; from side sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly pleased with this neck cream as a whole.  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a problem with my neck per se, but it has become more moist and supple.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad at all...</li>
            <li> It has a lovely and rich feel to it, and if it helps to ward off more wrinkles in the future, I will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just as great as every other product I&#x27;ve used by Body Merry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Not too heave and absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time and the moisturizing this product delivers is great!</li>
            <li> At first it seemed like it was working, but the effects did not get better over time, it seemed to stop working after the first week.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite things about this product is the 90 day 100% Satisfaction Guarantee, so it is completely risk free to try the product.  </li>
            <li> and luckily it does not linger.</li>
            <li> More than pleased with initial experience.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly - item just as described.</li>
            <li> This neck cream is creamy colored with mild scent.</li>
            <li> but I love how it goes on and how smooth and soft my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t super noticeable, but it was to me</li>
            <li> after using this cream for about 7 days, I saw some tremendous results that will literally leave you speechless.</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle cream, but I try many creams in my quest to defy the appearance of age, and this is my second bottle, which means that I&#x27;m happy with the performance, and after running out of the original bottle, I noticed its absence.</li>
            <li> I should also mention that it is super creamy and has a nice subtle smell to it - kind of like cucumber, very mild.  </li>
            <li> Makes neck smooth and pretty again.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I like that very much!</li>
            <li> so I was interested in this Age Defense Neck Cream that I got for free* to try and review.</li>
            <li> I recognize the ingredients, and the smell, which is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The new packaging is much better</li>
            <li> Works well, great moisturizer, does leave a slightly sticky texture but seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the product has a strong smell of cucumber, which I really didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> I am a very young looking 47 and most people guess my age at about 36.</li>
            <li> This one REALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li> The first time I applied, I noticed a tightening (and moisturizing!).  </li>
            <li> Love this cream-makes my neck so soft!</li>
            <li> My skin looks great, feels hydrated and some of those very fine lines that middle aged ladies start finding on their d&amp;eacute;colletage have been reduced.</li>
            <li> The overall texture of my skin on my neck is amazing.  </li>
            <li> That makes me happy to know as I do not want any harsh chemicals on my skin.</li>
            <li> All this make for a very different and effective cream for the neck.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> : I received a complimentary product from Body Merry to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li> However, it boasts some quality ingredients, so it is worth</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with all of the Body Merry products that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> So they were nice enough to send me the product to test and review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding this useful with the Retinol Surge to fade the sun damage on my neck.</li>
            <li> Love the fact it is natural as well.</li>
            <li> This cream is light it gets absorbed into her skin really fast</li>
            <li> I am waking up with fresh skin that glows.</li>
            <li> I am 41 years old and nobody guesses my age :-)</li>
            <li> Along with rosacea, I have extremely sensitive skin, yet I was able to immediately start with twice a day applications and had no reactions.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That change was nice, but not enough of an improvement that it made me feel I hadn&#x27;t overpaid for the cream.</li>
            <li> Wow, I don&#x27;t remember when I was as pleased with a product as I am with this.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product is truly worth checking and purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cream isn&#x27;t at all oily or sticky, it&#x27;s well absorbed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure: I was sent the Body Merry Age Defense Neck Cream complimentary for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It is very good at making my neckskin  look more toned and less dry.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase the Body Merry Neck Cream and plan to purchase other Body Merry products since they are all so reasonably priced and all have great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I will buy again because there are other products out there which are just as good</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin, I&#x27;ve had skin sensitivities with lots of other items.</li>
            <li> As always, she was right.</li>
            <li> I used a bronzer on my face and legs, and I can see that I did the right things.</li>
            <li> It feels just right.  </li>
            <li> I will buy it again right away</li>
            <li> Well, this product delivered noticeable results right away.</li>
            <li> In just a month with eating right and losing weight I almost there.</li>
            <li> and I am seeing it work right away.</li>
            <li> I have tried several new serums and creams and found that this product had the most satisfying results.  </li>
            <li> Slight cucumber smell is interesting and refreshing.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great in times like this where customer service seems to be a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> There are fewer vertical lines in my neck and it generally looks more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased overall with the price and the results and highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li> as I said, I&#x27;ve only used it 6 times, but I got a discount for writing an honest (and timely) review, so I&#x27;m on here, reviewing without giving it much of a chance.  </li>
            <li> this is a wonderful company that stands behind their product, I first tried it for 6weeks and received an email from the company wanting to know how it was working, I really didnt see a difference</li>
            <li> The pump is easy to use and makes no mess.</li>
            <li> I saw this neck cream at a very reasonable price and thought that I would try.  </li>
            <li> I recommend trying this product for yourself since the price is very reasonable and it has the Satisfaction</li>
            <li> I recommend trying this product for yourself since the price is very reasonable and it has the Satisfaction</li>
            <li> so you can be sure the proper stuff is in the cream .</li>
            <li> This one works just as well, although I was concerned that I hadn&#x27;t seen any results after the first week.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results, but I love the way it feels and how it is quickly absorbed, leaving skin a bit tighter and more refreshed.</li>
            <li> But also on my face and then use my regular face lotion on top of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still too early to tell if it really works, but so far it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Her neck and chest looked much smoother!</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough yet to be able to tell if there is an improvement from using the product yet, but overall, great product</li>
            <li> No real smell which is nice.</li>
            <li> My neck feels a lot firmer and my double chin isn&#x27;t as prominent anymore.</li>
            <li> When I used it, it made my neck feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> it seems like there is a wax or something in it that seems to tighten the neck at first, but then stops woring for some reason.</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate it!  </li>
            <li> I am 55 years old and the neck area is an important area for me.  </li>
            <li> I was using Revision Nectifirm at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, I&#x27;ll remember to send an update ;-)</li>
            <li> If it exceeds that expectation, it will be a real deal!  </li>
            <li> Nervous that I simply wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it, and hopeful that since it is so ¨natural¨ that I would have a product that I can use without hiding for days</li>
            <li> I would also add the option of a glass bottle in lieu of plastic since so many people are eliminating plastic from their daily routines in both household supplies and product containers.  </li>

            <li> I use Hyaluronic Acid cream first then add Neck Cream.</li>
            <li> Really like this product!  </li>
            <li> Southern weather-- Better for me in the Winter.</li>
            <li> Almost done my first bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing better the last couple weeks using it 5-6 out of 7 days</li>
            <li> Using it twice a day and have come back for more.</li>
            <li> I have noticed visible improvements, which is exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> I have been consistently using this cream and noticed some improvement.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with &#x27;slowly&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as the reviews stated.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as  I expected.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it for a Month and no longer use any of my Lancôme facial product, because this product is so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you buy this neck cream, do not give up hope if you don&#x27;t see changes in the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Evidently the person in the video was an employee.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am trying this product, I don&#x27;t see any change yet  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products and this is the first one that has made any difference.</li>
            <li> Recommended to all seeking wrinkles relief and firming results - absolutely without hesitation!</li>
            <li> Of ALL of them, this one gives the most results and almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> But I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk the damages that sunlight could have caused with this cream on my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning and again just now before bed.</li>
            <li> After this morning&#x27;s first application, I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> either which is a big deal to me because so many products do.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first night.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased and will continue to use daily.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid thirties and I love incorporating Anti Aging Products into my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I feel my neck soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my chin and face: the perfect substitute for expensive night creams.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Neck Cream morning and night and the skin on my neck is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> firming my neck is a monumental challenge thanks for trying!</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I put it on the first night</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a funny smell with the neck cream.  </li>
            <li> I feel good that Body Merry incorporates sustainable practices, never tests on animals, and never uses harsh chemicals or added fragrance in their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long, however, it goes on smoothly and lightly.  </li>
            <li> Nice thick cream glides on easily and is not sticky.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is not full of smelly chemicals which I&#x27;m sensitive to.</li>
            <li> NOW, however, I am very pleasantly surprised that the skin looks tight and the lines in my neck from sleeping, etc., are greatly diminished and the skin appears fuller.  </li>
            <li> Nice light scent, thick cream</li>
            <li> I really love this product, I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much because I would like to use it on my entire face!</li>
            <li> It helps to neutralize the harmful free radicals that are one of the major causes of aging.</li>
            <li> The bottle has a pump and it is easy enough to use (aside from getting the product to come out at the first use).  </li>
            <li> ; Anyway, the positive reviews about this product made me give it a try.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t take before/after pictures, but I believe there&#x27;s been some positive improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Positive reviews were  posted by customers pain to try product.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> love the long list of natural &amp; organic ingredients inside the pump tube (which dispenses just the right amount --- no shooting out &amp; wasting product!)</li>
            <li> I swear it&#x27;s pretty much gone now.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy the consistency of the cream with it not being too thick or heavy on the skin, and I also love the light scent that makes it suitable for men and women.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because of the online reviews I found - I needed something that worked fast and well because my daughter was getting married in about a month, so I pretty much started from ground zero with this.  </li>
            <li> So far so good only been a little more than a week</li>
            <li> I will certainly be getting more and plan to use this neck cream for a long time.  </li>
            <li> This product is great because it shows visible results the first time you use it- not staggering results, but the neck area definitely looks less crepey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much addicted to this stuff, this company always has great</li>
            <li> I am very particular about my skin regimen and often receive compliments about my skin.</li>
            <li> All of the easily visible wrinkles and lines will start to diminish as you apply the cream on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It was a total plus that it didn&#x27;t have a strong overpowering smell and didn&#x27;t leave my neck and chest looking or feeling like a grease factory.</li>
            <li> an instant tingling (not unpleasant) and tightening feeling going on (again, not unpleasant, just feels like</li>
            <li> While CoQ10 also helps the skin by acting as a strong antioxidant.</li>
            <li> I will certainly order again.</li>
            <li> For women who may not want to &#x27;mess&#x27; with their scent (perfumes, etc.), I would say that the scent is nice, but by no means overpowering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comparable to creams that are 3 times more expensive, and I have tried many!  </li>
            <li> My mom started using this cream too, and love it as there is a significant and dramatic difference on her neck after she religiously started using her own bottle that I bought for her.</li>
            <li> The saggy skin really gets tighten up in  a week usage and the results are very much visible .a highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> Seems to smooth fine lines and firm up the neck a bit.</li>
            <li> I will give it a little more time before I make a final judgement though :-)</li>
            <li> I enjoy pulling my hair back since the skin on my neck looks so much</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.in</li>
            <li> Non greasy and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li> It is very nourishing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very firming.</li>
            <li> Really made a difference.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> Goes on really smooth and skin is left feeling that way.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable, 100% guarantee and it works</li>
            <li> For the price you really need to try it.</li>
            <li> Unsure if this is really helping.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working really well.</li>
            <li> My neck feels so much tighter and firmer since using.</li>
            <li> It is really off putting, however it disappears after an hour.</li>
            <li> We often pay so much attention to our faces</li>
            <li> It is a reasonable price and dispenses sparingly.</li>
            <li> Very noticeable difference</li>
            <li> Thank you for keeping these products at a reasonable price point so everyone can benefit.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews more carefully.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I really dislike the smell, though.</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> My neck looks tighter and smoother and doesn&#x27;t crinkle up as much.  </li>
            <li> and it really works for her.</li>
            <li> additional positives are that the cream is free of chemicals such as Parabens, Sulphates or Phthalates , and it isn&#x27;t tested on animals  </li>
            <li> I wake in the day, and the lines are starting to smooth out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much prefer Olay&#x27;s Regenerist.</li>
            <li> I never thought neck cream would do much</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> My husband said this really works.</li>
            <li> she uses this every night and gives it high praise!</li>
            <li> I started using it under my night time moisturizer, and it really seemed to step things up.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very earthy, I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> which is when I really noticed the improvement.</li>
            <li> delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> My age really shows on my neck and chest area, 60.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like it, not working.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like some lotions so.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her neck is much softer, as well as smoother.</li>
            <li> I apply it every night and it has really improved how it looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> I bought the neck firming cream, but it really did not do anything.</li>
            <li> I really like the body merry skin care line.</li>
            <li> See result fast.</li>
            <li> I also like the reasonable price.  </li>

            <li> Absolutely not - I&#x27;ll keep using it for sure-</li>
            <li> Absolutely not - I&#x27;ll keep using it for sure-</li>
            <li> This cream will easily smooth the skin tissue and rejuvenate it in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Your skin will become much tighter and your skin will start to regain its firmness.</li>
            <li> However I didnt notice much of a change will continue to use til I see results.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this product for free as a review.</li>
            <li> Every time I see myself, I can&#x27;t believe how much improved my neck and chest are.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance notes are reminiscent of a fresh salad or freshly sliced cucumber</li>
            <li> many years ago it left me with ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> She loves to try skin products but rarely finds one that really works for her, she has sensitive combination skin and has been using this product for some weeks now</li>
            <li> Mother has diligently used the neck cream for about a month, and so far she is rather pleased with the current results.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> Only been a few days but happy thus far!!</li>
            <li> This is a rich cream that actually works!</li>
            <li> Better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> while results take time, the first two weeks of application yield results which far exceeded any expectations!</li>
            <li> If you have severe turkey-neck, this product will obviously not work as well, but it is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results of the Body Merry for my mother, and I even plan on taking a look at some of their other products for myself.</li>
            <li> this product was amazing the usual scent from body merry</li>
            <li> so I figured I&#x27;d try this since the reviews were all good not saying that the product is not good</li>
            <li> My skin definitely holds its moisture longer after using this and looks more firm and smooth.</li>
            <li> overall not a bad product.</li>
            <li> But after a couple days I started to see a difference my skin was firmer and so much softer even more toned and tight.</li>
            <li> This statement let me know that it was OK for me to use it with the Dermagist neck cream that I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li> I have great respect for a company that stands behind their product and is made in the god old USA.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;This product contains an alpha hydroxy acid that may increase your skin&#x27;s sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn.  </li>
            <li> It was just my lucky guess, since everyones skin is different.</li>
            <li> Not only is the product comparable to the bliss neck cream and serum, I feel it actually works better.</li>
            <li> She is practically 42 in addition to wanted a program this way one particular.</li>
            <li> Because as everyone knows, even if you may look many years younger than your actual age, the neck tends to betray one&#x27;s age.&lt;br</li>
            <li> an over all high rating because of how well it has worked upon initial application, and I look forward to see how it performs over the next 30-60 days since any sort of firming cream typically has even greater results over greater periods of time.  </li>

            <li> Once I realized it was doing what it was supposed to do, which was get rid of the old dead skin to uncover the smoother younger skin underneath, I really liked it!  </li>
            <li> Smells good , goes on nicely not greasy!</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> So embarrassing that I wore high collars and turtle necks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both products...</li>
            <li> I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews I got high hopes</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have to admit when I purchased this product I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream and now my friends are all going to order this too.  </li>
            <li> Had so much high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> If you keep on applying the cream first thing in the morning and before you go to sleep, you will see tremendous results in just a few days after the first time you have applied this cream.</li>
            <li> I have one particular crease on my forehead above my right eye that I have noticed improvement in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not how much improvement there can be on the neck of an old lady, but I like the feeling of the cream on my neck.  </li>
            <li> So far, this cream is working very well.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it .</li>
            <li> This one really works on mature 50+ skin.</li>
            <li> more firm, and diminishes lines as well.  </li>
            <li> More importantly it is a heavy cream that doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb, it also makes me look greasy.</li>
            <li> If I get the same level improvement every night for a week and maintain it, it will be worth the expense.  </li>
            <li> I love that the product is not tested on animals and does not contain harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I hope that my skin will firm more as I continue to use this neck cream.</li>
            <li> I will update after I use the product a few more times.</li>
            <li> Also, i must mention that it will also hydrate the skin, bring back its elasticity and make it look fresh and silky.</li>
            <li> Lovely texture and does seem to help my neck area without heavy scent</li>
            <li> When applied it does not feel sticky or oily and has a nice thick yet creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> I normally have issues with breakouts when trying new products</li>
            <li> But after using this cream in the pump container, be careful, it comes out fast, twice daily and massaging in gently for about 2 minutes Mon-Fri and 3 times on weekends, the results are really,  honestly fantastic.</li>
            <li> we forget the other important parts of our bodies.  </li>
            <li> It never hurts to try something new...</li>
            <li> Body Merry is my new indulgence.</li>
            <li> received  this cream from manufacturre for testing and review as part of the introduction of this new product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> received  this cream from manufacturre for testing and review as part of the introduction of this new product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I felt immediate results and though there is no cure for fat under chin (unless surgically removed/or the new shots they have now)</li>
            <li> This is like getting a new hairstyle and when you see yourself in the mirror, it takes you a minute.  </li>
            <li> I have religiously used so many of their products and repurchased some of their creams because they worked so well on my sensitive and perpetually problematic skin!</li>
            <li> never really thought about moisturizing my neck and haven&#x27;t noticed that my skin was aging as I am only 29, but it&#x27;s better to be proactive.</li>
            <li> The neck is my new obsession when it comes to wrinkles, I just realized that  I&#x27;m getting old and stuff is not like it used to be there!  </li>
            <li> Although I have very sensitive skin, I did not experience any problems.</li>
            <li> It has not irritated my sensitive skin, and keeps the moisture level high.</li>
            <li> They are extremely professional and go over and above to assist you with what will work right for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at how much my mother loved this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user of this brand of neck cream, eye cream and facial moisturizer</li>
            <li> I was really surprised!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually read the ingredients before pumping some out, so my first reaction was, huh...cucumber.  </li>
            <li> Recommend every other night to start; I got excited about it and used it every night</li>
            <li> Just okay, I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell to continue to use this.</li>
            <li> The neck, decolletage and back of hands is supposedly the first to show age.</li>
            <li> and I had pretty low expectations.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it has not only the necessary ingredients such as glycolic acid and the CoQ10, but has organic ingredients in it also....</li>
            <li> I am 49 and have always had a double chin thanks to genetics!</li>
            <li> so the first thing I always look for in any skin product is how my skin initially reacts to it.</li>
            <li> The first thing I notice, is that it takes about 10 pumps until you actually see the product coming out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Fragrance was not my favorite :/</li>
            <li> I was a bit startled and worried, but then I remembered that the Seller had been good enough to follow up my purchase a few days later with an email that explained how the cream worked and how to use it.</li>
            <li> Stretched out, sagging skin right under my chin.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the slight fragrance and the pump dispenser</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a fragrance I enjoy, but I don&#x27;t think it lingers around long enough to be too bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; area are smooth and less crepe.</li>
            <li> I tend to listen less to those who have been sent free product for a review</li>
            <li> I will come back and add a note at the end of the month, but so far, it looks like the real deal!</li>
            <li> and i notice my double chin taking off, becoming smaller and smaller.</li>
            <li> love using it when I&#x27;m about to go out for an extra lift, so long term effects are still up in the air, but I definitely temporary improvements.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love using it when I&#x27;m about to go out for an extra lift, so long term effects are still up in the air, but I definitely temporary improvements.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very light almost melon smell, not watery or thick.</li>
            <li> I like to rub it into my neck and chest when I dry off right after showering.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect it to turn back time, but it certainly helps to improve the appearance of my neck.</li>
            <li> Hope to get jump start on preventing the dreaded chicken neck LOL.</li>
            <li> Hopefully you can clearly see what has and has not changed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for a few days, I have no problems with my sensitive skin and it feels smooth.</li>
            <li> I developed a double chin that made me very self-conscious.</li>
            <li> one is professional strength so please use it with a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a 62 year old grandmother of 10.  </li>
            <li> It does have a tea like odor to it, so those who are sensitive to smells, you may want to consider that.</li>
            <li> Like it so far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Verdict: I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready to commit to using a neck cream on the regular.</li>
            <li> So very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and I do then find it keeps my neck soft yet taught throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairy young and don&#x27;t have an aging neck.</li>
            <li> I would add an additional plant material or two to this cream to change the scent since it does have a natural plant smell instead of no smell at all.  </li>

            <li> I am 59 yrs old with a wrinkled neck and not looking to do surgery.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen anything as far as results go yet after a month.</li>
            <li> I have oily combo skin soo far not a blemish.</li>
            <li> After using the cream for about 2 weeks I can see a marked difference in the elasticity of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I concentrated on this area and it is almost completely toned.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have young skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice the gradual change, but when I thought to look for a difference today, I noticed an obvious tightening of the skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Before using this cream, I would look at my neck in my car&#x27;s rearview mirror and be horrified at how old my neck appeared.  </li>
            <li> There are no harsh ingredients or fragrance that might irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li> Like the cream so far.</li>
            <li> It is completely odorless and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> It does not make my sensitive skin break out</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m close to 60 years old.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> This cream is a moisturizer that can be applied to the neck and chest area to firm, smooth and improve the skin.</li>
            <li> After just one application, I found that my skin felt firmer and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Ahhh, the old turkey neck.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find any harsh ingredients, chemicals, parabens, or phthalates inside, which is important to me when looking at skin care products.  </li>
            <li> The cream is based on a lot of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that can be used on sensitive skin then this will work for you.</li>
            <li> But it has helped to firm up the area, and I have noticed that my neck looks smoother and better -- and I&#x27;ve been using it for only a month!</li>
            <li> I love that this product  has no fragrances or harsh chemicals such as Parabens, Sulphates or Phthalates.</li>
            <li> Of course, one can only judge the true effectiveness of a product when used over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a helpful product ~ at least as good as Nectifirm and certainly not as pricey.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is light, moisturizing, slightly greasy but not so bad that it bothers me, lovely light cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> I do like the high amount of natural ingredients and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> started using the eye cream and have the same high hopes for my under eye crinkles and crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a complete fix (yet), but now I feel like the product really is working, so I plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth for hours, but is very heavy and sweaty in humid summer</li>
            <li> This is going to be part of my new daily regiment.</li>
            <li> I also like that the formula is free from harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulfates, and phthalates</li>
            <li> The cream immediately absorbed into my skin and had a slight scent of a sunscreen to it, nothing</li>
            <li> Like all our products, the formula is free from harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulfates and phthalates.</li>
            <li> all of their products, this is formulated free from harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulfates and phthalates.</li>
            <li> ItIt&#x27;s not too heavy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick, but is easily applied to my neck.  </li>
            <li> I returned this bottle as soon as I received it because it very clearly states on the back to avoid sunlight.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this cream has made my skin very soft and moisturized and the crepey look has definitely diminished.</li>
            <li> I guess my skin is more sensitive than I thought, because when I first tried it, instead of smoothing my skin like I had expected, it actually made it really rough for a few days...  </li>
            <li> A reaction includes burning sensation, my face and eck turn Corvette Red, is hot to touch like a fever for hours, and the following day the redness has subsided leaving what looks like acne bumps but are actually part of my Rosacea flare up.  </li>
            <li> Have I seen any major improvements?</li>
            <li> For the first two weeks or so, the only change I noticed was that the skin on my neck wasn&#x27;t as dry as it had been.</li>
            <li> It is not strong and does fade fairly quickly</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell a difference that my skin feels more moisturized, instead of feeling tight and rough.  </li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> I do not see any firming thus far, but I am also 67 years old and haven&#x27;t used the product that long.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a definite firming action going on.</li>
            <li> early Mother&#x27;s Day present,</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and will definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 years old and over the last year I have noticed the beginnings of a waddle neck.  </li>
            <li> With one pump, this cream should last you for a month or two and it is at such a reasonable price that there is no reason that you should not continue to use it for youthful looking skin as you enter into the future.</li>
            <li> As a result to that, everyone can use this cream, even people who have sensitive skin that is prone to blackheads, acne and red blemishes.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I followed the directions and only use it once a day.</li>
            <li> It is also supported by powerful natural and organic ingredients such as Plant Derived Hyaluronic Acid, Propolis, Royal Jelly, Cocoa Butter, Jojoba Oil, Green Tea, Avocado Oil, Licorice, Lemongrass and Rosehip Oil, to name just a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Sagging appears not to have gotten worse but doesn&#x27;t quite seem noticeably better.</li>
            <li> It goes on light but its a thick cream.</li>
            <li> but the skin has a much more firm look and they are less noticeable after using this for one month.</li>
            <li> I have definitely seen a slight improvement in the contour of my jawline and possibly a slight improvement in the firmness of my neck, it appears a bit more toned.</li>
            <li> I think I am about half way through the bottle because it&#x27;s pretty concentrated.</li>
            <li> I have used other neck firming and tightening creams in the past and am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The loose, turkey skin on my neck is my least favorite part of aging...</li>
            <li> I will absolutely order it again and will be looking for other products from them</li>
            <li> product hasn’t done much to change my skin, other than moisturizing it well.</li>
            <li> and I am finding that my neck is looking a little more firm.  </li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and nothing short of cosmetic surgery can bring back the hands of time.  </li>
            <li> However, I did break out a little the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom as she has been starting to see sagging in her skin and after a week of use she started to notice a major difference.  </li>
            <li> So then I started &amp;#34;bothering&amp;#34; to put on makeup which led to dressing a little better and you know how you feel when people who have not seen you in a few years actually are startled and say &amp;</li>
            <li> The first morning after applying the previous night,  my skin looked NOTICEABLY younger on my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage areas!  </li>
            <li> My skin feels moisturized yet doesn&#x27;t appear super shiny like it did after applying different firming cream in the past.  </li>
            <li> Oh I had been cheating and simply using a general lotion on my neck..</li>
            <li> I use it at least every other day and love the way it penetrates and fills in the lines in my neck.</li>
            <li> No strange side effects on skin or breakouts either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks and the sagging skin is pretty much gone, along with the lines on my neck being less visible.  </li>
            <li> I find that as long as I am completely dry where I am putting it that it absorbs into my skin, not leaving any kind of film behind.</li>
            <li> and I can tell it really helps to shape the skin under my neck and make it feel less</li>
            <li> The texture is thick and creamy but does quickly absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li> Since I had spent so much on the Dermagist cream, I could not waste it and decided to use both neck creams together, especially since I found the Body Merry cream slight drier that the Dermagist cream.</li>
            <li> This is important as I really dislike lotions and creams that leave a dirty or greasy</li>
            <li> They also state that there are no fragrances inside, but I think they mean there are no artificial fragrances -</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell just not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Small amount Really firms my neck.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure its doing all to much as I really have yet to notice a differance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30s and was just begging to see the first signs of aging in my neck.</li>
            <li> I am not quite forty, but was noticing some minor wrinkling starting on my neck....</li>
            <li> How long does it last?</li>
            <li> The wrinkles are reducing and are not nearly as noticeable as they were prior to her beginning the regimen of applying Body Merry&#x27;s Neck Firming Cream.</li>
            <li> Im using very small amount for entire neck area twice a day and still on first bottle.</li>
            <li> So, clearly nothing is surgery in a bottle; however, I have to say that I&#x27;ve seen slight improvement in the appearance of my neck.</li>
            <li> I have read that the neck is an easy way to tell age, so I want to get ahead of the game!</li>
            <li> And it left my skin feeling soft and less dry.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a fragrance, it may not be artificial but it sure does smell like herbs.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and firm at the same time.</li>
            <li> I found that I first didn&#x27;t like the medicine smell but found out after a few days that it was a calming me down smell.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable improvement in a deep line across my throat, and the loose skin under my chin has disappeared.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and tight.</li>
            <li> so far I see a little improvement in 4 weeks of use...</li>
            <li> have all noticed a difference on her neck, the lines a little smoother, she loves how soft her skin feels.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the old Nair a little.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not seen super dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> I have not used this product long</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts all night long, and for me, it&#x27;s soothing and calming.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s intensely moisturizing without being too thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 60 something women who has had several serious operations this past year and have put on weight, lost the luster of nice skin after years of hard work.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise your products works so much better and is a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s firmed and tightened, because I&#x27;ve used other neck</li>
            <li> So far i see an improvement very slight, been using it for 2 weeks..</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to see a big difference has done a little bit.</li>
            <li> Not only do I use it on my neck, but if I have a little left over on my fingertips, I spread it on my face, as well.  </li>
            <li> the price compared to other neck creams it cant be beat,, i will update later</li>
            <li> It goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The skin on my neck was like crepe paper, due to radiation and chemo a couple years back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still use this product, even if it smelled like Nair all day long!</li>
            <li> so it did reduce the lines from dry skin from tanning.</li>
            <li> BUT, they do seem LESS deep, and I don&#x27;t think anything short of surgery would change that, so it&#x27;s expected.  </li>
            <li> I am 52 and was starting to feel rather unhappy about the skin on my neck, which due to endless tanning when I was a teen and young adult, has developed some sags.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day but don&#x27;t notice any differences in my neck.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a single bottle (just reordered).</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have the caviar, but has most of the other ingredients and is much less expensive than the caviar based doctor cream.</li>
            <li> packaging.&amp;#60;--and, while I&#x27;m being picky, the tiny white font on the back of the label is extremely hard to read.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I have neglected my skin for many years, I&#x27;m now desperately finding a solution for my wrinkles and other skin problems.</li>
            <li> Most of the ones I have tried were very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I do not expect the loose folds to go away</li>
            <li> I thought nothing would ever help my neck, the sagging and the loose skin.</li>
            <li> Mine is loose from 100+lbs weight loss, I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if it continues to improve.</li>
            <li> I still have loose skin, but it isn&#x27;t as wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I used this because I had spotted some loose skin on my neck.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the bottle will last you for a while.  </li>
            <li> but then again I have only used this for less than a month.</li>
            <li> cream comes in a pump style red labeled black bottle.</li>
            <li> This product does the same for much less.</li>
            <li> The only thing I started to notice was a slight sag at my neck.</li>
            <li> I had surgery and lost alot of weight which left some areas of my body less than toned.  </li>
            <li> only takes one pump to cover my neck, i use an additional half a pump  on my jawls...</li>
            <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t leave that weird greasy feeling and it absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> And within the first week, I saw a dramatic difference.  </li>
            <li> The cream is thick enough that my neck feels adequately moisturized when applied, yet not so thick to leave a heavy film coating or greasiness on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Using it and starting to see a little bit of firmness.would buy again</li>
            <li> This little container has definitely made a difference!</li>
            <li> As a man, it&#x27;s a little outside my comfort zone to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many expensive brands with non or negative results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last</li>
            <li> This product arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this a few days and can already see and feel a difference</li>
            <li> A few key points that come up again and again in the reviews, and my opinions:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few days and no difference at all yet.</li>
            <li> did not do what was expected and stated on advertisement for it.  </li>
            <li> Only been using a few weeks but seems to have improved my neck .</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Not the improvement in the firmness I had expected.</li>
            <li> I feel like this prodect has not only helped firm up my neck but also my face.</li>
            <li> It has only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> The skin AROUND the wrinkles, which was previously just sort of dry and mildly loose in appearance, has changed dramatically.  </li>
            <li> And a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far no changes but also no skin break outs, unlike other very expensive ones that really make my skin so oily.</li>
            <li> looks like a little chinese filled manually the jar with homemade bad smelling liquid.</li>
            <li> I REALLY hate my neck wrinkles, which are much deeper than my face wrinkles, in part because I&#x27;m constantly bending my head to look at a screen (which I just forced myself to stop doing right now).  </li>
            <li> I bought the product based on other reviews here.</li>
            <li> It has antioxidants, glycolic acid, and other organic ingredients to help fight the signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> I am 62 and have used other products but truly nothing got me to wear a blouse that exposed my neck area.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue using it and explore some of their other products.</li>
            <li> Trust me when I say I have tried many&lt;br /&gt;products of this type, and this product works extremely well...</li>
            <li> other than surgery can remove those lines in our neck</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used regular face creams on my neck</li>
            <li> I was losing hope that a product in this price range would actually do much other than just moisturize.</li>
            <li> Sure wish I were getting the results everyone else has :(</li>
            <li> Other than that, I will continue to use the Body Merry Age Defense Neck Cream as part of my anti-aging skin care regimen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply this to my neck, d&amp;eacute;colletage and the backs of my hands, then usually put another cream over it, especially in winter, to lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> I am 60 and a few years ago had gastric bypass and lost a lot of weight and now have turkey neck and extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> No more lines, no more teensy sag, (which is why I bought it to begin with) and nothing but a swan like neck, with the skin of a 30 year old.</li>
            <li> Teh smell is not good, but it doesn&#x27;t last a long time so I can overloook that.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try their other product for dark circles.</li>
            <li> On the poor side: I had to push on the pump dispenser a few times before it started dosing the ointment; but that&#x27;s expected with any new pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> hold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it, and I hope it will continue to make a difference in my poor, old skin.  </li>
            <li> If it keeps cost down I am all for it because this is my go to product</li>
            <li> Some people think it smells weird, but that&#x27;s because most moisturizers have fake smells.</li>
            <li> Also the smell is less than desirable.  </li>
            <li> There is an odd odor to the cream.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasted me about a month and a half.  </li>
            <li> But it does assist in the elasticity of skin and making some creases less or go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My neck has tightened up slightly and the bags under my eyes have reduced to about half.</li>
            <li> I can see a slight difference with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles aren&#x27;t gone, but they&#x27;re noticeably less visible, softer looking.  </li>
            <li> It would be hidden by any other additional scent you may care to use, and is certainly in no way a negative of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a little less than one month,  </li>
            <li> It also made my neck skin feel tight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing at least a 50% reduction in the crepey, vertical lines that run up and down the center of my neck.</li>
            <li> I have using this for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to pay an arm and leg for a product that delivers like this one, as I have done in the past with other products.  </li>
            <li> Dont work even a little</li>
            <li> I gained a little weight and as a result my face got fatter.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a little over a month</li>
            <li> Please keep the price down!</li>
            <li> And I have wasted a LOT of money.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday since I got it.</li>
            <li> (I had slipped up on that for a few years - oh my).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This cream smells just like green plant material with no additional fragrances or perfumes added.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had for a few weeks already.</li>
            <li> I know that was a mouthful, but I&#x27;m trying to learn the &#x27;Secret&#x27; of Embracing my &#x27;Inner&#x27; Beauty!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks &amp; have not noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> This product does firm well.</li>
            <li> I have been using according to instructions for a few weeks and have not noticed any change in my skin.</li>
            <li> It does firm the skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, the saggy skin has diminished.  </li>
            <li> leaves neck &#x27;tacky&#x27; instead of any firm feeling</li>
            <li> I did notice an improvement of tightness of the skin around my neck area after a few days.</li>
            <li> My Mother was searching for a neck cream that could firm and erase the wrinkles which were beginning to show on her neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it moisturizes my neck well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on fancy brands when it comes to neck</li>
            <li> i have been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> The skin feels and appears tighter and less wrinkled!</li>
            <li> My tier 2 wrinkles (all together at the base of my neck) seem to be more shallow.  </li>
            <li> This is not a magic serum that makes fat necks skinny or turkey necks suddenly tight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it&#x27;s only been about two weeks, I don&#x27;t see dramatic results.</li>
            <li> cream is of about medium thickness, not super thick like a heavy cream but also not runny like a thinner lotion.</li>
            <li> cant have a tight neck a saggy jawls!</li>
            <li> But I was starting to have some sagging skin that was really looking bad!</li>
            <li> Neck crepe and creases diminished over a few days (yes, a few days!).  </li>
            <li> I am looking for a product that will slow down the aging process of my neck and my chest.  </li>
            <li> my skin is softer, not sure if it&#x27;s tightening.</li>
            <li> but people assume I am no more than .</li>
            <li> Works just as well, if not better and for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its the product or because I am taking care of my neck now..</li>
            <li> Skin is smoother but not sure it changed the &amp;#34; sagging&amp;#34; I was hoping to correct.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy it again after its gone, but we&#x27;ll see after I use it for longer.</li>
            <li> I was searching for an alternative to the Bliss line I usually use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m horrible at making sure I use it every day too.</li>
            <li> I just received this product so I&#x27;m really not sure</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t let the small bottle fool you.</li>
            <li> I used it twice yesterday and woke up this morning with no more stretchy skin on my neck.  </li>
            <li> It runs in my family and after two babies and my weight fluctuating over the past 4 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 years old, there&#x27;s a lot of chicken skin going on, and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Our neck and chest skin is very delicate and I am very careful to use product’s</li>
            <li> You cannot put any other makeup or lotion over it or is looks worse than without it.  </li>
            <li> but I think if someone buys it based on its claims of &amp;#34;no fragrance&amp;#34;, they will be surprised and maybe a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews</li>
            <li> I have oily skin &amp; this doesn&#x27;t break it out which is hard to find in a product.  </li>
            <li> I posted on the Eye  cream for dark circles review!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this with the assurance it would remove dark spots from my face; It has not!!!</li>
            <li> My craziest, deepest wrinkles are still crazy deep.  </li>
            <li> I know there&#x27;s no miracle cure out there, but I was at least hoping it would  lessen the lines in my neck.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used now for at least 3 months</li>
            <li> Body Merry is a brand I trust because they offer you a money back guarantee if you are unhappy with your results.</li>
            <li> It does not cause negative effects that can be harmful to the skin.</li>
            <li> I am slowly seeing a difference</li>
            <li> No, I can&#x27;t lie and say that I have, but if there was any product that could rid you of a turkey neck in just a few weeks, people would be lined up to pay 100x the cost of this!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen dramatic results, but it does seem to help some with tightening neck skin.</li>
            <li> In the past three weeks of use my skin on my neck and my chest seems to look smoother, and not as thin.  </li>
            <li> My neck does seem to be less wrinkled and my face seems firmer tool!!!  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a subtle change in the laxity of my neck</li>
            <li> This neck cream has not made a difference in my neck, but let&#x27;s be serious.  </li>
            <li> Whatever effect is subtle in my case, but I believe it is working, been using it for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am kinda shocked to say it&#x27;s actually working!!!</li>
            <li> I am in my 40s and my neck has gotten that crepey thin looking skin that I could see when I turn my head.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a great scent.</li>
            <li> (it has not gotten any worse over the 2 months).  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Body Merry Neck Firming and Tightening Cream approximately a month ago for my Mother, on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Ladies should not neglect the delicate skin on their necks and d&amp;eacute;colletage, but applying really expensive face creams there feels extravagent.</li>
            <li> Seriously can&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li> and if I didn&#x27;t like I would &#x27;t feel guilty.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, of course.</li>
            <li> I took a before picture, which is unfortunately grainy.  </li>
            <li> Makes it difficult to sleep with the smell from the cream at night.</li>
            <li> Umm the packaging is kinda scary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She says it works just as well as some of the really expensive neck-firming creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with their eye cream and retinol moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So sorry to say that I am not seeing any difference.</li>
            <li> I am seeing a bit of turkey neck starting and wanted to be proactive and purchase this cream to help delay this horrible look.</li>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t some weird apparition in the mirror....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the neck is a part of the body that is often neglected when it come to skin care routines.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed!</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t have artificial junk you don&#x27;t want on your skin.</li>
            <li> Using twice a day but still looks like a chicken neck.</li>
            <li> My chicken neck look is gone.</li>
            <li> It stinks</li>
            <li> The chicken skin is firmer, too.  </li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> smells horrible, not sure if it works yet.</li>
            <li> and i Am very insecure about my neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That makes it practically impossible for me to use this product.  </li>
            <li> indecent handmade bad smelling junk.</li>
            <li> I had tried it on my neck which turned out to be a bad idea I broke out with a rash</li>
            <li> I have not had any bad reactions to this cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed by this cream.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed...</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> dreadful</li>
            <li> Terrible irritation for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 62 and my neck has been my worst part that showed my age.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Lotion is super hydrating and smells wonderful with all the natural ingredients it includes. It is very good at making my neckskin  look more toned and less dry. Am buying another bottle and trying the eye cream as well!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.in 2weeks I&#x27;ll let you know how it work for turkey neck</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and I feel that I am seeing results.  I enjoy the slight fragrance and the pump dispenser is just enough for application.  I have used other neck firming and tightening creams in the past and am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Helps redness, wrinkles and crinkly skin. Makes neck smooth and pretty again. I have not been paid or offered free products for this review. I bought the product based on other reviews here. It works and I am going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this product as well, i have my boyfriend put it all over face and neck and it has made a difference, you can look at pics. I posted on the Eye  cream for dark circles review!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with my Age Defense Neck Cream. I&#x27;ve been using it every morning since I received it about three weeks ago and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable improvement in a deep line across my throat, and the loose skin under my chin has disappeared. I normally have issues with breakouts when trying new products but I did not experience that with this product.  The scent is light and pleasant and the cream absorbs into the skin without leaving a sticky residue.  I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the results that I&#x27;ve just ordered both the Retinol Serum and the Vitamin C moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service for this company is great.  I emailed them with a question on what order I should apply my products in, and they responded within an hour with detailed instructions.</li>
            <li> I have been using a month, and I can&#x27;t say I see a huge difference, but I plan to stick it out to see if I get results.</li>
            <li> This is a rich cream that actually works! I am 52 and was starting to feel rather unhappy about the skin on my neck, which due to endless tanning when I was a teen and young adult, has developed some sags. Body Merry Neck Firming and Tightening Cream has not miraculously taken all that sun damage away. But it has helped to firm up the area, and I have noticed that my neck looks smoother and better -- and I&#x27;ve been using it for only a month! I am definitely going to keep using it. Comes in a pump bottle that measures out the perfect amount for your neck.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and smells good.</li>
            <li> This cream is luscious! I am 60 and a few years ago had gastric bypass and lost a lot of weight and now have turkey neck and extremely dry skin. I have to say that this cream has made my skin very soft and moisturized and the crepey look has definitely diminished. My friends have all remarked about the difference in my skin since using these products. I do not expect the loose folds to go away but the skin has a much more firm look and they are less noticeable after using this for one month. Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after even more time. I have recommended this product to all my friends and couldn&#x27;t recommend it more. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I saw this neck cream at a very reasonable price and thought that I would try.  Most of the ones I have tried were very expensive.  Figured I could compare the difference and if I didn&#x27;t like I would &#x27;t feel guilty.  I found that I first didn&#x27;t like the medicine smell but found out after a few days that it was a calming me down smell.  It also made my neck skin feel tight.  You can put makeup over it without a problem which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Small amount Really firms my neck.  I like that it odor free. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream!!  Not only do I use it on my neck, but if I have a little left over on my fingertips, I spread it on my face, as well.  I can actually feel the cream firming my neck and face.  Love it!!  Non greasy and absorbs very well.  My neck does seem to be less wrinkled and my face seems firmer tool!!!  I&#x27;m a first time user of this brand of neck cream, eye cream and facial moisturizer and I&#x27;m really glad I gave this a try!!</li>
            <li> This Product IS showing me beneficial results in a short time. I do recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great product - use about three times a week and am getting better results than when I used coconut oil. Will buy again when it&#x27;s time for a refill.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this product takes years off my appearance.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, I love this! It felt really good and I suspect my face is going to look amazing in a couple weeks! Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Not really sure its doing all to much as I really have yet to notice a differance but then again I have only used this for less than a month.</li>
            <li> Great neck cream! It is very nourishing and moisturizing. It has antioxidants, glycolic acid, and other organic ingredients to help fight the signs of aging.  I love that this product  has no fragrances or harsh chemicals such as Parabens, Sulphates or Phthalates. This is a great product to add to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> After so many positive reviews for this product I decided to try it out myself. It&#x27;s been over a month now and I see no difference in the neck area despite morning and night application the smell is a bit off putting too.</li>
            <li> So far so good, awesomeroduct. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Saw a difference in one week. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> At age 59, I have been trying wrinkle treatments for several years now. And I have wasted a LOT of money. But Body Merry has changed that!! This one REALLY WORKS!! I was skeptical, of course. And thought it was too pricey. But it is worth every penny!! What a great product! I am amazed, truly!!  Give it a try!!</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful company that stands behind their product, I first tried it for 6weeks and received an email from the company wanting to know how it was working, I really didnt see a difference so they offered to refund my money to me, I said no but if they wanted to send me another bottle I would continue to use it well I am happy to say after 8weeks I have seen a big difference in my neck. I would and have recommended this product to friends and family. I have great respect for a company that stands behind their product and is made in the god old USA.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday since I got it. Very happy with this buy. Seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> Received product in a timely manner, was packaged fine.  I&#x27;ve been using the cream for 2 weeks now. I like the way it moisturizes and makes my neck feel, will continue to use</li>
            <li> This supper neck cream has such wonderful ingredients in it so you can be sure the proper stuff is in the cream . This one is loaded with 4% vitamin C 5% Glycolic acid and coenzyme Q10. All this make for a very different and effective cream for the neck.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on well and the pump bottle makes it easy to use , it even smells nice&lt;br /&gt;This one is professional strength so please use it with a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve been using for about one month now an I see a difference in my skin texture. It is work, there is a tightening of the skin visibility. Not too heave and absorb quickly. Love the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> It can be used twice daily; however, I have used it once each day.  I have seen improvement in the color and tightness of my neck</li>
            <li> This cream is the cream I didn&#x27;t know I needed,it firmed my neck and chest  in places I didn&#x27;t even know  needed to be firmed. It was a total plus that it didn&#x27;t have a strong overpowering smell and didn&#x27;t leave my neck and chest looking or feeling like a grease factory. I&#x27;m pretty much addicted to this stuff, this company always has great products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Results are seen quickly!</li>
            <li> I apply twice a day after cleansing. I also do some yoga exercises. I feel like this product gives my skin a firmer feel but at the same time hydrates for elasticity. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I highly recommend it! Shipping was also 5 stars -</li>
            <li> I like it and it Has firmed  the neck area.</li>
            <li> indecent handmade bad smelling junk. looks like a little chinese filled manually the jar with homemade bad smelling liquid. dreadful</li>
            <li> Love using this neck cream. Very firming.</li>
            <li> very nice feeling cream!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Never used anything on neck before but this is an amazing product that makes your skin look so good.</li>
            <li> good so far I see a little improvement in 4 weeks of use...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried a lot of similar products, including products that were over $100/oz. This one works just as well, although I was concerned that I hadn&#x27;t seen any results after the first week.</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy but soaks in and is not greasy. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Am still in my initial &amp;#34;try-out&amp;#34;... but I think it may be doing what it advertises... firming (neck) skin.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the cream while putting it on, it&#x27;s like putting on satin.  It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to the seller or their future customers to say it&#x27;s a dream  come true since I just started using it....but I gave it 5 stars for price, packaging, easy application, excellent communication with instructions and again...the feel of it.  It never hurts to try something new...so I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results, but I love the way it feels and how it is quickly absorbed, leaving skin a bit tighter and more refreshed. It also has a really pleasant fragrance.  Very happy with this product, so far</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a HUGE difference yet, but I like the product.  It makes my neck nice and soft!  I will give it a little more time before I make a final judgement though :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not how much improvement there can be on the neck of an old lady, but I like the feeling of the cream on my neck.  There sure isn&#x27;t very much in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I like it better to StriVectin! Really made a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this like clockwork every night for about 6 weeks now. I waited to post my review so I could give an honest opinion. I am kinda shocked to say it&#x27;s actually working!!! I&#x27;ve tried way more expensive creams to help my &amp;#34;grandma&amp;#34; like skin on my neck and nothing has worked.  I am in my 40s and my neck has gotten that crepey thin looking skin that I could see when I turn my head. I swear it&#x27;s pretty much gone now. So happy with this! No strange side effects on skin or breakouts either. It kinda smells like earthy, almond based to me. I only use it at night before bed because it&#x27;s too creamy feeling for me during the day. It&#x27;s worked so well on my neck that I have started using it on my face too. I will probably be using this forever. Seriously can&#x27;t believe it! Kinda wish I had a before and after photo now.</li>
            <li> Two weeks and it&#x27;s working already. Slight cucumber smell is interesting and refreshing.</li>
            <li> High quality. Easy to apply and feel comfortable. This product really works. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> After doing some online research for the best neck firming creams on the market, I decided to try this product from Body Merry and am very glad that I did. I have noticed a subtle change in the laxity of my neck and I only say &amp;#34;subtle&amp;#34; because I have only been using the product for about 3 weeks now. (Hopefully after a couple of more weeks of usage I&#x27;ll rate it 5 stars). The fragrance is very nice, the cream  glides on easily and isn&#x27;t greasy/oily feeling at all. I am certainly going to continue to use their product and plan on ordering more.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with it. Not only do I use it for my neck, which is why I bought it. But also on my face and then use my regular face lotion on top of it.It does make quite a difference! I was really surprised! This is going to be part of my new daily regiment.</li>
            <li> Truly a great product.  Goes on really smooth and skin is left feeling that way.  Skin looks and feels tighter and much more resilient.</li>
            <li> Love love this product. I&#x27;ve been using for about a month now and I see a difference in my skin texture when used. I&#x27;m 58 and had neck surgery last year, I have a scar and losing elasticity. Also used around my mouth, It works, there is a tightening of the skin visibly. ItIt&#x27;s not too heavy and absorbs quickly. Very affordable, 100% guarantee and it works, what more can you ask for. Love the pump bottle also.  I will order again and I recommend this to everyone of any age.</li>
            <li> my skin is softer, not sure if it&#x27;s tightening.</li>
            <li> I am a 62 year old grandmother of 10.  This is the best product I have ever used.  I have never entered any comments before, but I will never be without this product.  It only took a couple of weeks to lose my double chin and wrinkles on my neck.  For the price you really need to try it.</li>
            <li> I have not see clear resout yet but it feel good.</li>
            <li> Although I have been using it only a week I find this cream is moisturizing and firming and has a pleasant scent. Nice thick cream glides on easily and is not sticky. Although I have very sensitive skin, I did not experience any problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the assurance it would remove dark spots from my face; It has not!!! I am very dissatisfied with this product!!!</li>
            <li> Used the neck cream until is was gone about 8 weeks, I really loved the scent and the moisture it provided however it just did work for me I was looking for more firming. Customer Service is TOP NOTCH they really care about there customers.</li>
            <li> Unsure if this is really helping. Sagging appears not to have gotten worse but doesn&#x27;t quite seem noticeably better.</li>
            <li> so far so good. I have not gotten a reaction or a rash on my neck. I like the smell of the product. My neck is very smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful way to have both vit c &amp; glycolic! I actually use it on my face too because the label says you can and I like it.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any changes in my neck firmness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed. It seems to be working really well. My neck feels so much tighter and firmer since using. It absorbs wel linto the skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. Just leaves my skin feeling very smooth. I definatley am seeing results. Great product</li>
            <li> feel not too greasy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I can see a difference. I would definitely get it again. Delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for 7 days (6 treatments).  I REALLY hate my neck wrinkles, which are much deeper than my face wrinkles, in part because I&#x27;m constantly bending my head to look at a screen (which I just forced myself to stop doing right now).  My neck and my hands show my age more even than my gray hair, which people weirdly don&#x27;t seem to even notice.  I took a before picture, which is unfortunately grainy.  I didn&#x27;t intend to mislead anyone, it just turned out that way.  Hopefully you can clearly see what has and has not changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I said, I&#x27;ve only used it 6 times, but I got a discount for writing an honest (and timely) review, so I&#x27;m on here, reviewing without giving it much of a chance.  My craziest, deepest wrinkles are still crazy deep.  BUT, they do seem LESS deep, and I don&#x27;t think anything short of surgery would change that, so it&#x27;s expected.  My tier 2 wrinkles (all together at the base of my neck) seem to be more shallow.  You can see in the photo and judge for yourself.  The skin AROUND the wrinkles, which was previously just sort of dry and mildly loose in appearance, has changed dramatically.  (If only I&#x27;d found this earlier in life, before deep wrinkles took hold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it, and I hope it will continue to make a difference in my poor, old skin.  I do recommend it, and I do love it - for those of us who have necks which aren&#x27;t smoothed by face cream.  Cheers, gals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to mention - it smells of cucumber.  I didn&#x27;t actually read the ingredients before pumping some out, so my first reaction was, huh...cucumber.  If you find that off-putting, you might choose your time of application accordingly.  If you don&#x27;t, use any time!  :-)</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I don&#x27;t have to use it every night or day but I see a big difference in my neck and did almost immediately. I use it at least every other day and love the way it penetrates and fills in the lines in my neck. I hardly ever write reviews but I wanted to endorse this product heartily. It works better than products costing much much more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a good 2 weeks now and the results have been so good, I can wear my necklaces again. I had this lumpy wrinkly looking skin from my upper cleavage to my chin. So embarrassing that I wore high collars and turtle necks. But after using this cream in the pump container, be careful, it comes out fast, twice daily and massaging in gently for about 2 minutes Mon-Fri and 3 times on weekends, the results are really,  honestly fantastic. I am 62 and have used other products but truly nothing got me to wear a blouse that exposed my neck area. And the habit of using it got me using facial massage again (I had slipped up on that for a few years - oh my). So then I started &amp;#34;bothering&amp;#34; to put on makeup which led to dressing a little better and you know how you feel when people who have not seen you in a few years actually are startled and say &amp;#34;you look great&amp;#34; Oh your eyes, they can&#x27;t figure out what it is specifically but they like it.</li>
            <li> I am loving this. It is easy to use. It smells fresh and feels so great !  But , the best thing is that it actually works. I see improvement. I love it ! So smooth !</li>
            <li> It feels good on your skin. It&#x27;s still too early to tell if it really works, but so far it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Lots of chemicals. Terrible irritation for my skin.</li>
            <li> Another great product from this company, my skin on my neck is firmer! Hope to get jump start on preventing the dreaded chicken neck LOL. At 61 it is just around the corner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Didn&#x27;t work after 2 weeks use and irritated my skin</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my mother, noticed an improvement within a couple days, neck&lt;br /&gt;is more firm, and diminishes lines as well.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Using it and starting to see a little bit of firmness.would buy again</li>
            <li> I notice lines diminishing!</li>
            <li> While this product didn&#x27;t work for me (I didn&#x27;t see any changes), the customer service was outstanding. I would not hesitate to try another item in their product line.</li>
            <li> Have to use twice a day to see a difference. I tan so it did reduce the lines from dry skin from tanning. Used for two weeks before noticed a difference</li>
            <li> At age 63 (actually closer to 64) but people assume I am no more than . I was totally blown away by this product...I have been using the serum, but the neck cream is fantastic. I am getting to order a second time. It is great, not just for neck but eyes, and nasolip folds.....I highly recommend both products...</li>
            <li> At the end of 2 weeks of using this product twice a day on my neck, I wrote a review that was complimentary, but after a month, gee whiz, I happened to look at my reflection in the mirror in my doctor&#x27;s ladies room; it was even better than before. No more lines, no more teensy sag, (which is why I bought it to begin with) and nothing but a swan like neck, with the skin of a 30 year old. My grandmother told me when I was 16 that if I took care of my skin THEN, it would take care of me, when I was over 50. As always, she was right. Now I am 65, I gave up tanning in the sun when I was 32---but I used a bronzer on my face and legs, and I can see that I did the right things. But at 65, there is no amount of taking care of ourselves, without surgery, that will truly make a difference at the neck and decolletage. THIS makes a difference. My HUSBAND even noticed it. Now I want these purveyors to make a potion for the rest of our bodies. We can&#x27;t afford to put this product all over us, but surely, with all these grand reviews, they can look into it?</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and I can&#x27;t say I notice a big difference, however, I think my neck looks saggier when I forget to put it on in the morning...overall not a bad product. It does have a tea like odor to it, so those who are sensitive to smells, you may want to consider that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed by this cream. First of all, I don&#x27;t like the smell. It is really off putting, however it disappears after an hour. More importantly it is a heavy cream that doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb, it also makes me look greasy. I feel the urge to wipe it off. I had high hopes. Sorry!</li>
            <li> Great product, very light scent and hydrating. Looking forward to seeing the result</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at how much my mother loved this! She&#x27;s 52 and within a week, everyone noticed a difference. Her neck and chest looked much smoother! Most anti-aging products seem like a gimmick so we were happy this one seems to work. I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I thought nothing would ever help my neck, the sagging and the loose skin. This product has done wonders, I am so satisfied.  I have use it 7 weeks feel like I have hope , so I am very happy had lost hope. I am 62 and my neck has been my worst part that showed my age.  So now I just pray they never go out of business!</li>
            <li> This product arrived as expected. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a great scent to it, is easy to apply and absorbs quickly with no sticky after feeling.  I have not used it long enough yet to be able to tell if there is an improvement from using the product yet, but overall, great product</li>
            <li> Have just started using this on a nightly basis.  Like it so far.  I have read that the neck is an easy way to tell age, so I want to get ahead of the game!</li>
            <li> Most folks protect the skin on their face, their hands (oh, they get so chapped), their legs, and perhaps their feet. They might rub the trace of lotion or cream that remains on their hands onto their neck. But we tend to neglect  our neck and chest and it ages. It wrinkles. It becomes unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Merry has developed a very nice moisturizer specifically for our necks - Age Defense Neck Cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I have found it refreshingly pleasant to use. The fragrance notes are reminiscent of a fresh salad or freshly sliced cucumber but that is a quite brief sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of this neck cream applied to my under-chin, neck, chest, and shoulders is really pleasant. I am enjoying it and believe it can only do good to my skin. Of course, one can only judge the true effectiveness of a product when used over a long period of time. But short-term, I&#x27;d say that Body Merry has again developed a very nice product. I also like that the formula is free from harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulfates, and phthalates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: I received a complimentary product from Body Merry to facilitate this review. Opinions expressed are solely my own. I only recommend products I have used on myself. I received no compensation for this review.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this product... for my face!&lt;br /&gt;Yep, that is correct.  I began using this product for neck as instructed and although it did seem to diminish the look of the wrinkles on my neck, I began using it on my entire face as well .... and wow, I was very impressed with how it minimized the larger lines at the edges of my mouth, the creases on my forehead and the appearance of my skin in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 51 years old, with very fair skin, no breakouts, no redness, just nice results!&lt;br /&gt;I am posting this now because I am ordering two more for birthday gifts for my friends to try out.</li>
            <li> I applied to my neck and upper chest both in the morning and at night. To me, this smelled just like InstaNatural&#x27;s Age Defying Moisturizer Cream. It isn&#x27;t a fragrance I enjoy, but I don&#x27;t think it lingers around long enough to be too bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready to commit to using a neck cream on the regular. I think it can be just as effective to use a face moisturizer and apply that to your neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; as part of your beauty routine.  However, it boasts some quality ingredients, so it is worth a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li> I never thought about ever using a neck cream until I was about 35 (I am 43 now).  I began to be proactive and using a neck cream on and off since I was 35.  I am looking for a product that will slow down the aging process of my neck and my chest.  We often pay so much attention to our faces we forget the other important parts of our bodies.  Our neck and chest skin is very delicate and I am very careful to use product’s that will not have a adverse reaction on my skin.  I have been using a product by Body Merry – Age Defense Neck Cream for just under a month and I am please with the results.  I use it 2 times a day, in the morning and at night.  I use it on my neck, under my chin and my chest.  A little goes a long way, so the bottle will last you for a while.  Don’t use too much, results will not increase with the more product you use.  It is just wasteful.  I was enticed by what the product was made with, which is Glycolic Acid, Coenzyme Q10, and a lot of essential oils (jojoba oil, avocado oil, rosehip oil and lemongrass).  From all the research I have done jojoba / avocado oil are extremely good oils for aging and moisturizing skin, and rosehip oil is great for scars and discolorations.  The bottle has a pump and it is easy enough to use (aside from getting the product to come out at the first use).  The feel of the lotion is not greasy or oily.  It feels just right.  In the past three weeks of use my skin on my neck and my chest seems to look smoother, and not as thin.  I can definitely tell a difference that my skin feels more moisturized, instead of feeling tight and rough.  Overall I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it. In a world where creams are a dime a dozen, this neck cream actually does what is says it is going to do, at a great price. Another benefit of body merry’s age defense neck cream is that it has a 90 day money back guarantee, you don’t even have to return the bottle.  I received a bottle for testing purposes.s.</li>
            <li> I have been using Strivectin products for years and was for the most part, happy with them. I saw this and I thought I would give it a try. So very pleasantly surprised. Works just as well, if not better and for a fraction of the cost. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 and I&#x27;ve been using this neck cream for about about a month now. I&#x27;m seeing at least a 50% reduction in the crepey, vertical lines that run up and down the center of my neck. The skin appears smoother and firmer. I will definitely reorder this cream. I&#x27;ve been pleased with all of the Body Merry products that I&#x27;ve tried so far. They are as effective as more expensive products, but at a much more attractive price point.</li>
            <li> I have use this cream for about 3 months and am pleased with the visible results. Tightens neck wrinkles and even appears to help with chin lift. It is a reasonable price and dispenses sparingly. I am very particular about my skin regimen and often receive compliments about my skin.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff. It says to put a hyaluronic acid under it and I do then find it keeps my neck soft yet taught throughout the day. No real smell which is nice. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> This works great, I already notice a huge difference</li>
            <li> This little container has definitely made a difference!</li>
            <li> My neck looked better right away and continues to improve.  This cream is not expensive but it is effective.  Reccommended!</li>
            <li> I got the chance to review Body Merry Age Defense Neck Cream for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to ask the people from Body Merry about this since I had surgery on my thyroid many years ago it left me with ultra sensitive skin. They were nice about it and said that they can&#x27;t be certain if I would have any problems and that to try a test area and see but if I can&#x27;t use it on my neck that I could use it on my face to. So they were nice enough to send me the product to test and review. I had tried it on my neck which turned out to be a bad idea I broke out with a rash and my neck hurt. So that was my only issue with this product, So instead I continued use on just my face and that was fine. I can use almost anything on my face without issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream comes in a pump style red labeled black bottle. When applied it does not feel sticky or oily and has a nice thick yet creamy consistency. I did noticed that my face felt tighter with a daily application. And it left my skin feeling soft and less dry. As I continue to use this product if anything else comes up I will leave an update.</li>
            <li> This feels wonderful on my skin and makes it look soft and dewy.</li>
            <li> This product is great because it shows visible results the first time you use it- not staggering results, but the neck area definitely looks less crepey. Plus it doesn&#x27;t have artificial junk you don&#x27;t want on your skin. I LIKE IT!</li>
            <li> This item really works and the delivery was excellent.I will buy it again right away</li>
            <li> Its only been about three weeks since I stated using this neck firming cream and I noticed a difference immediately! I am hopeful that as tiem goes on the texture, tone and firmness of my neck will increase. Its a good product at a very reasonable price. Please keep the price down!</li>
            <li> Very noticeable difference and I like the way it feels. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom and she loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a product you have to give a couple days to try it. At first I was kind of upset cause I didn&#x27;t feel no difference. But after a couple days I started to see a difference my skin was firmer and so much softer even more toned and tight.</li>
            <li> This neck cream performs better than Strivectin!  Neck crepe and creases diminished over a few days (yes, a few days!).  The new packaging is much better and I will be buying Merry Body products from now on.  Thank you for keeping these products at a reasonable price point so everyone can benefit.</li>
            <li> Neck doesen&#x27;t look any better at this time.  Using twice a day but still looks like a chicken neck.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream. I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time and the moisturizing this product delivers is great!</li>
            <li> Love this product....love the way my skin feels and looks after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed. It seems to be working. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and already notice a difference. My neck feels a lot firmer and my double chin isn&#x27;t as prominent anymore. However, I did break out a little the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Warning!  Should be on the website...it IS on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This product contains an alpha hydroxy acid that may increase your skin&#x27;s sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn.  Use a sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and limit sun exposure while using this product and for a week afterwards.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That makes it practically impossible for me to use this product.  The Body Merry people contacted me and refunded me for the purchase.  That was VERY good of them.  I would give them 5 stars for that.</li>
            <li> I used this for a couple days before my mother decided she needed it more. When I used it, it made my neck feel soft and smooth.  I am only 30 ish so I am using it for preventive purposes. My mother who is in her mid 50&#x27;s  determined that she wanted and needed this. She says it makes her neck tighter and that the brown spots underneath her chin are getting lighter. She absolutely loves this product and wants me to buy her one for her birthday( LOL)</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to buy htis for my husband and myself.  Teh neck area is the most noticable area as you start to age for men and women. At first it seemed like it was working, but the effects did not get better over time, it seemed to stop working after the first week.  Teh smell is not good, but it doesn&#x27;t last a long time so I can overloook that.  You cannot put any other makeup or lotion over it or is looks worse than without it.  I will not be ordering again. it seems like there is a wax or something in it that seems to tighten the neck at first, but then stops woring for some reason.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now and I have to say that I am very impressed.  I was thinking of spending $60.00 on another cream, but I thought I would give this more affordable product a try first.  I&#x27;m glad I did, becuase the skin on my neck feels firmer already.  This product will be a part of my daily skin routine.</li>
            <li> im using this for horizonital rings around my neck from computer/cell use.. So far i see an improvement very slight, been using it for 2 weeks.. Not sure if its the product or because I am taking care of my neck now..&lt;br /&gt;FOr the price compared to other neck creams it cant be beat,, i will update later</li>
            <li> This stuff is just as great as every other product I&#x27;ve used by Body Merry. It&#x27;s my fourth one. Some people think it smells weird, but that&#x27;s because most moisturizers have fake smells. I think the texture, scent and ingredients are wonderful. I&#x27;m finding this useful with the Retinol Surge to fade the sun damage on my neck. I recommend any of this company&#x27;s products, and their customer service is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sister and it works like a charm. The saggy skin really gets tighten up in  a week usage and the results are very much visible .a highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> I guess that my genes are stronger than this cream.  I used it as directed for several weeks, but saw no results.  I took a photo of myself &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; starting to use it, but didn&#x27;t need to take an after photo to see that it hadn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been using your product for 3 weeks.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy that the cream is moisturizing the area around my neck that is most noticeable. I would recommend your product as part of your morning moisturizing routine to include your neck area.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews more carefully. Most of the high ratings were those who received the product for free for an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review. Let me be 100% honest here. I used the entire bottle over a 2 month period and saw no difference in the texture or firmness of my neck. Not to mention, the product has a strong smell of cucumber, which I really didn&#x27;t care for. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job</li>
            <li> Really nice product. Smells as good as it feels.  I am going to purchase again.</li>
            <li> great product! great results!</li>
            <li> All of the products I use from Body Merry are wonderful and reasonably priced.  This cream works well.  I don&#x27;t expect it to turn back time, but it certainly helps to improve the appearance of my neck.</li>
            <li> The loose, turkey skin on my neck is my least favorite part of aging...I see it in the mirror and curse at it...&amp;#34;@#$%! Be gone, wretched wattle!&amp;#34; Anyway, the positive reviews about this product made me give it a try. I&#x27;m impressed! There&#x27;s a definite firming action going on. I use Seventh Generation firming serum underneath (I had a bottle on hand), which probably helps quite a bit. If I had a spare $10,000 I would run screaming to the nearest cosmetic dermatologist and beg, &amp;#34;Do something!&amp;#34; but I can&#x27;t afford that....a good neck cream, I can afford. This is good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do toobad picking this out on my own! my wife even approves of the firming cream! She&#x27;s kind of picky as a makeup artist for Film/TV.</li>
            <li> I guess my skin is more sensitive than I thought, because when I first tried it, instead of smoothing my skin like I had expected, it actually made it really rough for a few days...  I was a bit startled and worried, but then I remembered that the Seller had been good enough to follow up my purchase a few days later with an email that explained how the cream worked and how to use it. Great thought went into that and I really appreciate it!  Once I realized it was doing what it was supposed to do, which was get rid of the old dead skin to uncover the smoother younger skin underneath, I really liked it!  It definitely works!  I only use it maybe twice a week now to maintain things, and my turkey neck is definitely improved!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it is the best on the market, but is the best of all that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Service was great! Product goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this lotion, but I have been using it for about a month now and have noticed no difference in my neck.  I know there&#x27;s no miracle cure out there, but I was at least hoping it would  lessen the lines in my neck.  Also the smell is less than desirable.  It is not strong and does fade fairly quickly but it&#x27;s not a great scent.</li>
            <li> For the price this stuff is awesome. Made a difference in 3 days 😎</li>
            <li> This product has lasted me 2 months, using both morning and at bedtime.  I have definitely seen a slight improvement in the contour of my jawline and possibly a slight improvement in the firmness of my neck, it appears a bit more toned. I also purchased hoping for improvement of wrinkling that is starting to form on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; from sleeping on my side.  I have seen no improvement in this area, however I continue to sleep on my side (it has not gotten any worse over the 2 months).  Bottom line, I will repurchase to continue to assess for another 2 months.  The price is good and delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> early Mother&#x27;s Day present, and Mom loves it.</li>
            <li> I truly am impressed with this product! very good stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I&#x27;m fairy young and don&#x27;t have an aging neck. However to prevent that, I started using the cream and I love the results!</li>
            <li> So far so good only been a little more than a week and I believe I see an improvement!! Thanks&lt;br /&gt;I think after 2 weeks my neck area looks fantastic!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK UPDATE I really see a great improvement in my neck after a month+.  I will continue using this product! I am going to try their other product for dark circles. Thanks for a great product at great price!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long, however, it goes on smoothly and lightly.  I like that very much!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any results...</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this neck cream!  I disagree with the others about the smell.  It&#x27;s not bad at all...yes, different, but not offensive.  I am 55 years old and the neck area is an important area for me.  This cream firms and gives my neck area a more youthful appearance.  I am now trying it on my face!  I have ordered another one because I don&#x27;t want to run out!  Try it...you won&#x27;t be disappointed...Also, I received a personal e-mail from the Founder and Director (of the product) wanting/interested in how I like the product and how they can improve.  Wow...you never see that!!  Great customer service!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks, and my wrinkles seem to be coming back, the same wrinkles that had almost disappeared after using Vernal moisturizing cream.  I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the second time I&#x27;ve used it. My neck looks great. People say I look younger than my age. Makes me feel good. I am recommending it to my friends who have also had great results. Love the fact it is natural as well. Thank Body Merry.....</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream for 2-3 weeks now. I like the way it moisturizes and will stick with it to hopefully see results in 6-8 weeks.  I really dislike the smell, though. It has no additional fragrances in it- - almost wish they could put something in it to neutralize the scent!</li>
            <li> I use on my neck and face. It goes on smooth and leaves my face feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> I like the non-greasy formula and the fact there isn&#x27;t residual &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; on my neck all day.  I didn&#x27;t take before/after pictures, but I believe there&#x27;s been some positive improvement in my skin.  I do see a younger appearance and tightening.  This is a good deal for the product, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my mom. She loves to try skin products but rarely finds one that really works for her, she has sensitive combination skin and has been using this product for some weeks now and she really likes it. This cream is light it gets absorbed into her skin really fast it isn&#x27;t oily and it&#x27;s fragrance free. The cream hydrates,smooths, firms and lifts the skin but it does take a couple of weeks to see a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and so far so good. I was using Revision Nectifirm at a much higher price. This product does the same for much less. I love the smell and feel of it. I would give it 5 stars but it takes 6-8 weeks for the full affect so I need to wait for that &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; rating. Customer service is outstanding! They email me asking if I&#x27;m satisfied and what I need - if anything. That&#x27;s great in times like this where customer service seems to be a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Body Merry is my new indulgence. I have almost purchased every product in the line.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews.  This cream works wonder on my neck area.  I am starting to get problem where my neck crinkles up whenever I speak.  It doesn&#x27;t look good like that.  No matter what cream I put.  It doesn&#x27;t help to fix this problem until I used this cream.  My neck looks tighter and smoother and doesn&#x27;t crinkle up as much.  I want to subscribe this but they don&#x27;t hv this option.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews I got high hopes and I use most of the can and I do not see a difference, I&#x27;m A male 61 years of age with A Turkey neck so I figured I&#x27;d try this since the reviews were all good not saying that the product is not good but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me the gobbler is still there</li>
            <li> Works fantastic love this product</li>
            <li> The first morning after applying the previous night,  my skin looked NOTICEABLY younger on my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage areas!  After a week, my d&amp;eacute;colletage area has less visible lines, which was my main concern.  This is the best product I have ever used, so I&#x27;m very interested to learn how it will affect my skin after two months.  Hopefully, I&#x27;ll remember to send an update ;-)</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mother to test out on her neck area since she is always complaining about it. She is very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;We have all noticed a difference on her neck, the lines a little smoother, she loves how soft her skin feels. product. The smell is very light and not bothersome at all. The cream doesn&#x27;t leave that weird greasy feeling and it absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect much, despite the reviews, but I could see some difference even after the first night!  If I get the same level improvement every night for a week and maintain it, it will be worth the expense.  If it exceeds that expectation, it will be a real deal!  I will come back and add a note at the end of the month, but so far, it looks like the real deal!</li>
            <li> Have been using it about two months now and have noticed a smoother, firmer neck. It is not greasy, absorbs well.  Recommend every other night to start; I got excited about it and used it every night and my neck became irritated.  So it does have plenty of glycolic acid...I plan to continue using it and explore some of their other products.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this product to me. She&#x27;s in her 30&#x27;s and it really works for her. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s, so don&#x27;t have the same elasticity in my skin as a younger user might. Still, I can see a difference and am glad to be using it. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Five things I love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent-free (ish)&lt;br /&gt;Texture&lt;br /&gt;Chemical Free&lt;br /&gt;No Animal Testing&lt;br /&gt;90 Day 100% Satisfaction Guarantee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At very first sniff, I was able to discern that this product is plant-based and chemical-free. This cream smells just like green plant material with no additional fragrances or perfumes added.  The cream is thick enough that my neck feels adequately moisturized when applied, yet not so thick to leave a heavy film coating or greasiness on my skin.  My skin feels moisturized yet doesn&#x27;t appear super shiny like it did after applying different firming cream in the past.  It is what I would describe as a medium thickness that feels like a light weight cream once applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say the thing that has me impressed the most is that this product has not caused a Rosacea flare up for me.  Facial products are one of my biggest triggers, and I know within 5 minutes of applying a product if I can use it or not.  A reaction includes burning sensation, my face and eck turn Corvette Red, is hot to touch like a fever for hours, and the following day the redness has subsided leaving what looks like acne bumps but are actually part of my Rosacea flare up.  I was nervous and hopeful when trying this product.  Nervous that I simply wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it, and hopeful that since it is so ¨natural¨ that I would have a product that I can use without hiding for days after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two additional positives are that the cream is free of chemicals such as Parabens, Sulphates or Phthalates , and it isn&#x27;t tested on animals  I personally have paid much more for products that don&#x27;t perform as well upon application, so the price is great in my book. One of my favorite things about this product is the 90 day 100% Satisfaction Guarantee, so it is completely risk free to try the product.  For example:  If I had an allergic reaction or simply didn&#x27;t like the cream, then the company will reimburse me, and I don&#x27;t have to return the product. That&#x27;s a win:win situation, for sure.  Just for the record,  I like the product, and I won&#x27;t be returning the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Enhancements I Would Suggest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I would add an additional plant material or two to this cream to change the scent since it does have a natural plant smell instead of no smell at all.  I would add one of the following (or all): lavender which both calming when inhaled and good for skin, Rose which meets the plant qualification but smells amazing, or even something more food plant-like such as vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I would also add the option of a glass bottle in lieu of plastic since so many people are eliminating plastic from their daily routines in both household supplies and product containers.  Many would willingly pay any difference there might be if the glass bottle cost the seller more than plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product an over all high rating because of how well it has worked upon initial application, and I look forward to see how it performs over the next 30-60 days since any sort of firming cream typically has even greater results over greater periods of time.  I recommend trying this product for yourself since the price is very reasonable and it has the Satisfaction Guarantee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received  this cream from manufacturre for testing and review as part of the introduction of this new product on Amazon. I do my best to provide honest and unbiased feedback, and I am always happy to answer comments if I did not cover some aspect of its functionalityt have to return the product.

            <li> Love the Product.  Have noticed results already in just a week. I am 59 yrs old with a wrinkled neck and not looking to do surgery.  I love that the product is not tested on animals and does not contain harsh chemicals.  The company very honest in stating can take up to 6 months to see maximum results.  Continued use if best. I use Hyaluronic Acid cream first then add Neck Cream. I look forward to continued results. Exercise and eating healthy helps also.</li>
            <li> works fantastic!!!! my neck is firm and looks great!!!</li>
            <li> really good cream for the neck.  It says use it one a day but I use it in the morning and night!!</li>
            <li> Ladies (and Gentlemen)  This one you have to try..Trust me when I say I have tried many&lt;br /&gt;products of this type, and this product works extremely well...</li>
            <li> So far, this cream is working very well. Too early for long-term effects, but my early review would be excellent.</li>
            <li> Really like this product!  I use it twice a day and I am finding that my neck is looking a little more firm.  The product is creamy without being too greasy and does not  have an offending scent.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day but don&#x27;t notice any differences in my neck.  I&#x27;ll keep using it ~ maybe it takes months for it to show results?</li>
            <li> Skin is smoother but not sure it changed the &amp;#34; sagging&amp;#34; I was hoping to correct.</li>
            <li> This product is ok. It&#x27;s not the best on the market and it smells like a perm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen dramatic results, but it does seem to help some with tightening neck skin. Mine is loose from 100+lbs weight loss, I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if it continues to improve. The cream itself is light, moisturizing, slightly greasy but not so bad that it bothers me, lovely light cucumber scent. Not sure if I would buy it again after its gone, but we&#x27;ll see after I use it for longer. I love that it is not tested on animals. Seems to smooth skin, but not experiencing the firming or tightening that I had hoped for. I did appreciate their amazing customer service, though!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the fragrance-- cucumbery. Makes my skin smooth for hours, but is very heavy and sweaty in humid summer Southern weather-- Better for me in the Winter.</li>
            <li> Time to review it after 2 months.It works my neck looks younger. I use it at night only. I wake in the day, and the lines are starting to smooth out.&lt;br /&gt; Thank you&lt;br /&gt; better than OIL of OLAY</li>
            <li> I think your Age Defense Neck Cream is amazing.  I was using Strivectin Neck Cream that was more expensive.  I thought I would try yours because of the price but was somewhat apprehensive. To my surprise your products works so much better and is a lot less expensive. I will be buying more and recommending it to friends.</li>
            <li> idk if there&#x27;s a difference but I&#x27;ll finish the bottle. would not buy again though.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference on my neck yet. I&#x27;ve had for a few weeks already.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom as she has been starting to see sagging in her skin and after a week of use she started to notice a major difference.  This stuff works great for her and she&#x27;s already wanting me to order her another bottle.</li>
            <li> I like this neck firming cream. I did notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I guess it is might be okay.  I haven&#x27;t seen anything as far as results go yet after a month.</li>
            <li> Love the product...the seller shipped it promptly and I will be re-ordering!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, my neck looks better, I use it on my hands and they definitely look better.I am 67 years old and will definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li> This is ok..not a great smell. Not as good as Avon&#x27;s tightening product, which I can no longer find. Much prefer Olay&#x27;s Regenerist.</li>
            <li> I just turned 50 and I&#x27;ve notice my neck sagging, with this product my neck appears to tighten up</li>
            <li> Oh I had been cheating and simply using a general lotion on my neck.. what a mistake! This cream is FANTASTIC! It really does firm up the skin on my neck and seems to dissolve some of the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent, thick cream</li>
            <li> Best neck cream I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to see a big difference has done a little bit.</li>
            <li> I never thought neck cream would do much but when I got this for free compliments of Tomoson I had to give it a try. I am impressed at how much younger and firmer my neck looks!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for about three weeks but I have already seen an improvement in the firmness in the skin of my chin and neck. I still have loose skin, but it isn&#x27;t as wrinkled. I hope that my skin will firm more as I continue to use this neck cream. I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This neck cream has not made a difference in my neck, but let&#x27;s be serious.  I am 65 years old and nothing short of cosmetic surgery can bring back the hands of time.  However, I like the texture of this cream.  It has a lovely and rich feel to it, and if it helps to ward off more wrinkles in the future, I will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> smells horrible, not sure if it works yet.</li>
            <li> Almost done my first bottle and it definitely seems to be helping.  I was using something more expensive (ROC), but this works just as well.  It has a light scent, absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  I am not quite forty, but was noticing some minor wrinkling starting on my neck....I have seen the necks of my aunts and did not want to end up like them.  I use it day and night, it seems to help quite a bit and it didn&#x27;t give my any skin irritation or cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> I got this neck cream for a great price bundled with my face serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months. Wish I had started earlier. I was getting some significant neck &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; and these are softening. Overall my neck area looks smoother and tighter. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it seems to be helping. Feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> What I Love about Body Merry&#x27;s Age Defense Neck Cream:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The skin on my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; appears more moisturized, smoother, and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I feel more confident when wearing my favorite v-neck shirts and necklaces!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I enjoy pulling my hair back since the skin on my neck looks so much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The separate bottle for Neck Cream helps me remember to incorporate this step into my nightly beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I feel good that Body Merry incorporates sustainable practices, never tests on animals, and never uses harsh chemicals or added fragrance in their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The product has a pleasant appearance and a fantastic pump dispenser that protects the cream from contamination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided this product for review purposes.</li>
            <li> this cream is working for me. I love it! I am using it almost 3 weeks now, and I can see pleasant change. Firmer skin and look 10 years younger!&lt;br /&gt;Im happy that I found this cream. It was just my lucky guess, since everyones skin is different. Im using very small amount for entire neck area twice a day and still on first bottle. Easy to use, no smell and very nice texture. Thank you! Hope it will be on market with the same price, since I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I just turned 66 years last month and look very good my age, as I am always told when folks hear my true age. The only thing I started to notice was a slight sag at my neck. I researched products and initially purchased a 2-pak offer of Dermagist Neck Restoration Cream for 129.00 2-3 months  via buyerreview.com. It was listed as the #1 neck cream product on their website. I did not see a significant difference and decided to search for neck creams on Amazon.com. I found this one from Body Merry where it was only 19.00, had great reviews and I felt I had to try it. Since I had spent so much on the Dermagist cream, I could not waste it and decided to use both neck creams together, especially since I found the Body Merry cream slight drier that the Dermagist cream. I&#x27;ve only been using the Body Merry for 3 weeks, but I do see an improvement. I will continue to purchase the Body Merry Neck Cream and plan to purchase other Body Merry products since they are all so reasonably priced and all have great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Merry even sent an email outlining how to get the most of the product, which I always find impressive for a retailer to do. In the tips, they stated: &amp;#34;For best results, use it with your regular toner and serum. You can use a hyaluronic acid serum, vitamin c serum or a retinol serum under the cream&amp;#34;. This statement let me know that it was OK for me to use it with the Dermagist neck cream that I had previously purchased. Thanks Body Merry for such apparently good products at such great prices!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, but not greasy.  I think over time this cream will bring more suppleness to my neck/decolette.  I&#x27;ve only been using it now for a couple of weeks, but I plan on continuing.  It&#x27;s good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this product it smelled like Chocolate! And then I checked the ingredient list and found that it has Cocoa Butter in it as one of the many beneficial ingredients. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to get rid of my neck lines.. since I was told by a Plastic Surgeon to keep my neck from bending to reduce neck lines? What?! I guess I&#x27;d rather keep being me than looking funny to look more Beautiful. I know that was a mouthful, but I&#x27;m trying to learn the &#x27;Secret&#x27; of Embracing my &#x27;Inner&#x27; Beauty! I will keep using This Rich and Delicious Moisturizer as  my Night Cream that tends to make me hungry!&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think anything, other than surgery can remove those lines in our neck we get from moving our neck and head about.</li>
            <li> Bought this product on a whim, and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;After 2+ weeks of use- turkey neck is disappearing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in neck firmness in two weeks!! My husband said this really works. Can tell a difference in what he calls the &amp;#34;chicken neck&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks &amp; have not noticed a difference. There is an odd odor to the cream. Makes it difficult to sleep with the smell from the cream at night.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom and she loves it. So 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have used this neck firming cream for about 2 months and am now on my second bottle.  One bottle lasted me about a month and a half.  The creme has made my neck area softer.  I do not see any firming thus far, but I am also 67 years old and haven&#x27;t used the product that long.</li>
            <li> it is the best product I have purchased!  I will absolutely order it again and will be looking for other products from them</li>
            <li> This is a scam. It did nothing to my skin</li>
            <li> No difference. Don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I used this twice now and this is a Holy Grail beauty product. I am waking up with fresh skin that glows. Two days in!! I am 41 years old and nobody guesses my age :-) Now with further use of this amazing product I have miraculous hopes :-) I cant believe how this is already working. I have oily combo skin soo far not a blemish. It actually erased ONE!! I will keep you&lt;br /&gt;updated. This product has so many what i call skin food in it. My skin drinks it up. Two pumps is all I need for face and neck :-) this may be the best skin cream EVER. Umm the packaging is kinda scary. Just rolled in bubble wrap but sealed well. If it keeps cost down I am all for it because this is my go to product</li>
            <li> Very good smelling. This product does firm well. Use it on my arms as well.</li>
            <li> she uses this every night and gives it high praise!</li>
            <li> I have to admit when I purchased this product I didn&#x27;t have high expectations. I was searching for an alternative to the Bliss line I usually use. Given the price and the great reviews I thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try the line out. I&#x27;m so glad that I did. Not only is the product comparable to the bliss neck cream and serum, I feel it actually works better. I haven&#x27;t finished the bottle yet but I&#x27;m already seeing results. I plan on buying another and also looking at the rest of the products in the line. This is a great skincare line and the customer service is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Just okay, I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell to continue to use this. Not a bad smell just not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have using this for a little over a month now and I can see overall improvement in my neck area.  It does seem firmer and some of the sun damage seems to have lightened!</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous! It actually does what it claims. Although, I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin, I recently started getting the lines on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; from side sleeping. Well, this product delivered noticeable results right away. And the scent is yummy - it kind of smells like chocolate - but it doesn&#x27;t linger. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about a month ago.  I&#x27;ve not seen super dramatic results.  However, I have seen improvement over the last couple of weeks.  I started using it under my night time moisturizer, and it really seemed to step things up.  Overall I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product. So far so good! Not oily or runny. Has a good smell. And a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I was given a discount exchange for an honest reivew of this product. I will update after I use the product a few more times.</li>
            <li> This review is for: Best Neck Firming Cream - Daily Moisturizer For Wrinkles and Sagging Skin - Tightens &amp; Smoothes Chest - With Vitamin C + Glycolic Acid + Lactic Acid + CoenzymeQ10 - 1.7 oz - By Body Merry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so nice to have a product that addresses and targets neck wrinkling problems. In the past I&#x27;ve used regular face creams on my neck but i feel this does a much better job. The texture is thick and creamy but does quickly absorb into my skin. The smell is very earthy, I don&#x27;t really like the smell but it&#x27;s not offensive.</li>
            <li> Review from someone soon to be 40! The neck cream produces firming results immediately, I saw a difference right away &amp; am looking forward to seeing even better results as time goes on. This cream seems to provide what it claims &amp; is a worth while purchase!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found the Body Merry line of products! I have been very happy with all of them. This neck cream seems to be helping smooth my neck wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly I like it.....seems to smooth out the neck</li>
            <li> I used this because I had spotted some loose skin on my neck. After using the cream for about 2 weeks I can see a marked difference in the elasticity of my skin.  I concentrated on this area and it is almost completely toned.  I also used it on my upper arms, and in ner thighs. I had surgery and lost alot of weight which left some areas of my body less than toned.  I can see an improvement in all the areas I used it on.  I know that as I keep using it, I will see more and more improvemernt in my skin tone and elasticity. I would recommend this to friends and family members, not only bcause of the efftiveness of the cream but also because  the company contacted  me and asked how the product was working and if I had any questions to feel free to ask.  I thought that this was great because this company honestly took an interest in me and how the cream was working for me.</li>
            <li> Did not see any change on my neck! A little disappointed!</li>
            <li> I really like this. It&#x27;s not a drastic change but I don&#x27;t look like I have a double chin anymore. I use it on my face too. I have one particular crease on my forehead above my right eye that I have noticed improvement in. Again not drastic but a noticeable decrease in depth! I&#x27;m horrible at making sure I use it every day too. I&#x27;ve been doing better the last couple weeks using it 5-6 out of 7 days which is when I really noticed the improvement. One &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; covers my face and neck so it&#x27;s more economically feasible then a lot of others out there.</li>
            <li> Starting to see firmness in my neck after several weeks of usage. Better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is one of the Best.  Have only been using this a few days and can already see and feel a difference</li>
            <li> After reading reviews for this neck cream, I cautiously decided to purchase it.  I figured for the price, it probably was not going to work.  Boy, was I in for a surprise.  I absolutely love this neck cream.  The crepey look on my neck is all but gone.  The overall texture of my skin on my neck is amazing.  I thought I would have to pay an arm and leg for a product that delivers like this one, as I have done in the past with other products.  I am here to tell you that this neck cream is fabulous!</li>
            <li> So, clearly nothing is surgery in a bottle; however, I have to say that I&#x27;ve seen slight improvement in the appearance of my neck. Along with rosacea, I have extremely sensitive skin, yet I was able to immediately start with twice a day applications and had no reactions. The smell is fairly innocuous, unlike some firming creams that I&#x27;ve tried. I will certainly order again.</li>
            <li> I am seeing results in the short time I&#x27;ve stated using this product. my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area are smooth and less crepe. with more use I expect to see greater results with this product.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell , like the texture , it works . delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a helpful product ~ at least as good as Nectifirm and certainly not as pricey. Using it twice a day and have come back for more.</li>
            <li> I just received this product so I&#x27;m really not sure how well it will/won&#x27;t work yet. The company Body Merry seems to want the product to work as well for me as I want it to work and sent me an email telling me what to do when and what to expect when. This product can&#x27;t be used one time with results, it&#x27;s a work in progress thing for about 6wks. I only received the product a couple of days ago and I don&#x27;t feel any tightening on the neck area nor do I see any results as of yet, so the results are not immediate which wasn&#x27;t a surprise for me. We&#x27;ll see in about 6 wks. if I want to buy it again. Company was wonderful to send the email though.</li>
            <li> I could not tell any difference.  I&#x27;ve used now for at least 3 months</li>
            <li> I was chosen to test this product and provide my unbiased product review. I have not used this product long but I am starting to notice some firmness. I am 45 so I don&#x27;t have young skin. I am excited to see more results with my continued use.</li>
            <li> I did not expect this product to show such a difference when I ordered it to replace another that was out of stock. After just a few days I could tell a difference and now after one month, even in pictures my neck/chest are much smoother and firmer. It lasts a long time as well. I will&lt;br /&gt;Continue to buy!!</li>
            <li> I have been using according to instructions for a few weeks and have not noticed any change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Does what it says but a lot of money for the size. Don&#x27;t know if I will buy again because there are other products out there which are just as good and you get more product.</li>
            <li> So far so good....it seems to lift and tighten...</li>
            <li> Love the smell but have to give it some time. So far I really like it .</li>
            <li> Since I have neglected my skin for many years, I&#x27;m now desperately finding a solution for my wrinkles and other skin problems. I have tried many expensive brands with non or negative results. I&#x27;m using this product for a few days, I have no problems with my sensitive skin and it feels smooth. I will continue to use this product for longer time to see if my skin improve.</li>
            <li> Love having a product for just my neck! Smells and feels amazing. The neck, decolletage and back of hands is supposedly the first to show age.</li>
            <li> This product WORKS! I have noticed visible improvements, which is exactly what I wanted...what we ALL want. Some don&#x27;t like the smell. I love it! It smells like cucumbers. If you don&#x27;t like it, no worries, the smell is gone in no time because it absorbs into the skin and goes to work! It has a great texture. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product that is WELL worth the price! And don&#x27;t let the small bottle fool you. It goes a long way! I will definitely be buying this again...</li>
            <li> I have been consistently using this cream and noticed some improvement.  I realize surgery would make a bigger difference, however that is not an option for me now so I will continue using the cream.  I think I am about half way through the bottle because it&#x27;s pretty concentrated. I don&#x27;t love the smell of it and luckily it does not linger. I do like the high amount of natural ingredients and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have faith, so I hope it will work :)</li>
            <li> The product made my skin itch after a week. I have to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I really love this cream.  I think it has made a difference.</li>
            <li> As a man, it&#x27;s a little outside my comfort zone to use this product. It&#x27;s a lot outside my comfort zone to recommend it and review it. A few key points that come up again and again in the reviews, and my opinions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Does it work? Yes. I&#x27;ve seen material changes in the tightness of the skin and level of &#x27;creases&#x27; in my neck area. This is not a magic serum that makes fat necks skinny or turkey necks suddenly tight. But it does assist in the elasticity of skin and making some creases less or go away.&lt;br /&gt;2. How does it smell? There is a good scent. For women who may not want to &#x27;mess&#x27; with their scent (perfumes, etc.), I would say that the scent is nice, but by no means overpowering. It would be hidden by any other additional scent you may care to use, and is certainly in no way a negative of the product. For men, it&#x27;s fine and not feminine.&lt;br /&gt;3. How long does it last? I&#x27;ve had a single bottle (just reordered). I use one &#x27;pump&#x27; 1-2 times a day, 5-6 days a week and it&#x27;s been almost 3 months. Well worth the cost per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, the outreach from customer service indicates this company, if you needed them, would have solid support of their product.</li>
            <li> It does firm the skin. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Noticed a difference immediately. I use on my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage. It smells great and is not full of smelly chemicals which I&#x27;m sensitive to. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> My age really shows on my neck and chest area, 60.  not expecting much , but hoping for the best, I purchased the product.  I am slowly seeing a difference and I&#x27;m happy with &#x27;slowly&#x27;.  I will certainly be getting more and plan to use this neck cream for a long time.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase!  It works exactly as the reviews stated.</li>
            <li> The appearance of my neck has improved, appears smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as  I expected. The price  is good.  Good moisturizer, but no tightening of the neck as product claims.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know it I should review this or it may be just too soon. I have only used it a few days and no difference at all yet. Got my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> My neck to my chest look great!!!!! I have ordered this twice already this tell you it works. My neck is firmer!!! In just a month with eating right and losing weight I almost there.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell of it.</li>
            <li> omg omg omg omg omg. This cant be true!! Am 37 and started seeing some sagging in the neck area. I didnt know there was something pacific for it. I saw this and bought without hesitation. Omg it work on contacted. Like a miracle wand. BOOM Gone!! I love you jajaja</li>
            <li> Awesome product, my wife says this stuff is the bomb!</li>
            <li> I love the way my neck looks after using this product. I am in my 60&#x27;s and use this day and night. My chicken neck look is gone. I feel so much younger now. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it for a Month and no longer use any of my Lancôme facial product, because this product is so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my neck and face. My skin is looking better than when I used Vissionaire or Genifique by Lancôme.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly pleased with this neck cream as a whole.  I thoroughly enjoy the consistency of the cream with it not being too thick or heavy on the skin, and I also love the light scent that makes it suitable for men and women.  This is a wonderful product that will help those that are being proactive about their beauty/skin regimens.  No time like the present for those who are not.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> They discontinued the neck cream I normally used and loved so I did a lot of research before I decided on Body Berry&#x27;s Neck Firming &amp; tightening cream.  I really like it.  I felt immediate results and though there is no cure for fat under chin (unless surgically removed/or the new shots they have now) I felt it has been the best so far.  I&#x27;ve dealt with this problem all my life-the turkey chin-I inherited it.  Body Berry definitely works the best of anything I&#x27;ve tried and I will continue to use it.  In fact, I liked it so much that I purchased the antiage serum to use underneath it.  Works great under makeup and you need to use a makeup or moisturizer with SPF if going to be outside, since body berry neck cream doesn&#x27;t have it in it.  I&#x27;m very happy and will con&#x27;t to use.  Never used any Body Berry products before and so far I&#x27;m very pleased.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I started using this neck cream about a month ago and I had pretty low expectations. I was losing hope that a product in this price range would actually do much other than just moisturize. I was starting to think I was going to have to cave and she&#x27;ll out a lot of money for something that had a better chance of working. For the first two weeks or so, the only change I noticed was that the skin on my neck wasn&#x27;t as dry as it had been. That change was nice, but not enough of an improvement that it made me feel I hadn&#x27;t overpaid for the cream. However, sometime between days 14 and 25 something changed. I didn&#x27;t really notice the gradual change, but when I thought to look for a difference today, I noticed an obvious tightening of the skin. It&#x27;s not a complete fix (yet), but now I feel like the product really is working, so I plan to continue to use it. If you buy this neck cream, do not give up hope if you don&#x27;t see changes in the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> This cream actually seemed to make the skin on my neck dryer.</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly, great communication, money back guarantee.  Product works wonderful on neck, moisturizes without feeling greasy, tightens, and fades neck rings.  It&#x27;s comparable to creams that are 3 times more expensive, and I have tried many!  I love this product because it has not only the necessary ingredients such as glycolic acid and the CoQ10, but has organic ingredients in it also....best of both worlds.  I bought is specifically for my neck but also use it on my face to tighten and get rid of fine lines, and it also smells great!  I am a fan.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and apply it every morning and evening on my neck and under my eyes. I do see a difference in my neck and around my eyes. My neck has tightened up slightly and the bags under my eyes have reduced to about half. My crows feet seem to be going away also. I will continue to use this product until it runs out and send another product update at that time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I can see some lines diminishing after about a month. Hope with more use, they will all go away. The cream glides on like silk and leaves my neck feeling moisturized and supple. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This item is a wonderful moisturizer.  I enjoyed my dealings with the sellar.  They are extremely professional and go over and above to assist you with what will work right for you.  Would recomend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant neck cream ...... I really enjoyed using it .....  It made my neck very smooth....</li>
            <li> Evidently the person in the video was an employee. No improvement. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was showing the signs of age on my neck.  What a difference this cream has made for me.  After a few weeks of use, the saggy skin has diminished.  I just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am trying this product, I don&#x27;t see any change yet  maybe I need to give it more time</li>
            <li> This is the second container I ordered of the neck firming and tightening cream since I started to see results after about 3 weeks. There are fewer vertical lines in my neck and it generally looks more hydrated. The cream also has a very pleasant smell, reminds me of cucumbers.  I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products and this is the first one that has made any difference.</li>
            <li> This cream rocks.  I bought it because of the online reviews I found - I needed something that worked fast and well because my daughter was getting married in about a month, so I pretty much started from ground zero with this.  And within the first week, I saw a dramatic difference.  I actually used it on my face, under my eyes and on my neck, and by wedding time, lines were gone, skin was noticeably tighter, and actually glowing.  And this vendor delivered quickly and hassle free.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> More than pleased with initial experience.  while results take time, the first two weeks of application yield results which far exceeded any expectations! Recommended to all seeking wrinkles relief and firming results - absolutely without hesitation!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like it, not working.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like some lotions so.</li>
            <li> I like this. I think it makes me break out, so I only use it when I go out. I put it on my arms, though, and it makes them firmer. I&#x27;m still fat, so does it matter? I like the way it smells, and so does Yetta. She also likes my deodorant. Like please get your nose out of my armpits, Yetta.</li>
            <li> The product works as described.I made a second purchase and intend to keep buying the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a little less than one month,  I can&#x27;t see a difference yet but hope too by the time the container is gone.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working. Iv&#x27;e been using it for several months every night.</li>
            <li> I am 49 and have always had a double chin thanks to genetics! But I was starting to have some sagging skin that was really looking bad! I have been using this cream for a few weeks and the sagging skin is pretty much gone, along with the lines on my neck being less visible.  I know that nothing short of surgery will get rid of my double chin, but this cream has worked wonders! All for an affordable price!</li>
            <li> It is giving me red itchy splotches on my neck.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin very soft and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> read about the ingredients in a promotion of a more expensive cream created by beverly hills doctors. This product doesn&#x27;t have the caviar, but has most of the other ingredients and is much less expensive than the caviar based doctor cream. I&#x27;m pleased with this cream. Whatever effect is subtle in my case, but I believe it is working, been using it for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Seems to smooth fine lines and firm up the neck a bit.</li>
            <li> Great product , very pleased due to not being greasy like others or causing a rash either since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I do see an improvement in neck elasticity but the smell takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> amazing! can&#x27;t wait to try the eye cream</li>
            <li> I received this device in turn for an honest evaluation. My wife desired to do this product simply because the girl recognized excess weight close to the girl throat. She is practically 42 in addition to wanted a program this way one particular. She has employed this kind of for a couple days in addition to she&#x27;s got recognized the goods securing your skin close to the girl throat. My wife will keep employ this product because doing so is actually employed by the girl. You can in no way win the actual competition towards period, although we can discover goods in which guide us all in the process.</li>
            <li> I like trying out various lotions and creams so I was interested in this Age Defense Neck Cream that I got for free* to try and review. I have sensitive skin so the first thing I always look for in any skin product is how my skin initially reacts to it. I have not had any bad reactions to this cream so it’s safe to say it is safe for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is of about medium thickness, not super thick like a heavy cream but also not runny like a thinner lotion. I like to rub it into my neck and chest when I dry off right after showering. I find that as long as I am completely dry where I am putting it that it absorbs into my skin, not leaving any kind of film behind. This is important as I really dislike lotions and creams that leave a dirty or greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product hasn’t done much to change my skin, other than moisturizing it well. However I am still giving it 5 stars because its age defense, so it is meant to help prevent the signs of aging and I’d say that my neck is still looking good. I’d like to think that I am not in need yet of lifting and firming of my skin in those areas, but who knows when I will so the hope is using this will continue to improve the look of my skin and keep it looking great at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting this Age Defense Neck Cream for free this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy.  I we definitely re-order</li>
            <li> So far no changes but also no skin break outs, unlike other very expensive ones that really make my skin so oily.</li>
            <li> I waited to do a review on this product to make sure it was working. The wrinkly appearance of turkey  neck is gone after 3 weeks and double chin is improving I am happy to say this product does work for me. Would tell others to give it a try and hopefully it will work for you too. I will reorder this product soon and will do another review after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I have tried high-end neck creams and low-end neck creams.  Of ALL of them, this one gives the most results and almost instantly.  The first time I applied, I noticed a tightening (and moisturizing!).  I have now been using for 1 week.  Before using this cream, I would look at my neck in my car&#x27;s rearview mirror and be horrified at how old my neck appeared.  NOW, however, I am very pleasantly surprised that the skin looks tight and the lines in my neck from sleeping, etc., are greatly diminished and the skin appears fuller.  I am very pleased overall with the price and the results and highly recommend this cream.  BUY IT!  If you have severe turkey-neck, this product will obviously not work as well, but it is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Dont work even a little</li>
            <li> As a part of a product trial through Tomoson, I got to try for free, the #BodyMerry Neck Firming and Tightening Cream , which I have also been using for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a great product to try out. I have been using on my face daily. What I love about it is that it&#x27;s not oily or greasy, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin looking that way either.  It contains great nutrients and I like that the scent isn&#x27;t too strong.&lt;br /&gt;I never really thought about moisturizing my neck and haven&#x27;t noticed that my skin was aging as I am only 29, but it&#x27;s better to be proactive. My skin definitely holds its moisture longer after using this and looks more firm and smooth. This is my own unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> did not do what was expected and stated on advertisement for it.  leaves neck &#x27;tacky&#x27; instead of any firm feeling</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says it works just as well as some of the really expensive neck-firming creams.</li>
            <li> bye bye &amp;#34;age rings&amp;#34;.  this cream is just amazing. I&#x27;ve used it for a week now in conjunction with the retinol moisturizer and those &amp;#34;rings&amp;#34; we gals get around our necks have diminished greatly!! started using the eye cream and have the same high hopes for my under eye crinkles and crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> works for me :) I have reordered three times. I feel very happy to leave a five star review. All were actual purchases by me not a  promo review.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It smells nice and absorbs quickly!</li>
            <li> I haves received this product for free to review and I can&#x27;t believe how good it is. I apply it to my neck area and it seems like I&#x27;m seeing results already. It smells great and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Only been using a few weeks but seems to have improved my neck . Will wait to see if as time goes on there is more  improvement .</li>
            <li> I returned this bottle as soon as I received it because it very clearly states on the back to avoid sunlight. It doesn&#x27;t tell you that in the description before you purchase. It may be an amazing cream. But I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk the damages that sunlight could have caused with this cream on my skin.</li>
            <li> I did notice an improvement of tightness of the skin around my neck area after a few days.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks but I see a difference in the way my skin looks and feels. I will definitely purchase this product again. I have had really good luck with all the Body Merry products.</li>
            <li> Super excited! I used it for the first time this morning and again just now before bed. I can see a difference already! I&#x27;m in my late 30s and was just begging to see the first signs of aging in my neck. After this morning&#x27;s first application, I noticed a difference. I already told a frind about it. I&#x27;m very happy and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Marjorie</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a few weeks and I understand it takes 6-8 weeks for the best results but so far I have been very impressed with the cream.  It is odorless, feels great upon application and I do think my neck is looking firmer.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Loving this! I was looking for a product just for my neck and found this! Smells good , goes on nicely not greasy!</li>
            <li> Great cream for the neck, face and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area. Leaves skin feeling soft and firm at the same time. Definitely a welcome addition to my wife&#x27;s daily skin regimen. She&#x27;s tried some on me and I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes me feel younger and i Am very insecure about my neck. This product helps</li>
            <li> I love this firming neck cream!  The consistency of the cream is really nice and it quickly absorbs into my skin.  The bottle dispenses just the right amount and the cream feels so good on my skin.  It has improved the texture of the skin on my neck and it looks better every day.  There are no harsh ingredients or fragrance that might irritate your skin.  It is made in the USA by a company that doesn&#x27;t do animal testing.  This is an awesome product and one I don&#x27;t want to run out of.  This will be a daily staple in my skin care routine!</li>
            <li> I have lost weight and my neck was getting flabby looking.  Ordered the firming cream and have started using.  Like the cream so far.</li>
            <li> Wow, I don&#x27;t remember when I was as pleased with a product as I am with this. I am so grateful for the reviews that made me want to try it. I have so many products that have done nothing and this comes along and I am seeing it work right away. You have nothing to lose trying it and I know that you will see a difference. Thank you</li>
            <li> Not the improvement in the firmness I had expected.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly - item just as described.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a month now and I&#x27;m happy so far, hopefully it will keep improving my skin.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Love It!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Body Merry Neck Firming and Tightening Cream approximately a month ago for my Mother, on Amazon. My Mother was searching for a neck cream that could firm and erase the wrinkles which were beginning to show on her neck. Because as everyone knows, even if you may look many years younger than your actual age, the neck tends to betray one&#x27;s age.&lt;br /&gt;My Mother has diligently used the neck cream for about a month, and so far she is rather pleased with the current results. Her neck is much softer, as well as smoother. The wrinkles are reducing and are not nearly as noticeable as they were prior to her beginning the regimen of applying Body Merry&#x27;s Neck Firming Cream. I&#x27;m pleased with the results of the Body Merry for my mother, and I even plan on taking a look at some of their other products for myself.</li>
            <li> I love this neck firming cream.  It is completely odorless and non-greasy.  Have only been using it for a couple days, so will give further update in a week or two.  So far, I love it!</li>
            <li> This neck cream is creamy colored with mild scent. The consistency is thick, but is easily applied to my neck.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it moisturizes my neck well. The pump is easy to use and makes no mess.</li>
            <li> Positive reviews were  posted by customers pain to try product. DO NOT BUY! garbage!</li>
            <li> Have been using 2 weeks and can see a difference.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> I think I can see a difference in the lifting of my cheeks. I will keep using it and see where it takes me.</li>
            <li> Have used this now for just over a week.  It exfoliates as it moisturizes.  I am just starting to notice some firming around my jaw line and just under the jaw.  It will take more use to see more results.  So far, so good.  Feels great on, absorbs quickly, and can be used day and night under moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I can see a slight difference with this stuff. I gained a little weight and as a result my face got fatter. I developed a double chin that made me very self-conscious. I use this twice a day and I can tell it really helps to shape the skin under my neck and make it feel less loose.&lt;br /&gt;I will repurchase once it&#x27;e empty.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a noticeable smell.</li>
            <li> I feel like this prodect has not only helped firm up my neck but also my face. It does not make my sensitive skin break out either which is a big deal to me because so many products do.  Also, I love the smell! Smells like cucumbers &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The neck is my new obsession when it comes to wrinkles, I just realized that  I&#x27;m getting old and stuff is not like it used to be there!  I apply it every night and it has really improved how it looks and feels.  And I feel over time, it&#x27;ll will prevent further wrinkles!  Great product.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Great seller!</li>
            <li> No difference after a week. If it changes I will repost.</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on fancy brands when it comes to neck cream.&lt;br /&gt;That cream has all the ingredients that you want in a product when you want some results.&lt;br /&gt;Even my husband likes it, the smell is nice and organic. Nothing overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought the neck firming cream, but it really did not do anything.</li>
            <li> I began using this cream a week ago and my neck is noticeably tighter.  I recently had a big weight loss and I&#x27;m close to 60 years old.  People began noticing and mentioning the difference.  I highly recommend this cream and now my friends are all going to order this too.  IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I LOVE body merry products. I&#x27;m obsessed with their eye cream and retinol moisturizer. I&#x27;m 37 and don&#x27;t have any neck sagging, yet lol. I purchased this because of the photo reviews and also the review that said it works for &amp;#34;neck rings&amp;#34;. I have two neck rings, no clue why; and they are worsening with age. This product did nothing to correct that issue. However it&#x27;s intensely moisturizing without being too thick and greasy. It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer but if you need it to reduce lines around your neck, I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
            <li> This cream does just as it says, I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> what can I say love this cream the skin of my neck look firmer and tighter amazing cream, I dont want to be without it.</li>
            <li> I really like the body merry skin care line. The neck cream works well but better on top of the hyaluronic acid dew serum. Very light almost melon smell, not watery or thick. Fills in the lines on my neck</li>
            <li> Love this cream-makes my neck so soft!</li>
            <li> None greasy, moisturizing and obsorbe instantly.  See result fast.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing!  I noticed a difference the first night.  I use it on my face, neck &amp; chest.  I have oily skin &amp; this doesn&#x27;t break it out which is hard to find in a product.  I purchased three more bottles.</li>
            <li> Thanking you for this neck cream. It is a fabulous product and i see a big difference in the appearance of my neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month.  I&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s firmed and tightened, because I&#x27;ve used other neck creams- but I love how it goes on and how smooth and soft my skin feels.  I also like the reasonable price.  I will continue to purchase this product.  I am 65.</li>
            <li> Really great neck. Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Had so much high hopes for this product. I thought Yeiiii!!! I I found something good that is cheaper than Nectufirm!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat what is prescribed by a doctor, should&#x27;ve followed his advice and stuck with Nectufirm.&lt;br /&gt;I used religiously morning and night, It does smell good and l liked that it was not greasy, it absorbs really well, which is nice specially at night if you are going straight to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I do however have to say that I love the cellulite cream they make, I will continue to buy that, and I will also try the stretch marks cream.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much because I would like to use it on my entire face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased and will continue to use daily.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully. I have been using this for two weeks and love the difference I see.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!  This stuff works!  I used it twice yesterday and woke up this morning with no more stretchy skin on my neck.  I&#x27;m 33 years old and over the last year I have noticed the beginnings of a waddle neck.  Stretched out, sagging skin right under my chin.  It runs in my family and after two babies and my weight fluctuating over the past 4 years - it had taken it&#x27;s toll.  I am now back to my pre-baby weight but the skin on my neck had lost some of it&#x27;s elasticity.  It wasn&#x27;t super noticeable, but it was to me and I&#x27;ve been obsessing over it ever since.  For such a great price this neck firming cream is AH-MAZING.  I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last but I will continue to use it twice a day as it recommends in the directions.  I should also mention that it is super creamy and has a nice subtle smell to it - kind of like cucumber, very mild.  I am beyond excited that this worked for me!</li>
            <li> No. Just no. It stinks and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> this product was amazing the usual scent from body merry i dont know what it is but it attracts me to it like a moth to light, it&#x27;s light creamy not greasy at all. i have been using it for a few days and i notice my double chin taking off, becoming smaller and smaller. i did notice the container and package are so cute now too! and the new easy tops on the container makes it more pleasant to use! Light airy fragrance being all natural is just perfect for me, i cant wait to see a flat chin soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have nothing but GREAT things to say about Body Merry! I have religiously used so many of their products and repurchased some of their creams because they worked so well on my sensitive and perpetually problematic skin! I am in my mid thirties and I love incorporating Anti Aging Products into my skin care routine. It&#x27;s all in the premise of &amp;#34;prevention is better than cure&amp;#34; - something to that effect. This Neck Firming and Tightening Cream, like all their products, work/ed wonderfully! My mom started using this cream too, and love it as there is a significant and dramatic difference on her neck after she religiously started using her own bottle that I bought for her. This product is truly worth checking and purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Only been a few days but happy thus far!! only takes one pump to cover my neck, i use an additional half a pump  on my jawls...cant have a tight neck a saggy jawls!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product. It feels good on my skin, I&#x27;ve had skin sensitivities with lots of other items. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it helps with wrinkles. So far I like it.</li>
            <li> Has not worked for me.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference almost immediately.  Will buy more.</li>
            <li> So sorry to say that I am not seeing any difference. I am a very young looking 47 and most people guess my age at about 36. I am seeing a bit of turkey neck starting and wanted to be proactive and purchase this cream to help delay this horrible look. I purchased this product due to the great reviews. I wondering if these are really actual customers since I am getting no results what so ever. I use it every morning and have had an open mind and optimistic hopefulness for this product. Sure wish I were getting the results everyone else has :(</li>
            <li> I have tried several new serums and creams and found that this product had the most satisfying results.  I&#x27;m a 60 something women who has had several serious operations this past year and have put on weight, lost the luster of nice skin after years of hard work.  I&#x27;m somewhat on the mend and have lost some weight, so my decollete was looking like cellulite.  After using this for several weeks, this has made a wonderful improvement.  I don&#x27;t really have a problem with my neck per se, but it has become more moist and supple.  I have ordered a second bottle.  Oh by the way, I have not received this product free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Nice texture to cream. Haven&#x27;t noticed any visible difference but it is a nice cream.</li>
            <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Merry comes to you today in this product review with a neck cream for age defense. I have never used a neck cream prior to applying this cream so I was unsure what to expect really. This cream is a moisturizer that can be applied to the neck and chest area to firm, smooth and improve the skin. The cream holds vitamins, antioxidants and AHAs. There are NO harsh ingredients and some of the few ingredients that are natural include things like Lemongrass, Rosehip Oil and Licorice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I received was 1.7 Oz and I used it morning and night. After just one application, I found that my skin felt firmer and soft to the touch. Body Merry is a brand I trust because they offer you a money back guarantee if you are unhappy with your results. With one pump, this cream should last you for a month or two and it is at such a reasonable price that there is no reason that you should not continue to use it for youthful looking skin as you enter into the future. The cream immediately absorbed into my skin and had a slight scent of a sunscreen to it, nothing unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great product. A+</li>
            <li> This made my neck so smooth. I really like using this. Body Merry is honestly one of my favorite brands to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this for a review, but my opinion is 100% honest!</li>
            <li> i received this item a couple of days ago, and here goes my honest opinion: the cream is easy and pleasant to use. On the poor side: I had to push on the pump dispenser a few times before it started dosing the ointment; but that&#x27;s expected with any new pump dispenser. On the good side: the scent of this cream is a combination of cocoa and flowers. The smell lasts all night long, and for me, it&#x27;s soothing and calming. The cream isn&#x27;t at all oily or sticky, it&#x27;s well absorbed. I feel my neck soft and smooth. I also use it on my chin and face: the perfect substitute for expensive night creams. It does seem to make my sagging skin appear firmer and tighter. I don&#x27;t expect marvels  but visual improvements might be seen later. Would definitely recommend it for aging skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Body Merry Age Defense Neck Cream for about two weeks. The first thing I notice, is that it takes about 10 pumps until you actually see the product coming out of the bottle. When you apply the cream to your neck, you can smell an herbal scent that Body Merry is known for. The good thing is it&#x27;s not as strong as some of the other Body Merry products I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m glad that they are improving the scent. Once you apply it on your neck it instantly feels like your skin gets tighten. You can feel a light tingling sensation, and then it wears off after about five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s only been about two weeks, I don&#x27;t see dramatic results. To be completely honest my neck looks pretty good, but I like to use products like Body Merry Age Defense Neck Cream to prevent any sagging in the future. I really love that while it&#x27;s treating my skin it&#x27;s also moisturizing it. The skin around my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area also looks smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Body Merry Age Defense Neck Cream is a great product. I will disagree where they mention that there are no fragrances. There is definitely a fragrance, it may not be artificial but it sure does smell like herbs. Other than that, I will continue to use the Body Merry Age Defense Neck Cream as part of my anti-aging skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was sent the Body Merry Age Defense Neck Cream complimentary for review purposes. However, the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> The skin on my neck was like crepe paper, due to radiation and chemo a couple years back.  None of my regular moisturizers felt like they got below the surface.  I have been using the Neck Cream morning and night and the skin on my neck is soft and smooth.  I feel like there may be some lifting and firming going on, but I can&#x27;t be sure yet.  I will be reordering this product again.  It is affordable and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Save your money...it doesn&#x27;t do a thing!  You can rub any cream on and it will do the same thing!</li>
            <li> Works well, great moisturizer, does leave a slightly sticky texture but seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I like it but use very sparingly</li>
            <li> Ahhh, the old turkey neck. It&#x27;s one of those things I don&#x27;t always notice on myself when looking straight into a mirror or in photos when I&#x27;m facing the camera.....but boy is it a shock when I catch myself sideways or in the background of photos.....I think, &amp;#34;Who IS that????!&amp;#34;.......then I realize it&#x27;s ME!!! I haven&#x27;t been photo-bombed by an escaped side show human-turkey....there isn&#x27;t some weird apparition in the mirror....that&#x27;s my neck....(so disregard that email I sent you, Paranormal Studies Institute!!) Now that I&#x27;ve established that it&#x27;s actually my face, let&#x27;s see what we can do about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the long list of natural &amp; organic ingredients inside the pump tube (which dispenses just the right amount --- no shooting out &amp; wasting product!) You won&#x27;t find any harsh ingredients, chemicals, parabens, or phthalates inside, which is important to me when looking at skin care products.  They also state that there are no fragrances inside, but I think they mean there are no artificial fragrances - because there definitely is a scent to the cream (which I found to not be really pleasant, but it&#x27;s not awful) -- it reminds me of the smell of grass and tea - but I think if someone buys it based on its claims of &amp;#34;no fragrance&amp;#34;, they will be surprised and maybe a little disappointed. I think they should consider rewording this for future packaging.&amp;#60;--and, while I&#x27;m being picky, the tiny white font on the back of the label is extremely hard to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the consistency of the cream and I can feel an instant tingling (not unpleasant) and tightening feeling going on (again, not unpleasant, just feels like something is happening!)  As I received this in order to review &amp; give my honest feedback, the million dollar question is.....so does it work? Have I seen any major improvements? No, I can&#x27;t lie and say that I have, but if there was any product that could rid you of a turkey neck in just a few weeks, people would be lined up to pay 100x the cost of this!! Did it hurt adding it to my skin care repertoire? Absolutely not - I&#x27;ll keep using it for sure- and who knows what it will do after 8 weeks or several months of using. I like the tightening feel it gives me....and love using it when I&#x27;m about to go out for an extra lift, so long term effects are still up in the air, but I definitely temporary improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price can&#x27;t be beat for the quality ingredients, it&#x27;s made in the USA, and they don&#x27;t test on animals.pay 100x the cost of this!!

            <li> Fragrance was not my favorite :/</li>
            <li> I definitely notice the difference, however, I am 69 and didn&#x27;t expect a miracle.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly,light but pleasant scent. i&#x27;ve only been useing this for a couple of weeks so my neck is not all firmed up, but i&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> Loved  it,just reordered another</li>
            <li> Used this cream for about 3 weeks and can see visible results already, the skin on my neck has become way smoother &amp; tighter, even my chin has tightened, very happy with this cream &amp; can&#x27;t beat the price; dear women, do not miss the back of your neck when applying any cream, it&#x27;s aging as well.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy this cream again.&lt;br /&gt;Beatrisa</li>
            <li> I am using it for about 4 weeks and can see feel the difference. My skin feels soft and tight. My sister even noticed it and after using for 2-3 times ordered for herself. I am going to continue using it see the results for another 4 weeks and update my feed. I also like the fact that its not breaking my wallet.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service from this company...firming my neck is a monumental challenge thanks for trying!</li>
            <li> Ladies should not neglect the delicate skin on their necks and d&amp;eacute;colletage, but applying really expensive face creams there feels extravagent. Based on the reviews and ingredients I decided to try this cream. I recognize the ingredients, and the smell, which is not unpleasant. It has not irritated my sensitive skin, and keeps the moisture level high. I apply this to my neck, d&amp;eacute;colletage and the backs of my hands, then usually put another cream over it, especially in winter, to lock in the moisture. My skin looks great, feels hydrated and some of those very fine lines that middle aged ladies start finding on their d&amp;eacute;colletage have been reduced. It is not a miracle cream, but I try many creams in my quest to defy the appearance of age, and this is my second bottle, which means that I&#x27;m happy with the performance, and after running out of the original bottle, I noticed its absence. I do recommend this product for its natural ingredients, no nonsense packaging and a great price! I have not used it on my face, so I cannot attest to its performance in that area.</li>
            <li> I noticed the size of the skin pores on my face have gotten smaller after one week.</li>
            <li> Product seems to work well so far, smells wonderful and does not cause any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference after 2 months.</li>
            <li> I feel this product is helping, and probable with more time will increase. I like the natural ingredients, and the customer service is great!</li>
            <li> It has only been a few weeks but I do notice an improvement in the skin on my neck and chest!  The skin feels and appears tighter and less wrinkled!</li>
            <li> I finally found a great neck cream.  This one really works on mature 50+ skin. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a few&lt;br /&gt;days and its already helping tighten up the skin, and leaves a silky feel.  I&#x27;ve had to return so many neck serums due&lt;br /&gt;to ineffectiveness and they charged a lot more $$ than this product.  I paid for this product out of my own pocket, so this&lt;br /&gt;review is from one who paid for the product outright.  I tend to listen less to those who have been sent free product for a review&lt;br /&gt;as I think many of those reviews are biased in some cases.  I&#x27;m a very satisfied paying customer.  For gals 50+ this ones a winner. ;-)</li>
            <li> After your face, your neck is the next most visible part of the body, and in order to keep it looking youthful, it’s important to find the best neck cream to tighten sagging skin in the area. Unfortunately, the neck is a part of the body that is often neglected when it come to skin care routines. We forget to cover it up, or to moisturize it with the best neck cream, and we rarely put sunscreen on it. Instead, we might put some regular lotion on it now and then, while focusing almost exclusively on the maintenance of facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a cream that will smooth the skin around your neck and jawline area, then Neck Firming and Tightening Cream with Vitamin C  is the perfect cosmetic product for you. after using this cream for about 7 days, I saw some tremendous results that will literally leave you speechless.This cream will easily smooth the skin tissue and rejuvenate it in a short amount of time. All of the easily visible wrinkles and lines will start to diminish as you apply the cream on a daily basis. Also, i must mention that it will also hydrate the skin, bring back its elasticity and make it look fresh and silky. Your skin will become much tighter and your skin will start to regain its firmness. Another positive thing about this product is the fact that it is perfect for every skin type out there. As a result to that, everyone can use this cream, even people who have sensitive skin that is prone to blackheads, acne and red blemishes. It does not cause negative effects that can be harmful to the skin. The cream is based on a lot of natural ingredients. If you keep on applying the cream first thing in the morning and before you go to sleep, you will see tremendous results in just a few days after the first time you have applied this cream. I loved this product and I would recommend it to all my friends. i received a free sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This product contains vitamins, antioxidants and AHAs. 4% Vitamin C, 5% Glycolic Acid and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) are supported by powerful natural and organic ingredients such as Plant Derived Hyaluronic Acid, Propolis, Royal Jelly, Cocoa Butter, Jojoba Oil, Green Tea, Avocado Oil, Licorice, Lemongrass and Rosehip Oil, to name just a few. Like all our products, the formula is free from harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulfates and phthalates. That makes me happy to know as I do not want any harsh chemicals on my skin. However I didnt notice much of a change will continue to use til I see results.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this product for free as a review. I am loving it. I have been using it a little over a month and I can tell a difference in my chest and neck. I use it every night after my bath when my skin is the softest. It goes on light but its a thick cream. It rubs in well, and leaves no smell. If you are looking for something that can be used on sensitive skin then this will work for you. My skin is sensitive and I followed the directions and only use it once a day. Its working. I like this product, if you are looking for a neck cream then this one by Body Merry will work for you I am sure, give it a try!</li>
            <li> Lovely texture and does seem to help my neck area without heavy scent</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that takes you off guard.  I put it on the first night I got it, and I actually saw results in the morning.  Instead of pleased, I was skeptical.  I&#x27;m 62 years old, there&#x27;s a lot of chicken skin going on, and wrinkles.  It&#x27;s been three weeks now, and I cannot believe the difference.  I wish I had taken a before picture.  This is like getting a new hairstyle and when you see yourself in the mirror, it takes you a minute.  Every time I see myself, I can&#x27;t believe how much improved my neck and chest are.  The wrinkles aren&#x27;t gone, but they&#x27;re noticeably less visible, softer looking.  The chicken skin is firmer, too.  I&#x27;ve had two people ask me if I&#x27;ve lost weight (?!!).  There is a bit of a funny smell with the neck cream.  It reminds me of the old Nair a little.  It doesn&#x27;t last long, just the first few minutes.  I&#x27;d still use this product, even if it smelled like Nair all day long!</li>
            <li> I am not yet done using this complimentary product I received from one of my favorite skin care product manufacturer, Body Merry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I am impressed on the way it was formulated.  This Neck Firming and Tightening Cream with Vitamin C provides your skin with its daily staple requirements of vitamins, antioxidants and AHAs.  It has 4% Vitamin C, 5% Glycolic Acid and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10).  It is also supported by powerful natural and organic ingredients such as Plant Derived Hyaluronic Acid, Propolis, Royal Jelly, Cocoa Butter, Jojoba Oil, Green Tea, Avocado Oil, Licorice, Lemongrass and Rosehip Oil, to name just a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you are following my review post here in Amazon you already know by now the moisturizing and skin rejuvenating  benefits of Hyaluronic Acid in which I discussed here several times.  While CoQ10 also helps the skin by acting as a strong antioxidant. It helps to neutralize the harmful free radicals that are one of the major causes of aging. Thus, the age-related decline in CoQ10 also your skin is more prone to damage by free radicals (Cited: blogperriconemd.com)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all of their products, this is formulated free from harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulfates and phthalates.</li>
            <li> This has a nice smell and it took about 2 weeks for noticeable differences. I used it twice a day for 2 weeks to get this result. I received this free as part of a promotion</li>
