            <li> This tiara is heavy duty.We purchased it for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume.She&#x27;s rough on her accessories( 4 yrs)and this one will stand up to the abuse of a preschooler. it&#x27;s meant for an adult so it&#x27;s kind of big,soI bent the band a little to make it work, the combs that hold it in place are solid. It&#x27;s more of a costume piece but is well made and doesn&#x27;t bend easily.Ive tried it on and it&#x27;s comfortable. It&#x27;s a bit heavy. Perfect for what we were looking for. I think this one will last awhile. I hope it doesn&#x27;t start losing the gems, like these things usually do.
