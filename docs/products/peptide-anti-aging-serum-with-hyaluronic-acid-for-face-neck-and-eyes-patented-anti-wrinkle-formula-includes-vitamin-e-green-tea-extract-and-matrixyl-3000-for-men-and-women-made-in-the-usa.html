            <li>Feels so good after applying.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is good.  </li>
            <li>very good anti-aging cream full of peptides for a good price.</li>
            <li>Amazing lotion.</li>
            <li>When given the opportunity to this out for my honest and unbiased review I was like Heck</li>
            <li>smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many many lotions but this one is amazing.</li>
            <li>Very light.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t play catch up like me :-)</li>
            <li>Great, really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>but I notice a more youthful complexion.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to notice any benefits from using this product.</li>
            <li>I do recommend it :)</li>
            <li>The Booster has to be the most nourishing product out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>This is a great facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend! !!!</li>
            <li>Ok but I don&#x27;t see much difference in the skin</li>
            <li>I am interested to see if this may help with my abdominal skin as it&#x27;s healing and returning to normal after giving birth 6 months ago, which the skin feels more hydrated and better already.</li>
            <li>Love that there is no residue because it absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use and believe will be good.</li>
            <li>Minty, fresh smelling and does not go on greasy at all</li>
            <li>Like it very much.  </li>

            <li>For me,  I have to apply more moisturizer since I don&#x27;t get enough from this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting a better looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I can definitely see that the fine lines are disappearing and generally the skin looks better.</li>
            <li>Just started using the product and don&#x27;t really have wrinkles</li>
            <li>Peppermint essential oil (which is one of the ingredients) works fine on my skin but for someone with sensitive skin it may be a problem</li>
            <li>I have been very surprised by the fact that my skin is tighter and the product seems to be working!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>On one hand it was an excellent moisturizer, however, it aggravated my (very mild) Rosacea something awful.  </li>
            <li>This product surprised me!  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m surprised it hasn&#x27;t run out yet</li>
            <li>I am seeing less and less of those fine line that make you look older than you really are...</li>

            <li> I am not a vain person but even I started to notice that I am aging... When given the opportunity to this out for my honest and unbiased review I was like Heck Yeah... I have notice this I am not getting any younger... my body tells me this but... now my face that is a different story... I am seeing less and less of those fine line that make you look older than you really are... I also notice that even though it is helping with those lines it isn&#x27;t giving me that puffy look that some do... A very nice texture and not to greasy not to oily... An all around great serum but I do have a suggestion start it earlier so you don&#x27;t play catch up like me :-)</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing the product. Just a few drops seems to provide moisture to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Great, really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Ok but I don&#x27;t see much difference in the skin</li>
            <li> Like it very much.  Goes on dry, not oily.  smells nice.  Gave it a four only because I would have preferred a floral smell.  The mint smell is suttle though so it&#x27;s fine.  Just started using the product and don&#x27;t really have wrinkles but I notice a more youthful complexion.  Plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> This product surprised me!  I have been very surprised by the fact that my skin is tighter and the product seems to be working!  It is easy to go on and does not smell bad!</li>
            <li> I was torn with this product.  On one hand it was an excellent moisturizer, however, it aggravated my (very mild) Rosacea something awful.  Had to return.</li>
            <li> Have&#x27;t seen any visible results yet; neck is still wrinkly</li>
            <li> does not work.  there is no 90 second wonder.  made my skin itch</li>
            <li> Moisturizer that is supposed to firm and tighten skin. Has hyaluronic acid which helps hydrate keeping the skin. I am interested to see if this may help with my abdominal skin as it&#x27;s healing and returning to normal after giving birth 6 months ago, which the skin feels more hydrated and better already. I&#x27;ll have to continue use though! Very light. Dispenses in a pump.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I am almost fifty. This product makes a difference to how I look in just a few weeks of use. It has a watery consistency. I have to supplement it with a moisturizer. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> very good anti-aging cream full of peptides for a good price. I have dry skin and feel the need to add another moisturizer afterwards/before despite  &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; written on the bottle but I can definitely see that the fine lines are disappearing and generally the skin looks better. Peppermint essential oil (which is one of the ingredients) works fine on my skin but for someone with sensitive skin it may be a problem</li>
            <li> I have used it for 6 weeks and there is no difference</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to notice any benefits from using this product. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks of use to date.  For me,  I have to apply more moisturizer since I don&#x27;t get enough from this product.  And I&#x27;m surprised it hasn&#x27;t run out yet since it&#x27;s such a small amount in this bottle.</li>
            <li> Awesome transaction. ..awesome product!  Saw and felt results immediately!  Highly recommend! !!!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moRT8NZAE5VH8L]]My skin is now glowing since I started use.  Love that there is no residue because it absorbs fast.  Continues to hydrate my skin all day.  Disclaimer: I obtained this item at a discount for my unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial moisturizer.  Minty, fresh smelling and does not go on greasy at all yet it makes my skin feel well-fed!</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion. Not oily or greasy at all!! Feels so good after applying. I will definitely stick with this for as long as they make it. I have tried many many lotions but this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is good.  I use it daily-usually nightly.  I do recommend it :)</li>
            <li> To me this Peptide Anti-Aging Serum is like a primer this preps my skin for serums and creams. I feel this makes serums and creams work double time. it evens skin tone, firms and hydrates.  I use it everyday and it really does boost the results of everything you use. The Booster has to be the most nourishing product out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has made a big difference in the color of my skin. You need to use it regularly for at least a week before you start seeing results and your skin gets use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting a better looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use and believe will be good.</li>
