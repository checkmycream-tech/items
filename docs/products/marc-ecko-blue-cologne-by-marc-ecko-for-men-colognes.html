            <li>I like cologne a bit more on the aqua side</li>
            <li>Blah blah blah blah need more words</li>

            <li>It really is a sexy fragrance.</li>

            <li>Should I say more?</li>
            <li>Get many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Compare to Nautica Blue, It has more sweet smell, and it stays great for great period of time!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Very light, good for hot summer days.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, comes in a nice big bottle and smells delicious.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much I had to get some more.</li>

            <li>a loud smell lol</li>
            <li>12-14 hours thanks amazon keep up the good work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good will recommend came fast in mail I give it 5stars</li>
            <li>its nice and smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>Not too strong but the scent lasts.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks cool too :)</li>
            <li>Thank you so much! :) :)</li>
            <li>Well then... I honestly can say that this is currently my favorite cologne by far.</li>
            <li>Scent lasts a descent amount of time (several hours (like 3-6hrs+)) and is a great value.</li>
            <li>I have used this powerful magic to get my way many-a-times.</li>
            <li>so thumbs up for this colugne, and a plus, its cheap</li>
            <li>and I get many compliments from my female colleagues on how good this cologne smell.</li>
            <li>The price is so much more reasonale than other name brand cologne&#x27;s, but it really is the best I have ever smelled.  </li>
            <li>It has clean shower smell to it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last all day but it smells good while it lasts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price, but suggest you look into Nautica Blue for something within this price range.  </li>
            <li>Light, Fresh,</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh, and intoxicating.  </li>
            <li>This fits both those criteria, but it fades so quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too woody or spicy, it&#x27;s quite &amp;#34;casual&amp;#34; as fragrance goes and smells mildly citrusy.</li>
            <li>Better than some of the high priced ones.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this :)</li>
            <li>Smells nice and more &amp;#34;formal&amp;#34; then other colognes can smell.</li>
            <li>This is the best cologne - it&#x27;s a subtle clean scent and the cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Ecko Blue is simply amazing, as soon as you spray it, there is a fresh-clean-citrus smell with a hint of cool mint.</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne by far!</li>
            <li>Crisp clean smell - I&#x27;m a chick magnet</li>
            <li>Nice looking bottle that can be left out on a dresser.</li>
            <li>This fragrance smells so fresh</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>He has a descent amount of cologne and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the packaging, bottle, and smell of this as well was my 26 year old brother.</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to fragrance (allergies) and most colognes and perfumes cause me problems.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite cologne he has and in my opinion better than the other Ecko scents (which I like as well).</li>
            <li>So if you are around this age range and the price is right, pull the trigger.</li>
            <li>This is a hard to find product, they had it in stock, website was good to navigate, fast shipment, ok price.</li>
            <li>I actually turned around to see who was wearing such a great scent, and nobody was around.  </li>
            <li>Son was happy with it, hard to find.</li>
            <li>Great smell but does not last long.</li>
            <li>but I had to find (what the smell implied was a hot guy) who was wearing this</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Everybody who smells it instantly falls in love.</li>
            <li>Wish I looked on amazon first because this is much cheaper than what I paid.  </li>
            <li>but i gave 5 starts due to the fact that any cologne that it smells like fresh water is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I used Marc Ecko original cologne for a few years and got many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell too strong and it&#x27;ll last you all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its nice and mellow and yet still has a little kick to it.</li>
            <li>I wanted something clean and crisp smelling, and this was definitely the one.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is very subtle and not too strong to the point where it smells amazing to me without causing an allergy problem.</li>
            <li>This cologne is absolutely to die for.  </li>
            <li>and i dont wanna throw the whole bottle on me just to have</li>
            <li>Wow I really can&#x27;t explain how pleased I am with this product for any future purchasers, take my advice from someone that used to get nothing but guccie, polo, dolce&amp;gabanna, ecko</li>
            <li>I was worried it would smell &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;, but it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this cologne.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I expected and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>You know how some colognes just &amp;#34;wear well&amp;#34; on a particular person.</li>
            <li>smells good af but its not strong enough</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I love it everyday</li>
            <li>Definitely has a different more masculine scent.</li>
            <li>I got this and a few more bottles of cologne for my brother on Christmas.</li>
            <li>Once it dries, man... hold on, cuz you&#x27;ll be fighting the ladies off left and right.</li>
            <li>I caught my first wiff on a fellow co-worker and have since purchased 3 bottles for various men in my life.  </li>
            <li>Not too young (Axe) or old</li>
            <li>I just got mine from Amazon and it came completely sealed</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>He has a musky smell naturally, and this cologne compliments it well.  </li>
            <li>IMO it smelled too much like some version of Curve, which I stopped wearing in middle school.</li>
            <li>It smells a little sharp/alcoholic, so I&#x27;ll probably look for something else with my next purchase, but for the money I&#x27;m glad I started with this scent to give me an idea of what I like, what I don&#x27;t like, and general cologne use.</li>
            <li>Plus its really strong, so you only need a small amount, like one decent spray.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this seller and will be buying from them again in the future!</li>
            <li>This cologne leaves a (colorless) clear residue on a white tee shirt.</li>
            <li>I regret not to pick up few more bottle for less than $ 15.00.</li>
            <li>Very different cologne for men, once you start using it you will fall in love with it, you must try it at least once!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on Amazon than other places!</li>
            <li>Easily competes with the lot more expensive brands for less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To give context, the cologne&#x27;s I have and use are: Dolce &amp; Gabbana as well as Dolce &amp; Gabbana light blue, Armani Code, Kenneth Cole Black, Eternity, Burberry Touch, Givenchy, Gucci Guilty, Nautica Blue, and a few more (what can I say</li>

            <li> The ladies love it.</li>
            <li> I like cologne a bit more on the aqua side</li>
            <li> Blah blah blah blah need more words</li>

            <li> It really is a sexy fragrance.</li>

            <li> Should I say more?</li>
            <li> Get many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Compare to Nautica Blue, It has more sweet smell, and it stays great for great period of time!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Very light, good for hot summer days.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, comes in a nice big bottle and smells delicious.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much I had to get some more.</li>

            <li> a loud smell lol</li>
            <li> 12-14 hours thanks amazon keep up the good work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good will recommend came fast in mail I give it 5stars</li>
            <li> its nice and smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> Not too strong but the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks cool too :)</li>
            <li> Thank you so much! :) :)</li>
            <li> Well then... I honestly can say that this is currently my favorite cologne by far.</li>
            <li> Scent lasts a descent amount of time (several hours (like 3-6hrs+)) and is a great value.</li>
            <li> I have used this powerful magic to get my way many-a-times.</li>
            <li> so thumbs up for this colugne, and a plus, its cheap</li>
            <li> and I get many compliments from my female colleagues on how good this cologne smell.</li>
            <li> The price is so much more reasonale than other name brand cologne&#x27;s, but it really is the best I have ever smelled.  </li>
            <li> It has clean shower smell to it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last all day but it smells good while it lasts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price, but suggest you look into Nautica Blue for something within this price range.  </li>
            <li> Light, Fresh,</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh, and intoxicating.  </li>
            <li> This fits both those criteria, but it fades so quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too woody or spicy, it&#x27;s quite &amp;#34;casual&amp;#34; as fragrance goes and smells mildly citrusy.</li>
            <li> Better than some of the high priced ones.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this :)</li>
            <li> Smells nice and more &amp;#34;formal&amp;#34; then other colognes can smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne - it&#x27;s a subtle clean scent and the cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Ecko Blue is simply amazing, as soon as you spray it, there is a fresh-clean-citrus smell with a hint of cool mint.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne by far!</li>
            <li> Crisp clean smell - I&#x27;m a chick magnet</li>
            <li> Nice looking bottle that can be left out on a dresser.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells so fresh</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> He has a descent amount of cologne and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the packaging, bottle, and smell of this as well was my 26 year old brother.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to fragrance (allergies) and most colognes and perfumes cause me problems.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite cologne he has and in my opinion better than the other Ecko scents (which I like as well).</li>
            <li> So if you are around this age range and the price is right, pull the trigger.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find product, they had it in stock, website was good to navigate, fast shipment, ok price.</li>
            <li> I actually turned around to see who was wearing such a great scent, and nobody was around.  </li>
            <li> Son was happy with it, hard to find.</li>
            <li> Great smell but does not last long.</li>
            <li> but I had to find (what the smell implied was a hot guy) who was wearing this</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Everybody who smells it instantly falls in love.</li>
            <li> Wish I looked on amazon first because this is much cheaper than what I paid.  </li>
            <li> but i gave 5 starts due to the fact that any cologne that it smells like fresh water is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I used Marc Ecko original cologne for a few years and got many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too strong and it&#x27;ll last you all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its nice and mellow and yet still has a little kick to it.</li>
            <li> I wanted something clean and crisp smelling, and this was definitely the one.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is very subtle and not too strong to the point where it smells amazing to me without causing an allergy problem.</li>
            <li> This cologne is absolutely to die for.  </li>
            <li> and i dont wanna throw the whole bottle on me just to have</li>
            <li> Wow I really can&#x27;t explain how pleased I am with this product for any future purchasers, take my advice from someone that used to get nothing but guccie, polo, dolce&amp;gabanna, ecko</li>
            <li> I was worried it would smell &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;, but it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this cologne.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> You know how some colognes just &amp;#34;wear well&amp;#34; on a particular person.</li>
            <li> smells good af but its not strong enough</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I love it everyday</li>
            <li> Definitely has a different more masculine scent.</li>
            <li> I got this and a few more bottles of cologne for my brother on Christmas.</li>
            <li> Once it dries, man... hold on, cuz you&#x27;ll be fighting the ladies off left and right.</li>
            <li> I caught my first wiff on a fellow co-worker and have since purchased 3 bottles for various men in my life.  </li>
            <li> Not too young (Axe) or old</li>
            <li> I just got mine from Amazon and it came completely sealed</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> He has a musky smell naturally, and this cologne compliments it well.  </li>
            <li> IMO it smelled too much like some version of Curve, which I stopped wearing in middle school.</li>
            <li> It smells a little sharp/alcoholic, so I&#x27;ll probably look for something else with my next purchase, but for the money I&#x27;m glad I started with this scent to give me an idea of what I like, what I don&#x27;t like, and general cologne use.</li>
            <li> Plus its really strong, so you only need a small amount, like one decent spray.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this seller and will be buying from them again in the future!</li>
            <li> This cologne leaves a (colorless) clear residue on a white tee shirt.</li>
            <li> I regret not to pick up few more bottle for less than $ 15.00.</li>
            <li> Very different cologne for men, once you start using it you will fall in love with it, you must try it at least once!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on Amazon than other places!</li>
            <li> Easily competes with the lot more expensive brands for less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To give context, the cologne&#x27;s I have and use are: Dolce &amp; Gabbana as well as Dolce &amp; Gabbana light blue, Armani Code, Kenneth Cole Black, Eternity, Burberry Touch, Givenchy, Gucci Guilty, Nautica Blue, and a few more (what can I say</li>
            <li> Long Lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and is not over bearing.</li>
            <li> I already had this cologne in the past and just needed a new one.</li>
            <li> This product came way faster then I expected.</li>
            <li> Got her faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I will be buying the bigger bottle after this smaller one runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to not wear this cologne everyday for the next few years!</li>
            <li> Ordered the bottle and now I wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Just too ordinary.</li>
            <li> I just say that not because it can&#x27;t be worn by others, but it&#x27;s hard to describe a smell in reviews.  </li>
            <li> Got my package and the bottle was broken.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong giving this one a try!</li>
            <li> Sooooo mediocre!</li>
            <li> Well packaged with all the cuts and contours but when I perceived it I was totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> (whatever that smelly crap is) smelling.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great smell but does not last long.Oh well.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, and my wife also love the smell of it. I regret not to pick up few more bottle for less than $ 15.00.</li>
            <li> Compare to Nautica Blue, It has more sweet smell, and it stays great for great period of time!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> This cologne is absolutely to die for.  I caught my first wiff on a fellow co-worker and have since purchased 3 bottles for various men in my life.  Clean, fresh, and intoxicating.  I would highly recommend.  The price is so much more reasonale than other name brand cologne&#x27;s, but it really is the best I have ever smelled.  Last all day with just 2 squirts.</li>
            <li> I would call this a great \\&quot;going out\\&quot; scent.  Not too young (Axe) or old (whatever that smelly crap is) smelling.  I would peg the age range at 24-37 yo.  I just say that not because it can&#x27;t be worn by others, but it&#x27;s hard to describe a smell in reviews.  So if you are around this age range and the price is right, pull the trigger.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance. Better than some of the high priced ones. I would buy this again or recommend to any of my friends.</li>

            <li> it was the best thing i could have bought.</li>
            <li> Tons of compliments. It&#x27;s hard to not wear this cologne everyday for the next few years! Light on the nose, very clean and refreshing...the women (and men) love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell for the price  I love it everyday use  Very smooth smelling for the price</li>
            <li> I get many &amp;#34;Hmmm something smells good in here&amp;#34; compliments when I use this cologne. Smells good</li>
            <li> Wow I really can&#x27;t explain how pleased I am with this product for any future purchasers, take my advice from someone that used to get nothing but guccie, polo, dolce&amp;gabanna, ecko is now one of the top cologne that I recommend the 2 sprays it&#x27;s all it takes for 12-14 hours thanks amazon keep up the good work</li>
            <li> I was walking through a store at the mall &amp; stopped in my tracks when I caught a whiff of this.  I actually turned around to see who was wearing such a great scent, and nobody was around.  So I started LOOKING for him.  Get this - I&#x27;m an old-ish woman who has been happily married to a great guy for 31 years... but I had to find (what the smell implied was a hot guy) who was wearing this just so I could find out what this stuff was.  Turns out it was on a display &amp; someone had opened up one of the boxes. That was the only box left, so I came to Amazon to find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this &amp; wear it myself if my husband won&#x27;t!  I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this because of the great reviews and they were spot on!  This cologne smells absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of Blue from a specialist at a shop a couple months ago and I loved it so much I had to get some more. This fragrance lasts all day. I put on two sprays this morning around 6am and I can still smell it at 10pm. This fragrance smells so fresh and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on it. Worth every penny AND I got it on sale! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Smells great, clean  - not overpowering. Lasts all day. Good price my girlfriend and I love this scent , so I bought a couple.</li>
            <li> Just bought an 1.7 OZ then decided to check amazon. Needless to say I will be buying the bigger bottle after this smaller one runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say this is by far one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve had over the years. It&#x27;s not overpowering and its a pleasant scent. 5/5 would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells really good. It doesn&#x27;t last all day but it smells good while it lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first-time cologne wearer, and this seems to be a great starter cologne. I smell it way more than anyone else does, but it is pleasant without worrying about the scent overpowering anyone around me. It smells a little sharp/alcoholic, so I&#x27;ll probably look for something else with my next purchase, but for the money I&#x27;m glad I started with this scent to give me an idea of what I like, what I don&#x27;t like, and general cologne use.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, great price</li>
            <li> Love this scent, All of the Marc Ecko products are great. Smells great</li>
            <li> great smell to it. Doesn&#x27;t smell too strong and it&#x27;ll last you all day.&lt;br /&gt;i have received many compliments with this cologne.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome cologne. Lasts the whole day (smells excellent too) I know this since my girlfriend compliments me on how good it smells at night and I put it on after my morning shower, so it definitely passes the longevity test. Easily competes with the lot more expensive brands for less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, what more do you want ?</li>
            <li> I personally loved the scent, and have found that all of the women in my life have loved it too.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect smell for me.  My wife comes up to me all the time just to smell me.  I received a sample of this cologne in the mail and I loved it.  Ordered the bottle and now I wear it everyday.  Excellent cologne.</li>
            <li> This one smells great. It is great in the summer or to go to some party.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on for like almost the entire day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at my local T.J. Maxx. Wish I looked on amazon first because this is much cheaper than what I paid.  Anyways, LOVE this cologne!  My bf did as well! I would definitely recommend.  He has a descent amount of cologne and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Buying it again.. It good..</li>
            <li> Crisp clean smell - I&#x27;m a chick magnet now couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> Great smell even for woman! I wish the smell lasts longer. Well, you still can&#x27;t beat the price compared to leading department stores.</li>
            <li> Love it came in fast and smells good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite.  I get it for him almost every year.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great products.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. My wife bought for father&#x27;s day, I purchased this one for my locker.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality of this fragrance. Very light and clean scent, it smells wonderful on my boy friend.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it.</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking for a cologne he likes that isn&#x27;t tested on animals. This fits both those criteria, but it fades so quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice size and smells great!! Not too strong but the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> Its ok. Definitely has a different more masculine scent. I like it. You know how some colognes just &amp;#34;wear well&amp;#34; on a particular person. For me, this great smelling cologne just isn&#x27;t one of them. Not one comment from my friends or co-workers.</li>
            <li> Love this colonge but here is some advice don&#x27;t buy from anyone except Amazon because many sellers are selling fakes.I just got mine from Amazon and it came completely sealed and it is real!!No I don&#x27;t work for Amazon just a buyer helping another buyer!</li>
            <li> I got this and a few more bottles of cologne for my brother on Christmas. I always give &amp;#34;smell good&amp;#34; to everyone on Christmas as &amp;#34;small gifts&amp;#34;or stocking stuffers. I was pleased with the packaging, bottle, and smell of this as well was my 26 year old brother.</li>
            <li> is kind of too strong, it smells too sweet lol. but i gave 5 starts due to the fact that any cologne that it smells like fresh water is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Smell is good. Does not lasts the smell more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> OMG the smell is amazing. I just use this mostly for work and I get many compliments from my female colleagues on how good this cologne smell. And the price is cheap that I can buy more and more and not worry about wasting money.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on Amazon than other places! My husband gets a lot of compliments on how good he smells. I love this scent!</li>
            <li> Ecko Blue is simply amazing, as soon as you spray it, there is a fresh-clean-citrus smell with a hint of cool mint. Once it dries, man... hold on, cuz you&#x27;ll be fighting the ladies off left and right. Well worth the price, comes in a nice big bottle and smells delicious. It&#x27;s A Must buy.</li>
            <li> nice mens cologne and a great deal on amazon</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and in great condition, as described. My husband really likes the cologne and it smells great on him. Great experience!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this! It was a gift. It smells great, the bottle looks sleek and it got here right on time!</li>
            <li> Smells great. This product was exactly what I expected and I was not disappointed. I would order again for sure.</li>
            <li> This smell isn&#x27;t popular with people I&#x27;ve worn it around.  It&#x27;s good for the price, but suggest you look into Nautica Blue for something within this price range.  If money is not an issue, Aqua Di Gio is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Smell so good and refreshing, Stays on all day! My girlfriend loves it. I definitely would recommend this fragrance to anyone!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells sooooooooooo good!  It has clean shower smell to it.  Plus its really strong, so you only need a small amount, like one decent spray.  To give context, the cologne&#x27;s I have and use are: Dolce &amp; Gabbana as well as Dolce &amp; Gabbana light blue, Armani Code, Kenneth Cole Black, Eternity, Burberry Touch, Givenchy, Gucci Guilty, Nautica Blue, and a few more (what can I say, I like to change up the smell often), but back to the point, Ecko, in my opinion beats the others I have.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband.  This is the best cologne - it&#x27;s a subtle clean scent and the cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I wanted something clean and crisp smelling, and this was definitely the one.  When my husband puts it on, he smells absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> Talk about timely fashion! This product came way faster then I expected. I already had this cologne in the past and just needed a new one. Great price, came in original box and everything was legit! I made out great with this purchase. Highly recommend this seller and will be buying from them again in the future!</li>
            <li> I used Marc Ecko original cologne for a few years and got many compliments on it.  I decided to try &amp;#34;Blue&amp;#34; by Ecko and it did not disappoint!  I have received several compliments of how &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Masculine&amp;#34; I smell.  I love the fragrance myself!  I am so glad that I changed...as it was time....and as I said Marc Ecko didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> The Best Ever,,,it&#x27;s All I use 5 stars</li>
            <li> Great smelling and good price.</li>
            <li> This cologne exceeded my expectations. Its scent is pronounced and lasts a LONGGG time. i will definitely keep purchasing it. A must buy!</li>
            <li> Wife loves the smell of this and I think it is great for me.</li>
            <li> Well then... I honestly can say that this is currently my favorite cologne by far. The bottle is also very appealing to the eyes and I&#x27;ve received many compliments whenever I decide to put this on. GET IT. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this smell. Light, Fresh, Long Lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to any and everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must if you&#x27;re still considering, this one is the right one!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells really good on my husband. I was worried it would smell &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;, but it really doesn&#x27;t. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Loved it it even came with a deodorant. ..both in a nice box ...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Got her faster than expected. My favorite fragrance ans very cheap for the quantity. I love it.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. Love it. I get lots of compliments on it. Helps me get all the guys.... Or ladies if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and he loved it! It smells great and the price is right. I definately recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne.  People always ask me what it is.  Lasts a long time and is not over bearing.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wears this cologne and I love it. I am extremely sensitive to fragrance (allergies) and most colognes and perfumes cause me problems. This fragrance is very subtle and not too strong to the point where it smells amazing to me without causing an allergy problem. It&#x27;s not too woody or spicy, it&#x27;s quite &amp;#34;casual&amp;#34; as fragrance goes and smells mildly citrusy. I love it and recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very different cologne for men, once you start using it you will fall in love with it, you must try it at least once!</li>
            <li> The cologne smells great! My boyfriend loves it. He wears it all the time! Thank you so much! :) :)</li>
            <li> Great cologne for a great price. Smells nice and more &amp;#34;formal&amp;#34; then other colognes can smell. Scent lasts a descent amount of time (several hours (like 3-6hrs+)) and is a great value. Highly recommend this :)</li>
            <li> Very light, good for hot summer days.</li>
            <li> Son was happy with it, hard to find.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best colognes I use. Very inexpensive. The thing is everyone buys the more expensive smelling colognes, so when you smell like this, Noone will know what it is. Trust me this is a good thing. No complaints so far. COMPLAINTS &amp;#60;COMPLIMENTS</li>
            <li> This smells amazing on my husband!  He has a musky smell naturally, and this cologne compliments it well.  Great price, too!</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance and a good price.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne by far! Everybody who smells it instantly falls in love. I have used this powerful magic to get my way many-a-times.</li>
            <li> Smells great! This cologne leaves a (colorless) clear residue on a white tee shirt. The bottle itself is beautiful. Great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> Got my package and the bottle was broken.</li>
            <li> Every woman I know loves the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my dad for his birthday and he loves it. It smells great. The bottle looks cool too :)</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find product, they had it in stock, website was good to navigate, fast shipment, ok price.</li>
            <li> It smells great and i have had many complements from hotties at college so thumbs up for this colugne, and a plus, its cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good will recommend came fast in mail I give it 5stars</li>
            <li> its nice and smooth and fresh. The ladies love it. I like cologne a bit more on the aqua side but this was great.</li>
            <li> Sooooo mediocre! I was so looking forward to receiving this perfume when I finally had in it my hands it felt very lovely. Well packaged with all the cuts and contours but when I perceived it I was totally disappointed. Just too ordinary.</li>
            <li> Great, I love the scent and it&#x27;s a great price for a quality product. Blah blah blah blah need more words</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as most reviews claim...IMO it smelled too much like some version of Curve, which I stopped wearing in middle school.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter&#x27;s boyfriend who loves Marc Ecko everything. Naturally he loved this cologne. It was a really good price. Another store was selling a 1.7 oz for the same price as Amazon&#x27;s 3.4 oz. It really is a sexy fragrance. I dont purchase cologne on name alone; it&#x27;s totally about the fragrance. The bottle is attractive. I would reccommend to anyone who has a father, brother, boyfriend...husband...any male. The women will love it..........trust me!!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so good that my wife won&#x27;t allow me to use it without her by my side. Should I say more? This one truly is \\&quot;The Lady Killer.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this cologne. Its nice and mellow and yet still has a little kick to it. Get many compliments when I wear it.</li>
