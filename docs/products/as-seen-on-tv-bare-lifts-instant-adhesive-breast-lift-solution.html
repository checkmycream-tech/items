    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>definitely perfect for cups</li>
            <li>I bought these before and they were great.</li>
            <li>I am greatly fond of my temporary boob lift when I need and feel to go braless.</li>
            <li>I bought it in dollar store, it was good price .</li>
            <li>OK SO I ORDER THIS item and was so excited!!</li>
            <li>, I might as well gone without as I&#x27;m sure no one would be able to tell the difference...</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM¢¾</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a year and love them.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine why so many people don&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li>Company is a rip off these are not the real barelifts!!!!</li>
            <li>Using them was fairly easy (just follow the instructions).</li>
            <li>If you are well above a C cup it may not work well for you, but C cup and under should work great.</li>
            <li>They are tape and sometimes they don&#x27;t go on smoothly</li>
            <li>It is not to complicate to use it so that&#x27;s great, but I think it could work with another women with less breast size.</li>
            <li>Victoria&#x27;s Secret has that is backless and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>You must get the authentic bare lifts!!</li>
            <li>and maybe they just didn&#x27;t do it right.  </li>
            <li>As I put it on it comes right off, but I do not know how to return this product.</li>
            <li>I do not have large breasts by any means, so</li>
            <li>but they did absolutely nothing for my C cup boobs.  </li>
            <li>They function very well once applied</li>
            <li>The item is very dependable and had no problems from the seller</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very baaaaaaaaaaaaaad&lt;br /&gt;Direct to the trash</li>
            <li>so will keep using these as long as they are available.</li>
            <li>What I bought instead is a new bra</li>
            <li>When it was on it hardly provided any notable lift anyway.  </li>
            <li>These really work well and last all day.</li>
            <li>Good, but to expensive</li>
            <li>Simple to put on, but doesn&#x27;t really work/give enough support for anything over a B/C cup.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve wasted at least 3 pairs because of the new glue they use or more probably the new thinness of the plastic.  </li>
            <li>Bare Lifts did not work at all for me.</li>

            <li> Bare Lifts is a total waste of time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to place Bare lifts on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Think my girls might have been a little too big for these.</li>
            <li> Lol these are horrible</li>
            <li> But, the lift they provided was so minimal</li>
            <li> Backless bras are hard to come by, so I thought I&#x27;d give Bare Lifts a try.</li>
            <li> if your boobs are small enough for these to work then you probably don&#x27;t even need them</li>
            <li> when i opened it it was empty!</li>
            <li> They are made of a thin tape often used with several Medical devices to hold pieces in place.</li>
            <li> The people who rated this poorly probably didn&#x27;t know how to apply it properly or probably have a larger cup size than recommended for this product.</li>
            <li> If you should manage to get Bare Lifts on correctly, it still will not hold your breasts up, the tape is too thin &amp; not strong enough.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stay stick keep sliding down.</li>
            <li> it does not go high and leaves it looking extremely weird.</li>
            <li> It is air tight &amp; should be used with caution.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Not so well for anything past those...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these failed to live up to the manufacturer&#x27;s claims and I am still searching for something that I can wear with my dress.</li>
            <li> It bulks &amp; is hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these new ones:(</li>
            <li> I guess I was hopeful that the other reviews were going to be wrong</li>
            <li> They tend to fold back on themselves before being applied and it is impossible to unstick them in order to apply to your breast</li>
            <li> They have somehow changed the adhesive used and it actually leaves a mark/rash and is painful after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Whether that contributed to the fact that these work wonders for me, remains to be seen, however my only concern is that they are SO HARD TO FIND NOW!!!  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MY MONEY AND TIME!!!!</li>
            <li> If its from China its not authentic!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible product!</li>
            <li> They didnt even stick please please please dont buy and be disappointed like me!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> what was I thinking?? like these would work.. if your boobs are small enough for these to work then you probably don&#x27;t even need them</li>
            <li> These did not stick to my breasts at all. The description said that it would work for B cups but it did not work at all for me.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> OK SO I ORDER THIS item and was so excited!! when i opened it it was empty! without the product, i was so upset.</li>
            <li> Bare Lifts did not work at all for me. They are made of a thin tape often used with several Medical devices to hold pieces in place.It is air tight &amp; should be used with caution. It is almost impossible to place Bare lifts on smoothly. It bulks &amp; is hard to work with. If you should manage to get Bare Lifts on correctly, it still will not hold your breasts up, the tape is too thin &amp; not strong enough. Bare Lifts is a total waste of time &amp; money. It just does not work.</li>
            <li> Well, these work but not as well as one would hope. definitely perfect for cups A through C. Not so well for anything past those...</li>
            <li> It is not to complicate to use it so that&#x27;s great, but I think it could work with another women with less breast size. (mine is 38D)</li>
            <li> I am  a 34D and this product did nothing for my breast! The package says up to D cup. My mother is a 36 C and i gave them to her, they did nothing for her breast either. Waste of money. DO NOT BUY! What I bought instead is a new bra Victoria&#x27;s Secret has that is backless and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have a backless dress that I need a bra for. Backless bras are hard to come by, so I thought I&#x27;d give Bare Lifts a try. I have C-cup breasts and cannot go without support. Using them was fairly easy (just follow the instructions). But, the lift they provided was so minimal, I might as well gone without as I&#x27;m sure no one would be able to tell the difference...Unfortunately these failed to live up to the manufacturer&#x27;s claims and I am still searching for something that I can wear with my dress.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about a year now. I LOVE THEM¢¾ I wear a 36C bra and have had breast augmentation. Whether that contributed to the fact that these work wonders for me, remains to be seen, however my only concern is that they are SO HARD TO FIND NOW!!!  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Simple to put on, but doesn&#x27;t really work/give enough support for anything over a B/C cup. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> These were literally a joke. Maybe if you are a A cup they would work  but they did absolutely nothing for my C cup boobs.  First of all when I &amp;#34;lifted&amp;#34; by breast up it created a fold above my nipple in my skin which looked weird and by the time I was peeling off the paper for the second one the first one fell off. When it was on it hardly provided any notable lift anyway.  Terrible product!</li>
            <li> They function very well once applied but I&#x27;ve wasted at least 3 pairs because of the new glue they use or more probably the new thinness of the plastic.  They tend to fold back on themselves before being applied and it is impossible to unstick them in order to apply to your breast</li>
            <li> I bought these before and they were great. They have somehow changed the adhesive used and it actually leaves a mark/rash and is painful after a couple of hours. I don&#x27;t like these new ones:(</li>
            <li> If you are a size DD.....dont bother with these, they don&#x27;t hold up.  I gave them away to someone else.</li>
            <li> Good, but to expensive&lt;br /&gt;It just 5 pairs in it!&lt;br /&gt;Ones I bought it in dollar store, it was good price .</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!!!! Company is a rip off these are not the real barelifts!!!! They didnt even stick please please please dont buy and be disappointed like me!!!!!</li>
            <li> This for me didn&#x27;t work, but whatever.</li>
            <li> You must get the authentic bare lifts!! If its from China its not authentic!!!! But they work if you heat it up with your hands or blow dyer!!!! I buy several of these!!! I wear a 34dd or ddd(depends on the bra).</li>
            <li> I wear a 34C bra and lost a lot of weight awhile back so my breasts are not as \\&quot;perky\\&quot; as I prefer. These really work well and last all day. The people who rated this poorly probably didn&#x27;t know how to apply it properly or probably have a larger cup size than recommended for this product. If you are well above a C cup it may not work well for you, but C cup and under should work great.</li>
            <li> The product was well above efficient and satisfactory. I am greatly fond of my temporary boob lift when I need and feel to go braless. The item is very dependable and had no problems from the seller</li>
            <li> Lol these are horrible I guess I was hopeful that the other reviews were going to be wrong and maybe they just didn&#x27;t do it right.  I gave this a try anyway in hopes of using them with bikinis.  I do not have large breasts by any means, so thats not the issue with them.  I followed the instructions but the adhesive just does not work at all!!! It gives no lift what so ever and even if you get it to stay it does not go high and leaves it looking extremely weird.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stay stick keep sliding down.</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s not doing what it said it would do. Not even for one minute will it stay on. As I put it on it comes right off, but I do not know how to return this product. WASTE OF MY MONEY AND TIME!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and love them. Can&#x27;t imagine why so many people don&#x27;t like them. These give me just enough lift and I can even swim with them on and they will last for 3 to 4 days before having to remove them. I am a 36D and don&#x27;t have enough nerve to get a breast lift so will keep using these as long as they are available. They are tape and sometimes they don&#x27;t go on smoothly but they still work!</li>
            <li> Think my girls might have been a little too big for these. Maybe I&#x27;ll try some duct tape. Or just pony up the dough for a boob job...</li>
            <li> I wish these would have worked. I had to use these combined with a lot of tape to hold them up! Maybe it&#x27;s because I have a larger cup size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very baaaaaaaaaaaaaad&lt;br /&gt;Direct to the trash</li>
