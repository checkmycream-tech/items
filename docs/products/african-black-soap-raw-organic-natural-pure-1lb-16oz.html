            <li>TOO AMAZING D-:!</li>
            <li>GOOD DEAL GREAT SOAP....</li>
            <li>I pair it with my homemade shea butter-coconut oil &#x27;lotion&#x27; for a nice clean,moisturized face!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting for something not so great to happen or for the results to go downhill, because this feels too good to be true.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, I love this soap and the packaging was perfect.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap does awesome on my skin and hair</li>
            <li>Smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>might recommend some of the liquid variety, which I&#x27;ve also used before and was quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>IMO, Natural Cosmetics has the best price, the largest selection, and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>And it smells good.  </li>
            <li>Loved it</li>
            <li>Good soap.  </li>
            <li>Feels good and keeps your skins moisturized.</li>
            <li>Skin looks good and feels softer.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap because I read that it was good for getting rid of acne and clearing up scars.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because - to be frank - even with all the good reviews here</li>
            <li>I was initially fairly hesitant and apprehensive about getting this soap.  </li>
            <li>I consider myself fairly picky in this regard.  </li>
            <li>It is good</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>It was wrapped a lot which was good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was good.</li>
            <li>Works well for some not so good for others.  </li>
            <li>How good is that  </li>
            <li>Again, there was fair warning that the product comes as is photographed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOULD BE A GOOD TO PUT IN A MASH</li>
            <li>Nice smell, lather and great price will have me purchasing again.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li>the wife likes it, so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>It lathers beautifully and it makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>It suds up so easy!!</li>
            <li>I am very happy and pleased and will buy more.</li>
            <li>This sop seems very authentic.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t going to cure your skin problems, but it is a nice soap that doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals in it yet does a good job at cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li>Love this soap!did wonders to my skin!</li>

            <li>I was extremely pleased with my package!</li>
            <li>Love this soap !</li>
            <li>I love this soap after using it for a month my face is clearer, no breakouts or blackheads anymore!</li>

            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Excellent and LARGE amount.</li>
            <li>She says it does amazing things for her skin.</li>
            <li>This soap has been amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I make a lot of my own beauty products and use this as an ingredient in my face and body wash.</li>
            <li>; kind of thing.</li>
            <li>Good quality, makes a lovely body wash.</li>
            <li>Its kind of unreal</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have a good aroma, but no smell at all is better than a foul funk.</li>
            <li>After reading some reviews, I decided to make my own liquid ABS.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m being writing this review for two, instead of just myself...</li>
            <li>This is very nice chemical free soap.</li>
            <li>Her skin is Flawless and she highly recommended this product.  </li>
            <li>CLEAN VERY NICELY ..</li>
            <li>Packaging is not the best, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>For those wanting a more &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; bar of soap, there are some great ABS bars available.</li>
            <li>A good natural moisturizer in an ideal compliment once you are cleansed and</li>
            <li>It has been great for my mild eczema.</li>
            <li>ive ordered before in a tub and very easy to use from another company.</li>
            <li>Very good and works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive skin, I found it is best just to apply it to your hands, then rub it on your skin.</li>
            <li>The natural earthy smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li>but after all, the feeling is so natural, and my skin is so happy now!</li>
            <li>However, if you want the true, authentic product, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 54 year old WF if that means anything, and do take excellent care of my skin, and eat healthy.  </li>
            <li>I re ad some of the reviews thought maybe too good to be true</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful and nice clean scent and I am not allergic to it with my very sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>Great product and fast shipping</li>

            <li>I love this soap because you can tweek it to your liking</li>
            <li>However, after each use my skin got inflamed and got more and more breakouts each time.</li>
            <li>EVERYTHING I ASKED FOR : )</li>
            <li>Still undecided as to whether I love the feel or not on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Okay I must say</li>
            <li>Not a bad one at all!!</li>

            <li>Steep the crumbles in hot to warm water until fully dissolved and add more water as desired for consistency (many suggest about 1ounce of crumbles to 2ounces water)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>now that&#x27;s clean!  </li>
            <li>This soap has a nice lather, and leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Just got it and so far works great.</li>
            <li>Works sooo much better than the dudo sound (sp?) version.</li>
            <li>It really dies your skin but a good body lotion takes care of that.</li>
            <li>I found the best results were when I washed my face at night only, rubbing the soap on my palms first, then my face for 30 seconds (any more</li>
            <li>the first time we bought the soap it came in a  nice package, was smooth to the touch, we really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel so clean...</li>
            <li>I love this soap my face feels so clean</li>
            <li>If pieces break off, you can easily mush them in your hand to make a bar.</li>
            <li>Clears his skin up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great for my skin, keeps it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love how clean I feel.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>me, it&#x27;s very mild, I even use it for cleaning my scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>OTHERWISE GREAT FOR BODY  LEAVES SKIN SOFT &amp; SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I have been using this for about 4 months now and so far it has done a really good job improving my skin.</li>
            <li>This soap is perfect for break outs and acne just break a piece off, lather it real good, apply and wash off do not leave the lather on your face or scrub to long this soap is raw</li>
            <li>It lathered up pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>First time I ordered it I received a nice square block.  </li>
            <li>This soap is amazing, leaves me feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find there was no scent at all, neither pleasant or repulsive.  </li>
            <li>It exfoliates my skin and has removed the scarring tremendously!</li>
            <li>So I quickly bought some more of the Dudu-Osun from Amazon and</li>
            <li>It came in a perfect little cube shape.</li>
            <li>Very gentle!!</li>
            <li>It came in one huge chunk.</li>
            <li>I stared breaking out after moving to another state (huge environment change)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great deal; he washes his face and body with it daily and it does have a cocoa buttery/shea butter smell to it and it makes his skin smooth and seems to help manage the oiliness of his face.</li>
            <li>Would use it on my whole body every day, but I make my own soap and use that instead.</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve seen, it lathers well and leaves my face smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>But after I&#x27;m done the face is smooth and a bit tingly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, an important buyer&#x27;s note</li>
            <li>With that said, I still am quite happy with the soap since it does get the job done, and the smell and experience is overall</li>
            <li>or it will have a light burning affect.  </li>
            <li>Confirmed by my Nigerian mama.</li>
            <li>This is not only for babies, it is great with all skin type and helps prevent/heal any skin outbreak.</li>
            <li>This is my second time buying from this seller and both times have been great.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to waste this wonderful</li>
            <li>This soap makes your skin smooth and helps with discoloration.</li>
            <li>I personally think is a great soap.</li>
            <li>I actually experienced some moderate skin irritation and itching.</li>
            <li>And also can get great results from using it daily consistantly.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, quality, and the way it leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not smooth and creamy in texture like Dove, but it cleans wonderfully leaving no sticky feeling after drying off.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This soap is all natural good for body acne and all.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good with this soap.</li>
            <li>GOOD NATURAL SOAP....</li>
            <li>Black Soap is very potent and depending upon your skin type needs, is best used between 2-4days per week, with a normalizing or moisturizing (aloe, cucumber, shea, honey) natural soap used on the alternating days to maximize benefits and prevent over drying.</li>
            <li>and it will cause irritation and redness but other than that it&#x27;s a very good product</li>
            <li>I use it to keep my face clean, smooth and free from blemishes.</li>

            <li>I use this product to wash my face, and it leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very mild and this is coming from someone who prefers freshly scented milder soaps.  </li>
            <li>But you do smell and feel a without a doubt completely clean feeling after washing with them</li>
            <li>Literally makes you squeaky clean though.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean but doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin and blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Apply with sponge or cloth.</li>

            <li>My boyfriend intends to buy more since he likes it so much</li>

            <li>I have tried many other soaps but came back to this one because it does the best job of making me feel (and look) clean.</li>
            <li>The breakouts came quickly and it somehow made my skin seem way more oily that anytime I&#x27;ve ever experienced in the past.</li>
            <li>my opinion, it&#x27;s pretty close to being a perfect everyday soap except for maybe the fragrance (for those who like highly fragrant, exotic, or perfumy smelling soaps.  </li>
            <li>Lathers fine, smell is ok, natural, not perfumy.</li>

            <li>I began using it for my body &amp; hair which was a suggestion of my Health Conscience Client who initially started me on this Amazing journey.  </li>
            <li>We only use it for our face and it is amazing cleans with out drying your face</li>
            <li>Too harsh for my skin but great make up remover.</li>

            <li>But it is sooooo worth it.</li>
            <li>PACKAGE NOT TIGHTLY AND SOAP ARRIVED MOSTLY</li>
            <li>Pure and original.</li>
            <li>It melts pretty quickly, so I cut some of it up &amp; put it in  bottles of water.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I planned to switch away from Dove soap, which I loved, but didn&#x27;t want to continue using (due to toxic chemicals in Dove</li>

            <li>The soap appeared fresh, solid and did I was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Not as cleansing and sensually satisfying as good handmade organic soap with better oils as base and an appropriate amount of lye to do its saponification job but better than cheap chemical commercial soap because there are no fake scents and the natural glycerin has not been removed.  </li>

            <li>you want more value you could get the 5 lb packs and that would last you quite some time.</li>
            <li>I could tell how much more irritated my skin was when I went on vacation and used regular soap instead.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure I reordered from the same company that I received my last order as it was shipped in a timely manner, and I am well satisfied with their product.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It has a natural scent, but it isn&#x27;t strong, and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>Be sure to bag it securely and separately, and store in a less humid area.</li>
            <li>Not very aromatic but is clean scented, if that&#x27;s a good enough discription?</li>

            <li>This soap is a great secret in skin care.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really smell anything.  </li>
            <li>The piece didn&#x27;t even shrink much in size</li>
            <li>Bought for myself, and now the whole family uses.</li>
            <li>Thanks for saving me money.</li>
            <li>After 1-2 days the soap is ready to use.</li>
            <li>This soap is also very drying.</li>
            <li>It also became very irritated with any moisturizer I tried.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal, i recommend it to my friends.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really clearing up my acne scars.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get it,</li>
            <li>It has some benefits, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for acne/skin irritation and didn&#x27;t really soften my skin either.</li>
            <li>Nothing really worked</li>
            <li>Much of the redness is gone.</li>
            <li>Just make sure not to leave it in the wet area, it will dissolve in water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it&#x27;s very drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having it .</li>
            <li>It takes makeup off very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Using this type of soap has really improved my skin.</li>
            <li>It has helped my acne prone skin so much.</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied withthis soap</li>
            <li>very lathery</li>
            <li>I much prefer unscented vegetable glycerin soap.</li>
            <li>Natural is most definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li>What I do on a daily basis is I walk into my warm steamy shower and let the steam open my pores up.</li>
            <li>When I first use a &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34; I run it under water to more or less glue it together as it has a tendency to crumble.</li>
            <li>First, I smelled it and it has a very natural smell.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take long to get there thanks to that lovely exfoliating action thats going on there.  </li>
            <li>The soap is great no complaints and a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li>I like this, however, since it reminds me that there probably aren&#x27;t as many chemicals as other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>compliment this regiment with 1/2 rose water and 1/2 &amp;#34;Organic, Apple Cider Vinegar, with The &#x27;Mother&#x27;, Raw - Unfiltered‎&amp;#34; as a toner.</li>
            <li>I always feel extra clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it in ideal mold conditions i.e. hot &amp; humid or cold &amp; damp places.</li>
            <li>It was very gentle and not harsh.</li>
            <li>I had heard so much good about African black soap.</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up and most of the dark spots caused by pimples are disappearing.  </li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive skin, you may consider apply the soap on a wash cloth first, it has some sandy peaces in it -</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t apply this soap directly to your face for the first week or so that you use it.</li>
            <li>It liquidifies and all I have to do is squirt a small amount in my palm and give my face/neck a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>Some people were complaining that this stings, but I have no problems and feel my skin is pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to balance the ph in your skin so sometimes my face becomes a little oily and sometimes it becomes dry but as long as I follow up with a moisturizer it is perfect.</li>
            <li>After getting out of the shower my skin felt dry and no longer felt softer or smooth.</li>
            <li>More than this, mine was half molded.</li>
            <li>I shave a lot lot less irritation after shaving.my skin looks like better.</li>
            <li>I have been using this soap mainly on my face for a couple years now.</li>
            <li>We call this Oshe Dudu and the main reason it is used by Nigerians</li>
            <li>I like this soap, it has a decent smell.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be placing an order for more in a larger size because everybody in the house uses it now.</li>
            <li>pretty much everything short of Accutane and nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li>Very natural product!</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and has a rich, silky lather.  </li>
            <li>Putting unused chunks in freezer as the house is warmer in these high temp days.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>The product came when it was expected, a really great raw soap.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a little more costly, so I decided to give this one a try</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think it was a normal response considering the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>cut the large bar into about 12 smaller cubes and stored them in a Zip lock bag until I&#x27;m ready to take another out and move it to my shower.</li>
            <li>It has a light shea butter scent, without all of the added parfumes that other soaps contain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are so many possibilities to tailor this raw organic soap to your specifications.</li>
            <li>My skin is feeling better with the use of raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>This raw black soap is great.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s really hard to use and kind of disintegrates during use, making a huge mess in the shower.</li>
            <li>but i got a lovely gentle face cleanse when i rub a lot of soap into a washcloth and use it that way, rinsing away the extra hulls or half burnt leaves.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li>Second time I ordered it, I received an up recognizable shape.  </li>
            <li>The original formulary only contains about 5 ingredients in total, (some newer formularies may also contain shea-palm-leaf-ash, vitamin E oil, honey or/and organic aloe depending upon the region in which it is made).</li>
            <li>The rest of the unused soap is stored back in the original packaging and then put into a ziplock bag in the freezer for later use.</li>
            <li>I have found that even using just a small amount I can get more use out of it than something like Dove.</li>
            <li>So far the soap is working!</li>
            <li>When taking a shower, I usually have to add more soap to my washcloth 3 times.</li>
            <li>At first I thought what the heck did I actually buy?</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have never felt so clean with any other soap</li>
            <li>So hard for me to believe that my old soap is getting replaced so soon when it took me much pain and toil to find such an economically effective and pleasing natural soap to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does tend to dry up your face but moisturize properly and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>wow this cleaned better than AND faster than the specialized mechanics soaps I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>might go through this soap quickly, but that&#x27;s not really a problem.</li>
            <li>love it, even gets rid of small skin tags, lightens old lady spots.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizing afterwards is a must; something I&#x27;ve done all my adult life (it&#x27;s quick in the mornings as you&#x27;re getting ready for work) is apply baby oil right after I get out of the shower from the neck down, brush my teeth, and then dry off.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered African black soap glad I did.</li>
            <li>very soft, so it doesn&#x27;t last very</li>
            <li>even worked on my motorcycle mildly doing a quick fix with a few minor adjustments which left my hands not exceptionally grimy but definitely obvious I had done some mechanical work and thought I would test this soap out and see how good it really is.  </li>
            <li>still have a large amount of this left (I bought the 5lb size), which I might start using for washing dishes just to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves my skin clear of back heads aids in closing my large pours, it also leaves my skin tight and pimple/blemish free with continued use.</li>
            <li>I originally had a slight fuel leak</li>
            <li>It doesn’t dry out your skin, and you’re left with dewy clean skin.</li>
            <li>I have never had clear skin like this in my life... makes me regret spending all that money on proactive and murad</li>
            <li>my face is so clear ...</li>
            <li>There is not really a scent, but just a light generic scent.</li>
            <li>and my skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li>It also helped clear away some of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>It is One whole piece not multiple pieces as shown in products picture ....</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a soapmaker myself but was curious about this soap and low on my own household unwrapped supply, so i ordered this, lured by low price and lack of extra packaging. .</li>
            <li>It will turn completely liquid.</li>
            <li>my face broke out completely</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>noticed that completely stop hair loss</li>
            <li>my hair became a natural sheen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MY SKIN IS SO SOFT AND</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am caucasian and have extremely sensitive skin, and lots of face washes will cause my face to break out.</li>
            <li>My skin is so clear and soft my hair and scalp are refreshed.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll continue to use Natural Cosmetic&#x27;s brand of ABS.</li>
            <li>This is completely natural and I had no problems with grit or roughness.</li>
            <li>I will never use anything else and have always believed that natural products are always healthier than synthetic chemical concoctions.</li>
            <li>I tried to rub it off and thought nothing about it and left it on the shelf until I was ready to use it.</li>
            <li>Natural Way Castile Liquid Soap-Unscented (for ages 8 and up contains rosemary eo)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural Way Castile Liquid Soap-Unscented (for ages 8 and up contains rosemary eo)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this for acne, but it really isn&#x27;t meant for that occasional pimple.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Would not recommend this if your skin is at all sensitive.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin Really soft</li>
            <li>so far i haven&#x27;t heard anyone else have that problem.</li>
            <li>Makes skin look so even and makes it extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Well......it lathers up in seconds and makes your skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I really tried to suck it up and continue using it, but if all these ghana soaps are like this, I will have to search for another vendor or a different type of soap.</li>
            <li>but I assume that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble with it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic,; It cleared up my skin, as I use it on my body and face ( I am 50+ years old).</li>
            <li>and I must say my skin has never felt so amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>wow my skin is like silk and just glows.</li>
            <li>Frequent use will keep these problems at bay.</li>
            <li>It will mush up it it is used directly with water as in the shower.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak against this product as the sole inflictor.</li>
            <li>It irritates my eyes and sensitive areas of skin.</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>and then I gently rub my skin in a circular motion with my ring and middle finger.</li>
            <li>I only use a tiny piece for each washing (usually twice a day) and it lathers so nicely and is not harsh at all!  </li>
            <li>very soft, so it&#x27;s squashy when it&#x27;s hot and wet.</li>
            <li>If I find out, I&#x27;ll come back &amp; post any new info!</li>
            <li>My rough heel/ankle areas are much more soft and less flaky.</li>
            <li>And authentic African Black Soap does not have any &#x60;labeling&#x27; and is simply cut and wrapped in a saran-like plastic wrapping and shipped.\\&quot;-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teenage son has been battling back acne and mild eczema for several years.  </li>
            <li>(Not sure what the substance is, looks like burnt wood mostly, and then some parts have a gritty sort of sand in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this soap, I will continue to use it on a daily basis...</li>
            <li>I have loved Black African Soap for awhile, but until now I had yet to try the Raw Soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bars are so big, I have cut 6 bars out of the 2, to reduce the size to a normal bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I gave five stars because  it is exactly  what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and leaves my face feeling very clean but a little dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use lye-based soaps, not even castile versions because they all dry my skin and make it feel too tight; but I had hoped that this would be different - not!</li>
            <li>As I workout 5x a week, this was my major problem because of dirt buildup on my skin.</li>
            <li>It cleanses my face like no other soap I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>When I first met my boyfriend he had such dry skin</li>
            <li>This soap contains sand grains that make your skin full of scratches and short black hairs in its core that make you wanna throw up...</li>
            <li>I have purchased black soap for many years, and this is the most disappointing batch I have ever received.  </li>
            <li>My black skin love the black soap</li>
            <li>It washes away all dirtt and inperities and leaves your skin feeling soft and clean unlike other soaps that left my skin feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>( It’s a little grainy, and can crumble a bit when first opened, but it’s not messy or anything.</li>
            <li>: Be careful where you store it, we break off hunks of it and set it in out soap dish near the shower and it seems to melt down really fast once it gets wet, so by the end of the shower the bottom of the soap dish along with my own bars of soap are coated in a slimy, soapy residue from the black soap...</li>
            <li>so knew generally what to expect.</li>
            <li>It came to me in a Ziploc bag wrapped up in an even smaller clear bag.</li>
            <li>i bought it to help clear up some break outs I was having and have noticed a definite improvement.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really keeping the amount of acne coming up to a minimal.</li>
            <li>The soap barely lathered</li>
            <li>: This is a NATURAL product as such it may grow mold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it to wash my hands several times so far, but wow...</li>
            <li>It is completely dissolved the next day.</li>
            <li>On the package, it only says natural.</li>
            <li>The soap I ordered came quite fast and just as I expected.</li>
            <li>I was using the Heritage brand for close to two years before finally switching to the natural product.</li>
            <li>I have only used this soap once so far</li>
            <li>but I definitely recommend it for someone who doesn&#x27;t have terribly sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>I am honestly just giving up and going to a dermatologist because I could have been paid a dermatologist money with all the failed experiments on my face.</li>
            <li>Arrived really broken, but still ok.</li>
            <li>really tried to like the African Black Soap, but unfortunately it seemed to be fairly &amp;#34;uncured&amp;#34;, or there was still lye in parts of the soap, because it burned my skin when I used it.</li>
            <li>and I am aware that black soap is a completely NATURAL product; as such there is the possibility that there may be odor.</li>
            <li>I was certainly hopeful after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t really have a smell other then an earthy aroma.</li>
            <li>is to give your little one they&#x27;re very real 1st bath once out of the hospital.</li>
            <li>But I usually use a little Shea butter or other oils to moisturize, I&#x27;m good for the day.  </li>
            <li>objective was to order an African Black soap, straight and simple, and this order fully delivered this expectation, which wasn&#x27;t particularly high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as the other versions of the soap, I have tried several and by comparison, the other brands definitely do not measure up AND the formulary is not the same as the original Ghanaian(sp?)</li>
            <li>On the face it stings the first time a little</li>
            <li>It burned a little the first time putting it on my face</li>
            <li>Love this homemade raw organic African black soap.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say about RAW ORGANIC AFRICAN BLACK SOAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first in buying it since I had purchased so many other different soap in the internet on a quest in finding something organic for my severe hormonal acne...</li>
            <li>: For the first few months I used ABSoap</li>
            <li>get it wet in the cloth and rub in a circular motion not hard but on face and neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, it does &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; twice as fast as other soaps, especially if you let it stay wet, and it adds a little extra work to keep your shower clean because there&#x27;s twice as much total soap being used.  </li>
            <li>I am AA &amp; have dry &amp; sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>certainly won&#x27;t give up on African Black Soap.</li>
            <li>Also, it is important to apply your African Black Soap with a soft cloth or facial brush or bath brush to avoid scratches as Natural soaps derived from caustic potash may retain some solid organic bits that may bruise if rubbed directly onto the skin.  </li>
            <li>will purchase from this seller again fast shipping and real african black soap.</li>
            <li>My facial skin is dry and sensitive</li>
            <li>My only concern at this point is if the black soap strips the skin too much, and does it upset the PH balance of our skin.  </li>
            <li>I had a severe acne breakout after trying the Oil Cleansing Method and now I have cystic acne and extremely inflamed skin, like no room between the pimples and getting like 10 new ones a day.</li>
            <li>This product looks very funky (very similar to what ends up in the little bag when I walk the dog...)</li>
            <li>There will be little stones mixed in occasionally, but you can pick them out if it is too much exfoliation for you.</li>
            <li>Literally within two days, his eczema was no longer raised, pink, or itchy and after a week it is completely clear.  </li>

            <li> TOO AMAZING D-:!</li>
            <li> GOOD DEAL GREAT SOAP....</li>
            <li> I pair it with my homemade shea butter-coconut oil &#x27;lotion&#x27; for a nice clean,moisturized face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting for something not so great to happen or for the results to go downhill, because this feels too good to be true.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, I love this soap and the packaging was perfect.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap does awesome on my skin and hair</li>
            <li> Smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> might recommend some of the liquid variety, which I&#x27;ve also used before and was quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> IMO, Natural Cosmetics has the best price, the largest selection, and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> And it smells good.  </li>
            <li> Loved it</li>
            <li> Good soap.  </li>
            <li> Feels good and keeps your skins moisturized.</li>
            <li> Skin looks good and feels softer.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I read that it was good for getting rid of acne and clearing up scars.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because - to be frank - even with all the good reviews here</li>
            <li> I was initially fairly hesitant and apprehensive about getting this soap.  </li>
            <li> I consider myself fairly picky in this regard.  </li>
            <li> It is good</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped a lot which was good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was good.</li>
            <li> Works well for some not so good for others.  </li>
            <li> How good is that  </li>
            <li> Again, there was fair warning that the product comes as is photographed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOULD BE A GOOD TO PUT IN A MASH</li>
            <li> Nice smell, lather and great price will have me purchasing again.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li> the wife likes it, so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> It lathers beautifully and it makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> It suds up so easy!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy and pleased and will buy more.</li>
            <li> This sop seems very authentic.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t going to cure your skin problems, but it is a nice soap that doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals in it yet does a good job at cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this soap!did wonders to my skin!</li>

            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Excellent and LARGE amount.</li>
            <li> She says it does amazing things for her skin.</li>
            <li> This soap has been amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of my own beauty products and use this as an ingredient in my face and body wash.</li>
            <li> ; kind of thing.</li>
            <li> Good quality, makes a lovely body wash.</li>
            <li> Its kind of unreal</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have a good aroma, but no smell at all is better than a foul funk.</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews, I decided to make my own liquid ABS.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m being writing this review for two, instead of just myself...</li>
            <li> This is very nice chemical free soap.</li>
            <li> Her skin is Flawless and she highly recommended this product.  </li>
            <li> CLEAN VERY NICELY ..</li>
            <li> Packaging is not the best, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> For those wanting a more &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; bar of soap, there are some great ABS bars available.</li>
            <li> A good natural moisturizer in an ideal compliment once you are cleansed and</li>
            <li> It has been great for my mild eczema.</li>
            <li> ive ordered before in a tub and very easy to use from another company.</li>
            <li> Very good and works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive skin, I found it is best just to apply it to your hands, then rub it on your skin.</li>
            <li> The natural earthy smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> but after all, the feeling is so natural, and my skin is so happy now!</li>
            <li> However, if you want the true, authentic product, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 54 year old WF if that means anything, and do take excellent care of my skin, and eat healthy.  </li>
            <li> I re ad some of the reviews thought maybe too good to be true</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful and nice clean scent and I am not allergic to it with my very sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> EVERYTHING I ASKED FOR : )</li>
            <li> Still undecided as to whether I love the feel or not on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Okay I must say</li>
            <li> Not a bad one at all!!</li>

            <li> It just kept sudsing with more agitation/contact to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just needs more moisturizing ingredients.</li>

            <li> This is OK soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, an interesting experiment to use.</li>

            <li> Soft, lathers good, would purchase again!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend LOVES this soap, which is good because I don&#x27;t care for it very much</li>
            <li> Has a very pleasant smell and it is definitely a miracle soap.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s just kind of cool to use an &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews, some loved it and some not so much.</li>
            <li> Came in a single block, best to cut it up.</li>
            <li> Steep the crumbles in hot to warm water until fully dissolved and add more water as desired for consistency (many suggest about 1ounce of crumbles to 2ounces water)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Steep the crumbles in hot to warm water until fully dissolved and add more water as desired for consistency (many suggest about 1ounce of crumbles to 2ounces water)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This soap has a nice lather, and leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Just got it and so far works great.</li>
            <li> Works sooo much better than the dudo sound (sp?) version.</li>
            <li> It really dies your skin but a good body lotion takes care of that.</li>
            <li> I found the best results were when I washed my face at night only, rubbing the soap on my palms first, then my face for 30 seconds (any more</li>
            <li> the first time we bought the soap it came in a  nice package, was smooth to the touch, we really enjoyed it.</li>

            <li> I love this soap my face feels so clean</li>

            <li> Okay, so I have been using this for about 4 months now and so far it has done a really good job improving my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is perfect for break outs and acne just break a piece off, lather it real good, apply and wash off do not leave the lather on your face or scrub to long this soap is raw</li>
            <li> It lathered up pretty nicely.</li>
            <li> First time I ordered it I received a nice square block.  </li>
            <li> This soap is amazing, leaves me feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find there was no scent at all, neither pleasant or repulsive.  </li>
            <li> It exfoliates my skin and has removed the scarring tremendously!</li>
            <li> So I quickly bought some more of the Dudu-Osun from Amazon and</li>
            <li> It came in a perfect little cube shape.</li>
            <li> Very gentle!!</li>
            <li> It came in one huge chunk.</li>
            <li> I stared breaking out after moving to another state (huge environment change)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a great deal; he washes his face and body with it daily and it does have a cocoa buttery/shea butter smell to it and it makes his skin smooth and seems to help manage the oiliness of his face.</li>
            <li> Would use it on my whole body every day, but I make my own soap and use that instead.</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve seen, it lathers well and leaves my face smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> But after I&#x27;m done the face is smooth and a bit tingly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, an important buyer&#x27;s note</li>
            <li> With that said, I still am quite happy with the soap since it does get the job done, and the smell and experience is overall</li>
            <li> or it will have a light burning affect.  </li>
            <li> Confirmed by my Nigerian mama.</li>
            <li> This is not only for babies, it is great with all skin type and helps prevent/heal any skin outbreak.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying from this seller and both times have been great.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to waste this wonderful</li>
            <li> This soap makes your skin smooth and helps with discoloration.</li>
            <li> I personally think is a great soap.</li>
            <li> I actually experienced some moderate skin irritation and itching.</li>
            <li> And also can get great results from using it daily consistantly.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, quality, and the way it leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not smooth and creamy in texture like Dove, but it cleans wonderfully leaving no sticky feeling after drying off.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This soap is all natural good for body acne and all.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this soap.</li>
            <li> GOOD NATURAL SOAP....</li>
            <li> Black Soap is very potent and depending upon your skin type needs, is best used between 2-4days per week, with a normalizing or moisturizing (aloe, cucumber, shea, honey) natural soap used on the alternating days to maximize benefits and prevent over drying.</li>
            <li> and it will cause irritation and redness but other than that it&#x27;s a very good product</li>
            <li> I use it to keep my face clean, smooth and free from blemishes.</li>

            <li> I use this product to wash my face, and it leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very mild and this is coming from someone who prefers freshly scented milder soaps.  </li>
            <li> But you do smell and feel a without a doubt completely clean feeling after washing with them</li>
            <li> Literally makes you squeaky clean though.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean but doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad fragrance</li>
            <li> I have tried many other soaps but came back to this one because it does the best job of making me feel (and look) clean.</li>
            <li> The breakouts came quickly and it somehow made my skin seem way more oily that anytime I&#x27;ve ever experienced in the past.</li>
            <li> my opinion, it&#x27;s pretty close to being a perfect everyday soap except for maybe the fragrance (for those who like highly fragrant, exotic, or perfumy smelling soaps.  </li>
            <li> Lathers fine, smell is ok, natural, not perfumy.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a great product</li>

            <li> I began using it for my body &amp; hair which was a suggestion of my Health Conscience Client who initially started me on this Amazing journey.  </li>
            <li> We only use it for our face and it is amazing cleans with out drying your face</li>
            <li> Too harsh for my skin but great make up remover.</li>
            <li> If I ever make soap with some of the books I bought, I may use some of this in the recipe with a hardening agent, that would be pretty cool, and if THIS company does that, it would be a five star product.</li>

            <li> But it is sooooo worth it.</li>
            <li> PACKAGE NOT TIGHTLY AND SOAP ARRIVED MOSTLY</li>
            <li> Pure and original.</li>
            <li> It melts pretty quickly, so I cut some of it up &amp; put it in  bottles of water.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I planned to switch away from Dove soap, which I loved, but didn&#x27;t want to continue using (due to toxic chemicals in Dove</li>

            <li> The soap appeared fresh, solid and did I was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Not as cleansing and sensually satisfying as good handmade organic soap with better oils as base and an appropriate amount of lye to do its saponification job but better than cheap chemical commercial soap because there are no fake scents and the natural glycerin has not been removed.  </li>

            <li> But the lather is BETTER than commercial soap.</li>
            <li> The scent is exactly as I remember it.  </li>
            <li> you want more value you could get the 5 lb packs and that would last you quite some time.</li>
            <li> I could tell how much more irritated my skin was when I went on vacation and used regular soap instead.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure I reordered from the same company that I received my last order as it was shipped in a timely manner, and I am well satisfied with their product.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It has a natural scent, but it isn&#x27;t strong, and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> Be sure to bag it securely and separately, and store in a less humid area.</li>
            <li> Not very aromatic but is clean scented, if that&#x27;s a good enough discription?</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t really get it,</li>
            <li> It has some benefits, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for acne/skin irritation and didn&#x27;t really soften my skin either.</li>
            <li> Nothing really worked</li>
            <li> Much of the redness is gone.</li>

            <li> Natural is most definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> What I do on a daily basis is I walk into my warm steamy shower and let the steam open my pores up.</li>
            <li> When I first use a &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34; I run it under water to more or less glue it together as it has a tendency to crumble.</li>
            <li> First, I smelled it and it has a very natural smell.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take long to get there thanks to that lovely exfoliating action thats going on there.  </li>
            <li> The soap is great no complaints and a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I like this, however, since it reminds me that there probably aren&#x27;t as many chemicals as other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> compliment this regiment with 1/2 rose water and 1/2 &amp;#34;Organic, Apple Cider Vinegar, with The &#x27;Mother&#x27;, Raw - Unfiltered‎&amp;#34; as a toner.</li>
            <li> I always feel extra clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it in ideal mold conditions i.e. hot &amp; humid or cold &amp; damp places.</li>
            <li> It was very gentle and not harsh.</li>
            <li> I had heard so much good about African black soap.</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up and most of the dark spots caused by pimples are disappearing.  </li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive skin, you may consider apply the soap on a wash cloth first, it has some sandy peaces in it -</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t apply this soap directly to your face for the first week or so that you use it.</li>
            <li> It liquidifies and all I have to do is squirt a small amount in my palm and give my face/neck a nice lather.  </li>
            <li> Some people were complaining that this stings, but I have no problems and feel my skin is pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to balance the ph in your skin so sometimes my face becomes a little oily and sometimes it becomes dry but as long as I follow up with a moisturizer it is perfect.</li>
            <li> After getting out of the shower my skin felt dry and no longer felt softer or smooth.</li>
            <li> More than this, mine was half molded.</li>
            <li> I shave a lot lot less irritation after shaving.my skin looks like better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap mainly on my face for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> We call this Oshe Dudu and the main reason it is used by Nigerians</li>
            <li> I like this soap, it has a decent smell.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be placing an order for more in a larger size because everybody in the house uses it now.</li>
            <li> pretty much everything short of Accutane and nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li> Very natural product!</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and has a rich, silky lather.  </li>
            <li> Putting unused chunks in freezer as the house is warmer in these high temp days.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> The product came when it was expected, a really great raw soap.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a little more costly, so I decided to give this one a try</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think it was a normal response considering the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> cut the large bar into about 12 smaller cubes and stored them in a Zip lock bag until I&#x27;m ready to take another out and move it to my shower.</li>
            <li> It has a light shea butter scent, without all of the added parfumes that other soaps contain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are so many possibilities to tailor this raw organic soap to your specifications.</li>
            <li> My skin is feeling better with the use of raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> This raw black soap is great.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s really hard to use and kind of disintegrates during use, making a huge mess in the shower.</li>
            <li> but i got a lovely gentle face cleanse when i rub a lot of soap into a washcloth and use it that way, rinsing away the extra hulls or half burnt leaves.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li> Second time I ordered it, I received an up recognizable shape.  </li>
            <li> The original formulary only contains about 5 ingredients in total, (some newer formularies may also contain shea-palm-leaf-ash, vitamin E oil, honey or/and organic aloe depending upon the region in which it is made).</li>
            <li> The rest of the unused soap is stored back in the original packaging and then put into a ziplock bag in the freezer for later use.</li>
            <li> I have found that even using just a small amount I can get more use out of it than something like Dove.</li>
            <li> So far the soap is working!</li>
            <li> When taking a shower, I usually have to add more soap to my washcloth 3 times.</li>
            <li> At first I thought what the heck did I actually buy?</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have never felt so clean with any other soap</li>
            <li> So hard for me to believe that my old soap is getting replaced so soon when it took me much pain and toil to find such an economically effective and pleasing natural soap to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does tend to dry up your face but moisturize properly and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> wow this cleaned better than AND faster than the specialized mechanics soaps I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> might go through this soap quickly, but that&#x27;s not really a problem.</li>
            <li> love it, even gets rid of small skin tags, lightens old lady spots.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizing afterwards is a must; something I&#x27;ve done all my adult life (it&#x27;s quick in the mornings as you&#x27;re getting ready for work) is apply baby oil right after I get out of the shower from the neck down, brush my teeth, and then dry off.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered African black soap glad I did.</li>
            <li> very soft, so it doesn&#x27;t last very</li>
            <li> even worked on my motorcycle mildly doing a quick fix with a few minor adjustments which left my hands not exceptionally grimy but definitely obvious I had done some mechanical work and thought I would test this soap out and see how good it really is.  </li>
            <li> still have a large amount of this left (I bought the 5lb size), which I might start using for washing dishes just to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leaves my skin clear of back heads aids in closing my large pours, it also leaves my skin tight and pimple/blemish free with continued use.</li>
            <li> I originally had a slight fuel leak</li>
            <li> It doesn’t dry out your skin, and you’re left with dewy clean skin.</li>
            <li> I have never had clear skin like this in my life... makes me regret spending all that money on proactive and murad</li>
            <li> my face is so clear ...</li>
            <li> There is not really a scent, but just a light generic scent.</li>
            <li> and my skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li> It also helped clear away some of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It is One whole piece not multiple pieces as shown in products picture ....</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a soapmaker myself but was curious about this soap and low on my own household unwrapped supply, so i ordered this, lured by low price and lack of extra packaging. .</li>
            <li> It will turn completely liquid.</li>
            <li> my face broke out completely</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> noticed that completely stop hair loss</li>
            <li> my hair became a natural sheen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MY SKIN IS SO SOFT AND</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am caucasian and have extremely sensitive skin, and lots of face washes will cause my face to break out.</li>
            <li> My skin is so clear and soft my hair and scalp are refreshed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll continue to use Natural Cosmetic&#x27;s brand of ABS.</li>
            <li> This is completely natural and I had no problems with grit or roughness.</li>
            <li> I will never use anything else and have always believed that natural products are always healthier than synthetic chemical concoctions.</li>
            <li> I tried to rub it off and thought nothing about it and left it on the shelf until I was ready to use it.</li>
            <li> Natural Way Castile Liquid Soap-Unscented (for ages 8 and up contains rosemary eo)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Natural Way Castile Liquid Soap-Unscented (for ages 8 and up contains rosemary eo)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this for acne, but it really isn&#x27;t meant for that occasional pimple.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend this if your skin is at all sensitive.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin Really soft</li>
            <li> so far i haven&#x27;t heard anyone else have that problem.</li>
            <li> Makes skin look so even and makes it extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Well......it lathers up in seconds and makes your skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really tried to suck it up and continue using it, but if all these ghana soaps are like this, I will have to search for another vendor or a different type of soap.</li>
            <li> but I assume that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic,; It cleared up my skin, as I use it on my body and face ( I am 50+ years old).</li>
            <li> and I must say my skin has never felt so amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> wow my skin is like silk and just glows.</li>
            <li> Frequent use will keep these problems at bay.</li>
            <li> It will mush up it it is used directly with water as in the shower.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak against this product as the sole inflictor.</li>
            <li> It irritates my eyes and sensitive areas of skin.</li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> and then I gently rub my skin in a circular motion with my ring and middle finger.</li>
            <li> I only use a tiny piece for each washing (usually twice a day) and it lathers so nicely and is not harsh at all!  </li>
            <li> very soft, so it&#x27;s squashy when it&#x27;s hot and wet.</li>
            <li> If I find out, I&#x27;ll come back &amp; post any new info!</li>
            <li> My rough heel/ankle areas are much more soft and less flaky.</li>
            <li> And authentic African Black Soap does not have any &#x60;labeling&#x27; and is simply cut and wrapped in a saran-like plastic wrapping and shipped.\\&quot;-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teenage son has been battling back acne and mild eczema for several years.  </li>
            <li> (Not sure what the substance is, looks like burnt wood mostly, and then some parts have a gritty sort of sand in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this soap, I will continue to use it on a daily basis...</li>
            <li> I have loved Black African Soap for awhile, but until now I had yet to try the Raw Soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bars are so big, I have cut 6 bars out of the 2, to reduce the size to a normal bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I gave five stars because  it is exactly  what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and leaves my face feeling very clean but a little dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use lye-based soaps, not even castile versions because they all dry my skin and make it feel too tight; but I had hoped that this would be different - not!</li>
            <li> As I workout 5x a week, this was my major problem because of dirt buildup on my skin.</li>
            <li> It cleanses my face like no other soap I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> When I first met my boyfriend he had such dry skin</li>
            <li> This soap contains sand grains that make your skin full of scratches and short black hairs in its core that make you wanna throw up...</li>
            <li> I have purchased black soap for many years, and this is the most disappointing batch I have ever received.  </li>
            <li> My black skin love the black soap</li>
            <li> It washes away all dirtt and inperities and leaves your skin feeling soft and clean unlike other soaps that left my skin feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> ( It’s a little grainy, and can crumble a bit when first opened, but it’s not messy or anything.</li>
            <li> : Be careful where you store it, we break off hunks of it and set it in out soap dish near the shower and it seems to melt down really fast once it gets wet, so by the end of the shower the bottom of the soap dish along with my own bars of soap are coated in a slimy, soapy residue from the black soap...</li>
            <li> so knew generally what to expect.</li>
            <li> It came to me in a Ziploc bag wrapped up in an even smaller clear bag.</li>
            <li> i bought it to help clear up some break outs I was having and have noticed a definite improvement.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really keeping the amount of acne coming up to a minimal.</li>
            <li> The soap barely lathered</li>
            <li> : This is a NATURAL product as such it may grow mold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it to wash my hands several times so far, but wow...</li>
            <li> It is completely dissolved the next day.</li>
            <li> On the package, it only says natural.</li>
            <li> The soap I ordered came quite fast and just as I expected.</li>
            <li> I was using the Heritage brand for close to two years before finally switching to the natural product.</li>
            <li> I have only used this soap once so far</li>
            <li> but I definitely recommend it for someone who doesn&#x27;t have terribly sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li> I am honestly just giving up and going to a dermatologist because I could have been paid a dermatologist money with all the failed experiments on my face.</li>
            <li> Arrived really broken, but still ok.</li>
            <li> really tried to like the African Black Soap, but unfortunately it seemed to be fairly &amp;#34;uncured&amp;#34;, or there was still lye in parts of the soap, because it burned my skin when I used it.</li>
            <li> and I am aware that black soap is a completely NATURAL product; as such there is the possibility that there may be odor.</li>
            <li> I was certainly hopeful after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t really have a smell other then an earthy aroma.</li>
            <li> is to give your little one they&#x27;re very real 1st bath once out of the hospital.</li>
            <li> But I usually use a little Shea butter or other oils to moisturize, I&#x27;m good for the day.  </li>
            <li> objective was to order an African Black soap, straight and simple, and this order fully delivered this expectation, which wasn&#x27;t particularly high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as the other versions of the soap, I have tried several and by comparison, the other brands definitely do not measure up AND the formulary is not the same as the original Ghanaian(sp?)</li>
            <li> On the face it stings the first time a little</li>
            <li> It burned a little the first time putting it on my face</li>
            <li> Love this homemade raw organic African black soap.  </li>
            <li> What more can I say about RAW ORGANIC AFRICAN BLACK SOAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first in buying it since I had purchased so many other different soap in the internet on a quest in finding something organic for my severe hormonal acne...</li>
            <li> : For the first few months I used ABSoap</li>
            <li> get it wet in the cloth and rub in a circular motion not hard but on face and neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, it does &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; twice as fast as other soaps, especially if you let it stay wet, and it adds a little extra work to keep your shower clean because there&#x27;s twice as much total soap being used.  </li>
            <li> I am AA &amp; have dry &amp; sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> certainly won&#x27;t give up on African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> Also, it is important to apply your African Black Soap with a soft cloth or facial brush or bath brush to avoid scratches as Natural soaps derived from caustic potash may retain some solid organic bits that may bruise if rubbed directly onto the skin.  </li>
            <li> will purchase from this seller again fast shipping and real african black soap.</li>
            <li> My facial skin is dry and sensitive</li>
            <li> My only concern at this point is if the black soap strips the skin too much, and does it upset the PH balance of our skin.  </li>
            <li> I had a severe acne breakout after trying the Oil Cleansing Method and now I have cystic acne and extremely inflamed skin, like no room between the pimples and getting like 10 new ones a day.</li>
            <li> This product looks very funky (very similar to what ends up in the little bag when I walk the dog...)</li>
            <li> There will be little stones mixed in occasionally, but you can pick them out if it is too much exfoliation for you.</li>
            <li> Literally within two days, his eczema was no longer raised, pink, or itchy and after a week it is completely clear.  </li>
            <li> It took the scarring normally took 3-6 months to fade and diminished the time to less than two weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this had way too much extra hull material, probably just to add bulk to sell by weight and very little real soap content.  </li>
            <li> You can apply directly breifly on problem spots like a zit or scar, but until your skin is use to it I would be very careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with average length &amp;#34;guy hair&amp;#34; and never use conditioner so a lady might have a different opinion as far as shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Only slight problem is an occasional grain of sand that could scratch your face, so I don&#x27;t rub the bar directly on my face.</li>
            <li> It also makes my razors last much longer than they have in the past.</li>
            <li> My skin is not incredibly sensitive but I continued to get stinging, red, burned skin in different patches after using this product.</li>
            <li> It looks odd in the shower (like poop!).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very soft, so when I sliced the block into usable pieces, I needed to mould them into blocks which wouldn&#x27;t break up with use.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> Cut up a section to use, It DOES Melt quickly..did not last long.</li>
            <li> Could not tolerate the smell, so I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the effects.</li>
            <li> Long lasting!</li>
            <li> I used it for about a week and a half and stopped using it because it made my skin feel tight and (for me) wasn&#x27;t gentle enough to be used as a total body soap...</li>
            <li> Before you apply it to your skin, lathers slightly between your hands or use a cloth, you can feel the natural texture of the product.</li>
            <li> Having said that, the soap can dry your skin out ONLY if you do not moisturize after.</li>
            <li> Keep it dry and take out only what you need.</li>
            <li> and although it is soft, it is firm enough to hold its shape.</li>
            <li> im beginning to hate a soap i love so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the african black soap in the past which was good soap too but too expensive for regular use</li>
            <li> I tried several other natural black soaps before, this one as you can see isn&#x27;t necessarily *</li>
            <li> Doesnt last long unless it is kept dry between uses.</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks latter I took it down off the shelf and noticed that not only did the fuzz come back</li>
            <li> you get the 1lb bar or larger, cut it into smaller bars using a sharp (butcher&#x27;s) knife and freeze the rest.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get the 1lb bar or larger, cut it into smaller bars using a sharp (butcher&#x27;s) knife and freeze the rest.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rubbing the soap directly on the skin can be a little too abrasive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You see I was really trying hard not to post yet.  </li>
            <li> African Black Soap Raw Organic Natural Pure...Came in a plain see-thru bag,in large chunks weighing 1 lb 2 oz.</li>
            <li> I have figured out not to use it except in the shower because if you leave it on too long it will burn, not a problem when I use it in the shower (I put some in a bottle and then fill bottle with water and use as a liquid).  </li>
            <li> tried it on my naturally curly 3c hair by allowing a few chunks soak in a bottle of water for about two days.</li>
            <li> I also passed a few bars out to my friends who like me have adult acne.</li>
            <li> Although I am writing this review a year after I recieved my product, This is how long this product has lasted me.</li>
            <li> and it gets used all day long, even my husband likes to use it now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit harder to lather than regular soap</li>
            <li> And it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I normally follow it up with a small bit of Shea butter as my moisturizer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that something this inexpensive and odd looking could work better than all the expensive things we&#x27;ve tried, but it absolutely does.  </li>
            <li> It is what I would define as an extreme exfoliator, but I have definitely noticed improvements in my skin already:  my pores are smaller, sun spots on my face are not so dark, and believe it or not, the skin above my eyelids is tighter!  </li>
            <li> I am on my second bar of African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hard on my skin and doesn&#x27;t crumbles quickly like some other black soap.</li>
            <li> However, there are tiny pieces throughout the soap that are extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> One is Dudu-Osun and the other is a similar looking unrefined soap from Ghana that is also sold here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My age spots all disappeared using the other 2 soaps but came back when I started using this brand!  </li>
            <li> But it is also only half as expensive as regular soap, and just cool, so it evens out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second time we purchased the soap it came wrapped in plastic wrap and felt like 80 grit sand paper, hard to use directly on skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this &#x27;raw&#x27; soap for years and obviously am completely happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not oily or dry</li>
            <li> This soft bar soap is gentle on skin even though it has a slightly scary looking appearance.  </li>
            <li> I have chronically dry skin and get eczema and this soap works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> but my face got really dry.</li>
            <li> Just keep the soap dry between uses.</li>
            <li> In the winter its gotten so dry that it literally stings</li>
            <li> Put it somewhere where it will dry out.</li>
            <li> The soap makes ur face really dry</li>
            <li> Yet it doesnt dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> My son uses it for acne, dry scalp and eczema.</li>
            <li> I just laid mine on plastic wrap to let it dry out</li>
            <li> I believe all skin types can use this because i have dry skin and my boyfriebd skin is oily</li>
            <li> The soap appears dry, and crumbly.  </li>
            <li> For those who can&#x27;t handle heavily perfumed commercial soaps, this is a definite plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really helps with the scarring that can be left behind from acne.</li>
            <li> It manages to exfoliate extremely well without feeling any harsh abrasive action.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used fancy soaps before, and i can see that the quality is probably average to high-average relative to what you can probably get in the market in Ghana.</li>
            <li> I usually have a friend or family member bring it directly from home</li>
            <li> I chose to cut it down into individual bars and wrapped them in wax paper covered with plastic</li>
            <li> A little piece  lathers up well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> For at least the last few years I have only used what would be considered somewhat natural soap bars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using African Black Soap for years now.</li>
            <li> I also plan on giving African black soap to all my friends for the holidays</li>
            <li> i will buy the nubian heritage african black soap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try some specifically moisturizing African black soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed less problem</li>
            <li> My white skin loves the black soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 with oily skin that is less so after using this regularly.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t believe this is real African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> I have very pale sensitive skin .......</li>
            <li> It feels just like regular soap that leaves a little bit of a residue when you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a little over a month</li>
            <li> other thing is that this soap also seems to be longer lasting in water than my previous soap...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t weigh it, as other reviews have mentioned that the total may be less than a pound.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 other brands of black soap prior to using this one.  </li>
            <li> as adult it sucks.</li>
            <li> not the quality I expected</li>
            <li> Everything I expected</li>
            <li> This soap came in the mail as expected.</li>
            <li> Just do not leave this soap in the wet shower or sitting in a wet soap tray because it will start melting.</li>
            <li> Soap is as expected.</li>
            <li> Was drying, as expected.</li>
            <li> Eh... not really much to write home about.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> Not to mention it&#x27;s crumbly and rough and breaks apart when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I gave it to my boyfriend who is African decent, with darker skin thinking he would be less sensitive to this product - wrong, his hands and knees started to peel after a few uses.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry</li>
            <li> you get to the last little bits of your soap save them and dice them into even smaller pieces with a small knife.</li>
            <li> you get to the last little bits of your soap save them and dice them into even smaller pieces with a small knife.</li>
            <li> I mean just look at it, it is not the prettiest or even somewhat normal looking compared to what we typically see here in the US.  </li>
            <li> This is the only raw product that clears my skin from pimples and blemishes.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> Just like the other reviews, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes because it does sting.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it is the soap or other changes that I have made.</li>
            <li> I might check out other soaps as well, to see what the differences are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so we started to carefully wash his head with the soap and the eczema is gone!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Just like the other reviews stated you cannot leave this in the shower in standing water because it will dissolve.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned grit or sand in the soap.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Natural-Cosmetics Raw Handmade African Black Soap by Atharva Imports</li>
            <li> Natural-Cosmetics Raw Handmade African Black Soap by Atharva Imports</li>
            <li> It is messy and sometimes can be a bit drying on the skin if your skin is already dry.  </li>
            <li> I keep 2 quarter sized pieces in my bathroom cabinet, and have the rest broken down into chunks &amp;#62; individually bagged &amp;#62; bagged together &amp;#62; kept in the back of my closet</li>
            <li> and I found sharp sand particles in it that hurts when exposed when the soap wears down.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no oily or grimy residue left behind, no fuel smell, and my hands felt as if I had done no work at all which usually takes a few washings and/or a shower to get rid of completely.  </li>
            <li> And it does dry, but no more than any other soap or shampoo.</li>
            <li> its the real deal...not a fake Knock off brand...</li>
            <li> There is no soap scum, and one order could last a person years!!!</li>
            <li> I can tell my dark marks aren&#x27;t as intensely dark as they would be.</li>
            <li> Acne cleared up and also dark spots from sun exposure faded.</li>
            <li> and I use it daily for at least three times.  </li>
            <li> It is not as harsh as I had expected.</li>
            <li> ; real African Black Soap does not contain any sulfates OR artificial ingredients and only contains less than 8 TOTAL ingredients and must contain: Plantain Skin Ash, Cocoa- Pod Ash, Shea Bark Ash, and Palm Oil.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll hunt down a regulated product after my skin recovers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like sharp soap!</li>
            <li> and I have extremely oily skin and kept getting cystic acne on my chin which was so bothersome!  </li>
            <li> Two products, one for less than $10.00.</li>
            <li> AND I HAVE BEEN USING BLACK SOAP FOR OVER A YEAR</li>
            <li> Not like the Dudu Osun Black Soap.</li>
            <li> Ive received my black soap almost a month ago and have noticed a difference in my skin tone...</li>
            <li> It even has bits of black rock in it.</li>
            <li> Morning Time: wash face with black soap, spray ACV toner, and moisturize with Clinique</li>
            <li> : remove eye make up with olive oil, wash face with black soap, (sometimes exfoliate), spray with ACV toner, moisturize with shea butter..</li>
            <li> Black soap is well known&lt;br /&gt;Smoothes the skin and gives it the brightest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a lot less oily.</li>
            <li> : I have had less acne with this product.</li>
            <li> I use less moisturizer when I get out of the shower now that I use this soap.</li>
            <li> This is what I expect when I order black soap.  </li>
            <li> Tightens up the pores so that they are less visible.</li>
            <li> I have much less breakouts and smoother skin when I use this soap.</li>
            <li> I stopped usin J&amp;J baby shower and replaced it with black soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m checking out some moisturizing black soaps on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin-- much less acne, clogged pores, dry/itchy skin, etc.</li>
            <li> black* in colour...</li>
            <li> i buy two pounds at a time and split them in half which gives me 4  soap bars .</li>
            <li> trying this black soap</li>
            <li> One pound lasted me about a year and a half</li>
            <li> This is much less time consuming than moisturizing with creams, which I reserve for the weekends.  </li>
            <li> I usually put on moisturizer after washing as it does dry out my face a little.  </li>
            <li> I just cut off a little piece and keep the rest in a dark cabinet or the freezer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Raw Organic African Black Soap for at least 2 years.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected as I have purchased the soap elsewhere in the past.</li>
            <li> Apply a little moisturizer, and that’s it, you’re done.</li>
            <li> If you are having skin issues like eczema, acne or seborrhea dermatitis it can sting a little.</li>
            <li> Usually a pimple or four pops up every other day for me.</li>
            <li> I have read that some users wash their face with it and leave the lather on a little longer before rinsing off.</li>
            <li> Little weird looking natural soap!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has helped a little with scarring.</li>
            <li> I keep it separately in a little container.</li>
            <li> In the soap, there are little remnants of twigs and rocks (and God know what else).</li>
            <li> Another plus is the soap has little to no lingering smell.</li>
            <li> ,SOMETIME YOU CAN FIND SEEDS , LITTLE ROCKS IN THE SOAP .IT</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a ling way</li>
            <li> Seriously, it looks like RAW ORGANIC African elephant</li>
            <li> I thought that this would solve my problem from previous failed attempts at trying to clear my skin.</li>
            <li> The soap was cut in very small pieces as if it was the scraps left from other soaps !!!</li>
            <li> Makes quite a few bars.</li>
            <li> You can leave on a few minutes as face mask.</li>
            <li> My dreads are softer and don&#x27;t have that dried out feeling to them anymore.</li>
            <li> this soap helps remove that dead skin</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> The acne/bumps on my shoulders and back is decreased.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> She said she could see results in a few days.  </li>
            <li> I use this to shave everyday and it has eliminated my razor bump issues.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit messy</li>
            <li> This seems harsh to me.</li>
            <li> made my skin a bit firm and cleared some spots.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first</li>
            <li> and then I wrap each cube in cling wrap, I then place a few in ziplock bags</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel ALL the dead skin coming off your face.</li>
            <li> But it ALWAYS went away within a few minutes of coming out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Anyway I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be shocked when first seeing it in person like it did with my husband, it looks just like a clump of mud.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll order again since the color is messy</li>
            <li> : I am also using raw shea butter as a nightly face moisturizer and raw organic apple cider vinegar as a toner, every time I wash my&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it with raw ivory shea butter.</li>
            <li> Shocked because I have spent a lot of money on products to clear my face.</li>
            <li> My face started to feel dry after about 1.5 weeks into using this product and my skin reacted poorly to the combination with an inflamed rash.</li>
            <li> Using for face requires VERY little of the soap - just a pinch.</li>
            <li> Ive tried other black soaps with shea base and the burned hulls as the source of natural lye</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, just smells very earthy.</li>
            <li> Small razors?</li>
            <li> I usually but the shea terra brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well its works just yet.</li>
            <li> There was a small label with a barcode.</li>
            <li> I pull out the soap to wash as usual and</li>
            <li> This is the REAL black soap from Ghana.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I find real black soap to be healing to my skin.</li>
            <li> Just break off a small piece, mold it into a circle and put it somewhere where it isn&#x27;t sitting in water when you are done.</li>
            <li> As I have used this product in past.</li>
            <li> The soap is very messy in general.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I am cutting a small piece at a time as it is a big block of soap.</li>
            <li> Also, my face was really dull looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard todescribe as I can not think of anything like it, you&#x27;d have to try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this soap, I read some negative reviews saying that they recieved, their soap in pieces and looked like &amp;#34;kitty litter.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> One complaint.  </li>
            <li> At least my skin isn&#x27;t itchy afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I only wish they would take those at ck out its dangerous</li>
            <li> Try, an inch thick 3/4s of a cookie sheet sized hunk in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, but Unfortunately did not work for me :(</li>
            <li> I also would break out from time to time, not really enough to call it acne but enough for the pimples to be annoying and to leave ugly dark marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to organic, I seriously doubt it.</li>
            <li> have been really insecure about my dark marks/hyperpigmentation all over my face forever!</li>
            <li> I have been trying really hard to pick them out when I see them, but it is impossible to not miss a few before it is too late</li>
            <li> But the smell is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> This soap has weird, little, jagged pieces that tear up your flesh and scratch you!</li>
            <li> I sort of burnt my nose and cheeks by leaving it on too long, but now my skin doesn&#x27;t react badly to it at all.</li>
            <li> it was very hard and packaged in a ziploc bag</li>
            <li> It drys out my skin and is really inconvenient, if you tear off a little piece and throw it in the trash it looks like dog poop</li>
            <li> Your skin is not cleaner when it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> worse before it gets better&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Smell is not great, but it does not linger after you wash it off, so it will not interfere with any colognes or perfumes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had boyfriends ask me what my secret is</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s highly frustrating that I have to keep picking out these sand grains in the soap just so I can rub it on my body.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just kept getting worse</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not that disappointed because there are plenty of non raw or organic soaps on the market that are drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M UNABLE TO OFFER ANY FEEDBACK FROM THAT STAND POINT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> disgusting smell, look and feel i swear it was even growing mold on it 3rd day</li>
            <li> or if i&#x27;m doing something wrong please let me know.</li>
            <li> and I had tried all the expensive products but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> or I sometimes use brown sugar followed by egg white (yes it smells awful but works) as my mask.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t purchase again unfortunately</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t appear to be any artificial junk in it from the smell and feel.</li>
            <li> It also dries acne like crazy.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my fault, but this soap cut me up so bad.</li>
            <li> it would look painful</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate the soapy scent, and the residue.</li>
            <li> Plus I hate makeup</li>
            <li> This morning I took a shower and got some very painful scratched on my thigh (in the picture) from something in the soap.</li>
            <li> and I hated it!</li>
            <li> Horrible cleanser!</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> Made my legs break out in an awful rash!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who has awful ache.  </li>
            <li> I had terrible acne breakout because of medication which I was prescribed</li>
            <li> I discovered this product by accident on the streets of NY @$5.00 a jar and decided that things couldn&#x27;t get any worst.</li>
            <li> This stuff will be the worst soap in your eye pain that you&#x27;ll ever feel!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is the only raw product that clears my skin from pimples and blemishes. I will never use anything else on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using African Black Soap for years now. Acne - lets just say that I use to have it. I use a cotton ball with cool water and gently rub and pat my face in my old acne spot areas. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I’m here to report to you that this stuff really works. Not only is my skin smoother &amp; velvety. I haven’t had any outbreaks since I started to use it. Before you apply it to your skin, lathers slightly between your hands or use a cloth, you can feel the natural texture of the product.( It’s a little grainy, and can crumble a bit when first opened, but it’s not messy or anything. Cut into bars and wrap what you don&#x27;t immediately use in cellophane.) It doesn’t dry out your skin, and you’re left with dewy clean skin. Apply a little moisturizer, and that’s it, you’re done. Two products, one for less than $10.00. Makes quite a few bars. You can even wash you hair it did wonder for my psoriasis. Make sure you condition. Liquid soap can be made ratio water 2 to 1 soap or adjust to your taste. You can leave on a few minutes as face mask. Start gently if you&#x27;ve never exfoliated.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this... buy products to support the economy of Africa, using local resources, and regular people making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the soap gets you clean.  And it&#x27;s just kind of cool to use an &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; soap.  And it smells good.  I&#x27;m guessing it would be a conversation piece if a stranger walks into your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; twice as fast as other soaps, especially if you let it stay wet, and it adds a little extra work to keep your shower clean because there&#x27;s twice as much total soap being used.  But it is also only half as expensive as regular soap, and just cool, so it evens out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t decided if I&#x27;ll buy more, but I definitely don&#x27;t regret making the purchase I did.  If I ever make soap with some of the books I bought, I may use some of this in the recipe with a hardening agent, that would be pretty cool, and if THIS company does that, it would be a five star product.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap .... Fast delivery .... One issue: picture should match product delivered.... It is One whole piece not multiple pieces as shown in products picture .... Other then that I would not have an issue of reorder.... A++++</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the service regarding with this soap. It came right on the delivery date, and the soap was intact. This soap has a nice lather, and leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean. Moisturizing afterwards is recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years because of my eczema.  It is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this soap!did wonders to my skin!</li>
            <li> I make a lot of my own beauty products and use this as an ingredient in my face and body wash. It looks strange but has such a clean smell and does a great job. Love it!</li>
            <li> Best soap I have ever used for my face, helps a lot with my acne.</li>
            <li> Glass? Sand? Small razors? I have no idea what they put in these, but I am left with deep scratches on my body that last for days after using these bars. No, this is not exfoliation. Your skin is not cleaner when it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> Loved it but it had alot of crumbled pieces.</li>
            <li> I love this soap because you can tweek it to your liking</li>
            <li> Great soap. You can wash yourself from head to toe. If you are having skin issues like eczema, acne or seborrhea dermatitis it can sting a little. If it stings then you know its working. After several applications your minor skin aliment is gone and you are one happy camper.</li>
            <li> Great quality and quantity for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Very good and works very well.</li>
            <li> The product smelled fine (not nice, but not bad) and lathered nicely. I was certainly hopeful after reading other reviews. However, after each use my skin got inflamed and got more and more breakouts each time. The breakouts came quickly and it somehow made my skin seem way more oily that anytime I&#x27;ve ever experienced in the past. I tried to stick with it to see if it was just a &amp;#34;get worse before it gets better&amp;#34; kind of thing. Unfortunately, it just kept getting worse and I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It does melt away if left in water, but I have learned how to combat this by placing it in a plastic contained with holes for draining water.</li>
            <li> An overall good standard soap without all the chemicals.  It isn&#x27;t going to cure your skin problems, but it is a nice soap that doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals in it yet does a good job at cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li> The perfect soap for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have never had clear skin like this in my life... makes me regret spending all that money on proactive and murad</li>
            <li> FACE AND BODY WASH. SKIN FEELS CLEAN AND SMOOTH, I&#x27;VE USED BLACK SOAP FROM MANY DIFFERENT SELLERS BOTH ON AMAZON AND EBAY AND I WOULD SAY THE SOAP FROM THIS SELLER IS MY FAVORITE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL DEFINITELY CONTINUE BUYING FROM THIS SELLER. MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN USING BLACK SOAP FOR OVER A YEAR NOW, WE LIKE BEING CLEAN BUT HAVEN&#x27;T FOUND ANYTHING &amp;#34;NON CHEMICAL&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;FROM THE HEALTH FOOD STORE OR REGULAR MARKETS THAT FEELS AS GOOD AS BLACK SOAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEITHER OF US HAVE ANY SKIN PROBLEMS SO I&#x27;M UNABLE TO OFFER ANY FEEDBACK FROM THAT STAND POINT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAME AS ORDERED, ON TIME. GOOD DEAL GREAT SOAP....EVERYTHING I ASKED FOR : )</li>
            <li> African Black Soap Raw Organic Natural Pure...Came in a plain see-thru bag,in large chunks weighing 1 lb 2 oz. Cut up a section to use, It DOES Melt quickly..did not last long. Not like the Dudu Osun Black Soap. Will not be buying this version of the soap again. Putting unused chunks in freezer as the house is warmer in these high temp days.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel so clean...the very first time I used it ,it did burn but it was cleansing snd removing impurities my face is so clear ...and also it helps fade scars snd strechmarks with exfoliating...its the real deal...not a fake Knock off brand...</li>
            <li> Still undecided as to whether I love the feel or not on my skin.  Okay I must say</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Great Quality.</li>
            <li> I have never felt so clean with any other soap like I do this one! There is no soap scum, and one order could last a person years!!! It suds up so easy!! There is not really a scent, but just a light generic scent. Not a bad one at all!! My skin is smoother and softer!!! I love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent and LARGE amount. Sliced it and gave it to my co-workers and they all got hooked.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I have been able to space out my facials because of this stuff.  I have figured out not to use it except in the shower because if you leave it on too long it will burn, not a problem when I use it in the shower (I put some in a bottle and then fill bottle with water and use as a liquid).  I feel my face and acne has improved with its use.</li>
            <li> Interesting. Smells pleasant. Feels healthy to the skin.</li>
            <li> Wow...Ive received my black soap almost a month ago and have noticed a difference in my skin tone...My skin feels and looks clearer!...Ill defiantly be buying some more...Thank you...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!! My skin feels cleaner &amp; more refreshed! The only flaw is it will skin so make sure you moisturize your skin!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have only been using the soap for a week. This is my first time using ABS,  so I can&#x27;t do a comparison. It smells earthy and lathers very well. It&#x27;s creamy and leaves my face feeling very clean but a little dry. It does melt easily.&lt;br /&gt;I was displeased with the packaging. It came in a plastic bag shapped into a big block. I chose to cut it down into individual bars and wrapped them in wax paper covered with plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;No real complaints!</li>
            <li> Great product, did not come in pieces as advertise.</li>
            <li> Yes!!! I was extremely pleased with my package! It arrived on time and was neatly packaged. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great quality, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love this soap my face feels so clean and it&#x27;s not oily or dry I will be ordering this again</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap mainly on my face for a couple years now. I have very sensitive skin, and this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all. I pair it with my homemade shea butter-coconut oil &#x27;lotion&#x27; for a nice clean,moisturized face! Would use it on my whole body every day, but I make my own soap and use that instead.</li>
            <li> Great soap make skin so soft, but would not use everyday.</li>
            <li> Best skin product I&#x27;ve ever used! And I have tried many name brand products before..</li>
            <li> Excellent size and delivery. There are so many possibilities to tailor this raw organic soap to your specifications.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I did break out for a couple weeks once I started but it&#x27;s really keeping the amount of acne coming up to a minimal. Makes my skin feel super soft! Does burn, so be aware. I have gotten used to it though, doesn&#x27;t happen to much anymore now that my skin has adjusted to it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> It looks as pictured seems lathers well but can be drying</li>
            <li> My Husband and I love, love, love African Black Soap. A little goes a long way. See how to liquify to make a shampoo or bath wash.    [...]</li>
            <li> PACKAGE NOT TIGHTLY AND SOAP ARRIVED MOSTLY CRUMBLED.  THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A GIFT BUT CAN&#x27;T BE NOW.</li>
            <li> Good quality, makes a lovely body wash. Packaging is not the best, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> Bought it to make body wash. I keep some by the sink as hand soap bc I like the neutral smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is not the greatest, but washes away.  Works fine.</li>
            <li> disgusting smell, look and feel i swear it was even growing mold on it 3rd day</li>
            <li> This soft bar soap is gentle on skin even though it has a slightly scary looking appearance.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it, but have found it to cleanse my skin without stripping all moisture from it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap ! Great quality and price !</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. A little goes a long way, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using black soap for a year and have loved it! I usually but the shea terra brand. However, it&#x27;s a little more costly, so I decided to give this one a try and I hated it! It feels just like regular soap that leaves a little bit of a residue when you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> BEST SOAP EVER!!!! Used it for my acne prone skin and it works wonders! Love it so much! Definitely buying again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a soapmaker myself but was curious about this soap and low on my own household unwrapped supply, so i ordered this, lured by low price and lack of extra packaging. . Ive tried other black soaps with shea base and the burned hulls as the source of natural lye so knew generally what to expect. What came was very soft uncured, incompletely saponified brown soap, very wet so smaller than weight would indicate. I like to add texture in form of flower petals and spices to my handmade soap  but this had way too much extra hull material, probably just to add bulk to sell by weight and very little real soap content.  The soap barely lathered but i got a lovely gentle face cleanse when i rub a lot of soap into a washcloth and use it that way, rinsing away the extra hulls or half burnt leaves. Not as cleansing and sensually satisfying as good handmade organic soap with better oils as base and an appropriate amount of lye to do its saponification job but better than cheap chemical commercial soap because there are no fake scents and the natural glycerin has not been removed.  I sliced the loaf into smaller bars to see if air curing helps any. It probably won&#x27;t, realistically, but maybe their next batch will be better.</li>
            <li> This sop seems very authentic. It even has bits of black rock in it. Not sure I&#x27;ll order again since the color is messy but it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Great soap if you like to exfoliate your body. It really dies your skin but a good body lotion takes care of that.</li>
            <li> Great soap. You get a lot for.little money. Just be sure not to expose it to too much moisture when not in use. It will turn completely liquid.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I always feel extra clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it on my skin</li>
            <li> Its kind of unreal how well my skin is responding to this product. I&#x27;m waiting for something not so great to happen or for the results to go downhill, because this feels too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I am also using raw shea butter as a nightly face moisturizer and raw organic apple cider vinegar as a toner, every time I wash my&lt;br /&gt;face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been really insecure about my dark marks/hyperpigmentation all over my face forever! Also, my face was really dull looking. I also would break out from time to time, not really enough to call it acne but enough for the pimples to be annoying and to leave ugly dark marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for almost a week now and I noticed such a great difference! My face is brighter, I look more alive with no makeup. I can tell my dark marks aren&#x27;t as intensely dark as they would be. Also, I haven&#x27;t seen a break out yet. Usually a pimple or four pops up every other day for me. I did notice only one whitehead pop up since last week then disappear VERY quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also using this on my body. I have light to moderate eczema on select areas like the folds of my arms, behind my legs, ect. and washing with this soap has soothed it tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an awesome makeup remover as well. Just like the other reviews, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes because it does sting.  I have read that some users wash their face with it and leave the lather on a little longer before rinsing off. I tried that and it STUNG, even after washing it off, my face was still tingling.. My face is sensitive and the soap is potent so I wont be trying that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face regimen is as follows: Morning Time: wash face with black soap, spray ACV toner, and moisturize with Clinique EVEN BETTER Skin Tone Correcting Moisturizer  Evening Time: remove eye make up with olive oil, wash face with black soap, (sometimes exfoliate), spray with ACV toner, moisturize with shea butter.. I don&#x27;t deviate from thisbecause I know consistency is key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my naturally curly 3c hair by allowing a few chunks soak in a bottle of water for about two days. It lathered up pretty nicely. I think I love it on my hair too, but to be sure. I&#x27;ll try it about 2-3 more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have fallen in love. Lifetime user.</li>
            <li> We like this soap a lot. I order it for me and my mother in law. She says it does amazing things for her skin. I use it on me and my daughter and we love it as well. TY</li>
            <li> Yes, I love this soap and the packaging was perfect.  I will be ordering again and tell my friends about this product.</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it morning and evening, and my face is getting better daily. Get this soap it is a must have.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, but Unfortunately did not work for me :( my face broke out completely</li>
            <li> This soap is perfect for break outs and acne just break a piece off, lather it real good, apply and wash off do not leave the lather on your face or scrub to long this soap is raw and it will cause irritation and redness but other than that it&#x27;s a very good product</li>
            <li> This smells like regular unscented soap, and seems to act like regular soap. I&#x27;ve never been able to use lye-based soaps, not even castile versions because they all dry my skin and make it feel too tight; but I had hoped that this would be different - not! I&#x27;m guessing that the use of ashes in the manufacture of this soap makes it too alkaline as does regular lye soap. It leaves a residue on my skin, and dries my skin. I hate the soapy scent, and the residue. The &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; feeling on my skin is actually the residue left on it after washing with this. The drying effect made my skin look like parchment. Horrible cleanser!</li>
            <li> I use this soap as a shampoo for my dreads and it works great. My dreads are softer and don&#x27;t have that dried out feeling to them anymore.</li>
            <li> Good soap.  Feels good and keeps your skins moisturized.</li>
            <li> Came in a single block, best to cut it up. I use it as a face soap to help with my oily skin. From what I&#x27;ve seen, it lathers well and leaves my face smooth and moisturized. Smell is not great, but it does not linger after you wash it off, so it will not interfere with any colognes or perfumes.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to purchase this. I had heard so much good about African black soap. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it on my face. I break out often and as adult it sucks. Nothing works. In just two uses, I noticed a change in my skin. It is clearing up already. Shocked because I have spent a lot of money on products to clear my face. I am very happy and pleased and will buy more. It came in one huge chunk. I cut into bars. I also passed a few bars out to my friends who like me have adult acne.</li>
            <li> This soap started off wonderful for me. It made my skin feel so smooth &amp; it lathered up really nice. After about another week of this soap I started realizing scratches on my skin. It made my skin more irritable and red. After getting out of the shower my skin felt dry and no longer felt softer or smooth. I did not like the formation of the soap. It being clumpy and having so much brown residue. I would advise to not use a white wash cloth. The soap is very messy in general.&lt;br /&gt;Also I am AA &amp; have dry &amp; sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Little weird looking natural soap!</li>
            <li> I like the black soap and this one is great. It&#x27;s not too hard on my skin and doesn&#x27;t crumbles quickly like some other black soap.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff! I shaved some off and put it in a bottle of water. I like it for my hair. Cured itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Raw Organic African Black Soap for at least 2 years. I rarely need lotion my skin is so soft. I&#x27;ve had boyfriends ask me what my secret is ;) I have very sensitive skin so this works miracles for me. When I first met my boyfriend he had such dry skin it would look painful (commercial fisherman) he started using the soap and loves it as well. I just slice off a bar sized chunk and keep in in a tupperware container in the shower. When I had very short hair i washed my hair with it and I can use it on my face as well. I will never use another soap again.</li>
            <li> Soap was wonderful, stings at first but after consistent usage it does not sting any more.  Evens out skin tone and makes your face glow.  Will try on body next.</li>
            <li> I💜this soap and it really works for my face, ALOT of ppl kept saying that it&#x27;s very frying to the skin but not mine because my face is VERY oily so I don&#x27;t have to use moisturizers after I use it on my face. I also like to wash my feet with it because it&#x27;s winter time and the skin on my feet peels and this soap helps remove that dead skin &amp; then I put Vaseline on them when I get out of the shower or bath tub.</li>
            <li> Black soap is well known&lt;br /&gt;Smoothes the skin and gives it the brightest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for my hair&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that completely stop hair loss&lt;br /&gt;And my hair became a natural sheen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;الصابون الأسود غني عن التعريف&lt;br /&gt;ينعم البشرة ويكسبها لمعانا&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;أنا استخدمه لشعري&lt;br /&gt;لاحظت أن تساقط الشعر توقف تماما&lt;br /&gt;وأصبح لشعري بريقا طبيعيا</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP MY SKIN IS SO SOFT AND MY BROWN SPOTS ON ARMS AND LEGS ARE GETTING LIGHTER  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love this soap after using it for a month my face is clearer, no breakouts or blackheads anymore! I have so many compliments from friends and family on how clear my skin looks! I used to have noticeable blackheads on my nose and the surrounding area and brake-outs of acne on my cheeks and chin... Not anymore!&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase from this seller again fast shipping and real african black soap.I also plan on giving African black soap to all my friends for the holidays</li>
            <li> not the quality I expected</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I use it everyday I break off a piece get it wet in the cloth and rub in a circular motion not hard but on face and neck. I use shea butter after.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have chronically dry skin and get eczema and this soap works wonders for me. I&#x27;m spoiled now - I have to take chunks of it with me when I travel :)</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this soap,because it really help my acne.</li>
            <li> No it gave me breakout and more blackheads than before. I saw my skin was getting darker</li>
            <li> Full of grit and wood pieces. More than this, mine was half molded. Trash</li>
            <li> Found this to work great for shaving even.  I have to move quicly because the lather does not last.  But after I&#x27;m done the face is smooth and a bit tingly.  But I usually use a little Shea butter or other oils to moisturize, I&#x27;m good for the day.  It is not as harsh as I had expected.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this soap, I read some negative reviews saying that they recieved, their soap in pieces and looked like &amp;#34;kitty litter.&amp;#34;  I ordered it anyway hoping that this wouldn&#x27;t be the case. I recieved mine in 2 giant bars of soap. The bars are so big, I have cut 6 bars out of the 2, to reduce the size to a normal bar of soap. I wanted to explain this because it lasts forever! I wrapped the remaining 5 bars of soap in plastic wrap to preserve for later use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am caucasian and have extremely sensitive skin, and lots of face washes will cause my face to break out. This soap clears up any acne, and is also good for dry skin. Having said that, the soap can dry your skin out ONLY if you do not moisturize after. If you get a light weight moisturizer and apply it after every soap use, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a natural scent, but it isn&#x27;t strong, and I really like the smell. It has a light shea butter scent, without all of the added parfumes that other soaps contain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive skin, I found it is best just to apply it to your hands, then rub it on your skin. Rubbing the soap directly on the skin can be a little too abrasive. I love this product, I definitely recommend it for any skin type, and I will certainly continue to buy it! Worth every penny!!! :)</li>
            <li> Everything I expected</li>
            <li> The handmade raw organic soap is great for giving your body a radiant and glowing skin tone. It also cleans the skin very well. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> the big bar cuts up easily with a butter knife.  I like the copious lather and have used it to shampoo.  I&#x27;m a guy with average length &amp;#34;guy hair&amp;#34; and never use conditioner so a lady might have a different opinion as far as shampoo.  it also rinses well.  I like the soap!</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for 3 weeks and I absolutely love it. I use it from head to toe: my hair, my face and my body and it is miraculous. I look forward to showering. My skin is so clear and soft my hair and scalp are refreshed. I only experienced a little burning when I first used the product. And it does dry, but no more than any other soap or shampoo. A good natural moisturizer in an ideal compliment once you are cleansed and softened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut the large bar into about 12 smaller cubes and stored them in a Zip lock bag until I&#x27;m ready to take another out and move it to my shower.</li>
            <li> This soap helped my acne so much! I can feel the difference every time I use it. The soap has also been beneficial for the breakouts on my chest and back.</li>
            <li> I buy this a lot. I have tried many other soaps but came back to this one because it does the best job of making me feel (and look) clean. Raw &amp; organic is the best way to go and I really enjoy how effective it is. Will continue to buy every month, I suggest you do your research &amp; then do the same and buy some.</li>
            <li> Cleans skin beautifully!!! Excellent for removing acne and skin issues.  Great seller!! Quick shipping..Highly recommended</li>
            <li> TOO AMAZING D-:! Can&#x27;t describe how good it is ;-:! :-D! 100000/10</li>
            <li> I love it, &amp; it&#x27;s at such a reasonable price. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well its works just yet. I gave five stars because  it is exactly  what I expected.</li>
            <li> Awful! This soap has weird, little, jagged pieces that tear up your flesh and scratch you! It&#x27;s like sharp soap! Made my legs break out in an awful rash! Not for me at all!</li>
            <li> Great natural skin scrub, and smells nice, nevermind the looks it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This soap is all natural good for body acne and all. Fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li> The best soap ever.  Skin looks good and feels softer.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing!! I stared breaking out after moving to another state (huge environment change) and I used this once a day and my skin is completely clear. I tried using it twice a day but my face got really dry. I found the best results were when I washed my face at night only, rubbing the soap on my palms first, then my face for 30 seconds (any more and it started to sting. I just make sure that I dry the soap off with a paper towel after or else it gets really gummy (it dissolves in water). I just cut off a little piece and keep the rest in a dark cabinet or the freezer. It came in a perfect little cube shape. Totally satisfied and I&#x27;ll continue to use Natural Cosmetic&#x27;s brand of ABS. So much better than the processed soap you get at stores. This is completely natural and I had no problems with grit or roughness.</li>
            <li> This soap is a great secret in skin care. It lathers beautifully, exfoliates and moisturizes. My rough heel/ankle areas are much more soft and less flaky. The acne/bumps on my shoulders and back is decreased. I will never use anything else and have always believed that natural products are always healthier than synthetic chemical concoctions. Just keep the soap dry between uses. Try it. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for everything. It&#x27;s great for face wash, body soap, hand soap, shaving soap, I&#x27;ve even heard of some people using it instead of shampoo. I haven&#x27;t used it that way yet but I can see how it would work. I&#x27;m using this to remove my make up and as a daily face wash for acne in addition to showering with it. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has started clearing up already and it&#x27;s a lot less oily. My boyfriend used it on a rash and it helped the rash heal in three days.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for everything it is very soft and refreshing on my skin, and it makes me feel very clean.</li>
            <li> I use this product to wash my face, and it leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. It cleared up my acne too!</li>
            <li> I am on my second bar of African Black Soap. It is mild and cleans well without drying my skin. I will continue to use this soap.</li>
            <li> Could not tolerate the smell, so I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the effects. I have a very sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li> Was as described by the seller. Doesn&#x27;t appear to be any artificial junk in it from the smell and feel.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing, leaves me feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> 　&lt;br /&gt;Presentation: This product is not about presentation.  It came to me in a Ziploc bag wrapped up in an even smaller clear bag. There was a small label with a barcode. If you are the type of person who needs their soap to come in a fancy box, this product is NOT for you!&lt;br /&gt;　&lt;br /&gt;Smell: I did some research and I am aware that black soap is a completely NATURAL product; as such there is the possibility that there may be odor. I was surprised to find there was no scent at all, neither pleasant or repulsive.  I couldn&#x27;t really smell anything.  It would have been nice to have a good aroma, but no smell at all is better than a foul funk. For those who can&#x27;t handle heavily perfumed commercial soaps, this is a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;　&lt;br /&gt;Lather: After using the soap, I was astounded at how well it lathered. It is an organic product with no sulfate or additives so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to suds up well. If there are no suds, it can feel as if you aren&#x27;t really getting clean. But the lather is BETTER than commercial soap. I used a loofah &amp; a piece of soap the size of a Lego and I washed myself head to toe no problem. The piece didn&#x27;t even shrink much in size so I know the pound of soap I bought will last for months.&lt;br /&gt;　&lt;br /&gt;Acne: I have had less acne with this product. I can&#x27;t say if it is the soap or other changes that I have made. I may get a white head every now and then, but nothing you&#x27;d call severe.&lt;br /&gt;　&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This is a NATURAL product as such it may grow mold. To avoid this I store my unused soap in the freezer. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it in ideal mold conditions i.e. hot &amp; humid or cold &amp; damp places. Other than that it&#x27;s a great product and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Seems to work for reducing my scalp folliculitis,however I had to discontinue as both my arms and neck are now covered with a rash. Perhaps others will be more successful.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I read that it was good for getting rid of acne and clearing up scars. I absolutely love it! I use it every night and I have seen a great improvement in my skin. It is supposed to balance the ph in your skin so sometimes my face becomes a little oily and sometimes it becomes dry but as long as I follow up with a moisturizer it is perfect. I would recommend this soap to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Bought for myself, and now the whole family uses. Already re- purchased.  One complaint.  First time I ordered it I received a nice square block.  Second time I ordered it, I received an up recognizable shape.  It was thinner and longer and misshapen. I really do love this product however.  It feels like you are moisturizing yourself as you wash.  I don&#x27;t even use shaving cream when I shave my legs.  I don&#x27;t have to, not with this soap. Don&#x27;t expect a flowery, or manufactured scent.  The scent is earthy in the shower but it doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin afterward.  But the softness totally does.  I use less moisturizer when I get out of the shower now that I use this soap. Try it you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Honestly I have sensitive skin and I have had acne since the seventh grade this soap is not for all types of skin. I am now a freshman in college I thought that this would solve my problem from previous failed attempts at trying to clear my skin. I am honestly just giving up and going to a dermatologist because I could have been paid a dermatologist money with all the failed experiments on my face. If your a brown skin like me DON&#x27;T DO IT you will find another way don&#x27;t waste your money i wish someone would have told me this in the reviews when I was reading them</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because - to be frank - even with all the good reviews here I was initially fairly hesitant and apprehensive about getting this soap.  I mean just look at it, it is not the prettiest or even somewhat normal looking compared to what we typically see here in the US.  For at least the last few years I have only used what would be considered somewhat natural soap bars.  I consider myself fairly picky in this regard.  I&#x27;ve used the african black soap in the past which was good soap too but too expensive for regular use (and I would rate this soap better)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see I was really trying hard not to post yet.  I&#x27;ve only used it to wash my hands several times so far, but wow...its like the best natural soap I&#x27;ve ever used with some great built in exfoliating action due to the texture of it.  It manages to exfoliate extremely well without feeling any harsh abrasive action.  It&#x27;s hard todescribe as I can not think of anything like it, you&#x27;d have to try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it&#x27;s pretty close to being a perfect everyday soap except for maybe the fragrance (for those who like highly fragrant, exotic, or perfumy smelling soaps.  It&#x27;s not a bad fragrance but it&#x27;s very mild and this is coming from someone who prefers freshly scented milder soaps.  But you do smell and feel a without a doubt completely clean feeling after washing with them and it doesn&#x27;t take long to get there thanks to that lovely exfoliating action thats going on there.  Just washing my hands and I can feel that this soap is absolutely chemical free - yes, that&#x27;s right...you can absolutely feel that this is natural and it is a great soap (and mind you I use only natural soaps as it is so I am already well accustomed to the difference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even worked on my motorcycle mildly doing a quick fix with a few minor adjustments which left my hands not exceptionally grimy but definitely obvious I had done some mechanical work and thought I would test this soap out and see how good it really is.  I originally had a slight fuel leak so there was the lingering smell of fuel on my hands.  I pull out the soap to wash as usual and wow this cleaned better than AND faster than the specialized mechanics soaps I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Absolutely no oily or grimy residue left behind, no fuel smell, and my hands felt as if I had done no work at all which usually takes a few washings and/or a shower to get rid of completely.  My (old) favorite soap bar is going to have to take a back seat while I use the rest of this soap and just maybe if it&#x27;s lucky I might use it if I forget to order more before this runs out!  So hard for me to believe that my old soap is getting replaced so soon when it took me much pain and toil to find such an economically effective and pleasing natural soap to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing is that this soap also seems to be longer lasting in water than my previous soap...all this and I haven&#x27;t even showered with it yet.  Can&#x27;t wait!  I will update if there are any significant changes soon.</li>
            <li> Do not like the soap any longer it made my skin purge and burn whether I left it on for one second or several seconds! I use the Nubian Heritage Black soap and I melt it down added tea tree oil and rose hip seed oil works so much better for my skin drinking plenty of water is also a bonus!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product. When it arrived I noticed white fuzzy stuff growing on the soap. I tried to rub it off and thought nothing about it and left it on the shelf until I was ready to use it. A couple of weeks latter I took it down off the shelf and noticed that not only did the fuzz come back but now it had blotches of blue mold spores growing on it. I immediately through it away. You have been forewarned!!</li>
            <li> Great price and quality as stated. Delivered quickly. I am happy with it</li>
            <li> was buying a bar for five dollars at the farmers market! Thanks for saving me money. My daughter has eczema helps her skin and I just use it because it&#x27;s great on my face. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I separated it into several chunks and just add water to submerge it and let it sit overnight. It is completely dissolved the next day. Then I noticed there&#x27;s some sand particles at the bottom.  I wonder how they got into the soap....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to organic, I seriously doubt it. On the package, it only says natural. Nowhere mentions the organic certification.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and I love it, my skin is significantly better. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great, justa as described.</li>
            <li> Does not strip the skin and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome all-natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural-Cosmetics by Atharva Imports (fulfilled by Amazon) makes the BEST authentic African Black Soap available (they follow the original recipe from Ghana with only 4-5total ingredients)... Nasabb.com makes the second best (but there have been some inconsistencies with timeliness of order processing)... As far as the other versions of the soap, I have tried several and by comparison, the other brands definitely do not measure up AND the formulary is not the same as the original Ghanaian(sp?) based recipe, so if it isn&#x27;t made/disributed by Natural-Cosmetics ( see Amazon product page link:  http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058NANJC?ref_&#x3D;cm_rdp_product )  or Nasabb.com, don&#x27;t risk it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, an important buyer&#x27;s note; real African Black Soap does not contain any sulfates OR artificial ingredients and only contains less than 8 TOTAL ingredients and must contain: Plantain Skin Ash, Cocoa- Pod Ash, Shea Bark Ash, and Palm Oil. The original formulary only contains about 5 ingredients in total, (some newer formularies may also contain shea-palm-leaf-ash, vitamin E oil, honey or/and organic aloe depending upon the region in which it is made). But, the traditional recipe is the one you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is Great for controlling eczema, psoriasis, acne, oily skin, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important usage tips:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;African Black Soap is very potent and depending upon your skin type needs, is best used between 2-4days per week, with a normalizing or moisturizing (aloe, cucumber, shea, honey) natural soap used on the alternating days to maximize benefits and prevent over drying. Also, it is important to apply your African Black Soap with a soft cloth or facial brush or bath brush to avoid scratches as Natural soaps derived from caustic potash may retain some solid organic bits that may bruise if rubbed directly onto the skin.  And authentic African Black Soap does not have any &#x60;labeling&#x27; and is simply cut and wrapped in a saran-like plastic wrapping and shipped.\\&quot;-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Save your soap crumbles and make LIQUID soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get to the last little bits of your soap save them and dice them into even smaller pieces with a small knife. Steep the crumbles in hot to warm water until fully dissolved and add more water as desired for consistency (many suggest about 1ounce of crumbles to 2ounces water)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage note:&lt;br /&gt;If you get the 1lb bar or larger, cut it into smaller bars using a sharp (butcher&#x27;s) knife and freeze the rest.&lt;br /&gt;** For more information on authentic African Black Soap you can Google or Yelp for more information on the web, but&lt;br /&gt;visit the websites of the two best soap-makers/distributors of the soap at: Nasabb.com or Atharvaimports.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of quality, definitely a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;Our grade: A/A-, Definitely a 5-Star product!&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Our 3 favorite (head to toe) natural soaps for sensitive skin types:&lt;br /&gt;1.

            <li> The soap I ordered came quite fast and just as I expected. It was wrapped in some sort of cling wrap and was in a big block shape. After reading some reviews, I decided to make my own liquid ABS. I cut off a nice size chunk using a knife and then cut that chunk into about 5-6 smaller pieces. I then found a nice size container to put the small chunks in and filled the container to the top with warm water. I also put a couple drops of Sundown Vitamin E Oil (70000 IU) which I also ordered from Amazon as well. After 1-2 days the soap is ready to use. The rest of the unused soap is stored back in the original packaging and then put into a ziplock bag in the freezer for later use. The soap is great no complaints and a little goes a LONG way. I love it will be ordering more :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has helped a little with scarring. But I NO LONGER have any more acne breakouts. As I workout 5x a week, this was my major problem because of dirt buildup on my skin.</li>
            <li> The soap was cut in very small pieces as if it was the scraps left from other soaps !!!</li>
            <li> This product looks very funky (very similar to what ends up in the little bag when I walk the dog...) but it works miracles.  My teenage son has been battling back acne and mild eczema for several years.  He tried antibiotics, prescription creams, special washes-pretty much everything short of Accutane and nothing really worked.  He found this himself and asked me to order it for him.  Literally within two days, his eczema was no longer raised, pink, or itchy and after a week it is completely clear.  His acne is improved and no longer infected.  It has a mild smell and doesn&#x27;t leave his skin either dry or oily, just clean.  It&#x27;s hard to believe that something this inexpensive and odd looking could work better than all the expensive things we&#x27;ve tried, but it absolutely does.  Just warn your guests that it&#x27;s soap and not a dog turd in that soapdish...</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative for all the chemical laden soaps on the market that may cause cancer or permanent skin damage. It makes my face a little dry, but it has a rich lather &amp; a pleasant scent. It melts pretty quickly, so I cut some of it up &amp; put it in  bottles of water. I use it in the shower, as a hand soap &amp; a shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is what I expect when I order black soap.  The scent is exactly as I remember it.  The lather is wonderful, and my skin is left nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used this for acne, but it really isn&#x27;t meant for that occasional pimple. It really helps with the scarring that can be left behind from acne. Since it is organic and a bar soap the likelihood of it harboring bacteria is high.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, using it as a body wash it does wonders. Tightens up the pores so that they are less visible. I have found that even using just a small amount I can get more use out of it than something like Dove. On the face it stings the first time a little but you start to get use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want more value you could get the 5 lb packs and that would last you quite some time. Do not leave this in water as it will start to melt.</li>
            <li> Looks just as it does in the picture. A little goes a very long way. Does not have a smell &amp; the residue/bubbles are brown.  However, there are tiny pieces throughout the soap that are extremely sharp. I would be washing with it &amp; end up with very tiny cuts. This soap is also very drying. Be sure to use a good moisturizer afterwards. Literally makes you squeaky clean though.</li>
            <li> great product really started clearing up my face. sender was quick and efficient with getting the product to me</li>
            <li> This soap is absolutely marvelous.  I look forward to making a purchase soon.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin!</li>
            <li> I decuded to try ABS based on the reviews I&#x27;d read.  I can honestly say that I agree; ABS is awesome! I bought it to use on my face.  My facial skin is dry and sensitive it gives me the blues especially in the winter.  In the winter its gotten so dry that it literally stings and it would breakout.  It also became very irritated with any moisturizer I tried.  I&#x27;ve been using ABS every day for a month now.  My skin has cleared up and most of the dark spots caused by pimples are disappearing.  My pores have gotten visibly smaller.  i&#x27;ve even made a liquid soap to use in the shower. It makes your skin so soft and supple.  This is the real deal, i recommend it to my friends.  I&#x27;m going to try it as a shampoo as well.  You may feel a light burning sensation when you first try it but after a couple of days it&#x27;ll go away.  if using it 2x a day feels drying to your face, use it 1x a day.  IMO, Natural Cosmetics has the best price, the largest selection, and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> This the holy grail for every skin issue! The natural earthy smell is wonderful.My family all use it. It is great for acne, wrinkles, skin discolorations and the bonus... It reduces the size of your pores that gives you a beautiful canvas for make-up or to go au naturale! This weight was a true pound and I will order from them again.</li>
            <li> Great product this is the only soap that I use I take it every where I go. You can cut it any size you want.</li>
            <li> The soap came in a plastic bag all crumbled. I was expecting a hand made soap, but not something that I would have to &amp;#34;assemble&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m going to end up using it to wash hands now.</li>
            <li> This soap came in the mail as expected. I didn&#x27;t weigh it, as other reviews have mentioned that the total may be less than a pound. This wasn&#x27;t a particular issue for me as my main concern was that the product arrive and that the quality be effective enough for me to use regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite happy with the product. It lathers, it&#x27;s African Soap, and the smell is nice. The product is a little bit more mild, and seems to me that it requires a little bit more work to work up a good lather. I like this, however, since it reminds me that there probably aren&#x27;t as many chemicals as other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From an objective perspective, I can tell that this is probably not the premiere, highest quality in the world soap. I&#x27;ve used fancy soaps before, and i can see that the quality is probably average to high-average relative to what you can probably get in the market in Ghana. This observation is pure speculation from my traveling, however. With that said, I still am quite happy with the soap since it does get the job done, and the smell and experience is overall nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might go through this soap quickly, but that&#x27;s not really a problem. For the price-point, and ease of access, I&#x27;m not opposed to ordering this soap regularly. I might check out other soaps as well, to see what the differences are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My objective was to order an African Black soap, straight and simple, and this order fully delivered this expectation, which wasn&#x27;t particularly high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might recommend some of the liquid variety, which I&#x27;ve also used before and was quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is the REAL black soap from Ghana. I have much less breakouts and smoother skin when I use this soap. Only slight problem is an occasional grain of sand that could scratch your face, so I don&#x27;t rub the bar directly on my face. I rub it between my hands and then put the suds on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your body, use as you would a regular bar of soap. Just do not leave this soap in the wet shower or sitting in a wet soap tray because it will start melting. Put it somewhere where it will dry out. I cut the big lump of soap they shipped into 3 bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find real black soap to be healing to my skin. It helps with breakouts, acne, and psoriasis. This soap is not drying to the skin and has a mild earthy scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I planned to switch away from Dove soap, which I loved, but didn&#x27;t want to continue using (due to toxic chemicals in Dove products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really tried to like the African Black Soap, but unfortunately it seemed to be fairly &amp;#34;uncured&amp;#34;, or there was still lye in parts of the soap, because it burned my skin when I used it. My skin is not incredibly sensitive but I continued to get stinging, red, burned skin in different patches after using this product. It is also quite gritty and has chunks of charcoal/ wood/ ash/ dirt in it. (Not sure what the substance is, looks like burnt wood mostly, and then some parts have a gritty sort of sand in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have a large amount of this left (I bought the 5lb size), which I might start using for washing dishes just to get rid of it. Would not recommend this if your skin is at all sensitive.</li>
            <li> IF I GET A PIMPILE I CREATE A FOAM MASK WITH THIS SOAP UNTIL IT DRIES AND POOF! ITS GONE!</li>
            <li> So far the soap is working! It has made my skin Really soft nd it&#x27;s really clearing up my acne scars. However the only problem i have is that it causes me to break out. It&#x27;s clearing up my skin, it makes it feel softer but i have more pimples coming out then i ever do. The soap makes ur face really dry so i moisturize and sometimes i don&#x27;t (maybe that&#x27;s the problem??? Idk) My sister and i are using it and its the same thing with her. I don&#x27;t really get it, maybe if someone knows what&#x27;s happening here or if i&#x27;m doing something wrong please let me know. But it&#x27;s a great soap nd i would recommend it to anyone, hopefully u&#x27;ll have better luck on the breaking out part, cause so far i haven&#x27;t heard anyone else have that problem.</li>
            <li> It has some benefits, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for acne/skin irritation and didn&#x27;t really soften my skin either. Also, it&#x27;s really hard to use and kind of disintegrates during use, making a huge mess in the shower.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  I read a ton of wonderful reviews, so I had to try this soap and so far, I am extremely pleased!  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and I have extremely oily skin and kept getting cystic acne on my chin which was so bothersome!  Nothing really worked but since I have started using this soap,  I have seen a difference in my skin already!  This soap will last forever!  I only use a tiny piece for each washing (usually twice a day) and it lathers so nicely and is not harsh at all!  I usually put on moisturizer after washing as it does dry out my face a little.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Arrived really broken, but still ok.</li>
            <li> It is good but i will not buy it i will buy the nubian heritage african black soap it is the best.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it. If you have a sensitive skin, you may consider apply the soap on a wash cloth first, it has some sandy peaces in it - but after all, the feeling is so natural, and my skin is so happy now!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and it has always had a lot of redness. This soap has been amazing. Much of the redness is gone. It has been great for my mild eczema. I could tell how much more irritated my skin was when I went on vacation and used regular soap instead. There will be little stones mixed in occasionally, but you can pick them out if it is too much exfoliation for you. If pieces break off, you can easily mush them in your hand to make a bar. I cut the big block into bars that I wrap in plastic wrap. For those wanting a more &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; bar of soap, there are some great ABS bars available. However, if you want the true, authentic product, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap, smells like the soap of yesteryear and DOES STING if gotten into your eyes. DO NOT try it! Yet it doesnt dry out your skin. Doesnt last long unless it is kept dry between uses. I love this soap tho...</li>
            <li> the first time we bought the soap it came in a  nice package, was smooth to the touch, we really enjoyed it. The second time we purchased the soap it came wrapped in plastic wrap and felt like 80 grit sand paper, hard to use directly on skin. as did this last time . think we&#x27;ll keep looking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many good organic &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; soaps but this Raw Organic African soap is definitely the best.  It lathers well, smells clean and is very creamy.  I must admit I noticed my skin had a brighter, clean glow to it right after my 1st wash!  I began using it for my body &amp; hair which was a suggestion of my Health Conscience Client who initially started me on this Amazing journey.  Her skin is Flawless and she highly recommended this product.  Oh yeah,  almost forgot that my hair was vibrant &amp; silky smooth after using this👍</li>
            <li> Although I am writing this review a year after I recieved my product, This is how long this product has lasted me. My skin is clearer, and I just have to have this as my skin care regimen. I wanted to make sure I reordered from the same company that I received my last order as it was shipped in a timely manner, and I am well satisfied with their product.</li>
            <li> Makes skin look so even and makes it extremely soft. I wouldn&#x27;t apply this soap directly to your face for the first week or so that you use it. Lather in your hands first. You can apply directly breifly on problem spots like a zit or scar, but until your skin is use to it I would be very careful. I sort of burnt my nose and cheeks by leaving it on too long, but now my skin doesn&#x27;t react badly to it at all.</li>
            <li> Love it so far, takes make up completely. A little piece  lathers up well and last a long time. Just make sure not to leave it in the wet area, it will dissolve in water. I keep it separately in a little container. Good value.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. It&#x27;s only been a little over a month and I can see the difference in my skin and my teenage daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews and researching the history of this soap I decided to try it.  Don&#x27;t be shocked when first seeing it in person like it did with my husband, it looks just like a clump of mud.  Well......it lathers up in seconds and makes your skin feel so soft.  I wash my face every morning and night with it and when I rinse it off my face actually squeaks.......now that&#x27;s clean!  It&#x27;s great at exfoliating but don&#x27;t over scrub or it will have a light burning affect.  I have a piece by my kitchen sink and it gets used all day long, even my husband likes to use it now.  Great price.  When I first use a &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34; I run it under water to more or less glue it together as it has a tendency to crumble.</li>
            <li> It drys out my skin and is really inconvenient, if you tear off a little piece and throw it in the trash it looks like dog poop lol</li>
            <li> Great.  It is the ONLY soap I use on my face and head.</li>
            <li> This is authentic and FAST delivery</li>
            <li> Pure and original. Confirmed by my Nigerian mama. We call this Oshe Dudu and the main reason it is used by Nigerians is to give your little one they&#x27;re very real 1st bath once out of the hospital. It is said it cleanse the newborn baby wonderfully, and I attest to that. I usually have a friend or family member bring it directly from home but since this time around no one went home, I decided to give Amazon a try in buying this product and I am not disappointed. This is not only for babies, it is great with all skin type and helps prevent/heal any skin outbreak. I stopped usin J&amp;J baby shower and replaced it with black soap. I use it myself on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I have no problems with rawness. I saw a difference in my skin in about 3 days.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped a lot which was good and it came in a perfect big block and it works great, thanks.</li>
            <li> It is messy and sometimes can be a bit drying on the skin if your skin is already dry.  Otherwise, I do like it and find it works well.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use this for face, body and will liquefy it for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Using for face requires VERY little of the soap - just a pinch. If you leave it in the shower, it will melt and mold itself to your soap container. Be sure to bag it securely and separately, and store in a less humid area. I keep 2 quarter sized pieces in my bathroom cabinet, and have the rest broken down into chunks &amp;#62; individually bagged &amp;#62; bagged together &amp;#62; kept in the back of my closet</li>
            <li> Very natural product! Good quality ! Will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I was skeptical at first in buying it since I had purchased so many other different soap in the internet on a quest in finding something organic for my severe hormonal acne... Well within 3 day of using it, I woke up one morning and OMG! my face looked so much better and within one week of using it faithfully my acne was all gone and my facial pore even shrunk! My grandson has eczema on his forehead so we started to carefully wash his head with the soap and the eczema is gone! I didn&#x27;t stop there... I started to use it on the back of my arms where I had bumps and guess what? Bumps are all gone!!!! Highly recommend this soap, I will continue to use it on a daily basis...</li>
            <li> Good black soap. Same as the health store.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It cleanses my face like no other soap I&#x27;ve used before. It is drying, but with the right moisturizer right after, no problem. This is my second time buying from this seller and both times have been great.</li>
            <li> I buy ABS for my teenaged son for his acne. Clears his skin up very quickly.</li>
            <li> At first I was ecstatic because it suds so well. It suds better than any soap or shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. When taking a shower, I usually have to add more soap to my washcloth 3 times. With the African soap, that was reduced to one time! It just kept sudsing with more agitation/contact to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s very drying to the skin. It needs some sort of moisturizer in it. I&#x27;m checking out some moisturizing black soaps on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not that disappointed because there are plenty of non raw or organic soaps on the market that are drying. It just needs more moisturizing ingredients. I&#x27;ve seen recipes on youtube that add more moisturizing ingredients so I will try one/some so I don&#x27;t have to waste this wonderful soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I don&#x27;t think I will buy this one again because it dries out my skin. I&#x27;m going to try some specifically moisturizing African black soaps.</li>
            <li> Great soap, will keep buying it. We only use it for our face and it is amazing cleans with out drying your face</li>
            <li> I love this soap first and foremost. I have used it for about a couple weeks.However I purchased a 3lb pack of this soap and I found sharp sand particles in it that hurts when exposed when the soap wears down. It&#x27;s highly frustrating that I have to keep picking out these sand grains in the soap just so I can rub it on my body. I don&#x27;t know if this is common with everyone who purchased this soap or if my batch happened to fall on the floor and absorbed sand, but im beginning to hate a soap i love so much. I really tried to suck it up and continue using it, but if all these ghana soaps are like this, I will have to search for another vendor or a different type of soap.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It leaves my skin feeling clean but doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed less problem skin-- much less acne, clogged pores, dry/itchy skin, etc. I did get some gnarly razor burn when I used it to shave with, though.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin and blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Apply with sponge or cloth. Long lasting!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who has awful ache.  She said she could see results in a few days.  She likes the product and will use it again.</li>
            <li> I was using the Heritage brand for close to two years before finally switching to the natural product. I am beyond glad that I did. It works better. Has an earthy smell to it. Will never go back.</li>
            <li> The product came when it was expected, a really great raw soap. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to others, has no additives or chemicals.</li>
            <li> ILOVE THIS SOAP, MY ECZEMA IS ALMOST GONE.</li>
            <li> I bought this months ago and still have some!! Very good for body acne would defiantly reccomend</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL Soap! This soap helped me get rid of my eczema! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I will be ordering more! thank you! love it!! It has a wonderful and nice clean scent and I am not allergic to it with my very sensitive skin. it also has a very nice lather!</li>
            <li> love everything that&#x27;s organic and natural.</li>
            <li> Soap is as expected. Will be ordering again soon. Thanks</li>
            <li> Just got it and so far works great. My skin is feeling better with the use of raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have been using this for about 4 months now and so far it has done a really good job improving my skin. It has improved acne on my face, keratosis pilaris on my arms, and overall acheiving healthier skin. However there is one thing about it I simply can&#x27;t tolerate. In the soap, there are little remnants of twigs and rocks (and God know what else). I have been trying really hard to pick them out when I see them, but it is impossible to not miss a few before it is too late and you have scratched up your body and face. This morning I took a shower and got some very painful scratched on my thigh (in the picture) from something in the soap. So my advice? Liquify the soap by letting it sit in water for a bit, or lather it on a shower puff before applying it to your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap does awesome on my skin and hair</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing I thought it would. Kindleo</li>
            <li> Great! I love it. I had a severe acne breakout after trying the Oil Cleansing Method and now I have cystic acne and extremely inflamed skin, like no room between the pimples and getting like 10 new ones a day. I have to put gauze on my face at night because my pimples pop just from sleeping on them. I just washed my face with the soap and my face feels really clean. It was very gentle and not harsh. It did make my open zits feel a bit tender but it didn&#x27;t burn or anything. It&#x27;s a bit harder to lather than regular soap but I assume that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s natural. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, just smells very earthy. So far, so good. I will update later after using it for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was good. I had no trouble with it and it came through USPS.</li>
            <li> There are several things to like...It&#x27;s organic,; It cleared up my skin, as I use it on my body and face ( I am 50+ years old). You do need to keep it in a container, or it will melt.</li>
            <li> This soap makes your skin smooth and helps with discoloration.</li>
            <li> Great product, ordered for my brother and he loved it!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I love this soap!!! I read many of the reviews, some loved it and some not so much. I personally think is a great soap. It lathers beautifully and it makes my skin very smooth. I am cutting a small piece at a time as it is a big block of soap. Not grainy at all and although it is soft, it is firm enough to hold its shape. I love that its all natural with beneficial ingredients. Will definitely purchase again after I finish this one.</li>
            <li> For the first couple of days of using this product , it stung and burned my face quite a bit. After continuing to use it that feeling subsided and it definitely did just as it said it would.... My face is clearer, softer and seemed to minimize the pores on my nose. It leaves the skin on my body feeling so clean and moisturized, I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great for my skin, keeps it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have only used this soap once so far and I must say my skin has never felt so amazingly soft.I have very pale sensitive skin .......wow my skin is like silk and just glows.I love how clean I feel.Another plus is the soap has little to no lingering smell.LOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove this soap.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this soap. i bought it to help clear up some break outs I was having and have noticed a definite improvement. I haven&#x27;t seen much drying / irritation, but always make sure to moisturize with some jojoba oil and argan oil or rosehip oil immediately after washing.</li>
            <li> Works well for some not so good for others.  I use this to shave everyday and it has eliminated my razor bump issues.  It also makes my razors last much longer than they have in the past.</li>
            <li> This raw black soap is great. It&#x27;s very mild and gentle on the skin. I&#x27;d recommend it in place of any overpriced skin regiment, including Proactive.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and item as described</li>
            <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this soap.&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing. I have loved Black African Soap for awhile, but until now I had yet to try the Raw Soap.&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed!👍💯</li>
            <li> Second time around! This soap works miracles! A little goes a long way! I use it to keep my face clean, smooth and free from blemishes. My son uses it for acne, dry scalp and eczema. Frequent use will keep these problems at bay. I cut some pieces and dissolve in water to make liquid soap to use as shampoo, face and body wash. It will mush up it it is used directly with water as in the shower. Has a very pleasant smell and it is definitely a miracle soap. A must buy! Will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> Would not recommend, it burned my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried several other natural black soaps before, this one as you can see isn&#x27;t necessarily *black* in colour...Honestly, I&#x27;m being writing this review for two, instead of just myself...My boyfriend LOVES this soap, which is good because I don&#x27;t care for it very much and they send you A LOT. Try, an inch thick 3/4s of a cookie sheet sized hunk in a plastic bag. I used it for about a week and a half and stopped using it because it made my skin feel tight and (for me) wasn&#x27;t gentle enough to be used as a total body soap...I actually experienced some moderate skin irritation and itching. My boyfriend intends to buy more since he likes it so much and it&#x27;s a great deal; he washes his face and body with it daily and it does have a cocoa buttery/shea butter smell to it and it makes his skin smooth and seems to help manage the oiliness of his face. All in all, would I personally buy this again...Probably not, but I definitely recommend it for someone who doesn&#x27;t have terribly sensitive, combination skin. Side note: Be careful where you store it, we break off hunks of it and set it in out soap dish near the shower and it seems to melt down really fast once it gets wet, so by the end of the shower the bottom of the soap dish along with my own bars of soap are coated in a slimy, soapy residue from the black soap...</li>
            <li> In only a few weeks has been very good for acne, ingrown hairs, and exfoliation for face and whole body!</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  It is a bit messy so I make a liquid soap -- break off a chunk, put it in a squirt jar and fill with water.  It liquidifies and all I have to do is squirt a small amount in my palm and give my face/neck a nice lather.  It is better than any exfoliator that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap. Thanks for having it . I t was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap and great for your face and body. And also can get great results from using it daily consistantly.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It lasts a long time and has a rich, silky lather.  Great for faces or any skin.</li>
            <li> Was drying, as expected. I did find a hair in it though, which was off-putting.</li>
            <li> I re ad some of the reviews thought maybe too good to be true so I ordered African black soap glad I did.I shave a lot lot less irritation after shaving.my skin looks like better.</li>
            <li> Too harsh for my skin but great make up remover. Maybe use once in a while. Does not work for my acne.</li>
            <li> This product contain  Glycerin ????? How good is that  for yiur skin?</li>
            <li> Initially I loved this product! My face started to feel dry after about 1.5 weeks into using this product and my skin reacted poorly to the combination with an inflamed rash. I can&#x27;t really speak against this product as the sole inflictor. However, I don&#x27;t think it was a normal response considering the glowing reviews. I have used the moisturizer for years and haven&#x27;t had any issues until I included the soap in my routine. My other issue (which is my fault having fair warning) The product has no labels or packaging. It could have saw dust in it and I&#x27;d be none the wiser. Again, there was fair warning that the product comes as is photographed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly won&#x27;t give up on African Black Soap.I think I&#x27;ll hunt down a regulated product after my skin recovers.</li>
            <li> CLEAN VERY NICELY ..,SOMETIME YOU CAN FIND SEEDS , LITTLE ROCKS IN THE SOAP .IT WOULD BE A GOOD TO PUT IN A MASH .CAN ALSO DRY YOUR SKIN WOULD TO HAVE A NICE LOTION AFTER YOU USE IT.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this from a very good company but it&#x27;s quite a bit more expensive; still wanted to use this soap and it does help with oiliness and acne.  Not very aromatic but is clean scented, if that&#x27;s a good enough discription?</li>
            <li> helped my husband&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> This soap is potent and has some antiseptic properties. I like but dissolves in water quickly. Will purchase more.</li>
            <li> Works great on the face. Cleans and reduces scars. Especially if you have acne! It also helped clear away some of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> At first I thought what the heck did I actually buy? A bag of greasy dirt and banana leaves? But then we all used it. Wow! It lathers up great, doesn&#x27;t really have a smell other then an earthy aroma. It works awesome on getting anything off of your hands and skin. I now use it both for skin and as a shampoo! Your skin feels great after you dry off! I&#x27;m sold - this stuff is terrific! It is much better than Dove or any of the non allergy, non scented bars of soap. And it lasts a long time. Just break off a small piece, mold it into a circle and put it somewhere where it isn&#x27;t sitting in water when you are done.</li>
            <li> This is very nice chemical free soap. My white skin loves the black soap. Nice smell, lather and great price will have me purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This seems harsh to me. It irritates my eyes and sensitive areas of skin. It takes makeup off very well.</li>
            <li> I had terrible acne breakout because of medication which I was prescribed and I had tried all the expensive products but nothing worked. Plus I hate makeup so I refused to cover it up.  My face was a messs. I discovered this product by accident on the streets of NY @$5.00 a jar and decided that things couldn&#x27;t get any worst. WOW...Almost immediately my face started clearing up,  by the time some of my friends saw me again a few months later they were totally impressed. I highly recommend this soap. I normally follow it up with a small bit of Shea butter as my moisturizer and i&#x27;m set.  It does tend to dry up your face but moisturize properly and you&#x27;ll be fine. I scrub once a week with a product that doubles up as a mask...or I sometimes use brown sugar followed by egg white (yes it smells awful but works) as my mask. Love my skin now. Natural is most definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> love it, even gets rid of small skin tags, lightens old lady spots.  love it</li>
            <li> awesome soap. made my skin a bit firm and cleared some spots. it doesn&#x27;t work miracles but it&#x27;s a good investment. will be ordering more soon. it is also a GREAT shampoo. I love using natural products and it cleaned my hair thoroughly without drying it. I did not use conditioner so it also saves time</li>
            <li> Some people were complaining that this stings, but I have no problems and feel my skin is pretty sensitive. I used it on my face after shaving and had no problems. Lathers fine, smell is ok, natural, not perfumy. Will probably order again.</li>
            <li> My son loves it!  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I like this soap, it has a decent smell. It burned a little the first time putting it on my face</li>
            <li> Love this soap, first time user.not pretty but great product!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my fault, but this soap cut me up so bad. Almost as if there were razors in it. Beware of this.... I read on another review but ignored it. I won&#x27;t purchase again unfortunately</li>
            <li> This is the third time purchasing this soap.  I love the smell, quality, and the way it leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> hope it helps my skin havent noticed a difference yet.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first but once it got here and we tried it......the softest soap I have ever tried(even softer than liquid body wash). I will definitely be placing an order for more in a larger size because everybody in the house uses it now. Just like the other reviews stated you cannot leave this in the shower in standing water because it will dissolve. I just laid mine on plastic wrap to let it dry out and it works just the same.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use. But the smell is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> i buy two pounds at a time and split them in half which gives me 4  soap bars . each bar lasts me for about 1 1/2 month therefore 2 lbs lasts me 6months. I believe all skin types can use this because i have dry skin and my boyfriebd skin is oily and i always catch him using my stuff. Iam acne prone and this keeps my acne in check</li>
            <li> Soft, lathers good, would purchase again!</li>
            <li> ...a pile of elephant dung.  Seriously, it looks like RAW ORGANIC African elephant dung.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the wife likes it, so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Love this homemade raw organic African black soap.  What a great product for a great price!  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My black skin love the black soap</li>
            <li> Very good product. Skin looking better already. Hopefully I see more improvements. As I have used this product in past.</li>
            <li> Been using BLK Soap, for yrs. luv this!! First time shopping with this seller. Will buy again..</li>
            <li> There is mold growing on the large portion that I have not used yet. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is as advertised, and holds its shape better than some softer crumbly ones I&#x27;ve tried before. You can slice a bar off the end and keep the rest sealed up for later. Using this type of soap has really improved my skin. Acne cleared up and also dark spots from sun exposure faded. I&#x27;m 42 with oily skin that is less so after using this regularly.</li>
            <li> Leaves your body feeling squeeky clean. Also, no pimple breakouts on my face like before after. trying this black soap</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but I feels smooth and soft</li>
            <li> GREAT SOAP I ALSO USE IT FOR SHAMPOOING MY HAIR., AS WELL AS A BODY WASH....THE ITEM WAS JUST AS DISCRIBED WITH SPEEDY DELIVERY ALSO, WELL WRAPPED.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Works sooo much better than the dudo sound (sp?) version. Very gentle!! I use it on my face and I haven&#x27;t seen a pimple since! After a month the bar is surprisingly almost the same size as when I first received it! a must purchase!</li>
            <li> This is OK soap. It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in a block which you need to slice into usable pieces. I used a regular kitchen knife, it was east to chop into 4 pieces which were about the size of a regular bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;To me, it&#x27;s very mild, I even use it for cleaning my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans and I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s loaded with chemicals. At least my skin isn&#x27;t itchy afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite a novelty to receive, cut up and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not so good:&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very soft, so it doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very soft, so it&#x27;s squashy when it&#x27;s hot and wet. It looks odd in the shower (like poop!).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very soft, so when I sliced the block into usable pieces, I needed to mould them into blocks which wouldn&#x27;t break up with use.&lt;br /&gt;Mine wasn&#x27;t a pound in weight, I assume it dries out.&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviewers have mentioned grit or sand in the soap. Mine had pieces of ash, which I think is part of the soap making process. But if you rub the soap on your body to make a lather, then you can scratch yourself with the soap. (I did, and a scratch in your armpit is sore!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an interesting experiment to use. But I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> What more can I say about RAW ORGANIC AFRICAN BLACK SOAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin clear of back heads aids in closing my large pours, it also leaves my skin tight and pimple/blemish free with continued use.</li>
            <li> Works well cleared my skin up with in a matter of weeks. It washes away all dirtt and inperities and leaves your skin feeling soft and clean unlike other soaps that left my skin feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Its an account excellent soap.for.acne but I only wish they would take those at ck out its dangerous</li>
            <li> Great product.  fresh.</li>
            <li> nice product, removes all oily part from skin and that is why it cure pimples but makes your skin very dry so you have to use lotion after it.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying a bulk. This stuff lasts me for eveeeeer. One pound lasted me about a year and a half and I use it daily for at least three times.  I cut it into one inch cubes and then I wrap each cube in cling wrap, I then place a few in ziplock bags and then I place the bulk of the ziplock bags in tupperwear. I probably don&#x27;t have to be so diligent, but I find that this has been a great way to keep it from any moisture for two years. Remember that this soap does not keep well with ANY type of moisture. Keep it dry and take out only what you need. Oh!! And do nooooooot let it get in your eyes!!! This stuff will be the worst soap in your eye pain that you&#x27;ll ever feel! But it is sooooo worth it. It has helped my acne prone skin so much. It exfoliates my skin and has removed the scarring tremendously! It also dries acne like crazy. What I do on a daily basis is I walk into my warm steamy shower and let the steam open my pores up. I then lather my hands with the ABSoap and wash my face with the lather I&#x27;ve created. I then go back a second time and leave the ABSoap on my face for 3-5 minutes and wash your body or shave or what ever. Well after that I rinse the soap off my face and then I gently rub my skin in a circular motion with my ring and middle finger. You&#x27;ll feel ALL the dead skin coming off your face. This is what gets the scarring to diminish in no time. It took the scarring normally took 3-6 months to fade and diminished the time to less than two weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compliment this regiment with 1/2 rose water and 1/2 &amp;#34;Organic, Apple Cider Vinegar, with The &#x27;Mother&#x27;, Raw - Unfiltered‎&amp;#34; as a toner. I then moisturize my skin with 2-3 drops of Elma &amp; Sana 100% Pure Certified Organic Argan Oil from Morocco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**DISCLAIMER!!!!: For the first few months I used ABSoap I felt my skin burn. When I&#x27;d leave the shower my face would be red. But it ALWAYS went away within a few minutes of coming out of the shower. I researched this and I read that many people have this result, but then it stopped. The said, &amp;#34;It just meant the soap is working.&amp;#34; I listened, thankfully, and it was true for me. Obviously, listen to your skin and do what you think is best. :-)read that many people have this result, but then it stopped.

            <li> I was very dissatisfied withthis soap it was very hard and packaged in a ziploc bag smh ive ordered before in a tub and very easy to use from another company. Didnt like at all.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that African black soap existed, I must have missed the Dr Oz episode where he mentioned it, LOL!  Anyway I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I could not be more pleased.  It is what I would define as an extreme exfoliator, but I have definitely noticed improvements in my skin already:  my pores are smaller, sun spots on my face are not so dark, and believe it or not, the skin above my eyelids is tighter!  I&#x27;m a 54 year old WF if that means anything, and do take excellent care of my skin, and eat healthy.  Moisturizing afterwards is a must; something I&#x27;ve done all my adult life (it&#x27;s quick in the mornings as you&#x27;re getting ready for work) is apply baby oil right after I get out of the shower from the neck down, brush my teeth, and then dry off.  This is much less time consuming than moisturizing with creams, which I reserve for the weekends.  I actually use a variety of oils now (lemon oil, almond oil, shea oil, etc).  My only concern at this point is if the black soap strips the skin too much, and does it upset the PH balance of our skin.  If I find out, I&#x27;ll come back &amp; post any new info!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap!! It smells great and cleans well!! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Love this soap, I will purchase again. I use it with raw ivory shea butter.</li>
            <li> Love! Will keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> Eh... not really much to write home about. I have purchased black soap for many years, and this is the most disappointing batch I have ever received.  The soap appears dry, and crumbly.  I will never purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Yes...there are a a lot of balck hair...  I cannot use them to wash my face but body at most...</li>
            <li> it looks like poop....especially sitting in the soap dish in your bathroom sink. It works great though.</li>
            <li> Peeled my skin and took out my hair around the hair line from washing my face. I gave it to my boyfriend who is African decent, with darker skin thinking he would be less sensitive to this product - wrong, his hands and knees started to peel after a few uses. BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> I ordered the soap on Tuesday and received it on Thursday! I was packaged neatly and very secure. The soap itself was in great condition. First, I smelled it and it has a very natural smell. Nothing feminine and perfumy. Kinda nutty almost. After using it for the first time it definitely make my skin squeaky clean, litterally. I definitely recommend following up with a good moisturizer. I use cocoa butter. Just a little goes a ling way so Im expecting this pound to last a while. I intend to use this in my face and body. Hope to see great results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the last 2yrs. Its a skin miracle worker, seriously lol.</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh scent and skin feels refreshed when rinsed, not dry or taught.  I love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised by the good reviews I&#x27;m reading here.  I&#x27;ve used 2 other brands of black soap prior to using this one.  One is Dudu-Osun and the other is a similar looking unrefined soap from Ghana that is also sold here on Amazon.  My age spots all disappeared using the other 2 soaps but came back when I started using this brand!  So I quickly bought some more of the Dudu-Osun from Amazon and my age spots all disappeared after a week&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe this is real African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> I really love it makes my skin feel good.&lt;br /&gt;its very lathery and you feel all your skins impurities go away.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as advertised.  I&#x27;ve used this &#x27;raw&#x27; soap for years and obviously am completely happy.&lt;br /&gt;It is not smooth and creamy in texture like Dove, but it cleans wonderfully leaving no sticky feeling after drying off.  I recomend using awashcloth or work up a lather in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT LEAVE THIS SOAP IN STANDING WATER.  You have been warned.</li>
            <li> I sent it to my sister as a gift.  it arrived looking like &amp;#34;kitty litter&amp;#34; as my sister said.  It was not what I expected as I have purchased the soap elsewhere in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because of the excellent reviews.  I use the African Shea Butter and love that and this was recommended to use with it.  For me, the soap dries out my skin a lot and it seems to have something that actually irritates my skin.  Not to mention it&#x27;s crumbly and rough and breaks apart when I use it.  I much prefer unscented vegetable glycerin soap.</li>
            <li> One time deal!  This soap contains sand grains that make your skin full of scratches and short black hairs in its core that make you wanna throw up...</li>
            <li> Would not repurchase my soap came broken in a cheap plastic bag some of it out of the bag scared to use it will throw in trash.</li>
            <li> I love AfricanBlack soap and this purchase did not disappoint me.  The soap appeared fresh, solid and did I was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> GOOD NATURAL SOAP....AT FIRST USED ON FACE AND BODY ....NOW ONLY USE ON BODY CAUSE THE SOAP CAUSED MY FACE TO BURN ...OTHERWISE GREAT FOR BODY  LEAVES SKIN SOFT &amp; SMOOTH.</li>
