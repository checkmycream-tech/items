            <li>It feels so good on your scalp.</li>
            <li>They are the best on the market and worth the money.</li>
            <li>What is most comfortable and performs the best with your hair.</li>
            <li>Soon I realized that the more I brush, the frizzier the hair was!</li>
            <li>The first time you use it you will understand why:)!!!</li>
            <li>my hair feels so amazing after using the brush.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>One is the size: full-size (the largest size), handy (medium sized), or pocket (the smallest size).</li>
            <li>It lasts for years, and works great to make hair smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>Boar bristle brushes are awesome because they can create natural volume in the hair, by distributing the hair oil throughout the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>Did it help with your static hairs?</li>
            <li>The Mason Pearson brush did help avoiding the static hair.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think it causes more hair fallouts because I see more hair coming out onto the Mason Pearson brush than I see on my cheap plastic</li>

            <li>The bristles have to be able to reach your scalp, and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how we did it :)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how we did it :)     </li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Going to buy more for the rest of the family.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the hairbrush goes through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>Very true.  </li>
            <li>It is a beautiful heirloom brush worth every penny of the incredibly high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first impression on this brush was actually nice.</li>
            <li>for fine hair combs and eliminates tangles without ripping out of your head.  </li>
            <li>If I could afford to buy another for him on a whim to make him happy I would, but he doesn&#x27;t actually want/need it.</li>
            <li>I People say brushing is the key to obtain healthy hair, and apparently it seems Mason Pearson brushes are considered as one of the best hair brushes in the world.</li>
            <li>originally purchased this brush because I was hoping to achieve some desirable effects.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it makes my scalp very itchy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;*****ly enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t have detangling hair, but this brush, rather than making my hair light and smooth it tangles my hair!</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t have detangling hair, but this brush, rather than making my hair light and smooth it tangles my hair!</li>
            <li>This was just the right size for my husband to use and fit in his dob kit.</li>
            <li>My hair is of medium thickness, and I once owned a nice Acca Kappa mixed nylon-boar bristle brush (with a gorgeous wooden handle)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than buying a new $10 plastic brush every year from the drugstore and letting it tear your hear as the plastic knobs fall off.</li>
            <li>Can not believe I paid this much for a hairbrush!!  </li>
            <li>This makes the expense of a Mason Pearson brush well worth the money--it&#x27;s a luxury item and the purchase is an investment--</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This makes the expense of a Mason Pearson brush well worth the money--it&#x27;s a luxury item and the purchase is an investment--</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth what I paid for</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for someone with fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves it dearly though, and really enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but definitely worth the investment for a great product!</li>
            <li>Although my hair is naturally glossy, I could feel my hair turning smooth and a bit shinier.</li>
            <li>Just got the bigger size Mixture bristle/nylon as it seems to work better in straightening my hair after washing.  </li>
            <li>Day one I brushed his, very short, hair with it and he loved the way it felt on his scalp.</li>
            <li>thing that really bothers me though is that after only 8 months of use, many of the boar bristles already have split ends.</li>
            <li>This is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept (say, in your handbag), but because of the bristle length of the various sizes.</li>
            <li>I changed back to my cheap plastic comb and my hair looked and felt a lot</li>
            <li>However, because I have so much hair</li>
            <li>However, it frizzes my hair, and the ends of my hair look much damaged.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.id it detangle your hair?</li>

            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two things you should know when you&#x27;re ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost.</li>
            <li>I cant use it on him now because he just doesn&#x27;t want to share the brush since I&#x27;ve got so much oil</li>
            <li>Mason Pearson bros is not the real Mason Pearson.</li>
            <li>Really massages the scalp and my hair</li>
            <li>bought this brush 8 months ago directly from Amazon.com (not a third-party seller listed on Amazon, i.e. my invoice says &amp;#34;Amazon.com LLC&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>These are top of the line brushes that will last decades if cared for properly.</li>
            <li>A classic for a reason.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.   </li>
            <li>The only negative thing about my cheap plastic comb is that it makes my hair static if I brush a lot with it.</li>
            <li>The only negative thing about my cheap plastic comb is that it makes my hair static if I brush a lot with it.</li>
            <li>come with a cleaning brush, so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always heard if you use the right tools, you don&#x27;t need extra product.</li>
            <li>It works very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t hurt even when my hair is a little tangled!</li>
            <li>(apparently once every other day will send it into a fit!)</li>
            <li>but added a new one with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>my new Mason Pearson brush</li>
            <li>But my cheap plastic comb can also do it when brushed multiple</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really a normal thing for boar bristles to split since they are natural.</li>
            <li>Also, this mixed-bristle brush hits the sweet spot in having just enough boar bristles to distribute the hair oils, but still has enough space between each bunch of bristles to penetrate my hair.</li>
            <li>Did the hair brush make your hair soft and silky?</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>husband loves it too, although now I can&#x27;t get it near him.</li>
            <li>The boar bristles with the split ends don&#x27;t seem to damage my hair (as far as I can tell), but they look unsightly.</li>
            <li>Now with that being said anything not 1 inch from my skull is pretty darn dry 100% of the time regardless of how well/often I condition/moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t have frizzy hair at all, and this brush just makes my hair look more damaged, frizzy, and unhealthy.</li>
            <li>Well the next day, I realized that my hair was greasier than it normally is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, this mixed bristle brush is for normal, finer, and shorter hair.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, just a normal brush, comb, and Paul Mitchell skinny serum gives far better desirable results than this expensive MP brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion, just a normal brush, comb, and Paul Mitchell skinny serum gives far better desirable results than this expensive MP brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my husband uses it; although I have short hair it is very thick and straight and coarse and the brush bristles won&#x27;t reach all the way to my scalp, but slides over the top hairs.</li>
            <li>I once had an all-boar-bristle brush from some other brand, and eventually realized that pure boar bristles just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair because it won&#x27;t penetrate at all.</li>
            <li>This mixed bristle brush will work well for you if your hair is fine to normal and not too long or too thick.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with this classic brush - and it comes in so many different sizes and different hair types</li>
            <li>A little smaller than I was expecting but with a great price and durability, how can you go wrong as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift?</li>
            <li>my dandruff, normally caused due to my oily scalp not being washed frequently enough</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 33 year old female with extreme &amp; severe oily skin/hair (16 hours after washing I look like someone with 3rd day hair and no dry shampoo...)</li>

            <li> Well the next day, I realized that my hair was greasier than it normally is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, this mixed bristle brush is for normal, finer, and shorter hair.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, just a normal brush, comb, and Paul Mitchell skinny serum gives far better desirable results than this expensive MP brush.&lt;br</li>

            <li> but my husband uses it; although I have short hair it is very thick and straight and coarse and the brush bristles won&#x27;t reach all the way to my scalp, but slides over the top hairs.</li>
            <li> I once had an all-boar-bristle brush from some other brand, and eventually realized that pure boar bristles just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair because it won&#x27;t penetrate at all.</li>
            <li> This mixed bristle brush will work well for you if your hair is fine to normal and not too long or too thick.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this classic brush - and it comes in so many different sizes and different hair types</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I was expecting but with a great price and durability, how can you go wrong as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift?</li>
            <li> my dandruff, normally caused due to my oily scalp not being washed frequently enough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 33 year old female with extreme &amp; severe oily skin/hair (16 hours after washing I look like someone with 3rd day hair and no dry shampoo...)</li>
            <li> My other brushes are under $15 so this is my biggest investment as far as hair brush is concern.</li>
            <li> I used only this brush and my flat iron and my hair</li>
            <li> If you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair, you&#x27;d do better with a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want to cry right now because this product was a huge disappointment for me!</li>
            <li> Next day, I skipped my skinny serum (thinking that this brush will also lead me to the same effect the skinny serum does), air dried and after my hair was dry, I started brushing with the MP brush.</li>
            <li> that unfortunately didn&#x27;t have enough spaces in between the bunches AND had too many boar bristles in each bunch, so it was hard to work the brush through my hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles get down to the scalp and actually remove excess oil</li>
            <li> I have owned several other boar bristle hair brushes from other cheaper brands, and this one doesn&#x27;t scratch my scalp because the nylon bristles are rounded at the tips.</li>
            <li> my children use as well and it doesn&#x27;t hurt their head like a harder bristle brush</li>
            <li> other consideration is the bristle type.</li>
            <li> the shoulder length sections are getting some shine, I&#x27;m seeing less frizz, although I&#x27;m not certain about any breakage difference.</li>
            <li> This brush is lower quality and is not worth the MP price.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you&#x27;ll need to go with the Detangler because the bristles are stiffer and can reach down through all of your hair to the scalp; the Detangler is the only Mason Pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> Andconsidering how much I paid for this brush, I&#x27;m a little sad that it looks like this after less than a year of use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful you can brush too hard, at least at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little small for adult use unless you have thin hair.  </li>

            <li> I want to cry right now because this product was a huge disappointment for me! I People say brushing is the key to obtain healthy hair, and apparently it seems Mason Pearson brushes are considered as one of the best hair brushes in the world. I cannot express how much I HATE this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression on this brush was actually nice. Although my hair is naturally glossy, I could feel my hair turning smooth and a bit shinier. Well the next day, I realized that my hair was greasier than it normally is. I do have an oily scalp that makes my hair greasy and oily 24 hours after shampooing. But before it passed the 24 hours, the roots on my scalp were already greasy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was only the beginning. Next day, I skipped my skinny serum (thinking that this brush will also lead me to the same effect the skinny serum does), air dried and after my hair was dry, I started brushing with the MP brush. Soon I realized that the more I brush, the frizzier the hair was! I normally don&#x27;t have frizzy hair at all, and this brush just makes my hair look more damaged, frizzy, and unhealthy. Oh and I hate how my hair feels so heavy after using this brush. I changed back to my cheap plastic comb and my hair looked and felt a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was my third day using this brush and it is simply horrendous. My scalp is itchy everywhere! I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with this brush because my scalp has never been itchy before. Now I&#x27;m officially afraid to use this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased this brush because I was hoping to achieve some desirable effects.&lt;br /&gt;1. Did the hair brush make your hair soft and silky? Yes. But my cheap plastic comb can also do it when brushed multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Did it massage your scalp? I think so. The Nylon penetrates into my scalp. However, because I have so much hair I have to put some effort in order to make the brush pins reach into my scalp. Most importantly, it makes my scalp very itchy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Did it detangle your hair? Nope! I normally don&#x27;t have detangling hair, but this brush, rather than making my hair light and smooth it tangles my hair! Hair feels very heavy after using this brush :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Did it help with your static hairs? What about the little baby hairs? Yes and No. The only negative thing about my cheap plastic comb is that it makes my hair static if I brush a lot with it. The Mason Pearson brush did help avoiding the static hair. However, it frizzes my hair, and the ends of my hair look much damaged. It did not do anything to my baby hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Did it help with hair regrowth? I&#x27;m not sure. Honestly, I think it causes more hair fallouts because I see more hair coming out onto the Mason Pearson brush than I see on my cheap plastic comb.&lt;br /&gt;I think Neiman Marcus carries MP brushes. Please go to Neiman Marcus and try it yourself before purchasing this online. In my opinion, just a normal brush, comb, and Paul Mitchell skinny serum gives far better desirable results than this expensive MP brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel sorry to leave a harsh review. But, this was my experience with the brush and I wanted to share my opinion. Thanks for reading.id it detangle your hair? Nope!

            <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;This is a review for a \\&quot;handy\\&quot; or medium sized Mason Pearson brush made of six rings of mixed boar bristle and nylon. The longer bristles are nylon and the shorter ones are boar bristle. It is a beautiful heirloom brush worth every penny of the incredibly high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the larger Mason Pearson brushes, including this one, come with a cleaning brush, so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things you should know when you&#x27;re ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort. One is the size: full-size (the largest size), handy (medium sized), or pocket (the smallest size). This is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept (say, in your handbag), but because of the bristle length of the various sizes. The smaller sizes have shorter bristles. The bristles have to be able to reach your scalp, and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair. If you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair, you&#x27;d do better with a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other consideration is the bristle type. Do you want a mixed bristle brush like this one that is part boar bristle and part nylon? What is most comfortable and performs the best with your hair. This mixed bristle brush will work well for you if your hair is fine to normal and not too long or too thick. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll need to go with the Detangler because the bristles are stiffer and can reach down through all of your hair to the scalp; the Detangler is the only Mason Pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair. Mason Pearson also makes an All Boar Bristle Brush for finer or shorter hair but I have never tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this mixed bristle brush is for normal, finer, and shorter hair. I bought it for myself but my husband uses it; although I have short hair it is very thick and straight and coarse and the brush bristles won&#x27;t reach all the way to my scalp, but slides over the top hairs. My husband loves it dearly though, and really enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair. This makes the expense of a Mason Pearson brush well worth the money--it&#x27;s a luxury item and the purchase is an investment--but it&#x27;s worth it. If you&#x27;re the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost. That&#x27;s how we did it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For additional information on Mason Pearson visit their web site at [...].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****ly enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair.

            <li> Amazing brush would recommend to everyone with HAIR! bought it for my roomate on her birthday . It changes your Hair its a must have for beauty GURUS</li>
            <li> best brush ever!  for fine hair combs and eliminates tangles without ripping out of your head.  my children use as well and it doesn&#x27;t hurt their head like a harder bristle brush</li>
            <li> These are top of the line brushes that will last decades if cared for properly. I know they&#x27;re pricey but it&#x27;s better than buying a new $10 plastic brush every year from the drugstore and letting it tear your hear as the plastic knobs fall off. A Mason Pearson feels great in your hand and polishes the hair beautifully. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever... my hair feels so amazing after using the brush. I heard about it for years and finally decided to give it a try. Wow. Amazing.</li>
            <li> A little small for adult use unless you have thin hair.  This size would be perfect for children or teens.</li>
            <li> This was our second Mason Pearson brush in about 40 years.  We still have the one we bought 40 yrs ago but added a new one with this purchase.  They are the best on the market and worth the money.</li>
            <li> So in love!!! The first time you use it you will understand why:)!!! Looking to buy the pocket size next</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 33 year old female with extreme &amp; severe oily skin/hair (16 hours after washing I look like someone with 3rd day hair and no dry shampoo...) Now with that being said anything not 1 inch from my skull is pretty darn dry 100% of the time regardless of how well/often I condition/moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my new Mason Pearson brush I&#x27;ve had for several weeks now the shoulder length sections are getting some shine, I&#x27;m seeing less frizz, although I&#x27;m not certain about any breakage difference. The lengths from shoulder to mid back aren&#x27;t that much different but I&#x27;m not brushing a hundred strokes a day, just when I feel the need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my dandruff, normally caused due to my oily scalp not being washed frequently enough (apparently once every other day will send it into a fit!) is gone. The bristles get down to the scalp and actually remove excess oil and what would eventually turn to dandruff. If you&#x27;re not careful you can brush too hard, at least at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves it too, although now I can&#x27;t get it near him. Day one I brushed his, very short, hair with it and he loved the way it felt on his scalp. He described it as a scalp massage. I cant use it on him now because he just doesn&#x27;t want to share the brush since I&#x27;ve got so much oil he doesn&#x27;t want it on his head. If I could afford to buy another for him on a whim to make him happy I would, but he doesn&#x27;t actually want/need it.</li>
            <li> Mason Pearson brushes are very handy to use.  The brush feels good on your scalp.  This was just the right size for my husband to use and fit in his dob kit.</li>
            <li> Good product does matter! I always heard if you use the right tools, you don&#x27;t need extra product. Very true.  I used only this brush and my flat iron and my hair looks amazing.  No extra junk needed on my hair!</li>
            <li> the only brush i&#x27;ll ever use</li>
            <li> Mason Pearson bros is not the real Mason Pearson. This brush is lower quality and is not worth the MP price.</li>
            <li> My other brushes are under $15 so this is my biggest investment as far as hair brush is concern. It feels good on the scalp as you brush your hair. Hair seems a bit static-y.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth what I paid for but I&#x27;ll keep the item.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the &amp;#34;handy&amp;#34; size and it is a great size for home use and traveling.</li>
            <li> Boar bristle brushes are awesome because they can create natural volume in the hair, by distributing the hair oil throughout the hair shaft. I once had an all-boar-bristle brush from some other brand, and eventually realized that pure boar bristles just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair because it won&#x27;t penetrate at all. So I prefer mixed-bristle brushes made of nylon and boar bristle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this brush 8 months ago directly from Amazon.com (not a third-party seller listed on Amazon, i.e. my invoice says &amp;#34;Amazon.com LLC&amp;#34;). It is the best hair brush I have ever used. I have owned several other boar bristle hair brushes from other cheaper brands, and this one doesn&#x27;t scratch my scalp because the nylon bristles are rounded at the tips. Also, this mixed-bristle brush hits the sweet spot in having just enough boar bristles to distribute the hair oils, but still has enough space between each bunch of bristles to penetrate my hair. My hair is of medium thickness, and I once owned a nice Acca Kappa mixed nylon-boar bristle brush (with a gorgeous wooden handle) that unfortunately didn&#x27;t have enough spaces in between the bunches AND had too many boar bristles in each bunch, so it was hard to work the brush through my hair. I don&#x27;t have that problem with this Mason Pearson brush. Also, the rubber paid of the Mason Pearson brush is softer and springier than all the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that really bothers me though is that after only 8 months of use, many of the boar bristles already have split ends. I found a forum online where someone else complained about this too, and some people said it may either be because a) the brush is fake, or b) it&#x27;s really a normal thing for boar bristles to split since they are natural. Some people on the forum said that their brushes have never gotten split ends. At this point, I have no idea what to believe. The boar bristles with the split ends don&#x27;t seem to damage my hair (as far as I can tell), but they look unsightly. Andconsidering how much I paid for this brush, I&#x27;m a little sad that it looks like this after less than a year of use. I am going to contact Amazon and ask about it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this classic brush - and it comes in so many different sizes and different hair types</li>
            <li> I have used Mason Pearson hair brushes (the hair brushes of the Queen...England, of course) and have loved them.  I have had a detangler for 20 years and purse size mixture for about the same time.  Just got the bigger size Mixture bristle/nylon as it seems to work better in straightening my hair after washing.  You will never regret buying one of these.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  Can not believe I paid this much for a hairbrush!!  It feels so good on your scalp.</li>
            <li> This brush arrived promptly and in great condition.  I highly recommend it for someone with fine hair.  Don&#x27;t let the price scare you.  It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Heard about Mason Pearson and don&#x27;t regret buying it.  Really massages the scalp and my hair just loves it.  Going to buy more for the rest of the family.  Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Purchased another boar/nylon brush and it was easier on my scalp and 1/3 the price. You are paying for the name.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I was expecting but with a great price and durability, how can you go wrong as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift?</li>
            <li> I love the way the hairbrush goes through my hair.  It works very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t hurt even when my hair is a little tangled!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair brush on the market. It lasts for years, and works great to make hair smooth and healthy. It&#x27;s expensive, but definitely worth the investment for a great product!</li>
            <li> A classic for a reason.  Had for a few months - gosh, almost a year! Love this brush. Wouldn&#x27;t go back to others.</li>
