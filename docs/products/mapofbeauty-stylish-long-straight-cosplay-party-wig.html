            <li>Perfect !</li>
            <li>Really great wig!</li>
            <li>for $11 it is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>This wig was good for the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good wig for its price.</li>
            <li>Good wig.</li>
            <li>But, if you plan on using this wig more than once or twice &amp; you don&#x27;t want it to fall apart, just fork out $40+ on a really good wig.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything spectacular.</li>
            <li>, it tangles very easily-</li>
            <li>Fit great, felt nice, and was easy to style.</li>
            <li>But these are just recommendations on improvement. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does fit rather comfortably though, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I love the texture, color, and feel of the wig.</li>
            <li>This wig fits nicely, its a very nice bright white and doesn&#x27;t look like cheap fibers.</li>
            <li>This is my first wig, but putting it on was very easy and the hair is of a nice quality.</li>
            <li>how easily it tangles.</li>
            <li>so I braided it, also the wig netting shows through but a hat fixes that easily.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t adjust the fit, and even though I like the synthetic fibers they used</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this wig for anybody who need a cheap but good quality whit wig.</li>
            <li>I have long hair but the wig cap is good, so it doesn&#x27;t look like I have an lumps in my head.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Love how it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>I ordered this wig for Konoha from Mekakucity actors and I have to say it does take a while to arrive but it worth it.</li>
            <li>Not my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>, I have seen MANY synthetic wigs that are not half as shiny as this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it came exactly like it was shown</li>
            <li>and it is exactly how it looks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty decent wig!</li>
            <li>in order to use this product you need light colored hair already or a same color wig cap.  </li>
            <li>and brushing (even gently) removes quite a bit of hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is quite itchy and tangles VERY easily.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>sure I can make due with it,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to cosplay, but I am a perfectionist.</li>
            <li>Very soft</li>
            <li>Give it a try and you won&#x27;t be disappointed by the style or price, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the bangs are pretty goofed up but honestly for the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;There isn&#x27;t much &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; on the wig I received, and what is there barely covers my real hair in the back.</li>
            <li>Cut a massive amount off will not wear this much</li>
            <li>it can be fixed with some playing around but still, effort</li>
            <li>The wig was way too tangly, it shedded too much when I brushed it, and frizzed after a couple of days</li>
            <li>Even for this price the item did not reach my expectations, the net was highly visible and misshapen so that it stuck out at parts.</li>
            <li>It was exactly how I expected.</li>
            <li>Great wig, a little thin but for the price it served its purpose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s okay for the casual cosplayer, costumes or just playing dress up (unless you really like the plastic</li>
            <li>As long as I don&#x27;t tug on the wig too much and such, it won&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li>: (I had to repost)It doesn&#x27;t always look shiny in photos which is GREAT, but in person, it still looks quite shiny.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with it is the fact that the wig is kind of small, and I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li>First their were my doubts from my previous purchase, but!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Cut a massive amount off will not wear this much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! A&lt;br /&gt;Little thin but it worked so well for princess Kida . Thank you</li>
            <li> Fits my head well. I have ordered nicer wigs for about the same price. Unfortunately the bangs are pretty goofed up but honestly for the price it&#x27;s a pretty decent wig! Very soft</li>
            <li> Too thin.  in order to use this product you need light colored hair already or a same color wig cap.  Basically not enough hair.</li>
            <li> This wig was good for the price. Sadly there were a few things that needed improving.&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t much &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; on the wig I received, and what is there barely covers my real hair in the back. The adjustable clips are sewn to the cap on one side so I can&#x27;t adjust the fit, and even though I like the synthetic fibers they used, it tangles very easily- and brushing (even gently) removes quite a bit of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I can make due with it, and I do like it. But these are just recommendations on improvement. :)</li>
            <li> for $11 it is great. that being said on my wig there was a patch that had no hair whatsoever. it can be fixed with some playing around but still, effort</li>
            <li> I got the white wig for my (genderbent) Soul Eater cosplay. I&#x27;m fairly new to cosplay, but I am a perfectionist. Shiny wigs are a cosplayers worst nightmare (according to MANY cosplayers)&lt;br /&gt;It is a very thin wig, the hair keeps falling out &amp; it is MUCH more shiny in person than in that photo. I get it, it&#x27;s synthetic hair, so it&#x27;s going to be shiny- HOWEVER, I have seen MANY synthetic wigs that are not half as shiny as this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay for the casual cosplayer, costumes or just playing dress up (unless you really like the plastic look)&lt;br /&gt;It does fit rather comfortably though, so that&#x27;s good. But it is quite itchy and tangles VERY easily.&lt;br /&gt;You do get what you pay for though! But, if you plan on using this wig more than once or twice &amp; you don&#x27;t want it to fall apart, just fork out $40+ on a really good wig.&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR Ehhhhh, it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: (I had to repost)It doesn&#x27;t always look shiny in photos which is GREAT, but in person, it still looks quite shiny.</li>
            <li> Very small. Not nearly as full as it makes it look.  I could not get it over my hair line</li>
            <li> Great wig, a little thin but for the price it served its purpose. (Used for Robin from Fire Emblem Awakening)</li>
            <li> Perfect ! It was exactly how I expected. Fit great, felt nice, and was easy to style. Came in at expected time. Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love how it&#x27;s so soft and it came exactly like it was shown</li>
            <li> Really great wig! The hair is thick and covers everything. I have long hair but the wig cap is good, so it doesn&#x27;t look like I have an lumps in my head. This is my first wig, but putting it on was very easy and the hair is of a nice quality.</li>
            <li> I love the texture, color, and feel of the wig. The only problem I have with it is the fact that the wig is kind of small, and I&#x27;m not sure if I have a big head or not. As long as I don&#x27;t tug on the wig too much and such, it won&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> I ordered the white wig to cosplay as shiroba.&lt;br /&gt;It took a while to arrive but it arrived earlier than I expected (shipping from China). The package was well intact and the wig was undamaged. The wig was longer than I was expected. It even included a wig cap.&lt;br /&gt;But it was a bit too shiny and very thin. I had to constantly brush it out due to how easily it tangles. Curiously, they sent a black wig cap for a white wig.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is a $10 wig so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything spectacular.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for Konoha from Mekakucity actors and I have to say it does take a while to arrive but it worth it. This wig fits nicely, its a very nice bright white and doesn&#x27;t look like cheap fibers. I definitely recommend this wig for anybody who need a cheap but good quality whit wig.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good wig for its price. Mine sheds a lot so I braided it, also the wig netting shows through but a hat fixes that easily. Good wig. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> First their were my doubts from my previous purchase, but! I impulse added it to the cart when I saw the picture and it is exactly how it looks. Give it a try and you won&#x27;t be disappointed by the style or price, it&#x27;s perfect. Thanks</li>
            <li> The wig was way too tangly, it shedded too much when I brushed it, and frizzed after a couple of days</li>
            <li> Horrible quality. Even for this price the item did not reach my expectations, the net was highly visible and misshapen so that it stuck out at parts. Not my money&#x27;s worth</li>
