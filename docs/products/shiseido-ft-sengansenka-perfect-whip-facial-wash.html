            <li>This product is one of Shiseido&#x27;s best foam cleanser for the face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my forties and its perfect and non-drying.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for my oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I suggest the Perfect Gel then.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I bought this all excited mine doesn&#x27;t foam!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It can hydrate your face~ very nice!</li>
            <li>You need a pea-sized amount because it lathers up so beautifully.</li>
            <li>The value is great...</li>

            <li>/&gt;In sum, it&#x27;s good for the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells like Dove soap, but feels soooo good as you lather it with water and spread the foam across your face.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend and I purchased this after she did some research for good face washes.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin and Perfect Whip does a great job at cleaning my face thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really mild, perfect for acne-prone skin.</li>

            <li>It is AMAZINGLY foamy.</li>
            <li>This face wash is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>A went through a lot of stuff at Target and Walmart but couldn&#x27;t find anything that I liked.  </li>
            <li>Never has my face felt so fresh and clean after washing than when I use Perfect Whip.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to see it availble on amazon now.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;ve tried many brands of face wash with a lot of experimenting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li>love this produce.</li>
            <li>Really a great product, not irritating and</li>
            <li>so I use another daily exfoliator for my nose alongside Perfect Whip.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well and my face feels great after word.</li>
            <li>After finding that out, I now use an oil cleaner and then this, and it works so much better.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I chose this foam cleanser mostly based on the excellent reviews and moderate price.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s because my face is so clean!</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t get acne as easily as I used to</li>
            <li>Great cleanser for oily/ acne prone skin - does not overdry and leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>but I wish it shipped for free.</li>
            <li>Fantastic price for a Shiseido product.</li>
            <li>But it does smell clean.</li>
            <li>The longer you leave it on, the deeper the clean.</li>
            <li>It smells so clean and it foams like shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for 6 months now, and my face is balanced over all, and very soft with nice coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>to be honest,i already knew this one is good, but still this gave me a big surprise.</li>
            <li>Leaves face feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>First Got this product from my sister in-law who is from Japan as a Christmas gift and fell in love the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Then I realized that Asian markets have different ones and found those to be better, the best being this product by FAR.  </li>
            <li>It cleans very well and it is easy to rinse.</li>
            <li>This facial wash is my favorite now!</li>
            <li>use this with my Clarisonic skin brush, and it&#x27;s perfect for providing the right amount and texture of foam to make the brush slide gently over my skin without tugging or pulling, or becoming too harsh for my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans very well and is light and foamy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really smooth application and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>it will give you a fresh feeling after washing your face.</li>
            <li>It claims that it won&#x27;t strip you face of natural oils and it couldn&#x27;t be more on point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is sticky and gooey straight out of the bottle, but lathers into a rich and creamy foam that cleans my face and leaves it feeling soft, clean, and even mildly moisturized.  </li>
            <li>the foam is so soft and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is good if you are looking for typical facewash.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, it doesn&#x27;t dry up your face like most products and it leaves your face with a delightful feeling that you have never experienced.</li>
            <li>this is the first time i try this product.</li>
            <li>I did not know that at first.</li>
            <li>The foam often spread into my hairline and it would take extra time to make sure I rinsed everything off.</li>
            <li>pretty bottle, not as drying as clean and clear</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fabulous cleanser that is really gentle and foam-rich:) I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for the influence of my sister and how much I loved the way it felt, I would still be my lazy self.</li>
            <li>However I do have really large pores on my nose</li>
            <li>Face cream is amazing, but a little drying.</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel clean and not dry at all .</li>
            <li>so unless you have no idea how to wash your face ...not much of a drawback .</li>
            <li>I was looking for a face wash that was gentle and because I am now 40</li>
            <li>I almost feel like it&#x27;s too much foam</li>
            <li>recommend this to absolutely everybody</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as a mild cleanser for others with sensitive or dry-prone skin.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love it and it will last a long time since it lathers up so very much .</li>
            <li>Only con is that the entire label other than the words Perfect Whip is in japanese</li>
            <li>You only need a dot of it so a whole bottle could last up to 6 months or more.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin but also enjoy this texture, I have had good experiences with richer Shiseido facial washes made for older skin, such as Benefiance and White Lucent.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, but I wanted something light and foaming to use at the end of the day and this stripped my skin without cleaning it fully.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t particularly like the scent</li>
            <li>price is well worth the benefit, in fact, I would pay twice as much for the same results.</li>
            <li>A tiny amount will make more foam than your hand can hold, if you have a way to make the foam properly.  </li>
            <li>last a very long time for a single person and feels great after washing your face.</li>
            <li>If you want a high end wash, I&#x27;d skip this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My skin also had a lovely glow to it after I rinsed and dried my face.</li>
            <li>The face wash removed all my make up, nourished my skin and left me feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I used to live in Japan and my sister introduced me to this product.</li>
            <li>Most facial washes are too rough on my skin</li>
            <li>I also love the soft, fluffy whipped texture.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face, but leaves it soft, clean- feeling, and glowing.</li>
            <li>After use, your skin feels very soft as well.</li>
            <li>complete review is on my blog:</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t suffered from any reactions.</li>
            <li>I really love the thick foam that it makes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to using higher end and more expensive Shiseido facewash.</li>
            <li>I bought this specifically for the luxurious foam texture and low price, but after using it for a few months, I have to admit that it does not rinse cleanly.</li>
            <li>I usually use a mild Clinique liquid soap, but have found it too drying.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, lathers up well, needs only a very small amount so it&#x27;ll last a long time, leaves your skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>and it would work twice as hard to produce more oils or just helped a little bit.</li>

            <li> I have very dry and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and it would work twice as hard to produce more oils or just helped a little bit.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser because my normal daily face wash (the neutrogena grapefruit scrub) was too harsh on my dry winter skin and was causing me to break out in red, irritated patches.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, my face has a nice glow and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight like it usually does with other washes.</li>
            <li> I mean, a pea size amount is almost too much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and neither dries me out nor leaves a film behind.  </li>
            <li> Since then, I have tried different brands but they leave my face feeling dry, or not even feel like it is doing anything.</li>
            <li> And this stuff lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Shiseido has been around a long time and</li>
            <li> and you only need such a small amount I still don&#x27;t understand how it can cover your entire face!</li>
            <li> It will also last for a very long time because you only need so little of it to spread all over your face.</li>
            <li> I was convinced that it would either dry my face out or leave it oily.</li>
            <li> It seems to leave a non-oily residue, making my skin dry but congested.</li>
            <li> After you wash it off your skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all.</li>
            <li> I have spent thousands of dollars on facial wash; some dried my face out, others left it with an oily residue.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small bit to wash your entire face.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve read that using a foaming facial wash is less abrasive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried.almost every product for my tiny little breakouts either they would leave my skin really dry</li>
            <li> Not much of a smell to it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You only need very, very little cream to wash your face or else it would be a waste.</li>
            <li> Seriously, you use the smallest amount, smaller than a pea</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle, so if your looking for a heavily scented facial cleaner, this isnt it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and boy do I mean that.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my little bumps go away</li>
            <li> I guess there is a little loofah thing you can purchase too</li>
            <li> and I waste it.</li>
            <li> Once applied to the face it has a velvet feel to it and doesn&#x27;t smell harsh at all.</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t had any bad breakouts since using this cleanser (although I don&#x27;t have very bad acne, so I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work for someone with more moderate acne), and a tiny bit of product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> You just have to moisten your face, use a SMALL, less than a pea sized amount</li>
            <li> (I mean less than a dime size amount )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen dramatic improvements to my skin since I started using it half a year ago (and there&#x27;s still almost half of it</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s not working well :(</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because it is not as expensive and</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> By chance a woman who worked at a nearby drug store outside of Nagoya recommended this product to me. Never has my face felt so fresh and clean after washing than when I use Perfect Whip. And this stuff lasts a long time. I am so glad to see it availble on amazon now.</li>
            <li> this is the first time i try this product. to be honest,i already knew this one is good, but still this gave me a big surprise. the foam is so soft and easy to wash off. it will give you a fresh feeling after washing your face. i absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using higher end and more expensive Shiseido facewash. I wanted to try this because it is not as expensive and it had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is good if you are looking for typical facewash. I would compare it to something you&#x27;d find it the drugstore (like the $6 Neutrogena facewashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t particularly like the scent (smells faintly like chemicals/non-fragranced).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, it&#x27;s good for the price but it&#x27;s nothing special. If you want a high end wash, I&#x27;d skip this.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ve tried many brands of face wash with a lot of experimenting.  A went through a lot of stuff at Target and Walmart but couldn&#x27;t find anything that I liked.  Then I realized that Asian markets have different ones and found those to be better, the best being this product by FAR.  Very soft, lathers up well, needs only a very small amount so it&#x27;ll last a long time, leaves your skin feeling soft and clean.  This is by far the best one.  No need to look further!</li>
            <li> This product is one of Shiseido&#x27;s best foam cleanser for the face. You only need very, very little cream to wash your face or else it would be a waste. It will also last for a very long time because you only need so little of it to spread all over your face. I&#x27;m glad I found it. Ever since I used it, I&#x27;ve had no sporadic pimples that appear every once in a while. I guess it&#x27;s because my face is so clean! I&#x27;ve started to give this as gifts and everyone who receives it loves it.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. It is AMAZINGLY foamy. (I mean less than a dime size amount )After use, your skin feels very soft as well. The smell is subtle, so if your looking for a heavily scented facial cleaner, this isnt it. But it does smell clean. My daughter and I both love it and it will last a long time since it lathers up so very much . It makes your face feel clean and not dry at all . I&#x27;m in my forties and its perfect and non-drying. Only con is that the entire label other than the words Perfect Whip is in japanese so unless you have no idea how to wash your face ...not much of a drawback . I would buy this over again in a heartbeat.Shiseido has been around a long time and if you&#x27;ve always wondered how good the products are, this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my oily, acne-prone skin. It cleans very well and it is easy to rinse.</li>
            <li> love this produce. i have bought it 3 times in the last 2 years. last a very long time for a single person and feels great after washing your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fabulous cleanser that is really gentle and foam-rich:) I use it everyday. It can hydrate your face~ very nice!</li>
            <li> I have spent thousands of dollars on facial wash; some dried my face out, others left it with an oily residue. Finding one that would truly bring balance to my t-zone oily areas was a joke. When my friend went to Thaipai and brought this back as a gift, I was hesitant to try it. I was convinced that it would either dry my face out or leave it oily. It did neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like Dove soap, but feels soooo good as you lather it with water and spread the foam across your face. The longer you leave it on, the deeper the clean. I have been using it for 6 months now, and my face is balanced over all, and very soft with nice coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is well worth the benefit, in fact, I would pay twice as much for the same results. Buy with confidence, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a face wash that was gentle and because I am now 40 I wanted softness and that is what I have with this face wash. Seriously, you use the smallest amount, smaller than a pea and it foams like crazy. I almost feel like it&#x27;s too much foam and I waste it. Really a great product, not irritating and it foams like CRAZY!</li>
            <li> This facial wash is my favorite now! It cleans very well and is light and foamy.&lt;br /&gt;My complete review is on my blog: (remove spaces and parentheses)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and Perfect Whip does a great job at cleaning my face thoroughly. I&#x27;ve seen dramatic improvements to my skin since I started using it half a year ago (and there&#x27;s still almost half of it left!). Now I don&#x27;t get acne as easily as I used to and my face stays oil-free for a longer time. I really love the thick foam that it makes. Just a pea-sized amount gives me lots and lots of foam. It&#x27;s also really mild, perfect for acne-prone skin. However I do have really large pores on my nose so I use another daily exfoliator for my nose alongside Perfect Whip.</li>
            <li> This is most-have face cleaning product. Just love it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin.  I usually use a mild Clinique liquid soap, but have found it too drying.  I opted to try this luxurious cream and am so glad that I did!  It may be a lower price, but it lives up to the Shiseido brand.&lt;br /&gt;It is sticky and gooey straight out of the bottle, but lathers into a rich and creamy foam that cleans my face and leaves it feeling soft, clean, and even mildly moisturized.  My skin also had a lovely glow to it after I rinsed and dried my face. I highly recommend this product as a mild cleanser for others with sensitive or dry-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while and I really love it. A little goes a long way, and boy do I mean that. I mean, a pea size amount is almost too much! It cleans very well and my face feels great after word. Keep in mind this cleaner is meant to be used after you have used an oil based clearer. The oil cleaner is supposed to get the dirt and make up, then you use this and it takes care of the rest. I did not know that at first. After finding that out, I now use an oil cleaner and then this, and it works so much better. I love this!</li>
            <li> First Got this product from my sister in-law who is from Japan as a Christmas gift and fell in love the first time I used it. Not much of a smell to it. You only need a dot of it so a whole bottle could last up to 6 months or more. A little goes a long way. Leaves face feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for the luxurious foam texture and low price, but after using it for a few months, I have to admit that it does not rinse cleanly. It seems to leave a non-oily residue, making my skin dry but congested. The foam often spread into my hairline and it would take extra time to make sure I rinsed everything off. I have dry skin, but I wanted something light and foaming to use at the end of the day and this stripped my skin without cleaning it fully. If you have dry skin but also enjoy this texture, I have had good experiences with richer Shiseido facial washes made for older skin, such as Benefiance and White Lucent.</li>
            <li> This face wash is truly amazing. I&#x27;ve never tried anything like it. You need a pea-sized amount because it lathers up so beautifully. Once applied to the face it has a velvet feel to it and doesn&#x27;t smell harsh at all. After you wash it off your skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all. It claims that it won&#x27;t strip you face of natural oils and it couldn&#x27;t be more on point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to absolutely everybody and you will not be disappointed! x</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  The value is great...it will last forever! It only takes a small bit to wash your entire face.  It smells so clean and it foams like shaving cream.  This is one of the only facial wash products that I can use.  My skin has cleared entirely since I began using it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I purchased this after she did some research for good face washes. You just have to moisten your face, use a SMALL, less than a pea sized amount and it lathers up like Mississippi mud. Anyhow, it doesn&#x27;t dry up your face like most products and it leaves your face with a delightful feeling that you have never experienced. Will buy again but I wish it shipped for free.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and very sensitive skin. Most facial washes are too rough on my skin and I&#x27;ve read that using a foaming facial wash is less abrasive. This stuff does wonders for my skin! After a few uses, my face has a nice glow and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight like it usually does with other washes. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried.almost every product for my tiny little breakouts either they would leave my skin really dry and it would work twice as hard to produce more oils or just helped a little bit. This stuff made my little bumps go away and you only need such a small amount I still don&#x27;t understand how it can cover your entire face! It&#x27;s magic! But my face is glowing and my pores are smaller! If I don&#x27;t use it I regret it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, the way it foams up gives me childlike delight!  A tiny amount will make more foam than your hand can hold, if you have a way to make the foam properly.  You definitely need something to assist with making foam, whether it is a foaming net or using a brush of some kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with my Clarisonic skin brush, and it&#x27;s perfect for providing the right amount and texture of foam to make the brush slide gently over my skin without tugging or pulling, or becoming too harsh for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a smell that reminds me of cetaphil, rather than a floral, fruity, or nature-type smell.  It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and neither dries me out nor leaves a film behind.  I will definitely repurchase this over and over.</li>
            <li> I used to live in Japan and my sister introduced me to this product. I used to use a make up remover and then the face wash. However, once I ran out of make up remover, I realized that I didn&#x27;t need it anyways. The face wash removed all my make up, nourished my skin and left me feeling fresh. I also love the soft, fluffy whipped texture. Let me also tell you, that I used to only use just make up remover wipes and never washed my face. If it weren&#x27;t for the influence of my sister and how much I loved the way it felt, I would still be my lazy self. Since then, I have tried different brands but they leave my face feeling dry, or not even feel like it is doing anything. If you don&#x27;t like the idea of a whipped face wash.. I suggest the Perfect Gel then. You can use it as a make up remover and wipe it away with a tissue or towel, or you can use it as a face wash. Just a suggestion, give it a shot!</li>
            <li> Face cream is amazing, but a little drying. really smooth application and fast shipping. pretty bottle, not as drying as clean and clear</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser because my normal daily face wash (the neutrogena grapefruit scrub) was too harsh on my dry winter skin and was causing me to break out in red, irritated patches. I chose this foam cleanser mostly based on the excellent reviews and moderate price. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face, but leaves it soft, clean- feeling, and glowing. I have fairly sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t suffered from any reactions. I also haven&#x27;t had any bad breakouts since using this cleanser (although I don&#x27;t have very bad acne, so I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work for someone with more moderate acne), and a tiny bit of product goes a long way! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this all excited mine doesn&#x27;t foam!!!!!! i even watched youtube clips on how to use it and i still can&#x27;t get it to foam up so i&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on!! I use my hands I guess there is a little loofah thing you can purchase too and it may help but so far it&#x27;s not working well :(</li>
            <li> Great cleanser for oily/ acne prone skin - does not overdry and leaves your skin super soft. Fantastic price for a Shiseido product.</li>
