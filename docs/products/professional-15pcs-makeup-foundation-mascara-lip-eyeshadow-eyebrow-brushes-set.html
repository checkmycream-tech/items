            <li>its absolutely perfect because i dont have this one</li>
            <li>but otherwise I&#x27;m happy with them</li>
            <li>great find</li>
            <li>These brushes are okay, at best.</li>
            <li>and i try so good</li>
            <li>;) I&#x27;m happy!!</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing and the price</li>
            <li>and they came very quickly!</li>
            <li>Very soft and very good at picking up product.</li>
            <li>The bristles themselves are soft, and the rose gold color of the metal is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Thesd brushes are okay.</li>
            <li>This set is cute and appreciate the brush titles on them.</li>
            <li>Love them use them every time I go out.</li>
            <li>so glad i got a good deal and really works for me</li>
            <li>Decent quality for amazing price.</li>
            <li>, this is an amazing deal for only $6.</li>
            <li>But overall they are OK.</li>
            <li>But with that said, I will note that it seems like they used 3 different shades of rose gold on these, so some of the metal pieces are a noticeably different color than others (which might not be a big deal to some people, but it kind of irks me).</li>
            <li>They work really well.</li>
            <li>LOL, made me realize I&#x27;ve been using my brushes wrong.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>be aware these are not full sized brushes, my 6yr old could use them but not me</li>
            <li>Yes, you get quite a lot of brushes for $6, but there are a number of brushes that are almost exactly the same as other ones, and when they arrived several of them were shedding already.</li>

            <li> There are also a few brushes with uneven bristles at the top, which leads to poor makeup application.</li>
            <li> Product is less than fare, brushes still stiff after use them, I though it will became soft after use but is not; no much to do with it</li>
            <li> They are extremely firm which with my makeup, doesn&#x27;t allow me to pick up enough makeup when applying it.</li>

            <li> this is one of my products and I&#x27;m waiting on so I could try everything by using these flashes King wait to get them....</li>
            <li> I think there is a mistake, I received some stickers instead of  my brushes, could you resend it to me?</li>

I would not repurchase these, personally.</li>
