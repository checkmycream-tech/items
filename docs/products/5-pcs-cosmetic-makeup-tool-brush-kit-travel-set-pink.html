            <li> This product&#x27;s packaging was slightly damaged when I got it. It did ship in a timey manner but the product is cheaply&lt;br /&gt;made and does not appear as nice as it does in the pictures. I would not buy this product again unless I was needing a&lt;br /&gt;cheap gift for a young girl.</li>
            <li> My first brush set. Meh...not impressed.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as I thought. But still nice</li>
            <li> Was just smaller then I thought but was satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest waste of my money ever. First of all, the brushes are WAY too small to be used. Then the design pattern starts to peel off immediately. If you are buying this for your little daughter who will use it for play play, buy it. Its really not worth it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived faster than I thought it would come. My daughter loves the makeup brushes. As a makeup play gift I would recomed others to buy it for themselves, plus the price was very reasonable. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I received my item a bit late but it was worth the wait. I must say i love these brushes they are just perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This set is so prettily packaged.  The brushes appear to be very good ones and I could not believe the great price.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I liked how they looked. You can never have too many makeup brushes! Also would make a cute gift!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very cute. I think they are good beginner brushes. I don&#x27;t have any problems with them and I&#x27;ve had them for several months. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> very cute but small brushes not full size</li>
            <li> Thought it would be a good set but I was wrong. Its not  a good quality not even for kids.</li>
            <li> This brushes were just the write thing. The bristles are soft and they don&#x27;t fall out, perfect, just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> The brushes are cute but they&#x27;re kind of small and falling apart. The brush bristles stayed in for the most part.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for beginners. Look exactly how pictured. So far the brushes dont shed. The design is beautiful. I would reccomend</li>
            <li> Got this set for mu niece....she absolutely loved it! She&#x27;s just into make up, and this was the perfect choice for her. Inexpensive, and most importantly, durable.</li>
            <li> The price met my expectation however the product didn&#x27;t.  Its difficult applying eye shadows because the product is poorly made.</li>
            <li> Tip of brush fell off 1st time I used it! Had to tape it on as I didn&#x27;t have a glue. They used a drop of glue &amp; it fell off! Really a waste!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, all except for the foundation brush. It&#x27;s a little rough, and kind of small, but everything else is perfect. I recommend buying this, along with another foundation brush that&#x27;s softer and bigger. If that&#x27;s what you prefer. Other than that, the handle&#x27;s are small witch makes the brushes easy to store in your makeup bag without taking up too much room!</li>
            <li> Fell apart after few uses</li>
            <li> When I got reseved it one Bruch was broke so I would not bye it is made in china do not bye</li>
            <li> Cheap quality, but that was expected. If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap set and don&#x27;t care much for the quality of the bristles/brush itself, this will work just fine. Probably a good set for a little girl who is going to ruin these anyway, but would not recommend them for a grown woman. Perhaps good enough as a secondary travel set.</li>
            <li> great quaility perf price</li>
            <li> Hate it. You sent me two orders of the same product, and the brushes don&#x27;t look anything like the ones in the photo. I just wanted black and pink leopard print, not pink and brown. I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> fun for kids.  bright colors, decent quality and has stood up to being washed multiple times now. would buy again</li>
            <li> thank you all i love these they are great i am trying to get my mom to  buy some more .happy new year !</li>
            <li> the powder brush is smaller than expected but  the design is cute. i wish it was a little bigger :/</li>
            <li> They brushes work but they are very small and the leopard print comes of very quickly.  Other than that they work ok.</li>
            <li> Simple but cute. A great addition to my makeup collection. Love the color and everything. I have to hide them from my kids because they think there cute.</li>
            <li> I just love my travel size brushes. Came in a cute little packing arrived on time. I just love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE BRUSHES!!! SO SOFT AND VERY AFFORDABLE! BEST BRUSHES I EVER HAD! I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I got them in the mail. I expected them to be bristly and rough. They were everything but that! I deff recommend them!</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I ordered these for my 3 year old grandchild so that she would stay outof my makeup. The brushes were very inexpensive but I was surprised that they were so nice. I would order these for myself next time I need brushes.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made but cute. Didn&#x27;t get ti use them much before the started to fall apart. It&#x27;s upsetting.  I was super excited when I got them. :(</li>
            <li> Work very well for the price</li>
            <li> Nice little set with fast shipping</li>
            <li> These are not full size brushes, but that is just what I was looking for. These are great for carrying in your purse, or a spare to keep in your suitcase if you travel a lot. They are cute, as well, so they would make a very nice \\&quot;extra\\&quot; when you are giving a gift to a lady of any age. For the price, I am amazed that they are as good as they are. The bristles are soft and so far, have not shown signs of falling apart. Keep them clean and they should serve your needs well for a while. Recommended.</li>
            <li> CUTE BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. OKAY CHEAP BRUSHES FOR KIDS. ADULTS PAY MORE AND GET MORE QUALITY.</li>
