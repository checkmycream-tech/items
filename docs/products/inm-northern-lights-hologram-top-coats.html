            <li>It still looks great but it just does not show well on darker or \\&quot;busy\\&quot; looking manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love Out the Door Northern Lights topcoat!</li>
            <li>Love, Hugs, &amp; Butterfly Kisses!</li>
            <li>While every review of this product was amazing, when I received and opened my bottle I smelled an acetone smell.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast with a great shine and gives just a  bit of gold shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, adds just the right sparkle without being over the top.</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>I told her to apply more, and she said that she already put 3 coats on.</li>
            <li>I love this hologram stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love both the silver and the gold.  </li>
            <li>The gold seems a bit milder, but I still love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the gold highlights.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I used this top coat for a &amp;#34;galaxy/nebula&amp;#34; design, and it made my nails look like they were glowing from within.  </li>
            <li>i love the silver holographic top coat</li>
            <li>As most people, I have purchased the silver version of this nail polish and so the gold version always sparked my curiosity.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff....</li>
            <li>Just fabulous!  </li>
            <li>The formula is very smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Just like the original but with glitter!</li>
            <li>As a nail blogger and polish enthusiast, I highly recommend this gorgeous and unique top coat!</li>
            <li>This nail polish is super sparkly and shiny!</li>
            <li>When I first purchased the Hologram top coat in Silver at Sally&#x27;s, I just thought it would add a touch of glitter to my mani.  </li>
            <li>She loved my silver version of the same polish.</li>
            <li>received quickly.</li>
            <li>Everything I expected and more; the gold is even better than I had imagined it to be, nails - get ready for even more fun.</li>
            <li>(Although, I do personally prefer the silver version better!)</li>
            <li>The silver seems to have a bit more of the wow factor.  </li>
            <li>Classes polish up for fun or dressing up.</li>
            <li>And just like their regular top coat, this one dries quickly and still protects your nails from chipping.  </li>
            <li>She wore this as a top coat over a mauve color, showed me and you could barely see the gold-</li>
            <li>This was the first time Ive bought the gold, in the past Ive bought the silver but this color is amazing!</li>
            <li>These Northern Lights Hologram Top Coats not only add sparkle, but they also add depth and dimension to my manis.  </li>
            <li>and I think it may look good as a final topcoat on some fancy nail art (I haven&#x27;t got the time recently</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m pretty sure the top coat itself is amazing, I believe the specific product I received from this seller must have been a little dried out and &amp;#34;revived&amp;#34; with some acetone by the seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for any laquerista!</li>
            <li>As one reviewer previously stated; it is NOT AS STRONG AS THE SILVER</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>When I run low on the gold or the silver, I mix them together for a totally new effect!</li>
            <li>so I would recommend using it on soft colors such as pastels.</li>

            <li> so I would recommend using it on soft colors such as pastels.</li>
            <li> Northern Lights goes on just like a top coat, but gives your polish a beautiful shimmer, holographic effect, with none of the annoying gritty, glitter that&#x27;s impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> so it takes too long for the glitter to mix before use.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re planning to make a plain manicure look wow and noticeable, you may want to check out some gold glitter polish instead.</li>
            <li> Other people also said it smelled like nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I previously ordered the silver version of this polish and just had to get the gold.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in silver for years, but was never able to find the gold.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what I usually do)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick</li>
            <li> Very subtle over any nail polish color.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> A bad bottle?</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was just disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>

            <li> Glow!! Glossy, Glossy, Glossy!!!</li>
            <li> I previously ordered the silver version of this polish and just had to get the gold. I am beyond happy with both of these polishes. I am so happy with this company. I definitely order again.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother- I got her the gold since she wears yellow gold. She loved my silver version of the same polish. She didn&#x27;t have the luck I had- I love mine. She wore this as a top coat over a mauve color, showed me and you could barely see the gold- I told her to apply more, and she said that she already put 3 coats on. I don&#x27;t know if maybe she didn&#x27;t shake the bottle up enough? Or maybe it wasn&#x27;t the base coat color? A bad bottle? Anyway, I was just disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick so it takes too long for the glitter to mix before use.  So it&#x27;s another thing sitting on my shelf.</li>
            <li> While every review of this product was amazing, when I received and opened my bottle I smelled an acetone smell. I decided to try it anyway and as I was applying it, it would remove the polish underneath! Other people also said it smelled like nail polish remover. While I&#x27;m pretty sure the top coat itself is amazing, I believe the specific product I received from this seller must have been a little dried out and &amp;#34;revived&amp;#34; with some acetone by the seller.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.  It wasn&#x27;t sparkly like I thought it would be.  I put on several coats and still not the wow I thought it would have.</li>
            <li> I love this hologram stuff.  I love both the silver and the gold.  The silver seems to have a bit more of the wow factor.  The gold seems a bit milder, but I still love it.  I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> awesome color I would purchase this again in the future.  Love the gold highlights.  One of my favorite nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in silver for years, but was never able to find the gold.  It dries very fast with a great shine and gives just a  bit of gold shimmer.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it. You have to try it. Love it</li>
            <li> This nail polish is super sparkly and shiny! INM is a great brand and anything sparkly makes it even better (:</li>
            <li> When I first purchased the Hologram top coat in Silver at Sally&#x27;s, I just thought it would add a touch of glitter to my mani.  Boy was I wrong.

As a nail blogger and polish enthusiast, I highly recommend this gorgeous and unique top coat!</li>
            <li> I suppose a lot of people bought this for its subtlety and I think it may look good as a final topcoat on some fancy nail art (I haven&#x27;t got the time recently but that&#x27;s what I usually do) but if you&#x27;re planning to make a plain manicure look wow and noticeable, you may want to check out some gold glitter polish instead.</li>
            <li> great product.  didn&#x27;t know this existed.....i love the silver holographic top coat but this is just as beautiful....a great option to have in gold.  great price...great delivery time.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this topcoat I decided to give it a try. Very nice, adds just the right sparkle without being over the top.</li>
            <li> Just like the original but with glitter!</li>
            <li> As most people, I have purchased the silver version of this nail polish and so the gold version always sparked my curiosity. As one reviewer previously stated; it is NOT AS STRONG AS THE SILVER so I would recommend using it on soft colors such as pastels. It still looks great but it just does not show well on darker or \\&quot;busy\\&quot; looking manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW I RATED THIS PRODUCT :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated this product on how well that the product served it&#x27;s purpose. The formula is very smooth and easy to apply. Just shake as the sticker says and apply.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!!!! Just enough sparkle... Love it!</li>
            <li> received quickly. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Very subtle over any nail polish color.  Classes polish up for fun or dressing up. I&#x27;ve been using for over five years.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....I now use it as my top-coat over any and every color I paint my nails/toes with!!!  (Although, I do personally prefer the silver version better!)</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t enough of the glitter in the bottle. I&#x27;ve used this product before (both gold and silver) and there was almost three times the amount of the glitter in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot and have used it before.  I will definately buy it again in the future!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Everything I expected and more; the gold is even better than I had imagined it to be, nails - get ready for even more fun.</li>
            <li> Just fabulous!  Love this topcoat!!!</li>
            <li> I love Out the Door Northern Lights topcoat! Along with an effective protective topcoat the shine is amazing! This was the first time Ive bought the gold, in the past Ive bought the silver but this color is amazing! Highly recommended!</li>
