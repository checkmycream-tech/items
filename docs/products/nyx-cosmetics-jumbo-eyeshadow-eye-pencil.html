            <li>The color Milk is simply amazing and gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li>happy thank you very much</li>
            <li>I still find myself using my paint pot by Mac more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not silver like pots &amp; pans, but it&#x27;s more glittery</li>
            <li>This Eye pencil is working for my wife she love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this eye shadow pencil.</li>
            <li>, these do the job well and better than anything I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Love this eye pencil it does wonders to my eye shadows</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and blends very easy.  </li>
            <li>I do really enjoy the concistancy of the product, and I love how it brightens up the eyeshadow</li>
            <li>Milk really does a good job of brightening eyeshadow colors.</li>
            <li>Still, love the colour, love how it feels, love how it works, but the inconvenience of it all really negates all that I love.</li>
            <li>quick and easy</li>
            <li>Great for blending with other eye shadows too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>it goes on pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy again :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit more light yellowish than the milk color.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of dotting the inside corner and lining the upper and lower lash lines on the inside corner at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It has just a little shimmer, goes on nice &amp; I don&#x27;t have a problem with smudging or color transfer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve watched a lot of videos on youtube with gurus using these pencils and decided I really wanted to try them out myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sparkly which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>This really pops the color.</li>
            <li>Like other cream products, if you don&#x27;t limit yourself on how much you use, it will crease on your eye, but if you hold back it lasts quite nicely.</li>
            <li>This color (cottage cheese) in particular seems to fade when I try to smudge it over my eye.</li>
            <li>This color doesn&#x27;t seem to glide across my eye as easily as the other colors.</li>
            <li>I love the colour, but the fact that I can&#x27;t sharpen this in any way makes this seem like a waste of time to me.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day, and it&#x27;s a great on its own or as a base for when I layer multiple shadows.</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;m in love&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>not soft as much as i think...</li>

            <li> , the color stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li> i am kind of disappointed..</li>
            <li> Makes it just a little lighter and gives it a little extra shimmer.  </li>
            <li> the down inside eyelid</li>
            <li> While I enjoy the look these give as a base under my eyeshadow</li>
            <li> The staying time for this NYX jumbo pencil is a few hours.</li>
            <li> It seems like a lot of trouble for make up.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not easy for me to do</li>
            <li> I use it as a highlight and under my eye shadows if they are a little dull.</li>
            <li> so it was hard for me to find a shadow liner with a little glitter that didn&#x27;t end up scratching my contact lenses</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of mineral pigments, and for matte ones I usually use the plain white base, but for ones that are glittery or shimmery, this makes it pop that extra bit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating.</li>
            <li> dust on your base color.  </li>
            <li> can also use it as a shadow base as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>

    <ol>
            <li> not soft as much as i think... and it&#x27;s not easy for me to do the down inside eyelid... i am kind of disappointed..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched a lot of videos on youtube with gurus using these pencils and decided I really wanted to try them out myself. While I enjoy the look these give as a base under my eyeshadow I still find myself using my paint pot by Mac more. I do really enjoy the concistancy of the product, and I love how it brightens up the eyeshadow I choose to use over it. This color (cottage cheese) in particular seems to fade when I try to smudge it over my eye. Milk really does a good job of brightening eyeshadow colors. Still learning it though. Definitely will buy again :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great jumbo pencil liner. It&#x27;s a little bit more light yellowish than the milk color. It also have a hint of sparkle in it. I wore it on my water line and it does help make the eyes look slightly larger and brighter. The staying time for this NYX jumbo pencil is a few hours. Great for blending with other eye shadows too.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of mineral pigments, and for matte ones I usually use the plain white base, but for ones that are glittery or shimmery, this makes it pop that extra bit.  Like other cream products, if you don&#x27;t limit yourself on how much you use, it will crease on your eye, but if you hold back it lasts quite nicely.</li>
            <li> This color doesn&#x27;t seem to glide across my eye as easily as the other colors. Not sure why. It&#x27;s very sparkly which I don&#x27;t care for. The color Milk is simply amazing and gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty color. It&#x27;s not silver like pots &amp; pans, but it&#x27;s more glittery white.&lt;br /&gt;Useful if you want to make any silvers or glittery whites pop out. or even if you want to do a white/glittery lid type thing.&lt;br /&gt;Need a primer esp if you get oily lids.</li>
            <li> Looks like cottage cheese when applied! Yuck.</li>
            <li> This eye pencil does not disappoint. It wears well and stays on. I use daily to brighten my eyes. A+++ seller. Thank you</li>
            <li> This Eye pencil is working for my wife she love it.&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product is great A++.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to all my friend.</li>
            <li> I love the colour, but the fact that I can&#x27;t sharpen this in any way makes this seem like a waste of time to me. I may try to de-pot it, as was recommended by another reviewer, but we&#x27;ll see. It seems like a lot of trouble for make up. It&#x27;s very frustrating. Still, love the colour, love how it feels, love how it works, but the inconvenience of it all really negates all that I love.</li>
            <li> Good, quality product. It lasts all day, and it&#x27;s a great on its own or as a base for when I layer multiple shadows.</li>
            <li> I would recommen this product!&lt;br /&gt;I just sweep across my eye lid one layer, the color stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color!!! I use it as a highlight and under my eye shadows if they are a little dull. This really pops the color. Wonderful as a highlighter!!</li>
            <li> The pencil color that  I ordered gave my eyes a great pop on the interior of the eyes, and it goes on pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this on the inside corner of my eyes.  I don&#x27;t use it for anything else.  It does a good job of dotting the inside corner and lining the upper and lower lash lines on the inside corner at the same time.  quick and easy</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great for an under-brow highlight before you dust on your base color.  Makes it just a little lighter and gives it a little extra shimmer.  Goes on smooth and blends very easy.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!  It has just a little shimmer, goes on nice &amp; I don&#x27;t have a problem with smudging or color transfer.</li>
            <li> Love this eye shadow pencil. It rolls on very easily and comes in a variety of great shades. I would def recommend.</li>
            <li> I wear circle lens so it was hard for me to find a shadow liner with a little glitter that didn&#x27;t end up scratching my contact lenses, these do the job well and better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far I&#x27;m in love&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Its a great pencil&lt;br /&gt;You can also use it as a shadow base as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy thank you very much</li>
            <li> Love this eye pencil it does wonders to my eye shadows i especially love the way my eyes look with this under my eye shadows.</li>
