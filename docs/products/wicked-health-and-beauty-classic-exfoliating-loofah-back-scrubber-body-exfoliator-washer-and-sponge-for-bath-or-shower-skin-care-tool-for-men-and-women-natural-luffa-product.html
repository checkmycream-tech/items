            <li>I can&#x27;t reach (smile) and exfoliates beautifly....</li>
            <li>but well worth waiting for.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it as it is so easy to use</li>
            <li>Loofah is just the right roughness</li>
            <li>Excellent, after you get it wet it is exactly what you need to be soft and silky smooth exfoliate the dead skin, I am a daily user it works great</li>
            <li>Overall, the entire thing works great.</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time</li>
            <li>** BROKE THE FIRST USE..</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it was intended to do.  </li>
            <li>People with sensitive skin might want a soft material, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Easy to reach my back.</li>
            <li>easy to use, bought it for my boyfriend who does not like the &#x27;girly&#x27; back brushes you find at stores.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and just as the ad promised.</li>
            <li>Makes it much easier to scrub.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Works very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
            <li>This item was everything very thing I expected and more.  </li>
            <li>Previously I had an itchy back and didn&#x27;t have the good fortune to have someone who could remedy that situation.</li>
            <li>On this scrubber she uses a Neutrogena body wash to help with blemishes, and it scrubs all the oils out and off of her back, helping her skin stay clear and free of any flare ups.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Does a good job getting at those hard to get at spots (i.e., back, feet, etc.).</li>
            <li>I thought it would be too soft, but I&#x27;m really quite pleasantly surprised at how well it works.</li>
            <li>This exfoliating back scrubber is exactly what I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>Gets those hard to reach places and feels amazing on your back.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find my item was  delivered on Sunday.</li>
            <li>Long enough to easily wrap around my back and scrub away!</li>
            <li>The loofah is not too soft or rough on the skin, just the right texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft enough to not scrape the skin, but still has enough texture so that it can scrub skin really well and help clear pours.</li>
            <li>Was delivered on time (actually a day before I expected it) and is exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>This is great for my teen who&#x27;s skin is extra oily right now and was in desperate need of something to help scrub the oils and such from her back.</li>
            <li>A bit smaller than I expected, but the construction seems reasonable for the price paid.</li>

            <li> Exfoliates on one side and soft on the other.</li>
            <li> Like that it is long enough to use on my back.</li>
            <li> The scrubber is very long, but the loofah part is quite think and too short, only about 1 foot.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on how it &amp;#34;holds up&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> My back has been so itchy and dry.  </li>
            <li> Used it daily for about 3 weeks, and rope handle tore loose.  </li>
            <li> Long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the loofah part itself will stay rough, but I really like using this loofah.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have found it long ago!!</li>
            <li> Works as expected!</li>
            <li> It comes with a small suction cup, I presume for hanging it up in the shower, though I hang mine to dry on a the towel rack.</li>
            <li> Hard, scratchy, loose pieces.</li>
            <li> I washed it a few times to see if it would loosen up, no still very stiff.</li>
            <li> - I thought that might be rude.</li>
            <li> The thin rope handles one broke off while in use.</li>
            <li> What you get is too thin and cuts into your hand when using.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the Loofah section was very small.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it since it&#x27;s a gift - I thought that might be rude. But, I did take it out of the packaging and looked it over. I even pretended to use it to make sure the length was right and the handles were sturdy. All was well and I feel good about giving this gift!</li>
            <li> Does a good job getting at those hard to get at spots (i.e., back, feet, etc.). Works well for anyone with osteoarthritis in a hip joint.</li>

            <li> Cheaply made.  The thin rope handles one broke off while in use.</li>
            <li> This exfoliating back scrubber is exactly what I hoped it would be.  I ordered it to replace one purchased in Tarpon Springs, FL. years ago and it is perfect. I recommend it to any one looking for one with great exfoliating capabilities without being too harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time and I love it! Arrived early and safely, with no damage!</li>
            <li> Dual textured side is definitely a plus. Long enough to easily wrap around my back and scrub away!</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase. Exfoliates on one side and soft on the other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect amount of abrasive-ness</li>
            <li> Feels great on my back. Leaves me smooth.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Does the trick to scrub your back.</li>
            <li> i never had an issue with it, works fine and dries fast. great for traveling light</li>
            <li> One of the &amp;#34;Handles&amp;#34; broke after just 5 days of use...</li>
            <li> Very nice loofah scrubber. Feels really good using it on my back. Very nicely made and I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Works great! The loofah part is quite abrasive without hurting the skin. I thought it would be too soft, but I&#x27;m really quite pleasantly surprised at how well it works. Overall, the entire thing works great. However, I am taking off one star because the loofah section needs to be longer than it is.</li>
            <li> Works well enough. A bit smaller than I expected, but the construction seems reasonable for the price paid.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find my item was  delivered on Sunday. This item was everything very thing I expected and more.  Makes me feel as if I just had a massage.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as stated in the product description. Can&#x27;t wait to start using it.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and just as the ad promised.</li>

            <li> Love, love, love......gets places on my back I can&#x27;t reach (smile) and exfoliates beautifly....good quality</li>
            <li> Order arrived as promised. The two rope handles make the loofah easy and comfortable for me to use; better than the loofahs on a stick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my back!  I would highly recommend it as it is so easy to use</li>
            <li> Great product. Took a while to get to me but well worth waiting for. Previously I had an itchy back and didn&#x27;t have the good fortune to have someone who could remedy that situation. Now all is well, thank you America.</li>
            <li> I love using this scrubber</li>
            <li> easy to use, bought it for my boyfriend who does not like the &#x27;girly&#x27; back brushes you find at stores.</li>
            <li> Works like it&#x27; supposed to!</li>
            <li> This is perfect to reach your back in the shower.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is well made and works great for back washing, I had a brush but it kept falling off the handle while using it.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  I use it daily.  Holds up to usage well.  Makes it much easier to scrub.  I&#x27;ll buy this again when I wear it out.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but I expect more.</li>
            <li> S*** BROKE THE FIRST USE..SMH CHEAP</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. The length is perfect for me and the loofah section works great. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on how it &amp;#34;holds up&amp;#34;...but so far; so good.</li>
            <li> Almost like having a shower mate!</li>
            <li> Hard, scratchy, loose pieces. I washed it a few times to see if it would loosen up, no still very stiff.</li>
            <li> Good for those hard-to-reach spots!  It comes with a small suction cup, I presume for hanging it up in the shower, though I hang mine to dry on a the towel rack.</li>
            <li> The scrubber is very long, but the loofah part is quite think and too short, only about 1 foot.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it was intended to do.  I&#x27;m happy I can now scrub my back without hurting my hands.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love thus product. Gets those hard to reach places and feels amazing on your back.</li>
            <li> Loofah is just the right roughness</li>
            <li> This is great for my teen who&#x27;s skin is extra oily right now and was in desperate need of something to help scrub the oils and such from her back. On this scrubber she uses a Neutrogena body wash to help with blemishes, and it scrubs all the oils out and off of her back, helping her skin stay clear and free of any flare ups. It&#x27;s soft enough to not scrape the skin, but still has enough texture so that it can scrub skin really well and help clear pours. Works very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Only used once but feels great.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Just what I wanted. More importantly, just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the Loofah section was very small.</li>
            <li> Loofah part of scrubber is wonderful.  Feels absolutely great on my back.  Would like to see thicker handles on ends.  What you get is too thin and cuts into your hand when using.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised but needs to be wider.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this back scrubber and uses it daily!</li>
            <li> Was delivered on time (actually a day before I expected it) and is exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> Love it, great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with the back scrubber - it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
