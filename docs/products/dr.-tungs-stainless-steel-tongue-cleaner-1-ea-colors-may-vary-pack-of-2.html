            <li> I was not aware how necessary this is in my life until I bought it. It&#x27;s a life changer, y&#x27;all. The stench of what came off my tongue in the first few passes made me feel terribly sorry for my family and friends. Team Tongue Scraper for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to take a good look at your tongue before your first use so you can be properly disgusted by what comes off of it AND properly delighted at what your tongue looks like after. No joke, I stopped by the mirror this morning just to admire my now-pink tongue again.</li>
            <li> 200% better than the plastic</li>
            <li> I medicate with BHO and it&#x27;s hard to get all the buildup in the back of my throat after medicating.  Giving a good scrub with my brush and then squeegying my tongue has improved the clean feeling 10-fold, and also improved my breath and the taste of juices and fruits.</li>

            <li> These are the only tongue cleaners I&#x27;ve used that are both effective and easy to clean. If you have allergies and wake up with post-nasal drip, tongue cleaning will make a world of difference in how clean your mouth feels.</li>

            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Leaves my tongue very clean and red.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Quick delivery</li>
            <li> Works extremely well for my tongue. I&#x27;ve only ever used plastic tongue scrapers before but this is amazing! And keeps my tongue clean and feeling fresh!</li>
            <li> These are an effective quality tongue cleaner. You will be amazed at the gunk that comes off your tongue, and the improvement in your overall breath, when using these with your tooth brush.</li>
            <li> fresher breath and can&#x27;t imagine having lived without this for all these years.</li>
            <li> What others say about the scraper cutting their tongues.... sooooo true. I tried to scape gently but I still end up bleeding.</li>
            <li> Love the product, far surpasses any other tongue scrapper that I have tried on the market. I don&#x27;t brush my teeth without it.</li>
            <li> They work very well. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve found. Works great. Such a clean feeling after</li>
            <li> We got two of these tongue cleaners, and they work well for us. I would encourage you to follow the instructions and not overdo it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, though; in fact, it feels good. I did it five or six (or maybe 8) times before I started noticing some discomfort that lasted a few hours. My fault. The instructions are there for a purpose, read and heed. Anyway, there is no gag reflex triggered, and my tongue feels good now. It&#x27;s the color of bubble gum. Pretty different from the whitish gray coat I was accustomed to. Yukko. I&#x27;ll never go there again!</li>
            <li> Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner works exactly as advertised.  I like that it&#x27;s metal and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> seems to work great now I got these red bumps on the back of my tongue not sure what that is about but it did take care of my bad breath so definitely a five-star maybe I scrubbed a little too hard I imagine</li>
            <li> Love this, have been using plastic cleaners before this, way better and flexible. Although misadvertised and came with pink handles. As one was for my brother, kind of was awkward. Otherwise, does the job!</li>
            <li> I have an old Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner.  The new one is much better.  Just a little bit wider.  I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> No more bad breath! It is amazing what collects on the back of your tongue!</li>
