            <li>Great!</li>

            <li>great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great to try it out, but its not something we&#x27;ll continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>but they are great for shaving.</li>
            <li>Great razor....comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Great working blades,comfortable,smooth</li>
            <li>Great price great product</li>
            <li>very good value and these razor blades are my favorite!</li>
            <li>honestly forgot that Schick existed!</li>
            <li>Awesome shave , the lady loves that way im able to Manscape with this</li>
            <li>I used these and shave great and nice without gettin razor burns or cuts</li>
            <li>Might not be as good a razor</li>
            <li>I loved how it glided across the skin and still provided a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality razor blade.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this razor!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this razor!</li>
            <li>I have tried all sorts of combinations of powders, cream, gel, disposable razors, nice razors, and electric razors.</li>
            <li>Using this with the sensitive shave gel and honestly the best shave</li>
            <li>This is the best razor for sensitive skin that I have ever used!</li>
            <li>and the blades are smooth and shave fairly close.</li>
            <li>Best razor I have found for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The blades have a lubricant strip that helps generate moisture and largely eliminates the need for shaving cream or shaving gel, making this the perfect product if you enjoy shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li>And this has caused problems with many blades--cuts, irritation, etc.</li>
            <li>Better than Mach brand rzrs</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>A++++  :-)</li>
            <li>but I do read the package :)</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but there are definitely better razors out there.</li>
            <li>I tried these out through BzzAgent, and I have to say I enjoyed them.</li>
            <li>I really love the result.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite razor blades.</li>
            <li>I love these cartridges, I didn&#x27;t think i could imagine these getting any better until I got abold of the hydro 5 sensation</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is much, much better than I&#x27;ve found anywhere else online or in any brick-and-mortar retailer.  </li>
            <li>but this one lubricates the skin better.</li>
            <li>These blades are great for the guy with real sensitive skin and does not want to spend a lot on them.</li>
            <li>great shave not really much else to say it&#x27;s a razor blade does a good job.</li>
            <li>I use and love my Schick Hydro 3 and 5 (the carts fit both handles)</li>
            <li>Each shave has been close, smooth, and pain free!</li>
            <li>The added strip of aloe is also great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>will consider this my new brand of blade for a successful result every time.</li>
            <li>Good price but shipping fee was high.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used previous generations of this blade with good satisfaction, but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>We received this for free to test and review, and we&#x27;re just so so on it.</li>
            <li>smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li>+ it contains &#x27;skin guards&#x27; that smooth and protect the skin;  +</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, most razors can provide a good first time shave or maybe even 2 or 3 good shaves, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much the next time around.</li>
            <li>and I originally used the standard hydro 5 which is great itself</li>
            <li>The first shave as smooth, close, and pain free!</li>
            <li>The gel last a good bit longer than that on Gillette.  </li>
            <li>The blades last a good 5-6 uses.  </li>
            <li>They were good enough I guess....</li>
            <li>This Schick Hydro 5-four cartridge refill pack for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; appears to have maxed out the number of blades that can be stuffed into a cartridge to be effectively swiped across the cheeks, chin, and neck.</li>
            <li>Having used many types of razors from disposables to top brand refill type razors, this one falls in the middle.</li>
            <li>I have been using these blades for the last 9 months and they provide a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Because it does a great job with the Aloe for a dollar less than this cartridge:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I shave almost every day and can easily use one of these blades for a whole month, even longer.</li>
            <li>favorite shave if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The edging feature was nice for my facial hair and sideburns.</li>
            <li>but I end up with far more knicks from these so...</li>
            <li>Most of the blades I have used are only good as long as their lubrication strip is full.</li>
            <li>I switched over to the Hydro 5 Sensitive razor blades about a year ago and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>you aren&#x27;t paying much more than for Dollar Shave Clubs top line...which are still cheap Chinese made blades mounted crooked.</li>
            <li>The 5 blades are great, they stay as sharp as the non sensitive ones it seems.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t blame Schick for trying to find a way to make a buck, but in the current environment where we shavers are looking for the best shave for the least amount of money this is a quick way to get Schick users to switch to Dorco.  </li>
            <li>and they confirmed the only difference between Hydro 5 Sensitive and Hydro 5 is 1) the color of the top razor strip and 2) this product was tested by a dermatologist (though she did not disclose the results of those tests).  </li>
            <li>First, read the two &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
            <li>In testing, this 5 blade cartridge:  +  yields up to 4 weeks of use and a smooth shave each time with either gel or soap-based shaving cream;  + the aloe gel system appears to work as well as the other Schick cartridges; and  + the trimmer works as advertised producing a sharp clean sideburn bottom cut, much better than using the full cartridge.    </li>
            <li>The trick to get a better shave with this is that first wet your face with water, apply cream and then shave.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I was offered the chance to try their new razor for free as part of a sponsored program.</li>
            <li>It shaves just fine, and doesn&#x27;t cause added irritation, but the slime factor is just gross.</li>
            <li>But so much cleaner now.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t even feel it touch your face and shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>Also, the aloe which I assume is what causes the slime, is gone within a couple weeks, making this a very run of the mill razor.</li>
            <li>My husband really loves this.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>Other than that overall a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be returning to the original blades after these are gone.</li>
            <li>All combinations left my skin burning and full of bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to shave better than the regular Schick Hydro 5 blades, but it seems to give me the same results.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice much difference between these and the non sensitive ones</li>
            <li>The handle had a decent quality feeling weight to it.</li>
            <li>I got them at a decent price with subscribe and save and a coupon.</li>
            <li>I bought them here because they were way cheaper than a main street pharmacy.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by the results!</li>
            <li>Cheap not high quality.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>I normally had to take Saturday off so my face can recover from shaving but, with these razors I have not stopped shaving every day.</li>
            <li>This cartridge costs about $1.20 more per pack than the regular Hydro 5....for no other reason than a different package and no vitamin E.  </li>
            <li>I normally purchase the normal blade refills, rather than the sensitive version, but I thought I&#x27;d try them out.</li>
            <li>you look at the cart they look exactly like the regular Hydro 5 in every way, all Hydro carts are made with a &amp;#34;Skin guard to reduce irritation&amp;#34; and both have Aloe in the gel reservoir.  </li>
            <li>The amount of space between where the razor is and when the blades begin makes it difficult to get a perfect shave under my nose/above the lip without some effort, whereas other razors have never had this issue before.</li>
            <li>Again I was surprised!</li>
            <li>And the flip-out-of-the-way upper guide makes it easy to get to those harder places, like under the nose.</li>
            <li>Works OK, but I actually prefer the disposable razors that I&#x27;d been using previously.</li>
            <li>But now I&#x27;ve found the Hydro 5 Sensitive.</li>
            <li>the Sensitive package has that nifty check mark logo like Gillette Fusion Proglide that mentions being dermatology tested...and  3.)</li>
            <li>The sensitive strip helped keep my skin from breaking out with bumps and getting irritated.</li>
            <li>Supposed to be for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than local stores</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of the Schick two-blade cartridge, but this one is enough to make me change to the Hydro 5, promising 3 to 4 months of close shaves from the 4 cartridges.</li>
            <li>I ordered what I thought was the 4-count refill size of 1 of Schick Hydro 5 Sensitive Refill Razor Blade,</li>
            <li>The main downsides of this are the space between where the razor starts and where there are actually blades shaving, and the slime issue.</li>
            <li>and I received a new razor handle with a blade already attached to it, and “an extra cartridge” making the size of 2.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, per se, but it&#x27;s not really any different from the regular version.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely smoother and closer and have never irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So unless you 1) believe your facial skin will be more receptive to being scraped with a green strip versus a blue strip or 2) want to fund Shick&#x27;s marketing department&#x27;s budget, buy whatever is cheaper - the regular Hydro 5 or this product, as they are essentially the same.</li>

            <li> This cartridge costs about $1.20 more per pack than the regular Hydro 5....for no other reason than a different package and no vitamin E.  </li>
            <li> I normally purchase the normal blade refills, rather than the sensitive version, but I thought I&#x27;d try them out.</li>
            <li> you look at the cart they look exactly like the regular Hydro 5 in every way, all Hydro carts are made with a &amp;#34;Skin guard to reduce irritation&amp;#34; and both have Aloe in the gel reservoir.  </li>
            <li> The amount of space between where the razor is and when the blades begin makes it difficult to get a perfect shave under my nose/above the lip without some effort, whereas other razors have never had this issue before.</li>
            <li> Again I was surprised!</li>
            <li> And the flip-out-of-the-way upper guide makes it easy to get to those harder places, like under the nose.</li>
            <li> Works OK, but I actually prefer the disposable razors that I&#x27;d been using previously.</li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;ve found the Hydro 5 Sensitive.</li>
            <li> the Sensitive package has that nifty check mark logo like Gillette Fusion Proglide that mentions being dermatology tested...and  3.)</li>
            <li> The sensitive strip helped keep my skin from breaking out with bumps and getting irritated.</li>
            <li> Supposed to be for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than local stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Schick two-blade cartridge, but this one is enough to make me change to the Hydro 5, promising 3 to 4 months of close shaves from the 4 cartridges.</li>
            <li> I ordered what I thought was the 4-count refill size of 1 of Schick Hydro 5 Sensitive Refill Razor Blade,</li>
            <li> The main downsides of this are the space between where the razor starts and where there are actually blades shaving, and the slime issue.</li>
            <li> and I received a new razor handle with a blade already attached to it, and “an extra cartridge” making the size of 2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, per se, but it&#x27;s not really any different from the regular version.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely smoother and closer and have never irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So unless you 1) believe your facial skin will be more receptive to being scraped with a green strip versus a blue strip or 2) want to fund Shick&#x27;s marketing department&#x27;s budget, buy whatever is cheaper - the regular Hydro 5 or this product, as they are essentially the same.</li>

            <li> only con which is assumed is the size of the blade, can be tricky to get into tight spots (even with the green bar down), but keep a cheap disposable two blade for that.</li>

            <li> It always leaves me with an extremely close shave, and it does so with a minimum of skin irritation.  </li>

            <li> Item I expected to be.</li>
            <li> For all my life--50 years of shaving--I&#x27;ve had to shave against the grain, upward. And this has caused problems with many blades--cuts, irritation, etc. But now I&#x27;ve found the Hydro 5 Sensitive. Still a few minor nicks, barely noticeable. But so much cleaner now. And the flip-out-of-the-way upper guide makes it easy to get to those harder places, like under the nose. A great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used previous generations of this blade with good satisfaction, but this is the best so far. Expensive? I shave almost every day and can easily use one of these blades for a whole month, even longer. It helps to use a high-quality shaving cream too. So the cost is less than 10 cents a day for the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great blade--just for the no-nick any time!</li>
            <li> Better than Mach brand rzrs</li>
            <li> Works OK, but I actually prefer the disposable razors that I&#x27;d been using previously.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these razors. They work so well for him.</li>
            <li> I used these and shave great and nice without gettin razor burns or cuts</li>
            <li> The best shaving system on the market and I have tried many.  You can&#x27;t even feel it touch your face and shaves very close.  The fused on blade guards work perfectly.  The gel last a good bit longer than that on Gillette.  The blades last a good 5-6 uses.  And when purchased on here...you aren&#x27;t paying much more than for Dollar Shave Clubs top line...which are still cheap Chinese made blades mounted crooked.</li>
            <li> They were good enough I guess....they were CLEARLY outdated or too old.  They worked but not as long as newer razors have.</li>
            <li> Blades work perfectly...just as advertised!</li>
            <li> great shave not really much else to say it&#x27;s a razor blade does a good job.</li>
            <li> really impressed with the quality and the price. They do an equivalent job to the competition!</li>
            <li> Excellent, everything perfect</li>
            <li> After reading the review of W. Taylor I called Schick&#x27;s customer service and they confirmed the only difference between Hydro 5 Sensitive and Hydro 5 is 1) the color of the top razor strip and 2) this product was tested by a dermatologist (though she did not disclose the results of those tests).  Whatever the results, they would be the same for the regular version of the Hydro 5.  Although the package does not specifically state it on front, this product also has Vitamin E, just like the non-sensitive version.  So unless you 1) believe your facial skin will be more receptive to being scraped with a green strip versus a blue strip or 2) want to fund Shick&#x27;s marketing department&#x27;s budget, buy whatever is cheaper - the regular Hydro 5 or this product, as they are essentially the same.</li>
            <li> very good value and these razor blades are my favorite!</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to shave better than the regular Schick Hydro 5 blades, but it seems to give me the same results.  It&#x27;s not bad, per se, but it&#x27;s not really any different from the regular version.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with either one.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades are great, they stay as sharp as the non sensitive ones it seems. I don&#x27;t really notice much difference between these and the non sensitive ones but these were $1 cheaper and we all know how overpriced blade refills are! I figured I&#x27;d test them out and save a little $. Consensus is they work just as well as the regular schick hyro 5 blades.</li>
            <li> Excellent item!....Received as described!....Would buy from again!.....A++++  :-)</li>
            <li> favorite shave if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use and love my Schick Hydro 3 and 5 (the carts fit both handles) so I&#x27;m not a Schick &amp;#34;Hater&amp;#34;...but I do read the package :)&lt;br /&gt;If you look at the cart they look exactly like the regular Hydro 5 in every way, all Hydro carts are made with a &amp;#34;Skin guard to reduce irritation&amp;#34; and both have Aloe in the gel reservoir.  The only difference is 1) Regular Hydro 5 gel also has vit e along with Aloe, 2.) the Sensitive package has that nifty check mark logo like Gillette Fusion Proglide that mentions being dermatology tested...and  3.) This cartridge costs about $1.20 more per pack than the regular Hydro 5....for no other reason than a different package and no vitamin E.  I like vitamin E. Why? Because it does a great job with the Aloe for a dollar less than this cartridge:)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t blame Schick for trying to find a way to make a buck, but in the current environment where we shavers are looking for the best shave for the least amount of money this is a quick way to get Schick users to switch to Dorco.  Might not be as good a razor but if you are gonna start ripping me off I&#x27;ll switch anyway.  Almost did when your carts started being made in China and we all could tell when the gel ran out before the razor did, smelled different/wrong, and the carts fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;Dear Schick: Gillette might thank you for this but your customers won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> We received this for free to test and review, and we&#x27;re just so so on it. It shaves just fine, and doesn&#x27;t cause added irritation, but the slime factor is just gross. Having used many types of razors from disposables to top brand refill type razors, this one falls in the middle. Not terrible, but there are definitely better razors out there. The amount of space between where the razor is and when the blades begin makes it difficult to get a perfect shave under my nose/above the lip without some effort, whereas other razors have never had this issue before. Also, the aloe which I assume is what causes the slime, is gone within a couple weeks, making this a very run of the mill razor. The handle is fine, about average with a refill style razor, and it&#x27;s not uncomfortable or awkward to hold so no complaints there. The main downsides of this are the space between where the razor starts and where there are actually blades shaving, and the slime issue. It&#x27;s been great to try it out, but its not something we&#x27;ll continue to purchase. Will probably just stick with the typical razor refills, and forgo the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; ones that don&#x27;t really seem to be any different than previously used refill razors by both gillette and schick.</li>
            <li> I tried these out through BzzAgent, and I have to say I enjoyed them. It was a no frills razor that got the job done and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m looking for in a razor. The edging feature was nice for my facial hair and sideburns. The handle had a decent quality feeling weight to it. The sensitive strip helped keep my skin from breaking out with bumps and getting irritated.</li>
            <li> First, read the two &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; reviews. One does not even say they tried the product, just called the company. The other is blaming Amazon&#x27;s pricing on Schick, which is the reason for the bad review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly forgot that Schick existed! I was surprised when I was offered the chance to try their new razor for free as part of a sponsored program. I have tried all sorts of combinations of powders, cream, gel, disposable razors, nice razors, and electric razors. All combinations left my skin burning and full of bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very doubtful that a free razor from a company I forgot existed would actually work. I was very surprised by the results! The first shave as smooth, close, and pain free! I loved how it glided across the skin and still provided a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, most razors can provide a good first time shave or maybe even 2 or 3 good shaves, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much the next time around. Again I was surprised! Each shave has been close, smooth, and pain free! I LOVE this razor! I LOVE this razor! I have told a few friends about it and I never share about razors. This is the best razor for sensitive skin that I have ever used! I am a Schick convert! I am going Schick and not looking back!</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful Schick Hydro user! They have always given me a great shave! I normally purchase the normal blade refills, rather than the sensitive version, but I thought I&#x27;d try them out. It still provides a great shave, but after about 2 weeks, my razor has RUST within the blades! I&#x27;ll definitely be returning to the original blades after these are gone.</li>
            <li> I really love the result. smooth shave every time. will consider this my new brand of blade for a successful result every time.</li>
            <li> My husband says that these are the best razors. I got them at a decent price with subscribe and save and a coupon.</li>
            <li> These snag. Cheap not high quality.  Supposed to be for sensitive skin but I end up with far more knicks from these so...</li>
            <li> I just like not having to go to the store...</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite razor blades. Most of the blades I have used are only good as long as their lubrication strip is full. This razor is no different, except its lubrication strip lasts a long time. I shave daily in the shower and a single blade usually lasts at least 3 weeks with me storing it in its case between uses.</li>
            <li> Not a good product, very poor design!</li>
            <li> Great! Much cheaper than local stores</li>
            <li> I got back into shaving the way I was taught with DE razor , brushes and mugs. I purchased these blades when I don&#x27;t have a half hour to indulge. I get done in one pass instead of three and the blades are smooth and shave fairly close.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price but they are great for shaving.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have found for my sensitive skin.  No more ingrown hairs or razor burn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a razor blade refill.  I was going for price, not function.  They work.</li>
            <li> I love these cartridges, I didn&#x27;t think i could imagine these getting any better until I got abold of the hydro 5 sensation</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro 5 is the best disposable razor on the market.  It always leaves me with an extremely close shave, and it does so with a minimum of skin irritation.  The blades have a lubricant strip that helps generate moisture and largely eliminates the need for shaving cream or shaving gel, making this the perfect product if you enjoy shaving in the shower.  The added strip of aloe is also great for sensitive skin.  The price on Amazon is much, much better than I&#x27;ve found anywhere else online or in any brick-and-mortar retailer.  I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Awesome shave , the lady loves that way im able to Manscape with this</li>
            <li> I started using the Hydro 5 after my partner complained that the disposable Schick Xtreme 3s I was using left my face a little scratchy. They&#x27;re definitely smoother and closer and have never irritated my sensitive skin. They do, however, lack the precision I could get with the Xtreme 3 for finishing sideburns and dealing with the awkward area around the nostrils. All razor blades are a rip-off but these are slightly less so than the Gillette equivalent. I bought them here because they were way cheaper than a main street pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Best razor/blades EVER!</li>
            <li> I switched over to the Hydro 5 Sensitive razor blades about a year ago and I am so glad I did. My skin is so less red and irritated. I don&#x27;t feel like I have scraped my face and neck off when I have shaved. I normally had to take Saturday off so my face can recover from shaving but, with these razors I have not stopped shaving every day. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality razor blade.  #hydrochallenge #GotItFree as part of a campaign with BZZagent. I was using them before that though.</li>
            <li> My husband really loves this. Atlast a worthy competitor to the other big expensive brands. The trick to get a better shave with this is that first wet your face with water, apply cream and then shave. The only drawback is the gel over a period time after several uses starts sticking to your face. Other than that overall a good product.</li>
            <li> last longer than the ones I buy at the store.</li>
            <li> qwertyuiop[ rs6dtdt7y8iotu9</li>
            <li> These blades are great for the guy with real sensitive skin and does not want to spend a lot on them. I have been using these blades for the last 9 months and they provide a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Five CLOSE Stars! This Schick Hydro 5-four cartridge refill pack for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; appears to have maxed out the number of blades that can be stuffed into a cartridge to be effectively swiped across the cheeks, chin, and neck. But in this case the housing:  + is not that much bigger in terms of wielding it around the face;  + it contains &#x27;skin guards&#x27; that smooth and protect the skin;  + the &#x60;aloe&#x27; gel reservoir is advertised as \\&quot;lasts 2x as long as ordinary lubricating strips\\&quot;;  + the 5 blades are closely grouped to allow raising and cutting the hairs in the beard; and  + has the expected Schick \\&quot;flip trimmer\\&quot; for straight cuts on sideburn bottoms.    In testing, this 5 blade cartridge:  +  yields up to 4 weeks of use and a smooth shave each time with either gel or soap-based shaving cream;  + the aloe gel system appears to work as well as the other Schick cartridges; and  + the trimmer works as advertised producing a sharp clean sideburn bottom cut, much better than using the full cartridge.    I&#x27;m a fan of the Schick two-blade cartridge, but this one is enough to make me change to the Hydro 5, promising 3 to 4 months of close shaves from the 4 cartridges. Somewhat expensive but the blades are long-lasting : Highly Recommended. Five SHARP Stars (4 each Schick Hydro 5 Sensitive Refill Cartridges.)</li>
            <li> Good price but shipping fee was high.</li>
            <li> - To whom it may concern. I ordered what I thought was the 4-count refill size of 1 of Schick Hydro 5 Sensitive Refill Razor Blade, 4 Count and I received a new razor handle with a blade already attached to it, and “an extra cartridge” making the size of 2. Which is not the simple 4 count box I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is annoying as “bleep” my payment method wasn’t passed as one thing and you received another, and I make my order time sensitive so now I am without what I needed because I thought I was being proactive by ordering my item over a week ago so I would have it in plenty of time. At this point I do not like careless mistakes when it involves my time, my person, or my dime. Just give me back my money for the inconvenience this has caused. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Great price for these!</li>
            <li> Not much different than the Gillette Mach 3. A close shave in some areas, but not all.</li>
            <li> Great razor....comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Quality product for a close shave.</li>
            <li> Worked for my razor bumps. Shipped fast and I originally used the standard hydro 5 which is great itself but this one lubricates the skin better. Using this with the sensitive shave gel and honestly the best shave I&#x27;ve had .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con which is assumed is the size of the blade, can be tricky to get into tight spots (even with the green bar down), but keep a cheap disposable two blade for that.</li>
            <li> Great working blades,comfortable,smooth</li>
            <li> Great price great product</li>
