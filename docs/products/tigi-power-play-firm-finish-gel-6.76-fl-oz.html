    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best gel out there.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>It felt incredibly diluted and as mentioned in another review</li>
            <li>Product smells great as well.</li>
            <li>Great.. Not to greasy</li>
            <li>Great hold and</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Really good and smells good too</li>
            <li>Very pleased with purchase</li>
            <li>So thrilled that my husband purchased six</li>
            <li>and it smells nice.  </li>
            <li>by far the best gel around.</li>
            <li>I love this gel - I am a woman, but haven&#x27;t found another gel that works as well.</li>
            <li>so we were thrilled to find it available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>You cannot get a better deal for your hair than this.</li>
            <li>this gel makes your hair smooth and health after using this product!</li>
            <li>I am going to buy more when I run out...</li>
            <li>I love this product..  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too sticky like most others..  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>It has a strong hold and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;f fine.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Tubes were Individually bagged and sealed with tape for great shipping as well.</li>
            <li>It washes clean with shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Gel is great, but it took a couple weeks longer to arrive than expected.</li>
            <li>The product is good but can be found locally, it took two weeks to get this product....</li>
            <li>for all the reviews that gave it a 5 star, I guess they don&#x27;t know how good the european product is.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, and have already ordered another.</li>
            <li>i have been trying many different gels recently and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you don&#x27;t like this product, I can offer you a whole cupboard full of one-time use gels that my darling husband has discarded!</li>
            <li>Very good gel if you are serious about hold.</li>
            <li>Just the right mixture of hold and shine.  </li>
            <li>Finally, a gel that provides the perfect firm hold without flaking.  </li>
            <li>the price is better than your local hairdresser.</li>
            <li>Just the first time I bought it online.</li>
            <li>I keep coming back for more.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair shine and do exactly what I want it to do in minutes</li>
            <li>If you like solid hold for your hair without being overly stiff, this is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>My husband is very particular about the gel he uses</li>
            <li>i have medium long hair and a drop the size of a coffee bean is all it takes for a kind of soft hold just to get the hair out of my face for the day.</li>
            <li>I guess not everyone knows there is a huge difference between the US and European quality.</li>
            <li>The company sent it to me really fast.</li>
            <li>The product was wrapped really well to prevent it from opening and spilling.</li>
            <li>This one holds well, but depending on how much you work it into your hair, it will keep getting softer while still holding.  </li>
            <li>It really holds.</li>
            <li>We discovered this product following an exhaustive search after his old favorite was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Much better than axe or other gels.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The picture for the product shows it as European while the original product that came is US</li>
            <li>It is scented a little more than I normally like (almost a cologne fragrance level), but the scent is acceptable.  </li>
            <li>Great product even with just using a small amount will go a long way in holding hair in place with a natural appearance.</li>
            <li>It holds really well and is soft to the touch not hard like others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m kind of disappointed since I was very excited to get it off of here instead of going to a salon and getting one each time I run out.</li>
            <li>bed head is the leader in mens hair goo as far as i&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>Free shipping, delivered to my door in less than 48 hours!</li>
            <li>European is much better and has a hard look while the US one is not firm at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> European is much better and has a hard look while the US one is not firm at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; version it&#x27;s essentially just water in a tube because the gel don&#x27;t hold for long.</li>
            <li> As I have very short hair (high and tight), I normally wear a very stiff gel.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to go a long way...</li>
            <li> This product has similar consistency, but holds a little firmer.</li>
            <li> Product came in a carefully prepared package.</li>
            <li> I thought the gel doesn&#x27;t hold hard enough.</li>
            <li> Firm, not flaky</li>
            <li> run your hands through it for a couple hours and the hold stays but the stiff goes away.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, our local store doesn&#x27;t always have this item in stock</li>
            <li> This gel sucks.</li>
            <li> I mean its a hair product.  </li>
            <li> Worst THING I HAVE ever used</li>

            <li> I used to use the BED HEAD product in the silver can, but they stopped making it. This product has similar consistency, but holds a little firmer. Product smells great as well.</li>
            <li> I love this gel - I am a woman, but haven&#x27;t found another gel that works as well.</li>
            <li> Great.. Not to greasy</li>
            <li> My husband is very particular about the gel he uses and I ought to know . . . I am the one that has to go in search of it.  We discovered this product following an exhaustive search after his old favorite was discontinued.  Finally, a gel that provides the perfect firm hold without flaking.  Unfortunately, our local store doesn&#x27;t always have this item in stock so we were thrilled to find it available on Amazon.  So thrilled that my husband purchased six tubes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you don&#x27;t like this product, I can offer you a whole cupboard full of one-time use gels that my darling husband has discarded!</li>
            <li> The product is good but can be found locally, it took two weeks to get this product....why?  All I was told was it&#x27;s on its way...so was Christmas.</li>
            <li> by far the best gel around. i have been trying many different gels recently and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Great hold and the price is better than your local hairdresser. You cannot get a better deal for your hair than this.</li>
            <li> I thought the gel doesn&#x27;t hold hard enough. It felt incredibly diluted and as mentioned in another review yes I received the &amp;#34;US&amp;#34; version it&#x27;s essentially just water in a tube because the gel don&#x27;t hold for long.</li>
            <li> this gel makes your hair smooth and health after using this product! I am going to buy more when I run out...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;f fine.  I mean its a hair product.  I&#x27;ve used it before.  Just the first time I bought it online.</li>
            <li> The company sent it to me really fast. The product was wrapped really well to prevent it from opening and spilling. I really enjoy this product. It holds really well and is soft to the touch not hard like others. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just the right mixture of hold and shine.  I have been looking for a product for my gray hair for years, and finally found it.  Shipped quickly, and have already ordered another.</li>
            <li> This gel sucks. Worst THING I HAVE ever used</li>
            <li> Really good and smells good too</li>
            <li> This is the only gel I will use. It holds hair in place without stickiness, flaking or brittleness. It was recommended by my hair stylist and I recommend it as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best gel out there.  I keep coming back for more.  Firm, not flaky and it smells nice.  It also seems to go a long way...</li>
            <li> bed head is the leader in mens hair goo as far as i&#x27;m concerned. i have medium long hair and a drop the size of a coffee bean is all it takes for a kind of soft hold just to get the hair out of my face for the day. not to wetlook or shiney like a d-bag from the 80&#x27;s. run your hands through it for a couple hours and the hold stays but the stiff goes away. this tube should last 6 months.</li>
            <li> I love this product..  Makes my hair shine and do exactly what I want it to do in minutes and it&#x27;s not too sticky like most others..  It seems that Bed Head has discontinued making Power Trip, so I tried this product for men and it works just as well for me.</li>
            <li> Great product even with just using a small amount will go a long way in holding hair in place with a natural appearance. Would definitely use this seller again. Tubes were Individually bagged and sealed with tape for great shipping as well.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son. Works great. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> If you use hair product every day, this one is tops.  It has a strong hold and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> If you like solid hold for your hair without being overly stiff, this is a very good product.  As I have very short hair (high and tight), I normally wear a very stiff gel.  This one holds well, but depending on how much you work it into your hair, it will keep getting softer while still holding.  It is scented a little more than I normally like (almost a cologne fragrance level), but the scent is acceptable.  It washes clean with shampoo.  Very good gel if you are serious about hold.</li>
            <li> Product came in a carefully prepared package. Very pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> Gel is great, but it took a couple weeks longer to arrive than expected.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Much better than axe or other gels.Free shipping, delivered to my door in less than 48 hours!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It really holds. Like man cement</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading all the reviews. I guess not everyone knows there is a huge difference between the US and European quality. European is much better and has a hard look while the US one is not firm at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture for the product shows it as European while the original product that came is US (there is a US written after total size at the front as opposed to nothing for the European one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m kind of disappointed since I was very excited to get it off of here instead of going to a salon and getting one each time I run out. I guess I&#x27;ll continue doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for all the reviews that gave it a 5 star, I guess they don&#x27;t know how good the european product is.</li>
