            <li> product to almost 2 months to receive - and it wasn&#x27;t a great quality would not recommend it</li>
            <li> This cape covers everything on anybody.</li>
            <li> Not enough velcro tabs to hold cape securely around neck. If person has a large neck it would fit secure however for a small framed person, the cape doesn&#x27;t fit snug. I didn&#x27;t return because I am able to secure with hair clips.</li>
            <li> Ordered cape in February and knew it would take some time to arrive but by April contacted World Pride.  Their response was quick and cordial.  They immediately resent another cape and it arrived within a week.  It has been awhile since I have had great customer service.  Cape was just what we needed for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice!!! I like it.. a it is large, and resistent. Es c&amp;oacute;moda en la parte del cuello. Esto y contenta por la compra.</li>
            <li> This was. A k ordered for 30 days.  Seller informed up front. I had no issue with this. Just delivered.  Great bargain.</li>
            <li> The neck is quite big but it ties easily enough.  It took a while to get here from across the world, but I wasnt in a hurry.  Great price.</li>
            <li> the tie on the back is not good, it&#x27;s often too large for clients. a snap back closure would be much better.</li>
            <li> Cheap.... took forever to come... plus I can&#x27;t strap it in the back.. I threw it away....</li>
            <li> I ordered 6 of these and none of them were alike, each one was different.</li>
            <li> This product was worth every penny I paid for it. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a product of this kind.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than I expected. The two sides of the Velcro are each smaller than a dime, leaving no way to adjust the fit. It is not very wide.</li>
            <li> The Velcro fastener is cheaply made so the thing broke and no longer stays fastened.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality. Not crazy about the Velcro. Found one with the snaps which I should have purchased.  You get what you pay for this was cheap, should have known better.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cotton cloth cape but I guess they are not made anymore. They would be cooled not holding in the body heat. The one I received will have to do. --John</li>
            <li> Shittty material, ripped in one use .</li>
            <li> Wish the neck were smaller. We just clip it with a claw clip and it works fine for both my husband and my sons.</li>
            <li> the product is good quality, just taking too long to get it, it takes exactly two months.</li>
            <li> pros:does the job..very big. cons: no velcrose...just delicate thin ties, also, very very thin material. in one  word, delicate! huge neck area.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t wrap all the way around so hair gets all over the back.  Also, the hair clings to this material, so you really have to shake it out.</li>
            <li> A cape.  What more can you say.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great communication</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light weight inexpensive cap. This looked about like the others I have had for 3+ years now.&lt;br /&gt;Its the same size as any other standard one.&lt;br /&gt;Its has a Velcro neck.&lt;br /&gt;It washes just fine.&lt;br /&gt;The negative star is for the fact that the Velcro snags the cap occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;This one probably wont last as long as the last, but the last was $15 dollars, and from a supply store. Since this was less then half the price its still great.</li>
