            <li>It made my hair very soft and I have coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I do not have to use any other kind of product on my hair for at least 3 days.</li>

Best use with the essential oil, spray a little before and after blow drying or flat ironing. my hair look beautiful, healthy, and shiny (not greasy). I had stopped using this product due to pricing to save money, big mistake! my hair started shedding, breaking and I wind up spending more. A few damage hair month later, I went back on my keracare regime and here I am, so please writing this review. And one more thing it is best using with humectant shampoo, a keracare shampoo or mizani will do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about my hair. I take very good care of my hair and am very picky about what I put in it. When straightening my hair, I like for it to be light and free, without being weighed down. I literally only put a few sprays of this on my hair after washing, and my hair was beyond gross and greasy. I have 3A/3B mid-back length hair that does have texture. This product was not good for my hair.</li>
            <li> GREAT hair product. I spray it on each section of my hair before I flat iron it, and it looks great! It smells really good too. It&#x27;s kinda pricey, but worth it. Hair doesn&#x27;t look oil or greasy after you use this, it&#x27;s salon quality!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff to spray in your hair prior to blow drying.  It made my hair very soft and I have coarse hair.  Once blow dried, it was a breeze to flat iron.  Highly recommend this product.  Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Love it! This product leaves the hair feeling silky. It also has a nice fragrance .</li>

            <li> really good on fine, soft and thinner hair textures.</li>
            <li> This sheen does a great job of protecting my relaxed hair from heat damage. My hair has more elasticity and body than it did even when I was natural, for 4 years. As for my regime... My hair is extremely fine (3B/3C) and jaw length. After shampooing and conditioning, I use a small amount of Kheils leave in, A few pumps if Niarobi foam, spray on about two pumps (6 inches away) of Kera K Silken, comb through and sit under the dryer. I curl with a ceramic curling (I don&#x27;t blow dry at home). I know for a fact that the difference is in the Silken, as I have had the same routine for 3 months before purchasing the Kera Kare Silken. Silken literally leaves my hair looking salon smooth. It&#x27;s my secret weapon!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer, especiall for relaxed hair.  It keeps my hair from breaking off in between relaxers.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Leaves my hair shining and it does not weigh my fine hair down at all. I use it whn my hair is wet and also when i flat iron(which is rare) and as a finish glosser. Love love this stuff. Matter of fact let me go head and place my order for another bottle.Lol</li>
            <li> This is one of the 4 products that i use on my curly hair after i flat iron it. It leaves it very shiny, silky and the smell it absolutely fabulous. Your man will be asking what smells so good!</li>
            <li> I flat iron daily since I workout and it does a fine job without weighing my hair down. Nice shine also.</li>

            <li> I love this product it makes my hair nice and shiny and healthy looking.</li>
