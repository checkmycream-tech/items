            <li>This is a good price and a good product</li>
            <li>The Sure Unscented Anti-Perspirant and Deodorant works great.</li>
            <li>anyway, it has no scent at all and makes sure you don&#x27;t have any scent either!</li>
            <li>I liked it because it was unscented, effective and lasted all day.</li>
            <li>so I can tell you that it worked great this summer, which was very hot and humid here.</li>
            <li>Finding it at a great price, lower than Publix,via amazon prime was wonderful, so I basically ordered nearly a year&#x27;s worth of it.  </li>
            <li>First let me say this is a great price for what you get.</li>
            <li>I have probably been using this product for twenty years or more.  </li>
            <li>but I have been trying to communicate with this seller for almost a month now and its gone way beyond the item and more into the principle .</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I like it better not to have an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>The aerosol is nice and cool and a lot easier to put on for me.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Dry feet is a great thing.</li>
            <li>My absolute, all time favorite.  </li>
            <li>Works good no scent, There is plenty in can to last.</li>
            <li>Quick mail delivery.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best deodorant, which I have been using for years - it&#x27;s new packaging...</li>
            <li>Does anyone know if the original deodorant (in the old style can) is available anywhere?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A quick spray is all that is necessary to keep your feet dry and your shoes smelling good!</li>
            <li>As far as scent, this stuff goes on and wears nicely without any scent at all, which may appeal to people with sensitive noses or folks who prefer colognes instead of &amp;#34;canned&amp;#34; cologne from the store.</li>
            <li>So I really appreciate that I can order this item for ~$3 with free shipping (click that &amp;#34;XX new and used from...</li>
            <li>I am not a &amp;#34;heavy sweater&amp;#34; nor am I a particularly smelly person, but I do find that this product works better than any of the roll on or swipe on brands that I have used including soft n dry and degree.</li>
            <li>We live on the East Coast and summers here are very humid.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again as needed and would recommend it, highly.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that after using it for ~two weeks I have not broken out in a rash or even been the slightest bit itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But along about the time the new can design came along I noticed that it just stopped working.</li>
            <li>There were rumors they would not make this anymore, so the new packaging is a delight to see.  </li>
            <li>The Sure Unscented protects me from sweating excessively, does not go on sticky (leaving me with that wet-armpit feel) and doesn’t give off a lot of scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never had this problem with the old can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For whatever reason none of the stores near me sell aerosol deoderants.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that this Sure product would cause the same problem--possibly over a larger area due to the nature of how it is applied.  </li>
            <li>Be careful around white cotton though, my wife says it sometimes produces a light yellow stain that won&#x27;t wash out.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise no other issues.</li>
            <li>All I wanted was a simple can of deodorant , with the convenience of not having to go to the store with my busy schedule</li>
            <li>Really does go on dry to keep you dry.  </li>

            <li> Really does go on dry to keep you dry.  </li>
            <li> went to Walmart and bought soft &amp; dri (dry) aerosol spray in the pink can</li>
            <li> The only one that keeps me really dry especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li> It does leave a little white residue if you don&#x27;t let it dry completely before dressing, but so do the supposedly &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li> antiperspirant keeps me completely dry all day without flaking, caking or leaving any residue at all.</li>
            <li> They must have changed the formula because now it does not keep me dry at all.</li>
            <li> ; link to see the Amazon Prime seller).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin under my arms (no idea why--no other part of me is like that) and tend to get rashes with the usual roll-on and stick deoderants/antipersperants.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to find in stores, these days</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time finding Sure spray deodorant in my local stores and it is the only deodorant DH will use.  </li>
            <li> :  If you have a fungal infection under your arms (happened to me twice--probably because other products made me so itchy) this stuff is a godsend because there&#x27;s no way for the fungal spores to contaminate the product.  </li>
            <li> When you would press down on the nozzle it would spit and spray in every direction</li>
            <li> I can buy this at Walmart for $2.96 or even Target for a little under $4.00.  </li>
            <li> I did not enjoy this.</li>
            <li> have allergies to some scents and can’t take heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li> , it just has a weird aerosol heavy spray thing going on where its almost like the feeling when you spray too much air freshener in the bathroom with the door closed and its difficult to breathe.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this product faithfully for the past 25 years.  </li>
            <li> This product works well, have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> but this has been a serious hassle</li>
            <li> The thing that scares me is that it’s getting impossible for me to find these in any local drugstores, or even Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> The price on amazon is about 3 bucks a can, so it&#x27;s even less expensive than the drugstore which is running a bit over 4 dollars.</li>
            <li> The product was deficient.</li>
            <li> Why is this so expensive on Amazon?</li>
            <li> Solid stick-type antiperspirants flake off in my bed at night (very annoying as it leaves a sandy feeling on my sheets) and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I seem to be allergic to this product because I tend to itch under arm even when I have washed it off.</li>
            <li> without the crazy aerosol feeling.</li>
            <li> They sent this item to the wrong address !</li>
            <li> This is very expensive for this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> So bad that I had to put it away in my closet.</li>
            <li> Each time the replacement can also had a bad spray nozzle.</li>

            <li> The product was deficient. I doubt I would buy this through Amazon again!</li>
            <li> My absolute, all time favorite.  I have probably been using this product for twenty years or more.  Really does go on dry to keep you dry.  Be careful around white cotton though, my wife says it sometimes produces a light yellow stain that won&#x27;t wash out.  I never noticed that on my stuff though. . . .  Otherwise no other issues.</li>
            <li> This is very expensive for this deodorant.  I can buy this at Walmart for $2.96 or even Target for a little under $4.00.  Why is this so expensive on Amazon?</li>
            <li> They sent this item to the wrong address ! and I have had difficulty trying to reach this seller . Do not buy anything from this seller . I realize that this is just a can of deodorant but I have been trying to communicate with this seller for almost a month now and its gone way beyond the item and more into the principle . All I wanted was a simple can of deodorant , with the convenience of not having to go to the store with my busy schedule but this has been a serious hassle and I will never again purchase anything like this on the internet</li>
            <li> I can never find unscented spray antiperspirant in my local stores. I don&#x27;t like scented ones as I prefer to wear different colognes and the mix of the two scents just doesn&#x27;t work at all. Solid stick-type antiperspirants flake off in my bed at night (very annoying as it leaves a sandy feeling on my sheets) and gel sticks cause caking in my armpits and eventually clog up the pits of my shirts with gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This antiperspirant keeps me completely dry all day without flaking, caking or leaving any residue at all. As far as scent, this stuff goes on and wears nicely without any scent at all, which may appeal to people with sensitive noses or folks who prefer colognes instead of &amp;#34;canned&amp;#34; cologne from the store. I am very happy with this product and I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I starting using it and after 4 uses it&#x27;s not spraying anymore!, Would not recommend this product. Prefer to buy a different in the store.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy this. I would spay it and felt like I was choking. Its not the smell i mind, it just has a weird aerosol heavy spray thing going on where its almost like the feeling when you spray too much air freshener in the bathroom with the door closed and its difficult to breathe. So bad that I had to put it away in my closet. I figure someone in my house may have a use for it one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Walmart and bought soft &amp; dri (dry) aerosol spray in the pink can and that works incredibly well... without the crazy aerosol feeling. I will buy it from Amazon next time.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this product faithfully for the past 25 years.  he is happy that he now has a good supply.</li>
            <li> First let me say this is a great price for what you get. This product works well, have nothing negative to say about it. I would buy it again as needed and would recommend it, highly.</li>
            <li> Works good no scent, There is plenty in can to last. I like it better not to have an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> The thing that scares me is that it’s getting impossible for me to find these in any local drugstores, or even Wal-Mart anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have allergies to some scents and can’t take heavy perfumes. The Sure Unscented protects me from sweating excessively, does not go on sticky (leaving me with that wet-armpit feel) and doesn’t give off a lot of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s perfect for people with sensitivities.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time finding Sure spray deodorant in my local stores and it is the only deodorant DH will use.  Finding it at a great price, lower than Publix,via amazon prime was wonderful, so I basically ordered nearly a year&#x27;s worth of it.  Came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I seem to be allergic to this product because I tend to itch under arm even when I have washed it off.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for at least 15 years. I liked it because it was unscented, effective and lasted all day. But along about the time the new can design came along I noticed that it just stopped working. They must have changed the formula because now it does not keep me dry at all. and I am at a loss of what to use since I can&#x27;t tolerate scented products. Does anyone know if the original deodorant (in the old style can) is available anywhere?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I should mention that I have had issues with the nozzle, and had to return the can for an exchange two separate times. Each time the replacement can also had a bad spray nozzle. When you would press down on the nozzle it would spit and spray in every direction so you couldn&#x27;t aim it properly. Never had this problem with the old can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone can recommend a good UNSCENTED aerosol deodorant, I thank you! Won&#x27;t be buying this product for my family again.</li>
            <li> the best and you literally can&#x27;t find this is drugstores in NYC..why?? anyway, it has no scent at all and makes sure you don&#x27;t have any scent either! def recommend!</li>
            <li> For whatever reason none of the stores near me sell aerosol deoderants.  I cannot find them at Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, etc etc.  So I really appreciate that I can order this item for ~$3 with free shipping (click that &amp;#34;XX new and used from...&amp;#34; link to see the Amazon Prime seller).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin under my arms (no idea why--no other part of me is like that) and tend to get rashes with the usual roll-on and stick deoderants/antipersperants.  I was concerned that this Sure product would cause the same problem--possibly over a larger area due to the nature of how it is applied.  I was pleasantly surprised that after using it for ~two weeks I have not broken out in a rash or even been the slightest bit itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  If you have a fungal infection under your arms (happened to me twice--probably because other products made me so itchy) this stuff is a godsend because there&#x27;s no way for the fungal spores to contaminate the product.  With roll-on and stick deoderants the fungal spores will get inside the deoderant and you&#x27;ll end up re-infecting yourself--sometimes weeks later.  With an aerosol deoderant that can&#x27;t happen since you apply it from a distance.</li>
            <li> The Sure Unscented Anti-Perspirant and Deodorant works great. It does leave a little white residue if you don&#x27;t let it dry completely before dressing, but so do the supposedly &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; brands. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months so I can tell you that it worked great this summer, which was very hot and humid here. No pit stains in any of my summer clothing. I am not a &amp;#34;heavy sweater&amp;#34; nor am I a particularly smelly person, but I do find that this product works better than any of the roll on or swipe on brands that I have used including soft n dry and degree. The aerosol is nice and cool and a lot easier to put on for me. The price on amazon is about 3 bucks a can, so it&#x27;s even less expensive than the drugstore which is running a bit over 4 dollars.</li>
            <li> Dry feet is a great thing. A lot of shoes make feet sweat and cause chafing and blisters. A quick spray is all that is necessary to keep your feet dry and your shoes smelling good!</li>
            <li> A great product.  Quick mail delivery.  No flowery smell, and it is not sticky like some products.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy this product again.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years.  The only one that keeps me really dry especially in the summer.  We live on the East Coast and summers here are very humid.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best deodorant, which I have been using for years - it&#x27;s new packaging... There were rumors they would not make this anymore, so the new packaging is a delight to see.  It&#x27;s harder to find in stores, these days so I buy in bulk for months to rely on it...  This is a good price and a good product</li>
