            <li>My son&#x27;s skin looked so  great that I snuck and used it!</li>
            <li>Another great product from B&amp;C Skin</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day, morning and night and mix it with a pinch of brown sugar twice a week to make a great exfoliator.</li>
            <li>the cleanser, cream and night cream - so inexpensive and just as good as the&lt;br /&gt;creams</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Now I have my own tube.</li>
            <li>very good to mix when shaving cool and refreshing</li>
            <li>Great product mild on your skin, but effective for acne and blemishes.</li>
            <li>which is awesome because i have sensitive skin after using it after waxing it left my skin very smooth !!!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I truly love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I would advise friends family to really use this because is really good</li>
            <li>i just received my cleanser and its very mild</li>
            <li>I look young and my skin tone is even and bright.</li>
            <li>My hubby and I both use it to clean our face.</li>
            <li>a bit more acne dont know if it is really working.</li>
            <li>btw I am black and it works great for clearing up ingrown hairs and razor bumps</li>
            <li>My acne has disappeared and my face hasnt been more clear!</li>
            <li>However, after more frequent use and my skin becoming used to it, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money, will not order again.</li>
            <li>I had shave my underarm and was  experiencing constant itching and since I have eczema and did not want to use any kind of steroid cream under my arm</li>
            <li>My skin is soooo clean, clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>Delivery was average, packaging was good.</li>
            <li>and she wants some now!</li>
            <li>Very small, but a great skin cleanser</li>
            <li>My only problem with the product is that it does not come in a 12 to 16 oz bottle, but it&#x27;s ok because a dime size amount washes my whole body.</li>
            <li>This is totally not harsh on your skin and it does not leave any additional residue but really makes my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li>This work very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and reduces the appearance of blemishes and acne.</li>
            <li>because I really like the product and it works very well</li>
            <li>But will dry the skin, so oil free moisturizer to follow will help with that.</li>
            <li>I bought this cleanser after doing much research for my 18 year old son whom was suffering from razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend B&amp;C products to everyone that&#x27;s looking to have clear and healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment and was as expected.</li>
            <li>They came out soft and supple.</li>
            <li>If you have ultra sensitive skin don&#x27;t use the loofah disk.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be making this apart of my normal regimen</li>
            <li>But the B &amp; C products will never hurt your pockets and I&#x27;m actually the happiest I&#x27;ve been with my skin since I was in my early 20s!</li>

            <li> I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because during initial use, it did make me break out a little.</li>
            <li> So I figured it was the clearing cleanser breaking my face out, so I stopped using it and a few days later it cleared up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent $50 on face cream and $20 on skin toners.</li>
            <li> I brought this and started using it and a few days later I noticed little bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> I brought the B &amp; C Skin Tight Clearing Cleanser because I was given a sample in a beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> and I do not have that white scum that my skin usually gets from using soap by itself.</li>
            <li> works like a charm, i use it everyday after shaving...</li>
            <li> Hands down!!</li>
            <li> The more I used the worst they got.</li>
            <li> This is a wash, I thought it was like an astringent that you put a small amount on a cotton pad and wipe your face</li>
            <li> have been using skin tight products ever since my barber introduced them to me, it has cleared me of shaving bumps, ingrown hairs, and also cleared my skin over all!!</li>
            <li> this is like soap you scrub your face then wash it off, I&#x27;ve done that I don&#x27;t notice a difference, at least not yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> it works well with the ointment as well to clear up those ugly spots!!</li>
            <li> Ill continue to use this</li>

            <li> I brought this and started using it and a few days later I noticed little bumps all over my face. The more I used the worst they got. So I figured it was the clearing cleanser breaking my face out, so I stopped using it and a few days later it cleared up. It didn&#x27;t work for me, but thats not to say it won&#x27;t work for someone else. Trail and error with these kinds of products.</li>
            <li> works like a charm, i use it everyday after shaving... btw I am black and it works great for clearing up ingrown hairs and razor bumps</li>
            <li> I love it I orered the cleanser, cream and night cream - so inexpensive and just as good as the&lt;br /&gt;creams anyone could buy in the department store that cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> Another great product from B&amp;C Skin Tight&lt;br /&gt;I have been using skin tight products ever since my barber introduced them to me, it has cleared me of shaving bumps, ingrown hairs, and also cleared my skin over all!! I would highly recommend B&amp;C products to everyone that&#x27;s looking to have clear and healthier looking skin. Hands down!!</li>
            <li> very good to mix when shaving cool and refreshing</li>

            <li> I truly love this cleanser. When I use it I feel cleaner and I do not have that white scum that my skin usually gets from using soap by itself. It works well and I will definitely be making this apart of my normal regimen</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser after doing much research for my 18 year old son whom was suffering from razor bumps. My son&#x27;s skin looked so  great that I snuck and used it! Now I have my own tube. My skin is soooo clean, clear and smooth. I spare no expense when it comes to skincare. I&#x27;ve spent $50 on face cream and $20 on skin toners. I could go on. But the B &amp; C products will never hurt your pockets and I&#x27;m actually the happiest I&#x27;ve been with my skin since I was in my early 20s! I look young and my skin tone is even and bright. I&#x27;m addicted. I even used this to wash my dry feet. They came out soft and supple. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product mild on your skin, but effective for acne and blemishes. Skin remains balanced and nourished with no irritation.</li>
            <li> This is totally not harsh on your skin and it does not leave any additional residue but really makes my skin feel clean. My mother even tried it and she wants some now! I will be purchasing this again and again.</li>
            <li> i just received my cleanser and its very mild which is awesome because i have sensitive skin after using it after waxing it left my skin very smooth !!! it works well with the ointment as well to clear up those ugly spots!! will give a two week review!!!</li>
            <li> Good product. But will dry the skin, so oil free moisturizer to follow will help with that.</li>
            <li> This work very well. My hubby and I both use it to clean our face.</li>
            <li> This face wash has done wonders for my skin tone!! My acne has disappeared and my face hasnt been more clear! Ill continue to use this</li>
            <li> Sooooo, was told to use this with a loofah disk to minimize the in growns and bumps around the bikini area. It works, not 100% but definitely around the 85-90% mark. Use this along with the in grown creme and you&#x27;re in the 90- 95% range. If you have ultra sensitive skin don&#x27;t use the loofah disk.</li>
            <li> Ive been getting clearer skin but also a bit more acne dont know if it is really working.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because during initial use, it did make me break out a little. However, after more frequent use and my skin becoming used to it, I really like this product. It&#x27;s gentle and reduces the appearance of blemishes and acne. I use it twice a day, morning and night and mix it with a pinch of brown sugar twice a week to make a great exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Very small, but a great skin cleanser</li>
            <li> because I really like the product and it works very well I would advise friends family to really use this because is really good</li>
            <li> I brought the B &amp; C Skin Tight Clearing Cleanser because I was given a sample in a beauty supply store.  I had shave my underarm and was  experiencing constant itching and since I have eczema and did not want to use any kind of steroid cream under my arm I went to the beauty supply store. I explained my problem to the sales lady and she suggested I try a sample before purchasing and I it worked.  There was no stinging under the arm when I used it and the itching stopped instantly. I tried using it all over my body and I have not experience any problem with my eczema flareups. I now use it as my overall body wash.  My only problem with the product is that it does not come in a 12 to 16 oz bottle, but it&#x27;s ok because a dime size amount washes my whole body.</li>
