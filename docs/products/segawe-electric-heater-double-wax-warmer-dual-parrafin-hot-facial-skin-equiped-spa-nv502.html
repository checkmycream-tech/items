    <ol>
            <li>Excellent wax warmer, grate price</li>
            <li>Otherwise great!</li>
            <li>Happy purchase!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this wax warmer in February and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Great for body wax and face wax to be placed separately.</li>
            <li>I did get three good months out of a fifty dollar wax warmer.</li>
            <li>I have to say until it stopped working I loved it.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love, love mine!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to place a label on the machine for State board purposes.</li>
            <li>Was glad it came on time</li>
            <li>Like the title states, ok for home but not for professionals.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Because the kettles come out of the warmer it is very easy to pour wax into them and to clean them when you are finished.</li>
            <li>I love this product, perfect one side for the face and the other for the body...</li>
            <li>I would have liked to have a choice on how hot the wax gets.</li>
            <li>Fantastic wax warmer.</li>
            <li>I use satin smooth wax, and the cans don&#x27;t fit snug but there is no problem with warming the wax.</li>
            <li>Had for a month now so far so good</li>
            <li>So u have to be ok with putting wax right into the tin provided and hope u never want to replace the wax.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and suitable for all types of waxes</li>
            <li>This is the third wax warmer I have purchased and it is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>The product seemed to work fine at first</li>
            <li>This warmer heats up my wax quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I own a  high end Day Spa and one of our Brow Bar wax pots broke and decided to try this one and see if it would last, so far so good.</li>
            <li>I am a professional cosmetologist and I love this product.</li>
            <li>And it heats up pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am trying to get a response from the seller as to what they will do to make it right.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s able to use it with different brands of waxes so it was worth it.</li>
            <li>very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Good little waxing unit.</li>
            <li>So far very good last two from different company.</li>
            <li>It either makes the wax boiling hot, or doesn&#x27;t heat it at all regardless of the heat setting.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can adjust each temperature individually instead of it just being an on/off switch.</li>
            <li>the product arrived early and m very pleased with the unit .. would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>This warmer maintains consistent temperature with and without the lids on.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loved this while she was in school, because it let her practice at home, but now she says that she has been working in different spas, that this warmer, believe it or not, is pretty much the industry standard.  </li>
            <li>This wax warmer holds the wax at consistent temperatures and has been very reliable.  </li>
            <li>It looks nice but you need to keep the settings on high to get the wax soft enough.</li>
            <li>Works very well with products such as gigi and satin smooth.</li>
            <li>It really keeps temp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset about this issue.</li>
            <li>Absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, but does not heat as fast as the wax pot I have from beauty image.</li>
            <li>I really like this wax warmer</li>
            <li>it is pretty universal and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just got one with a messed up thermostat, as it doesnt provide a steady temp while working with it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend purchasing this product for professionals or for customers who wax themselves.</li>
            <li>I will Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>And I use them professionally!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get remotely hot enough to even melt the wax...</li>
            <li>Down side when it heats up it makes a \\&quot;pop\\&quot; sound.</li>
            <li>I have a gigi pot that is over 15 years old...</li>
            <li>Got this for my home spa, and have used it once so far.</li>
            <li>Be careful, the holders remains hot to the touch for quite some time</li>
            <li>Save yourself the time and money and find a different dual wax warmer, even if it costs a bit more at least it will work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a slight smell when I first turn the warmer on.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m using it for personal use (and for use on a few friends).</li>

            <li> Right now I&#x27;m using it for personal use (and for use on a few friends).</li>
            <li> First purchase was broken, so I had to request for a new one.</li>
            <li> It has individual on/off switches so you can heat one or the other or both.  </li>
            <li> I reached out to the seller to ask for a refund due to a defective product and only owning it for 36 days and my request was refused.  </li>
            <li> I lost money on this purchase due to shipping it back.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money and such a let down.</li>
            <li> but we have only had it a few weeks and one warmer side stopped working.</li>
            <li> I bought this wax pot based on the other reviews.</li>
            <li> well, my only complaint is the clicking it makes when it reaches temp.</li>
            <li> The pot arrived in just a few days well before the time I expected it to get to me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because a previous wax warmer wasnt heating my wax cans.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the buckets are too deep for shallow wax cans and it is difficult to get the correct angle to scrape excess wax off the stick.</li>
            <li> I have strip wax in one warmer and hard wax in the other.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and was informed that I am 5 days past my 90 day warranty so there is nothing they can do.</li>
            <li> I used it twice before realizing that it wasn&#x27;t something I was doing wrong, but the fact that the heating just was not consistent.  </li>
            <li> I had clients all day for waxing when it stopped working randomly....</li>
            <li> Poor quality in product and terrible customer service.  </li>
            <li> Quite disappointed as I will now have to get another one.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy at this moment in time.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up as well as I would have hoped for it to. First purchase was broken, so I had to request for a new one.</li>
            <li> I am a professional cosmetologist and I love this product. Works very well with products such as gigi and satin smooth. I would highly recommend purchasing this product for professionals or for customers who wax themselves. Just make sure to place a label on the machine for State board purposes.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and suitable for all types of waxes</li>
            <li> I love, love mine! It really keeps temp. well, my only complaint is the clicking it makes when it reaches temp. and looses it</li>
            <li> This is the third wax warmer I have purchased and it is by far the best.  A bargain for the price.  It has individual on/off switches so you can heat one or the other or both.  And it heats up pretty quickly.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent wax warmer, grate price</li>
            <li> I purchased this wax warmer in February and it worked great. This weekend I went to use it and wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I contacted the seller and was informed that I am 5 days past my 90 day warranty so there is nothing they can do. I guess you get what you pay for. I did get three good months out of a fifty dollar wax warmer. I have to say until it stopped working I loved it.</li>
            <li> Was glad it came on time but when i went to use the waxer it didn&#x27;t turn on. I&#x27;m very upset about this issue.</li>
            <li> I love this product, perfect one side for the face and the other for the body... Absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must buy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~J~</li>
            <li> Good little waxing unit. The wax pots come out for cleaning. Down side when it heats up it makes a \\&quot;pop\\&quot; sound. Sometime startles me. Otherwise great!</li>
            <li> I ordered a wax from them September 2014 and it&#x27;s feb 2015 and the left side already stopped working! Total waste of money and such a let down. I had clients all day for waxing when it stopped working randomly....so not dependable!!!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s able to use it with different brands of waxes so it was worth it. Be careful, the holders remains hot to the touch for quite some time</li>
            <li> Great for body wax and face wax to be placed separately.</li>
            <li> Too big for any wax tin I&#x27;ve bought. So u have to be ok with putting wax right into the tin provided and hope u never want to replace the wax.</li>
            <li> The product seemed to work fine at first but we have only had it a few weeks and one warmer side stopped working. Now it just takes up space as it only has one functioning side. Quite disappointed as I will now have to get another one.</li>
            <li> This product was sold defective.  I used it twice before realizing that it wasn&#x27;t something I was doing wrong, but the fact that the heating just was not consistent.  It either makes the wax boiling hot, or doesn&#x27;t heat it at all regardless of the heat setting.  When I realized and tried to return I was 6 days over the return time frame of 30 days.  I reached out to the seller to ask for a refund due to a defective product and only owning it for 36 days and my request was refused.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  Poor quality in product and terrible customer service.  Save yourself the time and money and find a different dual wax warmer, even if it costs a bit more at least it will work.</li>
            <li> Fantastic wax warmer. Right now I&#x27;m using it for personal use (and for use on a few friends). I have strip wax in one warmer and hard wax in the other. I love that I can adjust each temperature individually instead of it just being an on/off switch. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loved this while she was in school, because it let her practice at home, but now she says that she has been working in different spas, that this warmer, believe it or not, is pretty much the industry standard.  And it&#x27;s not because this warmer is top-of-the-line or hi-tech or anything, it is just because it works and it&#x27;s reliable, that simple.</li>
            <li> Was broke upon arriving 👎😢</li>
            <li> So far so good! And I use them professionally! Happy purchase!</li>
            <li> The waxer works well. I like that there are 2 seperate temperature controls. Because the kettles come out of the warmer it is very easy to pour wax into them and to clean them when you are finished.</li>
            <li> i bought it  since i sometimes use two diff types of wax ... the product arrived early and m very pleased with the unit .. would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but does not heat as fast as the wax pot I have from beauty image.</li>
            <li> Hope this one lasts longer  then last two. So far very good last two from different company. Do use daily at work.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get remotely hot enough to even melt the wax... I lost money on this purchase due to shipping it back. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> very fast shipping. it doesnt botther me that it is in celcius… i like to find the temp i prefer on any wax pot i buy for myself.</li>
            <li> I bought this wax pot based on the other reviews. It looks nice but you need to keep the settings on high to get the wax soft enough. I don&#x27;t know if my pot is defective or if that is how they all are. The pot arrived in just a few days well before the time I expected it to get to me. I would have liked to have a choice on how hot the wax gets.Overall I can use it for the time being but am on the lookout for something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW # 2&lt;br /&gt;I have had this pot for only six months and it just stopped working with no warning. I am trying to get a response from the seller as to what they will do to make it right. Very unhappy at this moment in time. I hope they will replace or fix this pot. I have had wax pots last for years. I have a gigi pot that is over 15 years old... so 6 months feels like I got taken.</li>
            <li> Got this for my home spa, and have used it once so far. It heats up well and serves the purpose.I will Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does not heat wax properly</li>
            <li> This wax warmer holds the wax at consistent temperatures and has been very reliable.  I would definitely recommend this to a co-worker!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because a previous wax warmer wasnt heating my wax cans. This warmer heats up my wax quickly and efficiently. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I use satin smooth wax, and the cans don&#x27;t fit snug but there is no problem with warming the wax. The reason I&#x27;m giving this product a review of 4 stars is because&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight smell when I first turn the warmer on.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This warmer maintains consistent temperature with and without the lids on. The only drawback is that the buckets are too deep for shallow wax cans and it is difficult to get the correct angle to scrape excess wax off the stick. Otherwise, A+.</li>
            <li> Like the title states, ok for home but not for professionals. Maybe I just got one with a messed up thermostat, as it doesnt provide a steady temp while working with it.</li>
            <li> Had for a month now so far so good</li>
            <li> I really like this wax warmer it is pretty universal and heats up quickly. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the degree measurements are in Celsius</li>
            <li> I own a  high end Day Spa and one of our Brow Bar wax pots broke and decided to try this one and see if it would last, so far so good. Will keep posting if it does not last. It is on 12 hours a day 6 days a week.</li>
