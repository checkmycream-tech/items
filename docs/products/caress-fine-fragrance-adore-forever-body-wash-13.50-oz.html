            <li>Smells great, but irritated my skin.</li>

            <li>Smells good while using it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>

            <li>I honestly will not buy this body was ever again.  </li>
            <li>Nice, still trying to warm up to it.</li>
            <li>but it sure smells good.</li>
            <li>I loved it, will be ordering  more soon</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t lather up as good as the original Caress, I had to add more to the loofah to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>Strong nice smell that fights sweat smell.</li>
            <li>To be fair, something about my skin makes a lot of scents fade quickly, so it could just be me.</li>
            <li>There are better body washes.</li>
            <li>and I just don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell great and gave me a rash on my palms.</li>
            <li>Love the Caress</li>
            <li>I was glad to be warned about its bright crimson appearance, otherwise, I&#x27;d have been quite surprised.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an overwhelming smell and not fruity/flowery as a woman should smell but more overwhelming and a bit funky really.  </li>
            <li>Great scent on my skin &amp; it does last the day.</li>
            <li>My new favorite body wash!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t even anything to get excited about...</li>
            <li>When I first read about this body wash, I was so excited!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve honestly smelled other body washes that smelled better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love Love LOVE this brand with the new line of long wearing scent.</li>
            <li>Yes, it doesn&#x27;t last long scent wise!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a very good smell and it does not last more then a few minutes</li>
            <li>Okay smell but could not tell that the fragrance lasts as long as advertised.</li>
            <li>and you can smell it through the whole house when you use it.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this as I knew it was supposed to last 12 hours.  </li>
            <li>but perhaps I should try the other scent, Love Forever.</li>
            <li>It does linger slightly, but nothing to get excited about.</li>
            <li>It has a strong initial smell when you smell it out of the bottle, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last at all, and certainly not for 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t live up to commercial</li>
            <li>I used it in a long hot bath &amp; washed with it!!&lt;br /&gt;It cost less than getting at local stores!!</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a very good smell and it does not last more then a few minutes</li>
            <li> It smells good in the shower but that&#x27;s about it.  I couldn&#x27;t smell it once I got out of the shower and neither could my boyfrend.  There are better body washes.</li>
            <li> When I first read about this body wash, I was so excited! However, upon trying it, not so impressed. It&#x27;s just &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;. I was glad to be warned about its bright crimson appearance, otherwise, I&#x27;d have been quite surprised.  It smells good, however, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger all day like it claims to. It does linger slightly, but nothing to get excited about. The smell isn&#x27;t even anything to get excited about...I&#x27;ve honestly smelled other body washes that smelled better. I honestly will not buy this body was ever again.  Especially from 71,377 Solutions. Worst seller I&#x27;ve EVER had to deal with on Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent! Have had a lot of comments on how nice I smell!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this as I knew it was supposed to last 12 hours.  I must say, the scent definitely lasts.  However, it&#x27;s not that great.  It&#x27;s an overwhelming smell and not fruity/flowery as a woman should smell but more overwhelming and a bit funky really.  I have used it a few times and I just don&#x27;t love it so I will probably be disposing of it.  I had smelled them both in the store and chose Adore Forever but perhaps I should try the other scent, Love Forever.</li>
            <li> My new favorite body wash!</li>
            <li> Nice, still trying to warm up to it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried yet but it sure smells good.</li>
            <li> the body wash is wonderful, and smells really good too. I wouldn&#x27;t say it lasts 12 hours like it claims though. A few days later after i bought this item, I  was at my local Walmart and they had the item for  ONLY $3.00</li>
            <li> Smells good while using it but I cannot detect ANYTHING when I touch my skin after my shower.</li>
            <li> Strong nice smell that fights sweat smell. Just love it!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this body wash!  It smells so good!  I&#x27;m not sure if it lasts 12 hours, but I do catch a whiff now and then for hours after I&#x27;ve showered.  It&#x27;s my new favorite.  And cheaper than bath and body works stuff.</li>
            <li> Okay smell but could not tell that the fragrance lasts as long as advertised.</li>
            <li> Keeps the mosquitos away and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Great scent on my skin &amp; it does last the day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell great and gave me a rash on my palms. I gave it away</li>
            <li> I bought this because it says the scent lasts for 12 hours and continuously releases fragrance every time you touch your skin. Well, needless to say, it doesn&#x27;t. It has a strong initial smell when you smell it out of the bottle, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last at all, and certainly not for 12 hours. I also didn&#x27;t like that it didn&#x27;t lather up as good as the original Caress, I had to add more to the loofah to get a good lather. If it lived up to it&#x27;s expectation, I definitely would have kept purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I loved it, will be ordering  more soon</li>
            <li> Scent is overpowering.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who you crazy people are that are hating on this glorious elixir of the gods, but you should get your sniffers checked. Adore Forever is the ish. The smell lasted all day. Every time I caught a whiff of myself I felt like a majestic unicorn galloping through a field of ambrosia with Ryan Gosling in my saddle. Yeah. It&#x27;s that good. The smell isn&#x27;t flowery like your grandma or fruity like your middle school self, it is a smell for a grown ass woman, and I like that.</li>
            <li> Love Love LOVE this brand with the new line of long wearing scent. I do prefer the other one in this line. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t last long scent wise!! I used it in a long hot bath &amp; washed with it!!&lt;br /&gt;It cost less than getting at local stores!!</li>
            <li> This has a great Rose smell. I use this when I want a luxurious smell going. The scent stayed with me long after the shower as well. Love the Caress Adore Forever.</li>
            <li> This body wash smells great, but I&#x27;m not getting the &amp;#34;lasts all day&amp;#34; that I was hoping for. To be fair, something about my skin makes a lot of scents fade quickly, so it could just be me.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but irritated my skin. The irritation kept getting progressively worse till I stopped using it.  It was a shame because it smells awesome and you can smell it through the whole house when you use it. Might work as a good air freshener?</li>
