            <li>/&gt;The smell was pleasant and fragrant!</li>

            <li>My hair is processed so that is a VERY good thing.</li>

            <li>either I loved it!</li>
            <li>Smells good, but did not mesh with my hair type the best.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>The oil was great for smoothing my winter friz</li>
            <li>so once the pump is redesigned it will be great.  </li>

            <li>It works great with colored hair and did not make it fade.  </li>
            <li>I was equally happy when I realized it was An Herbal Essence product.</li>
            <li>the shampoo and conditioner have a great smell.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still really great.</li>
            <li>The smell of it is amazing and the best part of the shampoo.</li>

            <li>The conditioner  was very nice.  </li>
            <li>The elixer was amazing!</li>
            <li>My hair feels great, the kit smells amazing, and I&#x27;m off to search for 1L bottles of the shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li>pros of this bundle are that it smells AMAZING and the oil is great for your damaged ends.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved the smell.</li>
            <li>and I think it smells really good.</li>
            <li>My hair felt good and not at all oily or over-moisturized, like some moisturizing shampoos tend to do to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and honestly i loved it.</li>
            <li>It produced a good lather and my hair felt clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it also smells really good.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are nice and smell great.</li>
            <li>Although I loved the smell of their products, I had to give it up.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is surprising not drying to the hair..</li>
            <li>I have problems finding good conditioners/shampoos because it fritzes easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I need a good conditioner to keep it in check.  </li>
            <li>hair is also damaged but it seemed to work fairly well</li>
            <li>The conditioner also smelled really good and did not clump and matte my hair.</li>

            <li>the conditoner is good.</li>
            <li>The shampoo  had to use a good bit of it</li>
            <li>It smells so good</li>
            <li>and it still smells really good,</li>
            <li>I really loved the packaging and the fragrance of the collection.</li>
            <li>I was excited because it the perfect size to pack and check into the luggage.    </li>
            <li>First, the shampoo smelled great, but the thing that really impressed me was that it felt like my hair was getting lighter.</li>
            <li>The scent was pleasant as well, and my Fiance even complimented how nice my hair smelled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good line of products and it smells amazing.</li>

            <li>The smell is absolutely amazing</li>
            <li>My hair smelled amazing all day.</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing and maintains its smell even after you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lather was nice and the conditioner made my hair feel amazingly silky.</li>
            <li>kit has been AMAZING for my hair.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing</li>
            <li>, it was really amazing.</li>
            <li>The oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>Here is my honest opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner do smell nice.</li>
            <li>I also really liked the shampoo.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is nice as a cowash.</li>
            <li>The scents are nice but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>I like the oil elixer and it leaves a nice sheen and feel to my hair.</li>
            <li>The oil elixir was a nice add to the group</li>
            <li>and I really liked the way they made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase this set with my own money, I&#x27;d have to try it out for longer, but for now, I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil elixir smells really good, but it didn’t really act as brilliantly as it promises.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp; I really liked the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I just love how good it smell in my hair.</li>
            <li>The smell of the shampoo was so nice in the shower.</li>
            <li>but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this on my own because I like to stick with products that don&#x27;t contain sulfates.</li>
            <li>I really liked the conditioner and oil elixir.</li>
            <li>Even without the oil elixir, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>For the most part this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>in all its a nice product but its not what im looking for with my hair type.</li>
            <li>The shampoo suds up nicely and the conditioner softens my hair.</li>
            <li>Below is my honest opinion and review.  </li>
            <li>Frist try out of the box, I liked the smell -</li>
            <li>I thought, well this could be a &amp;#34;first product&amp;#34; kind of thing.</li>
            <li>The days i did not use the shampoo and conditioner, I used my own to test the oil by itself.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t that kind of defeat the purpose of washing your hair??&amp;#34</li>
            <li>First, the scent is so nice!!</li>
            <li>I must admit that I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this one; although HE products smell great, they did nothing for my hair, but since this was sent so graciously to me by Influenster, I gave it a try and am SO happy it was sent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is creamy and did a great job of lathering and cleansing my hair, and rinsed clean.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these products they are wonderful.</li>
            <li>I used the oil elixir after exiting the shower and had a pleasant reminder of the great smell and the oil wasnt too much that it would leave my hair looking oily.</li>
            <li>The products all have a light pleasant fruity smell.</li>
            <li>I love the oil spray the most I&#x27;m always looking for a good oil for my hair and my daughter</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly suprised by the great smell i didnt have high expectations for fig</li>
            <li>It makes washing your hair that much more enjoyable!</li>
            <li>Got my hair clean, conditions good.</li>
            <li>My first impression upon using the shampoo and conditioner was that they smelled great.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair feel very smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The oil is very light</li>
            <li>The product has a very nice smell, very fruity and floral!</li>
            <li>Got this free from influenster love it!</li>
            <li>I got this product to try free from Influenster, and love it!</li>
            <li>The ends feel so smooth and healthy!</li>
            <li>These made my hair feel very soft and smell so good!</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Both, as well as the oil, had a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I also had to continue to deal with the static and flyaways throughout my use of these products.  </li>
            <li>LOVE...........</li>
            <li>I had to use an additional leave in treatment and conditioner to make my hair look healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>The conditioner made my hair feel somewhat better.</li>
            <li>tend to do which causes more breakage.</li>
            <li>but i will have to test it out more to see if it makes a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>However, I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It was my favorite of the three products.</li>
            <li>I received this product free to test and review from Influenster!</li>
            <li>my hair will love and thsee products are a keeper.</li>
            <li>My favorite one is the oil elixr.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Focusing on my ends, while avoiding the roots, I found this smoothing serum really helped control my fly aways and hid my split ends.</li>
            <li>So, when I&#x27;m striving for a chic blow out, I want all of my ends looking as healthy as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner both smell really lovely</li>
            <li>and i noticed a healthy change in my hair.</li>
            <li>the oil elixir is my favorite out of all three.</li>
            <li>I was looking through prices to purchase this product it is cheaper than most shampoos</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The conditioner had the same delicious smell, however I did have to use more than I thought I would need to.</li>
            <li>It would have been better had it had a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li>The conditioner, however, is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>My ends looked healthy, and my hair was shiny.  </li>
            <li>I use a bit more than the instructions say because I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>and I would like it if it controlled frizziness a bit better.</li>
            <li>I love the smell to begin with.  </li>
            <li>The oil elixir was my favorite item.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I used all three products and I&#x27;m only impressed by one.</li>
            <li>This product is more of a gel than a cream.</li>
            <li>Fourth, the elixir oil was the best out of all the products.</li>
            <li>conditioner was ok.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a thicker consistency than most I have used.</li>
            <li>The hair oil is the only product I absolutely loved!!</li>
            <li>so I was able to try this.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great, lathers and rinses really well.</li>
            <li>It was okay.  </li>
            <li>I received these products free to test and review!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the oil elixir.</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;m glad I had the opportunity to try</li>
            <li>I had received this set free, courtesy of Influenster to test and review, thank God!</li>
            <li>I also have issues with shampoos clumping and tangling my hair, this shampoo did neither, and I can&#x27;t wait to go buy more.</li>
            <li>When using the oil elixer my hair was much more manageable.</li>
            <li>, it left my hair feeling wonderful after I used it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more about smoothing than cleaning.</li>
            <li>I love how my hair smells and feels.</li>
            <li>The oil elixir smooths my hair without making it greasy which I love.</li>
            <li>I love scents</li>
            <li>and while we probably won&#x27;t buy more of the conditioner, we may get more of the shampoo for periodic use and more of the Elixir for the scent.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this product is incredible, and the shampoo and conditioner made my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was able to try these products using Influenster.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smoother.  </li>
            <li>I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I had SO many compliments on my hair that day</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the results especially since the products are so inexpensive!</li>
            <li>The conditioner was better, I needed to use a ton of it to feel a difference</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed all three of the products.</li>
            <li>I Haven&#x27;t smelled a better shampoo or conditioner set.</li>
            <li>I received these products for free from Influenster and really liked two of the three of them.</li>
            <li>The conditioner, however, I didn&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I must confess the oil elixir is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely and rinses clean with no problem.  </li>
            <li>This product has really been amazing!</li>
            <li>The oil worked great on my damaged ends and they all left a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>liked it very much!  </li>
            <li>It did however leave my hair smelling great and feeling soft!</li>
            <li>I have pretty nice, healthy hair to begin with, but I also have layers and as mentioned, am color treated.</li>
            <li>I was able to brush it no problem and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use on the ends of your hair - steer clear of using it on your roots because you run the risk of making your hair greasy.</li>
            <li>I received these products free to test and review, but I was thoroughly pleased.</li>
            <li>I love how it immediately absorbs into my hair and helps smooth and strengthen my hair.</li>
            <li>In true Herbal Essences style, the shampoo smell is intoxicating!  </li>
            <li>All in all, I think this would be a great combination of products to use maybe once a month as more of a deep conditioning/repairing type product</li>
            <li>It was able to thoroughly clean the oil from my hair.</li>
            <li>All of these products smell great while leaving my hair feeling soft and frizz free</li>
            <li>but it was more than enough for 3 great washes.</li>
            <li>On the days I straighten my hair, I make sure to give it a good coating of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Oil Elixir.  </li>
            <li>it smells great and leaves your hair feeling and looking soft and fantastic.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recomend this product .</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s rather strong when it comes to its scent.</li>
            <li>First off the smell is amazing</li>
            <li>and the conditioner was fine.</li>
            <li>I liked the shampoo, because it left my hair clean and smelling good.  </li>
            <li>but I love that using the oil in my hair after my showers leaves me smelling so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>The shampoo has great rich lather and left my hair very clean.</li>
            <li>Plus it really helps to detangle my frizzy hair and give it a healthy shine!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to receive these products for free to test from Influenster!</li>

            <li>I enjoy all of the product packaging.</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly, and left my hair very shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair is usually pretty picky on what I put in it, but this trio has been working wonders!!</li>
            <li>Not only did it have a very nice smell (but not overpowering in smell)</li>
            <li>The products were free and I was so excited to test them for review.</li>
            <li>I received a free trial of this product through Influenster, and was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>It did have slip so I was able to detangle very quickly and easily, and my hair was very soft but strong and not overly mushy at all.</li>
            <li>The whole collection also has a very pleasant smell to it, and I noticed that it lingered during the entire day --</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try these.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I came home from work and found my Influenster box.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I knew the smell was going to be on point, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used Herbal Essences products in quite awhile, so I was excited to check it out again.  </li>
            <li>So when I got the chance to try this product, I was so excited.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to conditioners, but I did love this one.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it didnt leave my hair oily at all but just left a nice shine and smell!</li>
            <li>Currently, it&#x27;s not that humid, so I can&#x27;t test the frizz-free qualities, but the smell is really nice!</li>
            <li>I usually use Biolage products for my hair, so when I saw that it was Herbal Essences, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be impressed.</li>
            <li>so the oil was what I was most interested in.</li>
            <li>So I tell them about the product and they are excited to know it is not $$$$.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It rinses cleanly and I could tell that my hair was already softer.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to wash my hair twice with shampoo to get the clean hair feeling</li>
            <li>It rinses cleanly and I could tell that my hair was already softer.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered up well and made my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>I was the lucky recipient of a free sample of this from Influenster.  </li>
            <li>I usually do not use herbal essences products, but these smelled so amazing</li>
            <li>The weight flows smoothly, has a fresh tropical scent that lasts, and rinses out cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to try these products</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, leaves hair soft</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and the conditioner makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend these products to both men and woman looking to smooth or calm uncontrollable hair.</li>
            <li>My hair today feels silky soft, looks shiny and voluminous, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and my hair is so soft and sleek.</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair, bright red, so my ends are a bit damaged</li>
            <li>and I really focus on the ends of my hair since those are what are the most damaged.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good product</li>
            <li>I love the smell (of which, I am really picky)</li>
            <li>The scent of the elixir was light, fresh and not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair, I think this might be better for someone with straight oily hair.</li>
            <li>so I could get the full effect.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was my favorite, since it seemed to make my hair much smoother while I was in the shower.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, manageable and shiny with a nice scent.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as sweet as one would think.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers up really nice and the conditioner leaves my hair feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>(I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes, but I was actually surprised by how much I love it!)</li>
            <li>The day after my first application my hair felt incredibly soft and healthy but I had to deal with the flyaways and static that I get from sulfate shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use a smaller amount and my hair was smooth and easy to comb out.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>With this particular combo of products, I felt like I needed to wash my hair a lot more often because it made my hair feel oily after just a day or two.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair silky smooth and leaves a nice lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>I knew that I would be nothing short of pleased just as I am with most Herbal Essence products.</li>
            <li>I was lucky and received these products to try from Influenster.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t make your hair super shiny, which was another plus for me.  </li>
            <li>Overall, quite satisfied with all three products :)</li>
            <li>All in all, I love it, and I will definitely be buying more once this set runs out.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive this product from Influenster to try.</li>
            <li>It meshed well with any perfume I set to it, and was a fresh, yet interesting, slightly unusual scent.</li>
            <li>The dry oil spray is great on my 3b curls, really locks in moisture and gives it shine!</li>
            <li>I received this starter kit FREE to test and review thanks to Influenster!</li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair feeling smooth and really shiny!</li>
            <li>The oil elixir is my new favorite product.  </li>
            <li>I am thoroughly satisfied with these products and have found a new shampoo and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>The scent is absolutely amazing; totally invigorating, clean, and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s easy to use too much.</li>
            <li>I used to use Herbal Essence products a long time ago and recently came in possession of the updated version and it was great!</li>
            <li>and it does a great job of taming the mess.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair shiny and super soft :)</li>
            <li>but I let it air dry after using these products and it stayed nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair is not thin, but it is fine, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>I have very damaged, frizzy, fine hair</li>
            <li>Very fun to try new products!!</li>
            <li>conditioner helps a bit, but it doesn’t really calm my hair down….and</li>
            <li>It kept my curls calm without making my hair look oily.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is alright, did not detangle as much as I had hoped it would and didn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth as I wanted.</li>
            <li>After only a week of use, my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I received the whole system as a free sample to test and review.</li>
            <li>It actually washed all of the chlorine smell out of my hair &amp; smelled amazing all day.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t for me, but this would be a great product for someone with thicker hair than mine, and someone not overwhelmed by a heavy scent.</li>
            <li>Received a complimentary kit from Influensters.  </li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster to test and review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this bundle complimentary from Voxfox.</li>
            <li>The oil elixir is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I received this starter kit complimentary from influenster for review.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d need one with more conditioning action.</li>
            <li>And if you had straight or wavy or thick hair this would probably be perfect for you.</li>
            <li>I used the products every day for a week, my hair is soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and shiny my hair was after using it.  </li>
            <li>I would not purchase the shampoo or conditioner but the oil is worth</li>
            <li>Even though I really liked how my hair smelled, I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started to dye my hair more frequently, had 2 children, etc.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner seemed to work well, but considering I rarely &amp;#34;style&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I felt it was kind of necessary to rinse and repeat with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I really love the serum it made my hair really soft after I straightened.</li>
            <li>I received this kit complimentary from Influenster to review.</li>
            <li>I received these complimentary products from Influenster and Voxbox.</li>
            <li>I also really liked the oil as it left my hair feeling nourished and shiny.</li>
            <li>I received this as a complimentary gift.</li>
            <li>Third, the conditioner was ok, nothing to be excited about.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily AT ALL and did not leave an oily residue on my fingers afterwards and my hair sucked it right up.</li>
            <li>just right..</li>
            <li>This system is all right.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does clean my hair very well</li>
            <li>A good thing for me as I do not enjoy sweet scents and prefer to smell my perfume rather than hair product.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, super straight hair, it naturally tangles very easily, but this trio left my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The static cling that normally happens with blow drying is gone and it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li>My natural hair was so easy to comb through after conditioning</li>
            <li>Love how clean my hair feels after I shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t tend to dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Herbal Essences shampoos for awhile now, so I didn&#x27;t expect to be able to tell much difference in the washing process, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this trio.</li>
            <li>it felt very soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try out these new hair products</li>
            <li>The first thing that I did when I got the product was to smell it</li>
            <li>When I used the shampoo and conditioner it made my hair really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>it is still smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>first time I used this product, I tried all three items together.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about these products was the smell.  </li>
            <li>but I was thrown off by the amount of lather I got upon my first use.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner was creamy and had the same lovely smell.</li>
            <li>I use the oil elixir every night on the ends of my hair since i have got it and it has made it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>so I have been trying so many different shampoos, conditioners and moisturizers</li>
            <li>As part of the Influenster community, I received a free sample kit of the Herbal Essence Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Collection.</li>
            <li>I received the wild naturals rejuvenating starter kit free through Influenster for trial and review.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was creamy and had the same lovely smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and will be purchasing in the future.  </li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li>so this did work pretty well when I straightened my hair</li>
            <li>Overall, I was pleased.</li>
            <li>First thing I had to do was smell it.  </li>
            <li>With all of them working together my hair has definitely had more moisture.</li>
            <li>It gave me soft , smooth,  hair that was not tangled.  </li>
            <li>But I have been using this shampoo, conditioner, and oil elixir trio for about a month now and have really seen a difference in my hair!</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft and smooth, even with the heat torture my hair was getting.  </li>
            <li>My favorite item is definitely the oil, it makes my hair so shiny.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them all a few times now and really loved the shampoo.</li>
            <li>it left my hair super smooth with some shine to it also.</li>
            <li>To begin, I was lucky enough to receive a sample of this product line to test and review for FREE in a Vox Box from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, the shampoo is clear and has a light, soft later.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, the shampoo is clear and has a light, soft later.</li>
            <li>My hair used to be very soft and full of bounce and body.</li>
            <li>This is clearly a quality product, so I would recommend the product but not someone with straight hair or light wavy texture.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was light and left hair fresh and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>After I blow dried it, my hair was silky smooth and basically frizz free!</li>
            <li>Using the oil afterwards helped my hair be a little more soft, though I would have preferred more of a shine.</li>
            <li>in all, it was a positive experience</li>
            <li>First of all the shampoo and conditioner really stink, like grapefruit which im not a fan of.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I used two pumps, and it was too much.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4a kinky curly hair &amp; it left my hair feeling really clean &amp; strong</li>
            <li>My favorite is the oil, it left my hair feeling healthy without the look or feel of some other oil products.</li>
            <li>usually only wash my hair about 2 times a week as my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is reguvenation line, so I think is better suited for dry and processed hair.</li>
            <li>It was a free trial and i&#x27;m defiently interested in purchasing in the future</li>
            <li>The oil leaves my hair feeling super soft, however, I have wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li>; Purely for the sake of having my hair smell as though it had been kissed by the goddess of nature, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I use the oil elixir when I blow dry my hair as well, it leaves my hair soft and manageable and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li>It was nice to see that the shampoo did not leave my naturally curly hair brittle and dry.</li>
            <li>I make sure to apply it each time I blow dry and style my hair now!</li>
            <li>The conditioner conditioner was great, I only had to use a little bit</li>
            <li>I also put the elixer on my hair and it helped keep my hair from getting really frizzy.</li>
            <li>, I used the shampoo and conditioner together for one week straight.</li>
            <li>,This is a must buy and i highly recommend!</li>
            <li>All the products are worth purchase and completely rejuvenate your hair.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t care much for the elixir.</li>
            <li>so I really had to work the shampoo through my hair.</li>
            <li>However, I do really like the oil elixir itself.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t strip much of my color like I was worried about, which was a plus.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>and it covered my whole head.</li>
            <li>However, my hair really did feel softer and smoother after using it.</li>
            <li>I still really like the conditioner and oil elixir.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to use it because I don&#x27;t really like to use products in my hair after washing and didn&#x27;t want my hair to feel oily.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of the products, too, so did my husband.</li>
            <li>I recently got this to try for free thru influenster</li>
            <li>I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Collection, complimentary of Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li>I received travel-sized samples of the Wild Naturals Rejuvenating shampoo, conditioner &amp; oil elixir complimentary through Influenster.</li>
            <li>: nothing really here&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really do too much to help control frizziness.</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t bother me too much though.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Collection Bundle Kit through Influenster VOXBOX about a month ago to review.</li>
            <li>think this combo is good for people with hair not as thick as mine, because I’ve tried the combo three times and each time it didn’t work out too well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; my hair (other than a top knot) I didn&#x27;t notice a large difference in the way it corrected my damaged ends.</li>
            <li>I did find that it was a bit more gentle than other shampoos.</li>
            <li>The oil elixir helped tame frizz too, and it gave my hair a nice finish after using the gym blow dryer.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered really well, and left my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>In addition, my hair had a lot of static with this shampoo and conditioner, which I noticed was mentioned in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shampoo left my hair clean</li>
            <li>and I actually felt as though my hair was clean.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both used the shampoo and conditioner (though he&#x27;ll allow me to use whatever on his hair in the shower...and as long as it cleans, he&#x27;s fine)</li>
            <li>The conditioner I did not need much of though a little went a long way for me which was nice!</li>
            <li>so I could determine which of them makes the biggest difference, but as long as I can duplicate the results, I&#x27;m completely comfortable with having to buy all three of them.</li>
            <li>I did have to use a little more conditioner than usual to get a full moisturizing, but my hair felt very clean after the washing and very smooth as it dried.</li>
            <li>I try to stick with a &#x27;less is more&#x27; approach with conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Gave a decent rating for the oil.</li>
            <li>The sample size for the shampoo and conditioner was a generous 3+ oz, enough for a few washes and to get a good idea of the quality of the products.  </li>
            <li>you know there’s a decent amount of damage to it…  </li>
            <li>While I will definitely be looking for larger bottles of the shampoo and conditioner, the oil elixir is my favorite part of this kit.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is very rich, but rinsed out well and didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li>Although, the product design was similar to the current Herbal Essences products, the new white bottle with bright colors is a little more inviting.</li>
            <li>but I saw that isopropyl myristate was high up on the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>For the scent of this collection alone I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Definitely high on my list of products.</li>
            <li>This products not only left my hair smelling good all day but it also left it soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I had to use much more of this conditioner than I use of other brands and when I rinsed, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair with that soft, just conditioned feeling.  </li>
            <li>My natural curls where so defined!!</li>
            <li>I normally use something a little more high end, so I was hesitate to test this product.</li>
            <li>This system smelled a little weird, kind of plastic-y to me after rinsing, but my fiance loved it.</li>
            <li>Left my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>but i so happy i was wrong.</li>
            <li>My hair is very shiny and silky using the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Collection.</li>
            <li>As I would wash my hair the shampoo felt gentle, not harsh.</li>
            <li>definitely think it is worth a try</li>
            <li>I was able to use the shampoo and conditioner a few times since I received the products.</li>
            <li>: I have semi-natural hair so while everything was great while wet, when my hair dried it wasn&#x27;t as soft as I had</li>
            <li>Over all I would get the shampoo and conditioner for normal hair.</li>
            <li>and I was able to really stretch the conditioner which usually i burn through</li>
            <li>It has helped my hair look amazing for the past week that I have had it!</li>
            <li>The shampoo again was too harsh in my opinion for fine, thin or color treated hair, but all of the other products in this kit worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>and my hair is still continuing to fall out, in addition to all of those nice little one and two inch pieces that are growing back.</li>
            <li>Its my new fav shampoo and cond.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that the conditioner weighs my hair down quite a bit (I have wavy/curly hair and the conditioner kind of takes away my hair&#x27;s natural bounce).</li>
            <li>The smell was also amazing and once my hair dried the scent was still present.</li>
            <li>This whole set made my hair feel smooth, when I was done with the wash it didn&#x27;t feel harsh on my hair</li>
            <li>With my wavy hair, I couldn&#x27;t really tell that it was doing much, but on the second day of use I decided to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>I put a lot of the conditioner in my hair and it made it very soft.</li>
            <li>First, I put it all over my hair and the next day my hair looked and felt a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>And they ACTUALLY for the first time, made my hair soft.</li>
            <li>The conditioner left my hair feeling silky and healthy not weighted down.</li>
            <li>After that, I tried smoothing it on the ends after my shower, and I left my hair looked and felt better than it had been previously.  </li>
            <li>I had a few fly-aways at the top of my head, so I applied a tiny drop in my hands and rubbed them together, then lightly went over the crown of my head and smoothed them down.  </li>
            <li>the elixir, I love that you only need a little bit</li>
            <li>It has a very sweet smell, but not overwhelming ,</li>
            <li>These products have a slight floral and clean scent, and the scent lingers in your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the conditioner and oil did nothing for my hair as far as providing moisture.</li>
            <li>My hair felt really soft after i washed it</li>
            <li>I like the fact that they are natural products.</li>
            <li>I received herbal essences wild naturals from Influenster</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for those individuals with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves it really soft, however, I have wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li>Second, I didn&#x27;t feel like the shampoo lathered very well.</li>
            <li>and it leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li>I have soft spot for herbal essences because of their hello hydration line.</li>
            <li>With the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals that was not the case.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, a mom tried to swaddle her newborn baby in it.</li>
            <li>So, moving forward from there, I use the shampoo, and it is soft.</li>
            <li>Again, soft; making my hair feel like cotton.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The packaging wouldn&#x27;t catch my eye in the store and honestly, I was confused why the &amp;#34;cassia&amp;#34; berry looked like a fig (it turns out I was thinking of the cassis berry).</li>
            <li>If your hair has small breaks at the ends or has fly-aways I think it is a great product to tame the craziness!</li>
            <li>I used the Oil elixir after towel drying my hair first - the instructions say it can go on damp or dry hair - and</li>
            <li>It still felt pretty dry.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s worth a try to use, and there&#x27;s no real drawbacks to using this collection!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this if anyone is looking for new products!</li>
            <li>The shampoo was nothing special, it even felt a little drying.</li>
            <li>My main concern is they contain sulfate which is known to do further damage to hair.</li>
            <li>I love it and Ill most likely go out and buy it for myself after this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve been playing the shampoo roulette wheel, one will work good for a while, then my hair feels greasy, so I switch, but it always seems at the end of the day, I feel like a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li>gas a nice soft and subtle smell that actually lasts (washed and conditioned my hair as well as used the oil last night,</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil seemed to calm the frizziness of my hair down as well even after the humidity hit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much for my dry armpit length hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very moisturizing so there is no need to worry about it stripping or leaving for hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>Usually, shampoos that cleanse or strip away excess oils really well tend to leave my hair drier than I&#x27;d like, and that&#x27;s exactly what happened with this</li>
            <li>I am mystified by the product name since I have wild natural hair that needs to be rejuvenated regularly.</li>
            <li>products are such a personal preference, so would I recommended it based on my outcomes - absolutely, and I have.</li>
            <li>The conditioner did not have a thick consistency and after washing out the shampoo my hair was already untangled so it was an easy rinse.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much, although i used slightly more because my hair is so long, it&#x27;s half way down my back.</li>
            <li>My hair was smooth, I could run my fingers through it and it wasn&#x27;t a giant matted mess like before!</li>
            <li>half the bottle of conditioner to get enough coverage on my hair, more conditioner than expected.</li>
            <li>The conditioner made my hair silky and soft but only while it was in my hair.</li>
            <li>It coated my hair well and left if soft once I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from herbal essences because I have not been a big fan of their products in the past.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and at the next washing I can&#x27;t tell my hair had anything in it at all.</li>
            <li>While I usually love scents with fig, I was not entirely happy with this scent.</li>
            <li>think that this shampoo and conditioner is okay, but not great.</li>
            <li>Using the shampoo, I noticed that it didn&#x27;t really lather like other shampoos usually do, but it seemed to clean just as well.</li>
            <li>After the shampoo leaving my hair so dry I really needed the H.E. hair oil to bring back the softness to my hair, which it did.</li>
            <li>and so this should be able to help those of you with thick and dry hair!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>have a few things going on with my hair right now.</li>
            <li>I normally have dry, brittle, and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I am currently in the middle of transitioning my hair from relaxed to natural</li>
            <li>I expected my hair to smell good afterwards (because, duh, Herbal Essences), but I also figured that it would just be slightly covering up the chlorine smell.</li>
            <li>After only shampooing I felt a major difference.</li>
            <li>Normally my hair gets big and frizzy if I don&#x27;t blow dry it</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was just my particular hair type (I&#x27;m African American with 4c hair), but my hair was dry again before I even got halfway through my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, long, and brown.</li>
            <li>I live in a VERY dry state and my hair is always lacking moisture, I feel like.</li>
            <li>I am also glad it tamed my very thick and long hair.</li>
            <li>Lather (which really doesn&#x27;t do anything other than psychologically make us think it&#x27;s working), citrus scent (while it is not overly citrusy, I am not a big fan of citrus)&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>Usually, it feels like a weight on my head when its wet, but as soon as it lathered up, it felt light and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Personally, for me and my fine, color treated hair, I found the shampoo to be a bit harsh as it did its job a little too well.</li>
            <li>but I certainly would not recommend it for everyday use.</li>

            <li> and it is amazing</li>
            <li> , it was really amazing.</li>
            <li> The oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> Here is my honest opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner do smell nice.</li>
            <li> I also really liked the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is nice as a cowash.</li>
            <li> The scents are nice but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I like the oil elixer and it leaves a nice sheen and feel to my hair.</li>
            <li> The oil elixir was a nice add to the group</li>
            <li> and I really liked the way they made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase this set with my own money, I&#x27;d have to try it out for longer, but for now, I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil elixir smells really good, but it didn’t really act as brilliantly as it promises.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; I really liked the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I just love how good it smell in my hair.</li>
            <li> The smell of the shampoo was so nice in the shower.</li>
            <li> but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this on my own because I like to stick with products that don&#x27;t contain sulfates.</li>
            <li> I really liked the conditioner and oil elixir.</li>
            <li> Even without the oil elixir, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> For the most part this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> in all its a nice product but its not what im looking for with my hair type.</li>
            <li> The shampoo suds up nicely and the conditioner softens my hair.</li>
            <li> Below is my honest opinion and review.  </li>
            <li> Frist try out of the box, I liked the smell -</li>
            <li> I thought, well this could be a &amp;#34;first product&amp;#34; kind of thing.</li>
            <li> The days i did not use the shampoo and conditioner, I used my own to test the oil by itself.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t that kind of defeat the purpose of washing your hair??&amp;#34</li>
            <li> First, the scent is so nice!!</li>
            <li> I must admit that I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this one; although HE products smell great, they did nothing for my hair, but since this was sent so graciously to me by Influenster, I gave it a try and am SO happy it was sent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is creamy and did a great job of lathering and cleansing my hair, and rinsed clean.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these products they are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I used the oil elixir after exiting the shower and had a pleasant reminder of the great smell and the oil wasnt too much that it would leave my hair looking oily.</li>
            <li> The products all have a light pleasant fruity smell.</li>
            <li> I love the oil spray the most I&#x27;m always looking for a good oil for my hair and my daughter</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly suprised by the great smell i didnt have high expectations for fig</li>
            <li> It makes washing your hair that much more enjoyable!</li>
            <li> Got my hair clean, conditions good.</li>
            <li> My first impression upon using the shampoo and conditioner was that they smelled great.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel very smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The oil is very light</li>
            <li> The product has a very nice smell, very fruity and floral!</li>
            <li> Got this free from influenster love it!</li>
            <li> I got this product to try free from Influenster, and love it!</li>
            <li> The ends feel so smooth and healthy!</li>
            <li> These made my hair feel very soft and smell so good!</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> Both, as well as the oil, had a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I also had to continue to deal with the static and flyaways throughout my use of these products.  </li>
            <li> LOVE...........</li>
            <li> I had to use an additional leave in treatment and conditioner to make my hair look healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> The conditioner made my hair feel somewhat better.</li>
            <li> tend to do which causes more breakage.</li>
            <li> but i will have to test it out more to see if it makes a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> However, I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It was my favorite of the three products.</li>
            <li> I received this product free to test and review from Influenster!</li>
            <li> my hair will love and thsee products are a keeper.</li>
            <li> My favorite one is the oil elixr.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Focusing on my ends, while avoiding the roots, I found this smoothing serum really helped control my fly aways and hid my split ends.</li>
            <li> So, when I&#x27;m striving for a chic blow out, I want all of my ends looking as healthy as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner both smell really lovely</li>
            <li> and i noticed a healthy change in my hair.</li>
            <li> the oil elixir is my favorite out of all three.</li>
            <li> I was looking through prices to purchase this product it is cheaper than most shampoos</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The conditioner had the same delicious smell, however I did have to use more than I thought I would need to.</li>
            <li> It would have been better had it had a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li> The conditioner, however, is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> My ends looked healthy, and my hair was shiny.  </li>
            <li> I use a bit more than the instructions say because I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> and I would like it if it controlled frizziness a bit better.</li>
            <li> I love the smell to begin with.  </li>
            <li> The oil elixir was my favorite item.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I used all three products and I&#x27;m only impressed by one.</li>
            <li> This product is more of a gel than a cream.</li>
            <li> Fourth, the elixir oil was the best out of all the products.</li>
            <li> conditioner was ok.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a thicker consistency than most I have used.</li>
            <li> The hair oil is the only product I absolutely loved!!</li>
            <li> so I was able to try this.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great, lathers and rinses really well.</li>
            <li> It was okay.  </li>
            <li> I received these products free to test and review!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the oil elixir.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m glad I had the opportunity to try</li>
            <li> I had received this set free, courtesy of Influenster to test and review, thank God!</li>
            <li> I also have issues with shampoos clumping and tangling my hair, this shampoo did neither, and I can&#x27;t wait to go buy more.</li>
            <li> When using the oil elixer my hair was much more manageable.</li>
            <li> , it left my hair feeling wonderful after I used it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more about smoothing than cleaning.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair smells and feels.</li>
            <li> The oil elixir smooths my hair without making it greasy which I love.</li>
            <li> I love scents</li>
            <li> and while we probably won&#x27;t buy more of the conditioner, we may get more of the shampoo for periodic use and more of the Elixir for the scent.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I fell in love.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this product is incredible, and the shampoo and conditioner made my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I was able to try these products using Influenster.  </li>
            <li> I also love the smoother.  </li>
            <li> I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I had SO many compliments on my hair that day</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the results especially since the products are so inexpensive!</li>
            <li> The conditioner was better, I needed to use a ton of it to feel a difference</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed all three of the products.</li>
            <li> I Haven&#x27;t smelled a better shampoo or conditioner set.</li>
            <li> I received these products for free from Influenster and really liked two of the three of them.</li>
            <li> The conditioner, however, I didn&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I must confess the oil elixir is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It lathers up nicely and rinses clean with no problem.  </li>
            <li> This product has really been amazing!</li>
            <li> The oil worked great on my damaged ends and they all left a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> liked it very much!  </li>
            <li> It did however leave my hair smelling great and feeling soft!</li>
            <li> I have pretty nice, healthy hair to begin with, but I also have layers and as mentioned, am color treated.</li>
            <li> I was able to brush it no problem and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use on the ends of your hair - steer clear of using it on your roots because you run the risk of making your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I received these products free to test and review, but I was thoroughly pleased.</li>
            <li> I love how it immediately absorbs into my hair and helps smooth and strengthen my hair.</li>
            <li> In true Herbal Essences style, the shampoo smell is intoxicating!  </li>
            <li> All in all, I think this would be a great combination of products to use maybe once a month as more of a deep conditioning/repairing type product</li>
            <li> It was able to thoroughly clean the oil from my hair.</li>
            <li> All of these products smell great while leaving my hair feeling soft and frizz free</li>
            <li> but it was more than enough for 3 great washes.</li>
            <li> On the days I straighten my hair, I make sure to give it a good coating of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Oil Elixir.  </li>
            <li> it smells great and leaves your hair feeling and looking soft and fantastic.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recomend this product .</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s rather strong when it comes to its scent.</li>
            <li> First off the smell is amazing</li>
            <li> and the conditioner was fine.</li>
            <li> I liked the shampoo, because it left my hair clean and smelling good.  </li>
            <li> but I love that using the oil in my hair after my showers leaves me smelling so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> The shampoo has great rich lather and left my hair very clean.</li>
            <li> Plus it really helps to detangle my frizzy hair and give it a healthy shine!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to receive these products for free to test from Influenster!</li>

            <li> The whole collection also has a very pleasant smell to it, and I noticed that it lingered during the entire day --</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try these.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I came home from work and found my Influenster box.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I knew the smell was going to be on point, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used Herbal Essences products in quite awhile, so I was excited to check it out again.  </li>
            <li> So when I got the chance to try this product, I was so excited.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to conditioners, but I did love this one.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it didnt leave my hair oily at all but just left a nice shine and smell!</li>
            <li> Currently, it&#x27;s not that humid, so I can&#x27;t test the frizz-free qualities, but the smell is really nice!</li>
            <li> I usually use Biolage products for my hair, so when I saw that it was Herbal Essences, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be impressed.</li>
            <li> so the oil was what I was most interested in.</li>
            <li> So I tell them about the product and they are excited to know it is not $$$$.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It rinses cleanly and I could tell that my hair was already softer.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to wash my hair twice with shampoo to get the clean hair feeling</li>
            <li> It rinses cleanly and I could tell that my hair was already softer.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathered up well and made my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> I was the lucky recipient of a free sample of this from Influenster.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not use herbal essences products, but these smelled so amazing</li>
            <li> The weight flows smoothly, has a fresh tropical scent that lasts, and rinses out cleanly.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to try these products</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, leaves hair soft</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and the conditioner makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend these products to both men and woman looking to smooth or calm uncontrollable hair.</li>
            <li> My hair today feels silky soft, looks shiny and voluminous, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and my hair is so soft and sleek.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair, bright red, so my ends are a bit damaged</li>
            <li> and I really focus on the ends of my hair since those are what are the most damaged.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good product</li>
            <li> I love the smell (of which, I am really picky)</li>
            <li> The scent of the elixir was light, fresh and not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair, I think this might be better for someone with straight oily hair.</li>
            <li> so I could get the full effect.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was my favorite, since it seemed to make my hair much smoother while I was in the shower.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, manageable and shiny with a nice scent.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as sweet as one would think.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up really nice and the conditioner leaves my hair feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> (I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes, but I was actually surprised by how much I love it!)</li>
            <li> The day after my first application my hair felt incredibly soft and healthy but I had to deal with the flyaways and static that I get from sulfate shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use a smaller amount and my hair was smooth and easy to comb out.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> With this particular combo of products, I felt like I needed to wash my hair a lot more often because it made my hair feel oily after just a day or two.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair silky smooth and leaves a nice lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I knew that I would be nothing short of pleased just as I am with most Herbal Essence products.</li>
            <li> I was lucky and received these products to try from Influenster.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make your hair super shiny, which was another plus for me.  </li>
            <li> Overall, quite satisfied with all three products :)</li>
            <li> All in all, I love it, and I will definitely be buying more once this set runs out.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive this product from Influenster to try.</li>
            <li> It meshed well with any perfume I set to it, and was a fresh, yet interesting, slightly unusual scent.</li>
            <li> The dry oil spray is great on my 3b curls, really locks in moisture and gives it shine!</li>
            <li> I received this starter kit FREE to test and review thanks to Influenster!</li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair feeling smooth and really shiny!</li>
            <li> The oil elixir is my new favorite product.  </li>
            <li> I am thoroughly satisfied with these products and have found a new shampoo and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> The scent is absolutely amazing; totally invigorating, clean, and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s easy to use too much.</li>
            <li> I used to use Herbal Essence products a long time ago and recently came in possession of the updated version and it was great!</li>
            <li> and it does a great job of taming the mess.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair shiny and super soft :)</li>
            <li> but I let it air dry after using these products and it stayed nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair is not thin, but it is fine, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I have very damaged, frizzy, fine hair</li>
            <li> Very fun to try new products!!</li>
            <li> conditioner helps a bit, but it doesn’t really calm my hair down….and</li>
            <li> It kept my curls calm without making my hair look oily.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is alright, did not detangle as much as I had hoped it would and didn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth as I wanted.</li>
            <li> After only a week of use, my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I received the whole system as a free sample to test and review.</li>
            <li> It actually washed all of the chlorine smell out of my hair &amp; smelled amazing all day.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t for me, but this would be a great product for someone with thicker hair than mine, and someone not overwhelmed by a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> Received a complimentary kit from Influensters.  </li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster to test and review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this bundle complimentary from Voxfox.</li>
            <li> The oil elixir is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I received this starter kit complimentary from influenster for review.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d need one with more conditioning action.</li>
            <li> And if you had straight or wavy or thick hair this would probably be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I used the products every day for a week, my hair is soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and shiny my hair was after using it.  </li>
            <li> I would not purchase the shampoo or conditioner but the oil is worth</li>
            <li> Even though I really liked how my hair smelled, I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to dye my hair more frequently, had 2 children, etc.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner seemed to work well, but considering I rarely &amp;#34;style&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I felt it was kind of necessary to rinse and repeat with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I really love the serum it made my hair really soft after I straightened.</li>
            <li> I received this kit complimentary from Influenster to review.</li>
            <li> I received these complimentary products from Influenster and Voxbox.</li>
            <li> I also really liked the oil as it left my hair feeling nourished and shiny.</li>
            <li> I received this as a complimentary gift.</li>
            <li> Third, the conditioner was ok, nothing to be excited about.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily AT ALL and did not leave an oily residue on my fingers afterwards and my hair sucked it right up.</li>
            <li> just right..</li>
            <li> This system is all right.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does clean my hair very well</li>
            <li> A good thing for me as I do not enjoy sweet scents and prefer to smell my perfume rather than hair product.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, super straight hair, it naturally tangles very easily, but this trio left my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The static cling that normally happens with blow drying is gone and it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li> My natural hair was so easy to comb through after conditioning</li>
            <li> Love how clean my hair feels after I shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t tend to dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Herbal Essences shampoos for awhile now, so I didn&#x27;t expect to be able to tell much difference in the washing process, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this trio.</li>
            <li> it felt very soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try out these new hair products</li>
            <li> The first thing that I did when I got the product was to smell it</li>
            <li> When I used the shampoo and conditioner it made my hair really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> it is still smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> first time I used this product, I tried all three items together.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about these products was the smell.  </li>
            <li> but I was thrown off by the amount of lather I got upon my first use.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner was creamy and had the same lovely smell.</li>
            <li> I use the oil elixir every night on the ends of my hair since i have got it and it has made it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> so I have been trying so many different shampoos, conditioners and moisturizers</li>
            <li> As part of the Influenster community, I received a free sample kit of the Herbal Essence Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Collection.</li>
            <li> I received the wild naturals rejuvenating starter kit free through Influenster for trial and review.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was creamy and had the same lovely smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and will be purchasing in the future.  </li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> so this did work pretty well when I straightened my hair</li>
            <li> Overall, I was pleased.</li>
            <li> First thing I had to do was smell it.  </li>
            <li> With all of them working together my hair has definitely had more moisture.</li>
            <li> It gave me soft , smooth,  hair that was not tangled.  </li>
            <li> But I have been using this shampoo, conditioner, and oil elixir trio for about a month now and have really seen a difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> It made my hair so soft and smooth, even with the heat torture my hair was getting.  </li>
            <li> My favorite item is definitely the oil, it makes my hair so shiny.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them all a few times now and really loved the shampoo.</li>
            <li> it left my hair super smooth with some shine to it also.</li>
            <li> To begin, I was lucky enough to receive a sample of this product line to test and review for FREE in a Vox Box from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, the shampoo is clear and has a light, soft later.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, the shampoo is clear and has a light, soft later.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be very soft and full of bounce and body.</li>
            <li> This is clearly a quality product, so I would recommend the product but not someone with straight hair or light wavy texture.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was light and left hair fresh and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> After I blow dried it, my hair was silky smooth and basically frizz free!</li>
            <li> Using the oil afterwards helped my hair be a little more soft, though I would have preferred more of a shine.</li>
            <li> in all, it was a positive experience</li>
            <li> First of all the shampoo and conditioner really stink, like grapefruit which im not a fan of.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I used two pumps, and it was too much.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a kinky curly hair &amp; it left my hair feeling really clean &amp; strong</li>
            <li> My favorite is the oil, it left my hair feeling healthy without the look or feel of some other oil products.</li>
            <li> usually only wash my hair about 2 times a week as my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is reguvenation line, so I think is better suited for dry and processed hair.</li>
            <li> It was a free trial and i&#x27;m defiently interested in purchasing in the future</li>
            <li> The oil leaves my hair feeling super soft, however, I have wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> ; Purely for the sake of having my hair smell as though it had been kissed by the goddess of nature, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I use the oil elixir when I blow dry my hair as well, it leaves my hair soft and manageable and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li> It was nice to see that the shampoo did not leave my naturally curly hair brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> I make sure to apply it each time I blow dry and style my hair now!</li>
            <li> The conditioner conditioner was great, I only had to use a little bit</li>
            <li> I also put the elixer on my hair and it helped keep my hair from getting really frizzy.</li>
            <li> , I used the shampoo and conditioner together for one week straight.</li>
            <li> ,This is a must buy and i highly recommend!</li>
            <li> All the products are worth purchase and completely rejuvenate your hair.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t care much for the elixir.</li>
            <li> so I really had to work the shampoo through my hair.</li>
            <li> However, I do really like the oil elixir itself.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t strip much of my color like I was worried about, which was a plus.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> and it covered my whole head.</li>
            <li> However, my hair really did feel softer and smoother after using it.</li>
            <li> I still really like the conditioner and oil elixir.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use it because I don&#x27;t really like to use products in my hair after washing and didn&#x27;t want my hair to feel oily.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of the products, too, so did my husband.</li>
            <li> I recently got this to try for free thru influenster</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Collection, complimentary of Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li> I received travel-sized samples of the Wild Naturals Rejuvenating shampoo, conditioner &amp; oil elixir complimentary through Influenster.</li>
            <li> : nothing really here&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really do too much to help control frizziness.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t bother me too much though.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Collection Bundle Kit through Influenster VOXBOX about a month ago to review.</li>
            <li> think this combo is good for people with hair not as thick as mine, because I’ve tried the combo three times and each time it didn’t work out too well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; my hair (other than a top knot) I didn&#x27;t notice a large difference in the way it corrected my damaged ends.</li>
            <li> I did find that it was a bit more gentle than other shampoos.</li>
            <li> The oil elixir helped tame frizz too, and it gave my hair a nice finish after using the gym blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathered really well, and left my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> In addition, my hair had a lot of static with this shampoo and conditioner, which I noticed was mentioned in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shampoo left my hair clean</li>
            <li> and I actually felt as though my hair was clean.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both used the shampoo and conditioner (though he&#x27;ll allow me to use whatever on his hair in the shower...and as long as it cleans, he&#x27;s fine)</li>
            <li> The conditioner I did not need much of though a little went a long way for me which was nice!</li>
            <li> so I could determine which of them makes the biggest difference, but as long as I can duplicate the results, I&#x27;m completely comfortable with having to buy all three of them.</li>
            <li> I did have to use a little more conditioner than usual to get a full moisturizing, but my hair felt very clean after the washing and very smooth as it dried.</li>
            <li> I try to stick with a &#x27;less is more&#x27; approach with conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Gave a decent rating for the oil.</li>
            <li> The sample size for the shampoo and conditioner was a generous 3+ oz, enough for a few washes and to get a good idea of the quality of the products.  </li>
            <li> you know there’s a decent amount of damage to it…  </li>
            <li> While I will definitely be looking for larger bottles of the shampoo and conditioner, the oil elixir is my favorite part of this kit.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is very rich, but rinsed out well and didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> Although, the product design was similar to the current Herbal Essences products, the new white bottle with bright colors is a little more inviting.</li>
            <li> but I saw that isopropyl myristate was high up on the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> For the scent of this collection alone I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Definitely high on my list of products.</li>
            <li> This products not only left my hair smelling good all day but it also left it soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I had to use much more of this conditioner than I use of other brands and when I rinsed, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair with that soft, just conditioned feeling.  </li>
            <li> My natural curls where so defined!!</li>
            <li> I normally use something a little more high end, so I was hesitate to test this product.</li>
            <li> This system smelled a little weird, kind of plastic-y to me after rinsing, but my fiance loved it.</li>
            <li> Left my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> but i so happy i was wrong.</li>
            <li> My hair is very shiny and silky using the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Collection.</li>
            <li> As I would wash my hair the shampoo felt gentle, not harsh.</li>
            <li> definitely think it is worth a try</li>
            <li> I was able to use the shampoo and conditioner a few times since I received the products.</li>
            <li> : I have semi-natural hair so while everything was great while wet, when my hair dried it wasn&#x27;t as soft as I had</li>
            <li> Over all I would get the shampoo and conditioner for normal hair.</li>
            <li> and I was able to really stretch the conditioner which usually i burn through</li>
            <li> It has helped my hair look amazing for the past week that I have had it!</li>
            <li> The shampoo again was too harsh in my opinion for fine, thin or color treated hair, but all of the other products in this kit worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> and my hair is still continuing to fall out, in addition to all of those nice little one and two inch pieces that are growing back.</li>
            <li> Its my new fav shampoo and cond.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the conditioner weighs my hair down quite a bit (I have wavy/curly hair and the conditioner kind of takes away my hair&#x27;s natural bounce).</li>
            <li> The smell was also amazing and once my hair dried the scent was still present.</li>
            <li> This whole set made my hair feel smooth, when I was done with the wash it didn&#x27;t feel harsh on my hair</li>
            <li> With my wavy hair, I couldn&#x27;t really tell that it was doing much, but on the second day of use I decided to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> I put a lot of the conditioner in my hair and it made it very soft.</li>
            <li> First, I put it all over my hair and the next day my hair looked and felt a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> And they ACTUALLY for the first time, made my hair soft.</li>
            <li> The conditioner left my hair feeling silky and healthy not weighted down.</li>
            <li> After that, I tried smoothing it on the ends after my shower, and I left my hair looked and felt better than it had been previously.  </li>
            <li> I had a few fly-aways at the top of my head, so I applied a tiny drop in my hands and rubbed them together, then lightly went over the crown of my head and smoothed them down.  </li>
            <li> the elixir, I love that you only need a little bit</li>
            <li> It has a very sweet smell, but not overwhelming ,</li>
            <li> These products have a slight floral and clean scent, and the scent lingers in your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the conditioner and oil did nothing for my hair as far as providing moisture.</li>
            <li> My hair felt really soft after i washed it</li>
            <li> I like the fact that they are natural products.</li>
            <li> I received herbal essences wild naturals from Influenster</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for those individuals with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves it really soft, however, I have wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> Second, I didn&#x27;t feel like the shampoo lathered very well.</li>
            <li> and it leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have soft spot for herbal essences because of their hello hydration line.</li>
            <li> With the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals that was not the case.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft, a mom tried to swaddle her newborn baby in it.</li>
            <li> So, moving forward from there, I use the shampoo, and it is soft.</li>
            <li> Again, soft; making my hair feel like cotton.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The packaging wouldn&#x27;t catch my eye in the store and honestly, I was confused why the &amp;#34;cassia&amp;#34; berry looked like a fig (it turns out I was thinking of the cassis berry).</li>
            <li> If your hair has small breaks at the ends or has fly-aways I think it is a great product to tame the craziness!</li>
            <li> I used the Oil elixir after towel drying my hair first - the instructions say it can go on damp or dry hair - and</li>
            <li> It still felt pretty dry.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s worth a try to use, and there&#x27;s no real drawbacks to using this collection!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this if anyone is looking for new products!</li>
            <li> The shampoo was nothing special, it even felt a little drying.</li>
            <li> My main concern is they contain sulfate which is known to do further damage to hair.</li>
            <li> I love it and Ill most likely go out and buy it for myself after this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been playing the shampoo roulette wheel, one will work good for a while, then my hair feels greasy, so I switch, but it always seems at the end of the day, I feel like a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> gas a nice soft and subtle smell that actually lasts (washed and conditioned my hair as well as used the oil last night,</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil seemed to calm the frizziness of my hair down as well even after the humidity hit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for my dry armpit length hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very moisturizing so there is no need to worry about it stripping or leaving for hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Usually, shampoos that cleanse or strip away excess oils really well tend to leave my hair drier than I&#x27;d like, and that&#x27;s exactly what happened with this</li>
            <li> I am mystified by the product name since I have wild natural hair that needs to be rejuvenated regularly.</li>
            <li> products are such a personal preference, so would I recommended it based on my outcomes - absolutely, and I have.</li>
            <li> The conditioner did not have a thick consistency and after washing out the shampoo my hair was already untangled so it was an easy rinse.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much, although i used slightly more because my hair is so long, it&#x27;s half way down my back.</li>
            <li> My hair was smooth, I could run my fingers through it and it wasn&#x27;t a giant matted mess like before!</li>
            <li> half the bottle of conditioner to get enough coverage on my hair, more conditioner than expected.</li>
            <li> The conditioner made my hair silky and soft but only while it was in my hair.</li>
            <li> It coated my hair well and left if soft once I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from herbal essences because I have not been a big fan of their products in the past.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and at the next washing I can&#x27;t tell my hair had anything in it at all.</li>
            <li> While I usually love scents with fig, I was not entirely happy with this scent.</li>
            <li> think that this shampoo and conditioner is okay, but not great.</li>
            <li> Using the shampoo, I noticed that it didn&#x27;t really lather like other shampoos usually do, but it seemed to clean just as well.</li>
            <li> After the shampoo leaving my hair so dry I really needed the H.E. hair oil to bring back the softness to my hair, which it did.</li>
            <li> and so this should be able to help those of you with thick and dry hair!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> have a few things going on with my hair right now.</li>
            <li> I normally have dry, brittle, and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I am currently in the middle of transitioning my hair from relaxed to natural</li>
            <li> I expected my hair to smell good afterwards (because, duh, Herbal Essences), but I also figured that it would just be slightly covering up the chlorine smell.</li>
            <li> After only shampooing I felt a major difference.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair gets big and frizzy if I don&#x27;t blow dry it</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was just my particular hair type (I&#x27;m African American with 4c hair), but my hair was dry again before I even got halfway through my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, long, and brown.</li>
            <li> I live in a VERY dry state and my hair is always lacking moisture, I feel like.</li>
            <li> I am also glad it tamed my very thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> Lather (which really doesn&#x27;t do anything other than psychologically make us think it&#x27;s working), citrus scent (while it is not overly citrusy, I am not a big fan of citrus)&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> Usually, it feels like a weight on my head when its wet, but as soon as it lathered up, it felt light and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Personally, for me and my fine, color treated hair, I found the shampoo to be a bit harsh as it did its job a little too well.</li>
            <li> but I certainly would not recommend it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length, thick thick hair, so smoothing was nice, especially after winter basically zapped all the moisture from my hair.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very excited to try this</li>
            <li> The only thing is that i feel like the oil doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> The are identical and since I am getting older I have trouble reading the bottle to differentiate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat hard to use and I ruined one of my shirts when trying it the first time</li>
            <li> I styled my hair as I usually do with the straightening iron and my hair was really bouncy and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is generally very oily, so I usually use two shampoos at one washing to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About me, I have long (mid-back length) hair, that is dyed blonde.</li>
            <li> Anyone with long, blonde hair knows that&#x27;s an accomplishment in its&#x27; self.</li>
            <li> then I dried and styled my hair like normal.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way my hair feels after using them, They don&#x27;t leave my hair oily and heavy feeling like other products I&#x27;ve used for my frizzy, thick hair.</li>
            <li> It made my thick, frizzy, curly hair super soft and manageable (which very few products can do).</li>
            <li> My hair is usually dry after it I wash it and even 12 hours later after the products were used on my hair my</li>
            <li> I may rotate this product into my routine every once in awhile when my hair feels dry, but otherwise, this is not something I would use as my daily products.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo stripped all the oil off my hair and made it feel extremely dry and coarse.</li>
            <li> My hair was very soft when it dried, so that was also a plus.</li>
            <li> To start, I will say that I only wash my hair every other day, not daily.</li>
            <li> The clear shampoo lathers well, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I got this free to review and while I was skeptical, after one use, I am a fan.</li>
            <li> I got this free to review and while I was skeptical, after one use, I am a fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see if they have a deep conditioner in this collection.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair</li>
            <li> The only minus is that there was no sustaining moisture when my hair dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel that isn&#x27;t for my hair type, which is straight and thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also been very dry where I live due to the extreme weather conditions.</li>
            <li> It definitely conditions and brings your hair back to life without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I am really loyal to my other shampoo, so I am hard on other hair product.</li>
            <li> I pay $30+ for a similar hair oil which gives the same results as this less than $10 product.</li>
            <li> Once my hair was dry, (whether blown out or naturally air dried)</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying I used to use Herbal Essence shampoo and conditioner a long long time (like 10 years ago!)</li>
            <li> Right then and there, the heavens parted as a cherub descended and handed me a bouquet of flowers and the secret to eternal life.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural curly/frizzy and the trio used together helped tame the frizz and my curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, for the Elixir, I used this product for about three weeks too, on a daily to every other day basis, just when I needed it.</li>
            <li> Only person id recommend the shampoo to is people who have extremely oily hair because this shampoo will definately remove all oil from your hair.</li>
            <li> but it did seem that different than any other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have very long color damaged hair, it&#x27;s dry and brittle aND it&#x27;s a fight just to comb it.</li>
            <li> Used it after a blow dry and kept my hair sleek for 2 days.</li>
            <li> Also this shampoo didn&#x27;t make my scalp dry</li>
            <li> and i do have a dry scalp</li>
            <li> It feels like dry oil like it doesn&#x27;t give you a greasy feeling on your hands after you apply it</li>
            <li> Once i rinsed it off my hair still felt dry.</li>
            <li> Over time it has started to dry out and become brittle and thinned.</li>
            <li> so I struggle to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or frizzy.</li>
            <li> I used it both when my hair was damp and dry.</li>
            <li> it made it feel a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I have curly dry frizzy hair</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s sometimes difficult to deal with, but using this collection resulted in my hair being a little more manageable, and was a marked improvement from the hair products I usually use.</li>
            <li> When I tryed it my hair was soft and It don&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy like other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> , usually you only get enough for one go and can&#x27;t truly judge based off that</li>
            <li> The only down side with this product is my hair had absolutely NO volume.</li>
            <li> But I could only use it for 2 days since my hair is so long and thick which isn&#x27;t really enough time for me to tell a difference.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair like other shampoos</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I received this free product</li>
            <li> but alas, while I have no real problems with the shampoo and conditioner, I really like the Oil Elixir.</li>
            <li> I then tried a few tiny drops of the oil elixer.</li>
            <li> The lightweight rejuvenating oil didn&#x27;t give my hair the sheen I expected.</li>
            <li> I then tried a few tiny drops of the oil elixer.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was thicker than expected, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> SLS is the 2nd ingredient and it&#x27;s always harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> After using the elixir my hair which is normally thick and wild was tamed and luscious.</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair are really dry and all other oil treatments I&#x27;ve tried have just weighed it down and looked greasy.</li>
            <li> me, my hair is thick and dry, and my hair is falling out constantly.</li>
            <li> for the conditioner, I used this product for about three weeks, once every other day as well.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I used approx.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I don’t think this combination works for me, but it might for other people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I knew that it dries my hair out from having seen that ingredient in other products.</li>
            <li> Look forward to trying the other scents soon.</li>
            <li> Only a small, small amount is necessary.</li>
            <li> This small bundled arrived just before we left on vacation.  </li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner every other day and the oil every day.</li>
            <li> and I only needed to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Detangling was very minimal.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo for about three weeks, once every other day (so, every 2 days), and was not thrilled with the overall results.</li>
            <li> hair can get pretty crazy with tangles when it&#x27;s wet but with just using the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> The only thing I would even have a slight complaint about is that when I am in the shower I can not tell the shampoo bottle from the conditioner bottle.  </li>
            <li> so no need to worry about your hair being weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Just let my hair down</li>
            <li> I blow-dried my hair with a round brush, and flat ironed like usual.  </li>
            <li> It did dry my hair out a bit, but all shampoo usually does that.  </li>
            <li> (My hair is black, but brown in the sun) and fritzy.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair</li>
            <li> I recently had some hair work done, and after lifting it a few shades, it needed some serious repair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the very heavy scent was too overpowering for me, and it weighed my fine, thin hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair.</li>
            <li> but I have thick curly hair and my hair looked dry after using just these products.</li>
            <li> The oil elixir dried quickly, not sticky or over oiled.</li>
            <li> This combo is NOT sulfate-free and I haven&#x27;t used a product containing sulfates in a little over two years.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about all that I like even a little.</li>
            <li> I’ve used the conditioner separately (without shampooing my hair), a little amount with shampoo and, a lot with shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> and I was not let down!</li>
            <li> The conditioner did not do much for my hair, a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> And the conditioner was not overly heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> It too rinsed out well and didnt leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy the way some moisturizing conditioners do.</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo and conditioner once and the oil elixir everyday.</li>
            <li> It just laid limp on my head.</li>
            <li> It too rinsed out well and didnt leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy the way some moisturizing conditioners do.</li>
            <li> I put the elixir on my ends after I towel dried my hair.</li>
            <li> so i didn&#x27;t need to go so heavy with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> After I washed my hair with the rejuvenating shampoo and conditioner, I worked  it into my ends and blow dried it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t thick or nourishing enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> but that is typical for me because I have very thick long hair</li>
            <li> Not recommended for people with thick curly hair unless you use other products in conjunction.</li>
            <li> Its not a strong smell</li>
            <li> This is after a few days of blow drying in the morning, after which I throw a small drop of the oil through the ends.</li>
            <li> have very thick and dry hair</li>
            <li> I have to say I was skeptical, as I put my hair through a lot of treatments over the last few years.</li>
            <li> It leaves very little  residue</li>
            <li> After towel drying, I applied a small amount of the oil elixir to my ends.  </li>
            <li> that was the a small factor but still a factor.</li>
            <li> I replaced all of my usual hair products with these 3</li>
            <li> ; so I don&#x27;t usually use shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It’s past my shoulders, so</li>
            <li> I will be buying them when these small sizes run out.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how to describe it,</li>
            <li> My hair at the end of the week felt and looked very heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> In fact, I had a hard time combing through my hair after using these products.  </li>
            <li> It also, did NOT break me out, which seems to be a common problem with</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and has still retained that thickness despite the fact that it seems like a lot has fallen out.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair that is really, really thick.</li>
            <li> Again not a huge fan of the scent, but have smelled worse.</li>
            <li> I have THICK, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick and curly hair</li>
            <li> None of the products leave my hair heavy or greasey!!</li>

            <li> I received the bundle for free through Influenster. The first thing that I did when I got the product was to smell it and I absolutely loved the smell. When I used the shampoo and conditioner it made my hair really soft and smooth. I also put the elixer on my hair and it helped keep my hair from getting really frizzy. My hair is usually dry after it I wash it and even 12 hours later after the products were used on my hair my it is still smooth and soft. I love this product and I think it smells really good. I have only used the products once but I will probably use the elixer a couple days a week and I really focus on the ends of my hair since those are what are the most damaged. I definitely recommend this item to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Received a complimentary kit from Influensters.  liked it very much!  The shampoo was light and left hair fresh and bouncy.  And the conditioner was not overly heavy or greasy.  Both, as well as the oil, had a lovely fragrance.  Would I buy it again?  Yes.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from Influenster. Here is my honest opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few things going on with my hair right now. I am 7 months postpartum and my hair is still continuing to fall out, in addition to all of those nice little one and two inch pieces that are growing back. My hair is thick and has still retained that thickness despite the fact that it seems like a lot has fallen out. It&#x27;s also been very dry where I live due to the extreme weather conditions. Needless to say, I was very excited to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this product, I tried all three items together. The shampoo and conditioner do smell nice. I used the Oil elixir after towel drying my hair first - the instructions say it can go on damp or dry hair - and then I dried and styled my hair like normal. Later that day, some I see on a semi-regular basis actually asked me if I had just gotten my hair cut (I haven&#x27;t had a hair cut since November and it&#x27;s now March!) My hair felt good and not at all oily or over-moisturized, like some moisturizing shampoos tend to do to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side though, I used the shampoo and conditioner together for one week straight. I use the Oil Elixir only twice in that time frame. My hair at the end of the week felt and looked very heavy and oily. I think this product initially helped with the dryness my hair was experiencing from the winter, but otherwise, I probably should have stopped after two uses. I may rotate this product into my routine every once in awhile when my hair feels dry, but otherwise, this is not something I would use as my daily products.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about these products was the smell.  The smell is absolutely amazing but I was thrown off by the amount of lather I got upon my first use.  This combo is NOT sulfate-free and I haven&#x27;t used a product containing sulfates in a little over two years.  I decided to give it a chance anyways and continued to use the products.  The day after my first application my hair felt incredibly soft and healthy but I had to deal with the flyaways and static that I get from sulfate shampoos.  I ended up throwing my hair up and leaving it that way the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually only wash my hair about 2 times a week as my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily very quickly.  With this particular combo of products, I felt like I needed to wash my hair a lot more often because it made my hair feel oily after just a day or two.  I also had to continue to deal with the static and flyaways throughout my use of these products.  All in all, I think this would be a great combination of products to use maybe once a month as more of a deep conditioning/repairing type product but I certainly would not recommend it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> LOVE...........THE SMELL!!! Shampoo left my hair clean</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;About me, my hair is thick and dry, and my hair is falling out constantly. this product is amazing, my hair feels softer and stronger (not as much is falling out). I love the smell and the way my hair feels after using them, They don&#x27;t leave my hair oily and heavy feeling like other products I&#x27;ve used for my frizzy, thick hair. I use the oil elixir when I blow dry my hair as well, it leaves my hair soft and manageable and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li> I received these products through Influenster. It smells amazing, leaves hair soft but I have thick curly hair and my hair looked dry after using just these products. I tried it twice with the same results. I had to use an additional leave in treatment and conditioner to make my hair look healthy. Not recommended for people with thick curly hair unless you use other products in conjunction.</li>
            <li> i recieved a free sample.from influenster to try out and honestly i loved it. It smelled amazinggg!! it left my hair super smooth with some shine to it also. this is a product i will definitely pick up next time at the store.</li>
            <li> I received these products as a sample in an Influenster Vox Box. I would like to start off by saying that this product smells GREAT! My hair smelled amazing all day. I also really liked the shampoo. It produced a good lather and my hair felt clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the conditioner and oil did nothing for my hair as far as providing moisture. Perhaps it was just my particular hair type (I&#x27;m African American with 4c hair), but my hair was dry again before I even got halfway through my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think it is worth a try and I would purchase the shampoo. Just keep in mind that every product doesn&#x27;t work for everybody. YMMV.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Didn&#x27;t really do much for my dry armpit length hair. After shampooing my hair felt coated. The conditioner made my hair feel somewhat better. The oil spray was a total miss. The conditioner is nice as a cowash. That&#x27;s about all that I like even a little.</li>
            <li> I received this kit from Influenster to try. Overall, I like the products. The scents are nice but not overbearing. I felt like they leave my hair in a state of being well hydrated and moisturized. I have very thick, curly hair so some prodcuts feel like they don&#x27;t rinse out well. I feel like the shampoo and conditioner rinse out well. I like the oil elixer and it leaves a nice sheen and feel to my hair. However, it&#x27;s easy to use too much.</li>
            <li> I got this free to review and while I was skeptical, after one use, I am a fan. It smells amazing, the shampoo is clear and has a light, soft later. It rinses cleanly and I could tell that my hair was already softer. The conditioner was creamy and had the same lovely smell. It too rinsed out well and didnt leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy the way some moisturizing conditioners do. I then tried a few tiny drops of the oil elixer. Man, that stuff is great! Its cold and windy here today but my bleach blond hair does not look or feel frizzy or dry.</li>
            <li> I received this through influencer to try. Smells good, but did not mesh with my hair type the best. Gave a decent rating for the oil. Used it after a blow dry and kept my hair sleek for 2 days. Probably wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy, will be sticking to my redken and pureology for the color treated aspect, but will keep on hand for emergencies.</li>
            <li> I did get this from Influenster to try out and reivew. I have used the shampoo and conditioner once and the oil elixir everyday. My hair felt really soft after i washed it and it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair like other shampoos tend to do which causes more breakage. Also this shampoo didn&#x27;t make my scalp dry and i do have a dry scalp and i used the neutrogena t gel and it makes my scalp so white and flakey and this shampoo didn&#x27;t do that. I use the oil elixir every night on the ends of my hair since i have got it and it has made it smooth and soft. It doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy and i use about 2 or 3 pumps. The only thing is that i feel like the oil doesn&#x27;t last that long. It feels like dry oil like it doesn&#x27;t give you a greasy feeling on your hands after you apply it and it also smells really good. The scent does linger in your hair. Overall it is a good product but i will have to test it out more to see if it makes a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I received this set from influenster free to try. I normally use something a little more high end, so I was hesitate to test this product. However, I am so glad I did. I pay $30+ for a similar hair oil which gives the same results as this less than $10 product. The oil elixir dried quickly, not sticky or over oiled. It left my hair feeling conditioned and rejuvenated. It was my favorite of the three products. The shampoo and conditioner are nice and smell great. I like the fact that they are natural products.</li>
            <li> I received this product free to test and review from Influenster! Let me begin by saying I used to use Herbal Essence shampoo and conditioner a long long time (like 10 years ago!) But stopped using the product cause it was drying my hair out and causing my scalp to flake up. Although I loved the smell of their products, I had to give it up. I was a little skeptical when I received this free product but I figured what the heck, I&#x27;ll  give it a try! I am trying impressed! I am currently in the middle of transitioning my hair from relaxed to natural so I have been trying so many different shampoos, conditioners and moisturizers my hair will love and thsee products are a keeper. My natural hair was so easy to comb through after conditioning (I did let it sit my hair for 10mins before rinsing out)...I&#x27;m curious to see if they have a deep conditioner in this collection. My natural curls where so defined!! My hair literally felt rejuvenated, after 3 days, my hair still feels like is has moisture in it and no flaky scalp. The oil elixir is also great!!! It&#x27;s not oily AT ALL and did not leave an oily residue on my fingers afterwards and my hair sucked it right up. When I touch my hair afterwards, I did not have oily fingers either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S...the smell is also still great!</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample from influencer to review. This is a great product. The smell is amazing and the conditioner makes my hair so soft. The shampoo works wonderfully too. The oil elixir was a nice add to the group makes my hair silky smooth and leaves a nice lasting fragrance. I would highly recommend these products they are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I received this bundle from Influenster free for product testing.  I found the shampoo and creme rinse rejuvinating.  The weight flows smoothly, has a fresh tropical scent that lasts, and rinses out cleanly.  I have colored hair so I can add that it did not strip or discolor my hair.  My only challenge was that the pump on the oil did not work. The oil was great for smoothing my winter friz so once the pump is redesigned it will be great.  Perhaps my bottle was a fluke.</li>
            <li> I got this bundle complimentary from Voxfox. These made my hair feel very soft and smell so good! My favorite one is the oil elixr. Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> To begin, I was lucky enough to receive a sample of this product line to test and review for FREE in a Vox Box from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me, I have long (mid-back length) hair, that is dyed blonde. My hair is not thin, but it is fine, if that makes sense. I used the shampoo for about three weeks, once every other day (so, every 2 days), and was not thrilled with the overall results. Personally, for me and my fine, color treated hair, I found the shampoo to be a bit harsh as it did its job a little too well. Usually, shampoos that cleanse or strip away excess oils really well tend to leave my hair drier than I&#x27;d like, and that&#x27;s exactly what happened with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the conditioner, I used this product for about three weeks, once every other day as well. Focusing on my ends, I had no problem running my fingers through my hair while washing, as this conditioner made for a great detangler in the shower! It rinsed cleaned, and made combing my hair post shower a breeze! Anyone with long, blonde hair knows that&#x27;s an accomplishment in its&#x27; self. Once my hair was dry, (whether blown out or naturally air dried) it felt very soft, and smooth. The only down side with this product is my hair had absolutely NO volume. It just laid limp on my head. So, while I would recommend this conditioner, I would also suggest using a volumizing spray while styling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, for the Elixir, I used this product for about three weeks too, on a daily to every other day basis, just when I needed it. Focusing on my ends, while avoiding the roots, I found this smoothing serum really helped control my fly aways and hid my split ends. I have pretty nice, healthy hair to begin with, but I also have layers and as mentioned, am color treated. So, when I&#x27;m striving for a chic blow out, I want all of my ends looking as healthy as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend these products to both men and woman looking to smooth or calm uncontrollable hair. The shampoo again was too harsh in my opinion for fine, thin or color treated hair, but all of the other products in this kit worked wonderfully. The scent was pleasant as well, and my Fiance even complimented how nice my hair smelled.</li>
            <li> I received these products to test for free from Influenster. I was really excited to try these. The shampoo and conditioner both smell really lovely and I really liked the way they made my hair feel. However, I am not a big fan of the oil elixir. It&#x27;s somewhat hard to use and I ruined one of my shirts when trying it the first time ):</li>
            <li> Ive receive this product free to test and review and i love it!! it makes my hair feel very smooth and hydrated.Ive been using this for a week now and i noticed a healthy change in my hair. It has a very sweet smell, but not overwhelming , just right.. The shampoo is surprising not drying to the hair.. the oil elixir is my favorite out of all three. it puts the moisture back into my hair without even having to wash it again.  i have no cons about this product,This is a must buy and i highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was sent this bundle free from Influenster. I tried them out last night and I do say, I am very impressed. My hair is natural curly/frizzy and the trio used together helped tame the frizz and my curls. I washed with the shampoo and conditioner and then put in the deep conditioner and let it soak in for about 5 minutes. My hair today feels silky soft, looks shiny and voluminous, and smells amazing. These products have a slight floral and clean scent, and the scent lingers in your hair. Its not a strong smell, it&#x27;s a nice one. I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase this set with my own money, I&#x27;d have to try it out for longer, but for now, I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Tried this for free from influenster. I love this bundle! Smells amazing and my hair is so soft and sleek.</li>
            <li> I received herbal essences wild naturals from Influenster it was a free sample. I thoughtthis product was a set it was not to oily and made my hair smell great.  I would purchase this item at a store or Amazon.  It works great with colored hair and did not make it fade.  I was looking through prices to purchase this product it is cheaper than most shampoos and I think comparable to salon products.  Over all I will be using this from now.</li>
            <li> As part of the Influenster community, I received a free sample kit of the Herbal Essence Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Collection. The sample size for the shampoo and conditioner was a generous 3+ oz, enough for a few washes and to get a good idea of the quality of the products.  Although, the product design was similar to the current Herbal Essences products, the new white bottle with bright colors is a little more inviting. The products all have a light pleasant fruity smell.The clear shampoo lathers well, and a little goes a long way. It was nice to see that the shampoo did not leave my naturally curly hair brittle and dry. On the other hand, I used approx. half the bottle of conditioner to get enough coverage on my hair, more conditioner than expected. The conditioner did not do much for my hair, a little disappointing. The lightweight rejuvenating oil didn&#x27;t give my hair the sheen I expected. This is clearly a quality product, so I would recommend the product but not someone with straight hair or light wavy texture. I would not recommend for those individuals with naturally curly hair. I am mystified by the product name since I have wild natural hair that needs to be rejuvenated regularly.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair that is really, really thick. I have problems finding good conditioners/shampoos because it fritzes easily.&lt;br /&gt;I think this combo is good for people with hair not as thick as mine, because I’ve tried the combo three times and each time it didn’t work out too well.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo kinda blew my hair up. It’s all brown (My hair is black, but brown in the sun) and fritzy.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner helps a bit, but it doesn’t really calm my hair down….and I’ve used the conditioner separately (without shampooing my hair), a little amount with shampoo and, a lot with shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Each time my hair didn’t come out the winner.&lt;br /&gt;The oil elixir smells really good, but it didn’t really act as brilliantly as it promises.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don’t think this combination works for me, but it might for other people.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I got these products free to test and review through Influenster</li>
            <li> I received this complementary from influenster to test out and I absolutely love it. I love the smell (of which, I am really picky) The formula is conditioning and smooth. The oil elixir is by far my favorite. I make sure to apply it each time I blow dry and style my hair now! I have wavy frizzy hair and it does a great job of taming the mess. I would definitely recommend this if anyone is looking for new products!</li>
            <li> I was excited when I came home from work and found my Influenster box. I was equally happy when I realized it was An Herbal Essence product. I have to say that I knew the smell was going to be on point, and I was not disappointed. The shampoo lathered really well, and left my hair feeling clean. Sometimes I have to wash my hair twice with shampoo to get the clean hair feeling I got with only washing my hair once with this product. The conditioner had the same delicious smell, however I did have to use more than I thought I would need to. It would have been better had it had a thicker consistency. I used the oil after towel drying an brushing my hair. I styled my hair as I usually do with the straightening iron and my hair was really bouncy and shiny. I knew that I would be nothing short of pleased just as I am with most Herbal Essence products. I would definitely recommend this product to family an friends. I will be looking out for it in stores so that I can purchase it as well.</li>
            <li> I received this starter kit complimentary from influenster for review.  I haven&#x27;t used Herbal Essences products in quite awhile, so I was excited to check it out again.  In true Herbal Essences style, the shampoo smell is intoxicating!  It lathers up nicely and rinses clean with no problem.  The conditioner, however, is not my favorite.  I have long, wavy hair and I need a good conditioner to keep it in check.  I had to use much more of this conditioner than I use of other brands and when I rinsed, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair with that soft, just conditioned feeling.  After towel drying, I applied a small amount of the oil elixir to my ends.  The scent of the elixir was light, fresh and not overpowering at all.  I blow-dried my hair with a round brush, and flat ironed like usual.  My ends looked healthy, and my hair was shiny.  I had a few fly-aways at the top of my head, so I applied a tiny drop in my hands and rubbed them together, then lightly went over the crown of my head and smoothed them down.  It worked perfectly, and left my hair very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it was a positive experience and I would purchase the shampoo and oil elixir again, but I need to stick to a heavier conditioner.</li>
            <li> All the products are worth purchase and completely rejuvenate your hair.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Influenster and absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> I was lucky and received these products to try from Influenster. I really enjoy all of them. the shampoo and conditioner have a great smell. I feel like the oil has a tad different smell but it&#x27;s still really great. The shampoo lathers up really nice and the conditioner leaves my hair feeling super soft. I use the oil after my hair being in my towel for about 5 minutes. I use a bit more than the instructions say because I have a lot of hair. It leaves it really soft, however, I have wavy/curly hair and I would like it if it controlled frizziness a bit better. That is the only downfall but it really isn&#x27;t a big deal to me. Overall, it is great and I would continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this bundle. I was pleasantly suprised by the great smell i didnt have high expectations for fig but i so happy i was wrong. I used the oil elixir after exiting the shower and had a pleasant reminder of the great smell and the oil wasnt too much that it would leave my hair looking oily. I would strongly recomend this product .</li>
            <li> I received this bundle for free from Influenster to test and review. This did not affect my review in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give this bundle 5 stars out of 5. It&#x27;s a good line of products and it smells amazing. I do not think it was the &amp;#34;correct&amp;#34; bundle for my hair type. I have very damaged, frizzy, fine hair so I&#x27;d need one with more conditioning action. This system does work well though. And if you had straight or wavy or thick hair this would probably be perfect for you. I unfortunately just have difficult hair.</li>
            <li> I received the wild naturals rejuvenating starter kit free through Influenster for trial and review. I used the products every day for a week, my hair is soft and healthy looking. The oil elixir is my new favorite product.  I will recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!! It made my thick, frizzy, curly hair super soft and manageable (which very few products can do). It also smells amazing and maintains its smell even after you get out of the shower. It helped my hair hold its style until I washed it again. (I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes, but I was actually surprised by how much I love it!)</li>
            <li> I got this free to review and while I was skeptical, after one use, I am a fan. It smells amazing, the shampoo is clear and has a light, soft later. It rinses cleanly and I could tell that my hair was already softer. The conditioner was creamy and had the same lovely smell. It too rinsed out well and didnt leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy the way some moisturizing conditioners do. I then tried a few tiny drops of the oil elixer. Man, that stuff is great! Its cold and windy here today but my bleach blond hair does not look or feel frizzy or dry.</li>
            <li> I received this bundle from Influenster to try and review.  I absolutely love it and will be purchasing in the future.  My hair is extremely dry, especially in the winter.  I love the smell to begin with.  It&#x27;s light but not overly fruity.  The shampoo and conditioner didn&#x27;t leave any residue build up and I actually felt as though my hair was clean.  The oil elixir was my favorite item.  I love how soft and shiny my hair was after using it.  I feel as though the damage that I&#x27;ve done to my hair will be repaired with continued use.  I will continue to use these items in the future.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to receive these products for free to test from Influenster! I used the entire system twice, within 4 days of each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was pleasant and fragrant! It makes washing your hair that much more enjoyable! The shampoo lather was nice and the conditioner made my hair feel amazingly silky. I put the elixir on my ends after I towel dried my hair. It didn&#x27;t make my hair oily or anything! After I blow dried it, my hair was silky smooth and basically frizz free! :) I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free to test via influenzter. I used all three products and I&#x27;m only impressed by one. First, I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. I feel like that was the a small factor but still a factor. Second, I didn&#x27;t feel like the shampoo lathered very well. This product is more of a gel than a cream. Third, the conditioner was ok, nothing to be excited about. Fourth, the elixir oil was the best out of all the products. It kept my curls calm without making my hair look oily. I would not purchase the shampoo or conditioner but the oil is worth the purchase of you are looking to purchase one of the 3.</li>
            <li> I received a sample package of this from influenster &amp; I really liked the shampoo. I have natural 4a kinky curly hair &amp; it left my hair feeling really clean &amp; strong (the cassia extract) but without leaving it with that stripped feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner was ok. It did have slip so I was able to detangle very quickly and easily, and my hair was very soft but strong and not overly mushy at all. The only minus is that there was no sustaining moisture when my hair dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care much for the elixir. I read the ingredients beforehand and saw that it had silicones. I&#x27;m not against silicones at all but I saw that isopropyl myristate was high up on the ingredient list. Companies use it in serums so that your hair isn&#x27;t left with that greasy feeling but I knew that it dries my hair out from having seen that ingredient in other products. I decided to try it out anyway because every companies formulation is different. It dried my hair up sooo much and left it tangled. I decided to rinse my hair and deep condition but that did nothing so I had to shampoo &amp; deep condition all over again to get that product off of my hair.</li>
            <li> I got samples of this collection through influenster to try for testing. The products were free and I was so excited to test them for review. The shampoo has a thicker consistency than most I have used. I have thick long hair so I really had to work the shampoo through my hair. The smell of it is amazing and the best part of the shampoo. The conditioner did not have a thick consistency and after washing out the shampoo my hair was already untangled so it was an easy rinse. The smell was also amazing and once my hair dried the scent was still present. After using the elixir my hair which is normally thick and wild was tamed and luscious. For the scent of this collection alone I would highly recommend it. I am also glad it tamed my very thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> I received this set free to try from Influenster. My first impression upon using the shampoo and conditioner was that they smelled great. The shampoo lathered up well and made my hair feel clean. However, the conditioner and elixir just did not work for me. While they weren&#x27;t oily, they didn&#x27;t make my hair softer or smoother. In fact, I had a hard time combing through my hair after using these products.  Even though I really liked how my hair smelled, I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> I got a sample size in the mail from influencers for free and so I can review it. The smell makes me go back to my childhood because my mom loves the shampoo. When I tryed it my hair was soft and It don&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy like other shampoos and conditioners. I love the oil spray the most I&#x27;m always looking for a good oil for my hair and my daughter I just love how good it smell in my hair. And the smell last almost all day.</li>
            <li> I received this from influenster to test and review. I was super excited to try these products but once I did i was very disappointed. First of all the shampoo and conditioner really stink, like grapefruit which im not a fan of. The shampoo stripped all the oil off my hair and made it feel extremely dry and coarse. The conditioner made my hair silky and soft but only while it was in my hair. Once i rinsed it off my hair still felt dry. The hair oil is the only product I absolutely loved!! After the shampoo leaving my hair so dry I really needed the H.E. hair oil to bring back the softness to my hair, which it did. Plus the oil smells really amazing!! I love it and Ill most likely go out and buy it for myself after this bottle is empty. Only person id recommend the shampoo to is people who have extremely oily hair because this shampoo will definately remove all oil from your hair.</li>
            <li> I used to use Herbal Essence products a long time ago and recently came in possession of the updated version and it was great! The smell of the shampoo was so nice in the shower. Definitely high on my list of products.</li>
            <li> I received a sample for free to test and review from Influenster.com. While I usually love scents with fig, I was not entirely happy with this scent. However, I do really like the oil elixir itself. I do feel like it softens the ends of my hair. I have color treated hair, bright red, so my ends are a bit damaged so this did work pretty well when I straightened my hair (Smooths out my fried ends). While I usually only use shampoo/conditioner for color treated hair, it&#x27;s about time for a color refresh so I was able to try this. It didn&#x27;t strip much of my color like I was worried about, which was a plus. Again not a huge fan of the scent, but have smelled worse. My hair was very soft when it dried, so that was also a plus. Overall, I was pleased. Look forward to trying the other scents soon.</li>
            <li> Got this set from Influenster to try out and review it.  First off, it smells wonderful.  The shampoo is great, lathers and rinses really well. The conditioner is alright, did not detangle as much as I had hoped it would and didn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth as I wanted. My favorite is the oil, it left my hair feeling healthy without the look or feel of some other oil products. It didn&#x27;t look greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I received this bundle free from Influenster to test and review. I have to say I was skeptical, as I put my hair through a lot of treatments over the last few years. I&#x27;ve started to dye my hair more frequently, had 2 children, etc. My hair used to be very soft and full of bounce and body. Over time it has started to dry out and become brittle and thinned. This seemed like just another product to me that promised great results. I figured I would give it a try, because...free shampoo and conditioner! I was shocked. After only a week of use, my hair feels amazing. This is after a few days of blow drying in the morning, after which I throw a small drop of the oil through the ends. The static cling that normally happens with blow drying is gone and it&#x27;s super soft. I can&#x27;t believe it. I will definitely be adding it to my list of must-haves in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from Influenster.  It was okay.  It smelled very nice, however I did not feel like my hair was hydrated afterwards.  It still felt pretty dry.  I did like the oil, but again wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;ed... I have curly hair, I think this might be better for someone with straight oily hair.</li>
            <li> Recieved these three products to test and review, I&#x27;ve purchased Herbal Essence  in the past and was very disappointed. However, this product has changed my vowes on the brand. I have very long color damaged hair, it&#x27;s dry and brittle aND it&#x27;s a fight just to comb it. After using these products however my hair feels and smells great! I was able to brush it no problem and it looks fantastic. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this in the future and recommending it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I received these 3 products for free from influenzer to test and review. First thing I had to do was smell it.  I&#x27;m all about scents; the shampoo smelled great! I have really curly hair so I struggle to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or frizzy. This products not only left my hair smelling good all day but it also left it soft and manageable.  The oil was my favorite! Leaves your hair shiny and super soft :)</li>
            <li> I received these products free to test and review! I usually do not use herbal essences products, but these smelled so amazing I couldn&#x27;t wait to try! I replaced all of my usual hair products with these 3 so I could get the full effect. All of these products are great! The shampoo is very moisturizing so there is no need to worry about it stripping or leaving for hair dry and brittle. The conditioner was thicker than expected, which is a plus. It coated my hair well and left if soft once I rinsed it out. The oil is very light so no need to worry about your hair being weighed down.  It also doesn&#x27;t make your hair super shiny, which was another plus for me.  This line is great when you notice your hair is starting to lose life.</li>
            <li> I received this product from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle sizes I received of the products were perfect for traveling! I was able to use the shampoo and conditioner a few times since I received the products. My hair is naturally curly, long, and brown. I have never treated or dyed my hair. All these factors may play into the result of the testing. The scent of the Rejuvenating collection is wonderful! The shampoo and conditioner seemed to work well, but considering I rarely &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; my hair (other than a top knot) I didn&#x27;t notice a large difference in the way it corrected my damaged ends. It did however leave my hair smelling great and feeling soft! I really enjoyed the oil elixir. I used it both when my hair was damp and dry. It&#x27;s great to use on the ends of your hair - steer clear of using it on your roots because you run the risk of making your hair greasy. Only a small, small amount is necessary. I think this sample size will last me awhile. Overall, I would recommend this product - specifically the oil elixir. If your hair has small breaks at the ends or has fly-aways I think it is a great product to tame the craziness!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received this trio as part of an Influenster campaign for free to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I didn&#x27;t receive this in the mail, I probably never would have thought to even try out this brand again. The packaging wouldn&#x27;t catch my eye in the store and honestly, I was confused why the &amp;#34;cassia&amp;#34; berry looked like a fig (it turns out I was thinking of the cassis berry). That being said, I&#x27;m glad I had the opportunity to try these out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathered well but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this on my own because I like to stick with products that don&#x27;t contain sulfates. SLS is the 2nd ingredient and it&#x27;s always harsh on my skin. I really liked the conditioner and oil elixir. Normally my hair gets big and frizzy if I don&#x27;t blow dry it but I let it air dry after using these products and it stayed nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I recently had some hair work done, and after lifting it a few shades, it needed some serious repair. It has been years since I&#x27;ve used herbal essences. I had received this set free, courtesy of Influenster to test and review, thank God! After only shampooing I felt a major difference. My hair was smooth, I could run my fingers through it and it wasn&#x27;t a giant matted mess like before! The conditioner conditioner was great, I only had to use a little bit and it covered my whole head. Even without the oil elixir, I was thrilled. But I just had to try it too. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments today on my hair and I&#x27;m extremely pleased! This is definitely something I will purchase in the future!</li>
            <li> I was given these products to review.&lt;br /&gt;I think these products make a great combination.&lt;br /&gt;However, the oil is too oily and greasy in my hair and it wouldn&#x27;t spread evenly throughout my hair. It just globbed up on the area I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is also damaged but it seemed to work fairly well overall.&lt;br /&gt;The smell and scent is amazing and my friends and family love it as well!</li>
            <li> I received this kit for free in order to try it for Influenster!&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick and dry hair and so this should be able to help those of you with thick and dry hair!&lt;br /&gt;This kit has been AMAZING for my hair. I live in a VERY dry state and my hair is always lacking moisture, I feel like. So when I got the chance to try this product, I was so excited. This product has really been amazing! It has helped my hair look amazing for the past week that I have had it! I do believe the combination of all the products has been the best part of it all. With all of them working together my hair has definitely had more moisture.</li>
            <li> Got this free from influenster love it! The oil works great for styling curly hair!</li>
            <li> I received these products free to test and review, but I was thoroughly pleased. The shampoo smells amazing and lathers up really well. You don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it to lather up. My hair is generally very oily, so I usually use two shampoos at one washing to wash my hair. Not with this shampoo! It was able to thoroughly clean the oil from my hair. I washed my hair twice. I also have issues with shampoos clumping and tangling my hair, this shampoo did neither, and I can&#x27;t wait to go buy more. The conditioner also smelled really good and did not clump and matte my hair. Detangling was very minimal. The oil elixir added additional moisture, but you really only need one pump of it. The first time I used it, I used two pumps, and it was too much. I am thoroughly satisfied with these products and have found a new shampoo and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. These products smell great and clean well!</li>
            <li> Received sample in a vox box. Loved it!! Makes your hair smell so good and it leaves your hair soft. When using the oil elixer my hair was much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to conditioners, but I did love this one. Not only did it have a very nice smell (but not overpowering in smell), it left my hair feeling wonderful after I used it. I do use a lot of heat and dye on my hair, so finding a conditioner that help repair any damage is needed and this conditioner did that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the elixir, I love that you only need a little bit and it does a lot of work!  Great for those damaged ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo, well I&#x27;m &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t usually use shampoo.  It did dry my hair out a bit, but all shampoo usually does that.  I did find that it was a bit more gentle than other shampoos.</li>
            <li> This system is all right. I received the whole system as a free sample to test and review. I am really loyal to my other shampoo, so I am hard on other hair product. This system smelled a little weird, kind of plastic-y to me after rinsing, but my fiance loved it. I felt it was kind of necessary to rinse and repeat with the shampoo. It&#x27;s definitely more about smoothing than cleaning. However, my hair really did feel softer and smoother after using it. I have shoulder-length, thick thick hair, so smoothing was nice, especially after winter basically zapped all the moisture from my hair. Overall, I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it, but I will continue to use my samples until they&#x27;re gone. I would maybe alternate using this shampoo for smoothing and another one for cleansing.</li>
            <li> I received this in a Voxbox from influenster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, course hair. For the most part this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It smelled great!&lt;br /&gt;My hair didnt have that stripped feeling after shampooing&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner washed out without the slimy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The oil smelled great and blended into my hair perfectly&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I have semi-natural hair so while everything was great while wet, when my hair dried it wasn&#x27;t as soft as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all its a nice product but its not what im looking for with my hair type.</li>
            <li> I got this product to try free from Influenster, and love it! I normally have dry, brittle, and frizzy hair. This solved all those problems in three days. I love how my hair smells and feels. I have never been happier. I would recommend it to anyone! I will be buying this again for sure!</li>
            <li> I got this product sent to me from Influenster to test and rate. I love the smell and the natural ingredients but it did seem that different than any other shampoos. Got my hair clean, conditions good. But I could only use it for 2 days since my hair is so long and thick which isn&#x27;t really enough time for me to tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I got these products to test and review for free from  influenster. I really love the serum it made my hair really soft after I straightened. The shampoo does clean my hair very well it made it feel a bit dry. I put a lot of the conditioner in my hair and it made it very soft. The scent or these products smell great I would definitely purchase the serum again.</li>
            <li> I received this starter kit FREE to test and review thanks to Influenster! I was so excited to try out these new hair products and I was not let down! The scent is absolutely amazing; totally invigorating, clean, and fresh smelling. The shampoo suds up nicely and the conditioner softens my hair. My only issue is that the conditioner weighs my hair down quite a bit (I have wavy/curly hair and the conditioner kind of takes away my hair&#x27;s natural bounce). The oil elixir smooths my hair without making it greasy which I love. Overall, quite satisfied with all three products :)</li>
            <li> I received this bundle free from Influenster to test and review.  I color my hair and use a hairdryer on it. It’s past my shoulders, so you know there’s a decent amount of damage to it…  I have used the shampoo, conditioner and the oil elixir twice. The shampoo has great rich lather and left my hair very clean. The conditioner is very rich, but rinsed out well and didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. The oil worked great on my damaged ends and they all left a nice smell.  My hair is very shiny and silky using the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Collection. I’m very pleased with these products. They are comparable to much more expensive lines. I will be buying them when these small sizes run out.  Update: I still really like the conditioner and oil elixir. Turns out the shampoo can be Too cleansing for colored hair. I will still use it on occasion when I want to get rid of product build-up. I still recommend these products, just with the one caution.</li>
            <li> All of these products smell great while leaving my hair feeling soft and frizz free</li>
            <li> I have received these for free. I have soft spot for herbal essences because of their hello hydration line. I love scents so I like how the shampoo smells and lathers and the conditoner is good. The tree stars are because off the oil elexir. I feel that isn&#x27;t for my hair type, which is straight and thick. It is reguvenation line, so I think is better suited for dry and processed hair. Over all I would get the shampoo and conditioner for normal hair.</li>
            <li> I received this set from being a part of influenster for free.  First let me say that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from herbal essences because I have not been a big fan of their products in the past.  The product has a very nice smell, very fruity and floral! The shampoo  had to use a good bit of it but that is typical for me because I have very thick long hair but once I got enough it lathered well. The conditioner I did not need much of though a little went a long way for me which was nice! The leave in oil was also great! I was hesitant to use it because I don&#x27;t really like to use products in my hair after washing and didn&#x27;t want my hair to feel oily. Thankfully it didnt leave my hair oily at all but just left a nice shine and smell!</li>
            <li> I received this a a free trial from the influenster panel and I was really impressed by the sample size, usually you only get enough for one go and can&#x27;t truly judge based off that but it was more than enough for 3 great washes. First off the smell is amazing i was truly impressed and I was able to really stretch the conditioner which usually i burn through but I had the great oil elixir to use afterwards so i didn&#x27;t need to go so heavy with the conditioner. It definitely conditions and brings your hair back to life without weighing it down. It was a free trial and i&#x27;m defiently interested in purchasing in the future</li>
            <li> Got this bundle from Influenster. Should&#x27;ve just left my one review here instead of each separate product...but alas, while I have no real problems with the shampoo and conditioner, I really like the Oil Elixir. It smells great. I will use the elixir on my ends and continue to use coconut oil at my scalp. My husband and I both used the shampoo and conditioner (though he&#x27;ll allow me to use whatever on his hair in the shower...and as long as it cleans, he&#x27;s fine)...and while we probably won&#x27;t buy more of the conditioner, we may get more of the shampoo for periodic use and more of the Elixir for the scent. It does soften my hair. Currently, it&#x27;s not that humid, so I can&#x27;t test the frizz-free qualities, but the smell is really nice!</li>
            <li> I received this bundle of products complementary for testing and review purposes.  This small bundled arrived just before we left on vacation.  I was excited because it the perfect size to pack and check into the luggage.    I have very fine, super straight hair, it naturally tangles very easily, but this trio left my hair soft and smooth.  I liked the shampoo, because it left my hair clean and smelling good.  The conditioner  was very nice.  It gave me soft , smooth,  hair that was not tangled.  I tried to use the elixir several ways.  First, I put it all over my hair and the next day my hair looked and felt a bit greasy.  After that, I tried smoothing it on the ends after my shower, and I left my hair looked and felt better than it had been previously.  I like the set and I would recommend it.  The only thing I would even have a slight complaint about is that when I am in the shower I can not tell the shampoo bottle from the conditioner bottle.  The are identical and since I am getting older I have trouble reading the bottle to differentiate.  I would recommend a different color cap or banner across the bottle for easier identification.  I really like the smell of the products, too, so did my husband.</li>
            <li> I received this bundle for free to test and review and I love it all!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is usually pretty picky on what I put in it, but this trio has been working wonders!! To start, I will say that I only wash my hair every other day, not daily. But I have been using this shampoo, conditioner, and oil elixir trio for about a month now and have really seen a difference in my hair! First, the scent is so nice!! Not sure how to describe it, but I love that using the oil in my hair after my showers leaves me smelling so clean and fresh! Plus it really helps to detangle my frizzy hair and give it a healthy shine! But the conditioner does a very good job getting the knots out of my waves. All around this is a great hair-care regiment. None of the products leave my hair heavy or greasey!!</li>
            <li> I was the lucky recipient of a free sample of this from Influenster.  Below is my honest opinion and review.  Shampoo - Love the scent!  Love that there is no artificial colors.  Love how clean my hair feels after I shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t tend to dry my hair out.  Lately I&#x27;ve been playing the shampoo roulette wheel, one will work good for a while, then my hair feels greasy, so I switch, but it always seems at the end of the day, I feel like a greasy mess.  Then I got my VoxBox from Influenster and I gave the products a try and was really impressed.  At the end of the day, my hair still felt great, no greasy feeling at all and residue the next time I shampooed.  Conditioner - Again, love the scent!  I try to stick with a &#x27;less is more&#x27; approach with conditioner.  I have THICK, wavy hair and it seems with some conditioners I have to pile it on to make my hair tangle free.  With the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals that was not the case.  I was able to use a smaller amount and my hair was smooth and easy to comb out.  Oil Elixir -  WOW!  I LOVE this stuff!  I didn&#x27;t start out that way though.  With my wavy hair, I couldn&#x27;t really tell that it was doing much, but on the second day of use I decided to straighten my hair.  That&#x27;s when I fell in love.  It made my hair so soft and smooth, even with the heat torture my hair was getting.  On the days I straighten my hair, I make sure to give it a good coating of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Oil Elixir.  It also does not leave a residue.  My hair feels so soft and at the next washing I can&#x27;t tell my hair had anything in it at all.</li>
            <li> I received this collection for free from Influenster in return for my review. I usually use Biolage products for my hair, so when I saw that it was Herbal Essences, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be impressed. I WAS WRONG!!!!! First, the shampoo smelled great, but the thing that really impressed me was that it felt like my hair was getting lighter. I have very long thick hair. Usually, it feels like a weight on my head when its wet, but as soon as it lathered up, it felt light and bouncy. The conditioner was great too, but not as impressive as the shampoo. The elixer was amazing! The ends of my hair are really dry and all other oil treatments I&#x27;ve tried have just weighed it down and looked greasy. All in all, I love it, and I will definitely be buying more once this set runs out.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is incredible, and the shampoo and conditioner made my hair silky soft. My favorite item is definitely the oil, it makes my hair so shiny.</li>
            <li> I recently got this to try for free thru influenster and it is amazing it smells great and leaves your hair feeling and looking soft and fantastic. Its my new fav shampoo and cond.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Collection, complimentary of Influenster to test and review. I have naturally thick and curly hair that&#x27;s sometimes difficult to deal with, but using this collection resulted in my hair being a little more manageable, and was a marked improvement from the hair products I usually use. Using the shampoo, I noticed that it didn&#x27;t really lather like other shampoos usually do, but it seemed to clean just as well. The conditioner was my favorite, since it seemed to make my hair much smoother while I was in the shower. Using the oil afterwards helped my hair be a little more soft, though I would have preferred more of a shine. The whole collection also has a very pleasant smell to it, and I noticed that it lingered during the entire day -- so it&#x27;s rather strong when it comes to its scent. All in all, it&#x27;s worth a try to use, and there&#x27;s no real drawbacks to using this collection!</li>
            <li> I received travel-sized samples of the Wild Naturals Rejuvenating shampoo, conditioner &amp; oil elixir complimentary through Influenster. They were the perfect size to throw in my swim bag and take to the pool. I expected my hair to smell good afterwards (because, duh, Herbal Essences), but I also figured that it would just be slightly covering up the chlorine smell. Surprise! It actually washed all of the chlorine smell out of my hair &amp; smelled amazing all day.  The oil elixir helped tame frizz too, and it gave my hair a nice finish after using the gym blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of these products!  Herbal Essences used to be one of my favs when I was younger.  I will be buying this set again.  It leaves your hair feeling clean and fresh.  I am so glad I was able to try these products using Influenster.  Thanks again! I also love the smoother.  Very fun to try new products!!</li>
            <li> I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The opinions expressed in this review however entirely are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Herbal Essences shampoos for awhile now, so I didn&#x27;t expect to be able to tell much difference in the washing process, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this trio. The shampoo and conditioner have a good consistency and smell amazing. I did have to use a little more conditioner than usual to get a full moisturizing, but my hair felt very clean after the washing and very smooth as it dried. While I will definitely be looking for larger bottles of the shampoo and conditioner, the oil elixir is my favorite part of this kit. I just can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair. The ends feel so smooth and healthy! I probably should have tried these products separately so I could determine which of them makes the biggest difference, but as long as I can duplicate the results, I&#x27;m completely comfortable with having to buy all three of them. My hair feels great, the kit smells amazing, and I&#x27;m off to search for 1L bottles of the shampoo/conditioner so I can do this again.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed all 3 of these products! The dry oil spray is great on my 3b curls, really locks in moisture and gives it shine! The products smell great too! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Received this as a free sample. Smells great. Left my hair super soft! I&#x27;d definitely buy this!</li>
            <li> OVER 50 User:&lt;br /&gt;I too, received my package from Influenster a couple of weeks ago. I thought I would try it a few weeks to see what I really thought about the products. Frist try out of the box, I liked the smell - not overly citrus- it lathered well and the conditioner was fine. I have curly dry frizzy hair so the oil was what I was most interested in. I spritzed it on my hair after sleeping on it the night before and headed out to work. I had SO many compliments on my hair that day, it was really amazing. I thought, well this could be a &amp;#34;first product&amp;#34; kind of thing. I tried the same thing the next week, and the same results, people asking me what I am doing different. So I tell them about the product and they are excited to know it is not $$$$.&lt;br /&gt;so my breakdown on this product:&lt;br /&gt;Pro: OIL, Definitely the oil - this will continue to be on my shelf of daily go to&lt;br /&gt;Mid: Lather (which really doesn&#x27;t do anything other than psychologically make us think it&#x27;s working), citrus scent (while it is not overly citrusy, I am not a big fan of citrus)&lt;br /&gt;Con: nothing really here&lt;br /&gt;Hair products are such a personal preference, so would I recommended it based on my outcomes - absolutely, and I have. will I use the shampoo and conditioner going forward eh? BUT THE O IL STAYS and that is huge for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this product for about 2 weeks and I Love it! It smells so good and it leaves my hair feeling smooth and really shiny!</li>
            <li> I recieved these 3 products as part of a a free trial to test. I was very happy with the results especially since the products are so inexpensive! My hair is damaged from dying it and this help bring it back to life!</li>
            <li> I received a free trial of this product through Influenster, and was excited to try it.  Unfortunately, the very heavy scent was too overpowering for me, and it weighed my fine, thin hair down.  It wasn&#x27;t for me, but this would be a great product for someone with thicker hair than mine, and someone not overwhelmed by a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> This whole set made my hair feel smooth, when I was done with the wash it didn&#x27;t feel harsh on my hair either I loved it!</li>
            <li> I received this kit complimentary from Influenster to review. I used the shampoo and conditioner every other day and the oil every day. The days i did not use the shampoo and conditioner, I used my own to test the oil by itself. The shampoo was nothing special, it even felt a little drying. The conditioner was better, I needed to use a ton of it to feel a difference but it did come out smooth. The oil is amazing. It leaves my hair soft, manageable and shiny with a nice scent. When you use the entire kit together, it does product great results.</li>
            <li> I received this bundle free through Influenster for testing purposes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that this shampoo and conditioner is okay, but not great. I personally would use this once in a while maybe when I go on a trip because they are smaller, but not every day. My main concern is they contain sulfate which is known to do further damage to hair. In addition, my hair had a lot of static with this shampoo and conditioner, which I noticed was mentioned in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros of this bundle are that it smells AMAZING and the oil is great for your damaged ends. I would probably buy the oil again, but pass on the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive this product from Influenster to try. I really enjoyed all three of the products. The shampoo and conditioner have a great smell and leave my hair feeling great. I feel like the oil has a bit of a different smell but still great nonetheless. The oil leaves my hair feeling super soft, however, I have wavy/curly hair and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really do too much to help control frizziness. That doesn&#x27;t bother me too much though. I would still use this product and definitely recommend the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I received these complimentary products from Influenster and Voxbox. I used them as soon as I got them. They smell like the tears of unicorns and angels! I Haven&#x27;t smelled a better shampoo or conditioner set. And they ACTUALLY for the first time, made my hair soft. I Have unruly curly, frizzy hair. The oil is like a leave in conditioner. You don&#x27;t need very much, although i used slightly more because my hair is so long, it&#x27;s half way down my back. I Have recommended these products to my friends and family because for me, they actually work.</li>
            <li> I received this three piece starter kit, for free, from Influenster, to use and review.&lt;br /&gt;It gas a nice soft and subtle smell that actually lasts (washed and conditioned my hair as well as used the oil last night, this morning I threw my hair up in a bun before work. Just let my hair down and it still smells really good, 9 hours later)&lt;br /&gt;My hair can get pretty crazy with tangles when it&#x27;s wet but with just using the shampoo and conditioner I could run my fingers through my hair immediately after showering.&lt;br /&gt;The oil seemed to calm the frizziness of my hair down as well even after the humidity hit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I Would definately buy all three of these products.</li>
            <li> I received these products for free from Influenster and really liked two of the three of them. I&#x27;ve used them all a few times now and really loved the shampoo. It is creamy and did a great job of lathering and cleansing my hair, and rinsed clean. I also really liked the oil as it left my hair feeling nourished and shiny. I also noticed that it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy, even though I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day. The conditioner, however, I didn&#x27;t love. It wasn&#x27;t thick or nourishing enough for my thick hair. I would definitely purchase the shampoo. I would consider purchasing the oil, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever make it through the bottle. I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I received this as a complimentary gift. At first, I was pretty skeptical about this product. &amp;#34;You mean I&#x27;m supposed to PUT oil into my hair??? Doesn&#x27;t that kind of defeat the purpose of washing your hair??&amp;#34; Purely for the sake of having my hair smell as though it had been kissed by the goddess of nature, I gave it a try. After I washed my hair with the rejuvenating shampoo and conditioner, I worked  it into my ends and blow dried it. Right then and there, the heavens parted as a cherub descended and handed me a bouquet of flowers and the secret to eternal life. My hair is so soft, a mom tried to swaddle her newborn baby in it. Someone stopped me on the street and asked if I had recently returned from a trip to Tahiti. After using this elixir, I swear that my hair has never been softer and the sky has never looked so blue. Everything is in harmony and having dozens of men enchanted by my hair is a luxury that gives me a great sense of power and control. Great product, Herbal Essences. 4 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I must admit that I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this one; although HE products smell great, they did nothing for my hair, but since this was sent so graciously to me by Influenster, I gave it a try and am SO happy it was sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I enjoy all of the product packaging. The scent was a shocker. It isn&#x27;t as sweet as one would think. A good thing for me as I do not enjoy sweet scents and prefer to smell my perfume rather than hair product. It meshed well with any perfume I set to it, and was a fresh, yet interesting, slightly unusual scent. It also, did NOT break me out, which seems to be a common problem with me.&lt;br /&gt; So, moving forward from there, I use the shampoo, and it is soft. My hair is processed so that is a VERY good thing. No stripping over three uses.&lt;br /&gt; The conditioner. Again, soft; making my hair feel like cotton.&lt;br /&gt; The Oil. THIS IS THE STAR OF THE SHOW.&lt;br /&gt;  I love this. It penetrates the shaft of each strand and for some reason, the scent is slightly different, lighter, than the shampoo. It leaves very little  residue so I knew when I was done working it through my hair.&lt;br /&gt; THIS is the product I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Collection Bundle Kit through Influenster VOXBOX about a month ago to review. I really loved the packaging and the fragrance of the collection. The shampoo lathered well and I only needed to use a small amount. As I would wash my hair the shampoo felt gentle, not harsh. The conditioner left my hair feeling silky and healthy not weighted down. I must confess the oil elixir is my favorite. I love how it immediately absorbs into my hair and helps smooth and strengthen my hair. I believe all 3 are wonderful products.</li>
