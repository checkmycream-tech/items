    <ol>
            <li>Her Babybliss fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>This was a great product to keep my styling iron!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy I did and would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>This was the best shipping screw-up!</li>
            <li>Great mostly functional stand, with one flaw.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>To mention, I have a completely smooth marble top that is ideal for suction.  </li>
            <li>Does not stick to any kind of surface.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and great value</li>
            <li>As most of the reviews have stated, it doesn&#x27;t stick to table tops.</li>
            <li>I bought 5!  :)</li>
            <li>I love that I found this item.</li>
            <li>3 stars because I love my holder,</li>
            <li>I love this holder, it fits my flat iron perfect &amp; keeps it from falling or getting bumped!  </li>
            <li>We bought two of these for the salon because the HSI holder we bought from Amazon 4 years ago is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>Great for holding the flat iron when on and in use.</li>
            <li>Works great if the hot tools are not very heavy.</li>
            <li>Since we use the same styling tools, I thought it might be a good item to buy.</li>
            <li>This would be a good product if the suction cups actually worked&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I hadn&#x27;t walked away from it and come back to a fire.</li>
            <li>I bought this to get the hot iron off the counter &amp; out of the way.</li>
            <li>Otherwise product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>My sister purchased one and said she really thought it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Having damaged a styling iron before due to it falling off the counter when I attempted to lay it down, I was very impressed with how well it was held in place until I was ready to use it again.  </li>
            <li>It does not stick to surfaces very well.  </li>
            <li>There is no &amp;#34;Hot Tools&amp;#34; logo on it and the whole design is sh*tty.</li>
            <li>I use to keep my hot iron on my bare vanity, no I place it inside of this holder.</li>
            <li>and these were both on new granite slab counter tops</li>
            <li>Both were shipped from the same place, so not sure what happened, but I&#x27;m glad I ended up with the right size, but</li>
            <li>Also was told having hot flat iron in clamped position can cause warp-age of the iron.. who knows.. would not waste money again.</li>
            <li>Within one week, I heard a loud noise and then one of the stylists said &amp;#34;what just happened??&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>It looks so professional and neat.</li>
            <li>use this everyday, saves my sink top from getting those yellow burn marks on it, would buy again.</li>
            <li>it does keep my flat iron in it&#x27;s place, but the suction cups dont hold for more than a few minutes, and it always smells like it&#x27;s burning, even though there&#x27;s been no evidence of melting plastic...</li>
            <li>The thing broke in half all by itself, just because a hot iron was in it!  </li>
            <li>With that said, it&#x27;s a problem that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much, but I&#x27;m not super picky.  </li>

            <li> This worked well initially, held a Chi flat iron constantly for a month, but it cracked after a month for absolutely no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> It will hold briefly but with any movement when pulling my flat iron out it comes up.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure if I really needed to buy this  product.</li>

            <li> I was using a broken epoxy circle that you put hot pots on.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I am having trouble getting it to stick with the suction cups, it often comes undone from the surface</li>
            <li> both items have the same issue after a few hours the suction cups release</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a 2\\&quot; Hot Tools straightener and was sad</li>
            <li> I just press it down when I&#x27;m done using it</li>
            <li> My gf said the suction cup is not very strong.</li>
            <li> Having trouble getting the suction cups to work</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> wrong brand!</li>
            <li> Horrible product</li>

            <li> it does keep my flat iron in it&#x27;s place, but the suction cups dont hold for more than a few minutes, and it always smells like it&#x27;s burning, even though there&#x27;s been no evidence of melting plastic...</li>
            <li> This worked well initially, held a Chi flat iron constantly for a month, but it cracked after a month for absolutely no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> As most of the reviews have stated, it doesn&#x27;t stick to table tops. I guess I don&#x27;t see the point in it with that being the case. I tried it in my bathroom and it fell onto the bath mat in front of my sink. I tried it on my vanity and it fell onto my carpet. The straightening iron fell out upon impact, so it melted both the mat and carpet. I&#x27;m glad I hadn&#x27;t walked away from it and come back to a fire.</li>
            <li> I was using a broken epoxy circle that you put hot pots on.  My flat iron would get knocked off all the time but my dog &amp; me moving around.  I love this holder, it fits my flat iron perfect &amp; keeps it from falling or getting bumped!  I bought one for me &amp; one for my daughter!</li>
            <li> I bought this to get the hot iron off the counter &amp; out of the way. It serves its purpose well</li>
            <li> We bought two of these for the salon because the HSI holder we bought from Amazon 4 years ago is no longer available.  Both of these would not stick to our metal cabinets, whereas the HSI holder does.  Within one week, I heard a loud noise and then one of the stylists said &amp;#34;what just happened??&amp;#34;  The thing broke in half all by itself, just because a hot iron was in it!  Total junk.  Do not buy!  Look on an auction site for HSI holders like I did.  I bought 5!  :)</li>
            <li> Great mostly functional stand, with one flaw.  It does not stick to surfaces very well.  To mention, I have a completely smooth marble top that is ideal for suction.  Some buyers may have problems that is related to their counter tops. It will hold briefly but with any movement when pulling my flat iron out it comes up.  With that said, it&#x27;s a problem that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much, but I&#x27;m not super picky.  I just press it down when I&#x27;m done using it and it stays put until I use my flat iron again.</li>
            <li> My gf said the suction cup is not very strong. Otherwise product is exactly as described. Her Babybliss fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money! Does not stick to any kind of surface. Every time I put my tool in it, it fell because the suction cups dont stick!!!</li>
            <li> This was a great product to keep my styling iron!  Having damaged a styling iron before due to it falling off the counter when I attempted to lay it down, I was very impressed with how well it was held in place until I was ready to use it again.  Lightweight and Durable!</li>
            <li> I love that I found this item. I use to keep my hot iron on my bare vanity, no I place it inside of this holder. It looks so professional and neat. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Great for holding the flat iron when on and in use. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I am having trouble getting it to stick with the suction cups, it often comes undone from the surface it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> The thing I got in the mail looks NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. NOTHING. LIKE. IT. There is no &amp;#34;Hot Tools&amp;#34; logo on it and the whole design is sh*tty. I wish I could have return it but I lost the packaging. The suction cups don&#x27;t stay suctioned for very long. Horrible product</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stick to mirror/countertop. Also was told having hot flat iron in clamped position can cause warp-age of the iron.. who knows.. would not waste money again.</li>
            <li> use this everyday, saves my sink top from getting those yellow burn marks on it, would buy again. thank you</li>
            <li> I was not sure if I really needed to buy this  product. My sister purchased one and said she really thought it was worth the money.  Since we use the same styling tools, I thought it might be a good item to buy. I saw it online and ordered it. I am very happy I did and would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, and it stated it was for a 1\\&quot; straightener. I ended up buying a 2\\&quot; Hot Tools straightener and was sad I&#x27;d have to return this holder. Both were shipped from the same place, so not sure what happened, but I&#x27;m glad I ended up with the right size, but wrong brand! I received a \\&quot;Ceramic Tools by Jilbere\\&quot;. I unintentionally left my straightener on the 400 degree setting ALL DAY! Didn&#x27;t do any damage to either my straightener or holder, thank goodness! This was the best shipping screw-up! 3 stars because I love my holder, but it&#x27;s not the one I ordered...</li>
            <li> This would be a good product if the suction cups actually worked&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 of these for X-Mas gifts both items have the same issue after a few hours the suction cups release and these were both on new granite slab counter tops</li>
            <li> Works great if the hot tools are not very heavy. Having trouble getting the suction cups to work so if I put heavier tools inside of it it just tips over.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and great value</li>
