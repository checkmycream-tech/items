            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>This product is great and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky or filmy.</li>
            <li>This is a great concept- Applying your lotion while you are in the shower.</li>
            <li>It is great for people like me who don&#x27;t take the time to apply lotion or procrastinate about doing it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product...especially when in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>Just what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li>great product.  </li>

            <li>The cost is great, compared to brick and mortar stores.  </li>
            <li>Great smell.</li>
            <li>It feels great but smells</li>
            <li>Great for my guy who hates lotioning and feeling &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got to get more!!</li>
            <li>Very nice Scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice in-shower lotion.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>but this is amazing!</li>
            <li>and he said he liked it!</li>
            <li>Its the best product and leaves my skin smooth nourished and happy.</li>
            <li>lol I just love it!</li>
            <li>Am thinking that whatever makes it continue to moisturize my skin after it&#x27;s rinsed off may not be good for my drain.</li>
            <li>To my surprise it works fairly well, and my skin does feel a bit softer and doesnt get any sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>A good idea if you want to cover your body in petroleum-based product.  </li>
            <li>, it seems like I have to use a lot of it to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>It is good if you want a lighter lotion, like for the summer.</li>
            <li>My mom loved it.</li>
            <li>What good is that?</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m thinking this can&#x27;t be good for the drain as the oil will build up over time and clog the drain.</li>
            <li>And for me, I knew it was a winner even before we tried it, because it has earned the Good Housekeeping Seal...</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Gives good moisture to lock in hydration in the shower.</li>
            <li>Then everyone I bunked with this weekend had used it and loved it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>good- not greasy</li>
            <li>This product is so good that even after towel drying it still is on your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good solution for Psoriasis and Eczema as well.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job and feels good on my skin</li>
            <li>Great on your skin and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Awesome:):)</li>
            <li>Works great, but needs to smell better</li>
            <li>It smells ok, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work great?</li>
            <li>This is ok as a moisturizer but great as a shave lotion.</li>
            <li>This right here is the best thing ever</li>
            <li>and it has a very pleasant fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this!</li>

            <li>We went out and got my husband  some magic too!</li>

            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>

            <li>but I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I promise you, you will love it and never want anything else!</li>
            <li>It also saves time because you don&#x27;t have to wait for the lotion to &amp;#34;soak in.&amp;#34;  Love it!</li>
            <li>Totally love!  </li>
            <li>but I love this!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>If youre any way like me who hates lotion then this is definetly for you :)!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for close to a week now, and I love it!</li>
            <li>And it would have smelled better!</li>
            <li>Hopefully they&#x27;ll come out with a softer, more pleasant, feminine smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh, clean, wonderful smell that just makes you happy.</li>
            <li>Feels great while I&#x27;m in the shower, but the feeling wears off very quick and I still have to apply lotion afterwards</li>
            <li>If you have healthy skin and your looking for a very light moisturizer this is perfect (will leave you with smooth feeling</li>
            <li>: Amazing.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel amazing</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>How about some scents like lilac, rose, lavender, orchid, honeysuckle....</li>
            <li>Really liked this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It also rinses nicely</li>
            <li>Not as effective as I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice idea</li>
            <li>It feels nice, but I haven&#x27;t noticed an increased moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>A nice luxury product for your bath or shower.</li>
            <li>Had me rubbing across my own skin...</li>
            <li>Really nice.</li>
            <li>It shortens my morning routine which is nice.</li>
            <li>My skin is nice and moisturized, no slathered lotion post shower needed.</li>
            <li>Not sticky to touch skin after use which is nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear lotion, sunblock, foundation, creams, anything like that because honestly, it makes me sweat.</li>
            <li>I have used baby oil with aloe vera in my shower and have liked it.</li>
            <li>I received this at a discounted price from Amazon for an honest review</li>
            <li>I recieved a sample of this for an honest review, so here it is.</li>
            <li>This stuff works and smells very clean!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, has a wonderful clean but not overbearing scent, and rinses well but still leaves your skin silky throughout the day.</li>
            <li>But I found Nivea&#x27;s (out of shower) Essentially rich lotion &amp; I am happy with that for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this on Amazon at a great price (with a coupon) as I&#x27;ve been looking for an in-shower lotion to try to speed up my morning routine.</li>
            <li>Almond oil is rich in vitamin A, B and E, which are great for skin health.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it was  magic, my skin felt wonderful.</li>
            <li>and the idea is wonderful in saving time and making the most of moisturizing when it can really be locked in best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought it &amp; from the first time, I loved it!</li>
            <li>Excitedly, I even told a woman in the grocery store how amazing this stuff was!</li>
            <li>It rubbed on very smoothly and because of the steam, the pleasant fragrance filled the shower.</li>
            <li>Nivea makes some wonderful products and I am glad to see they are expanding their product line because they are capable of so much more.</li>
            <li>The best in-shower moisturizer I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>My favorite lotion now in the shower!!!!!LOVE!!I love saving time and being nice and warm in the shower while applying lotion.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how effective this product may be.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST shower lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>this product is a good choice if you will enjoy Nivea products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not flowery/girly, just a pleasant clean smell.</li>
            <li>The best in all the world is Ro&#x27;s Argon from Lush (in shower moisturizer).</li>
            <li>The lotion smells great and is priced right.</li>
            <li>SO easy and affective!</li>
            <li>My skin dries out easily and I can tell that the moisture is staying throughout the day!</li>
            <li>Love love love this, favorite item!</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and unisex.</li>
            <li>However, if you have a very smooth shower floor, it may be more slippery.  </li>
            <li>Love it so good for my  &amp;#34;psoriasis&amp;#34; thanks Walmart !!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge relief for me!</li>
            <li>like Olay fragrance better.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this product works as described.</li>
            <li>Love this product for summer.</li>
            <li>But the more water I let run over me, it didn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li>Oh, love.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok-</li>
            <li>I still prefer the baby oil much more.</li>
            <li>I want to compare it to some thing I have been using for many years made by Aveeno--their &amp;#34;Creamy Bath Oil&amp;#34; and their &amp;#34;Bath Oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a better fragrance, but it works the way it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>, I love this lotion , I love how it&#x27;s smells, how is leaving my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this body lotion.</li>
            <li>healthy option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.  </li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>My wife love this lotion thank you</li>
            <li>I have skin that flares up with eczema with many products.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll fall in love with it</li>
            <li>But the effect seems soso, just ok</li>
            <li>Winter requires more moisturizing that this can offer alone, however.</li>
            <li>This is why I love the concept of Nivea’s</li>
            <li>Ok but I still put lotion on</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This product is ok, but I do not think it moisturizes as well as the Olay in the shower lotion does.</li>
            <li>I love themild scent as well.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Better than the Jergens version</li>
            <li>Love this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been a day since I shaved and my legs are still smooth and they haven&#x27;t hurt a bit!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling wonderful, will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>Also great for showering at the gym for example to skip the whole putting-lotion-extra-quick-naked-in-front-of-people thing.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>And talk about the price compared to oil of olay, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>This is just another marketing gimick to get you to buy more product.</li>
            <li>Personally I love it.</li>
            <li>&amp; it isn&#x27;t the easiest top to close.</li>
            <li>Love the concept.</li>
            <li>but my skins does feel softer :)  </li>
            <li>( I am so glad that someone mentioned that it  causes the shower to get slippery because I took steps to make sure I didn&#x27;t slip and fall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Olay version and I think I like this one better.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell better too.</li>
            <li>an okay in shower lotion.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product I just wish they would get scented lotions as well.</li>
            <li>Would like more scents.</li>
            <li>I can feel that my skin is now more moisturized, smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>but I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of  this.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Hotel&#x27;s have more money than I do for drain opening services.</li>
            <li>love not having to get out of shower and then add lotion.</li>
            <li>I obtained a sample of this in my Walmart Beauty Box and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The scent is great, and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add more of a review after a couple of uses, but for now, thumbs up.</li>
            <li>My arms and legs were radiant and smooth!</li>
            <li>The concept of in-shower lotion is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I purchased this in the extra-dry formulation mostly out of curiosity and because I&#x27;d seen the ads on TV.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than remembering to put on lotion after the shower, which I always forgot to do.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love Nivea&#x27;s In-Shower body lotion</li>
            <li>I read the warning on the label before using and made sure to thoroughly rinse the shower floor, however, the lotion still seems to leave a slippery residue.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this.  </li>
            <li>and I would assume that most people that wear lotions</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t bother them will love it.</li>
            <li>everyone, this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>wish it came in fragrance free!</li>
            <li>Still love the the product.</li>
            <li>I believe this product lasts longer and better nourishes my skin.</li>
            <li>You would be better off using baby oil - which doesn&#x27;t moisturize well in my opinion - than using this product.</li>
            <li>I love the iea</li>
            <li>but if your looking for noticeably more moisturized skin</li>
            <li>would give this product more stars if it were not marketed for In-Shower use.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is a product that I will gladly repurchase over &amp; over again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful, but I would not bu again.</li>
            <li>The almond oil in this product is has so many benefits for your skin.  </li>
            <li>It rejuvenates your skin by promoting healthy skin renewal.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this.  </li>
            <li>But anyway--- This product has a great deal more in the bottle and costs a fair amount less $$ than my Aveeno products do, so if I like it as well (or even more?!)</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, smells good.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, though, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>formula for dry skin works the best as its thicker and won&#x27;t run off as you&#x27;re using it.  </li>
            <li>This seemed like an easy way to skip a step in the morning, and it&#x27;s an OK moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Another wonderful thing is when you get out of the shower and dry off there isn&#x27;t any residue on your towel</li>
            <li>the most nourishing bod lotion from Nivea just got cheaper and more available than ever.</li>
            <li>I then tried this product again by toweling off lightly, then applying the product followed by a VERY light rinse.</li>
            <li>My skin is beyond smooth and I smell fantastic!</li>
            <li>Awesome product, it last a full day.</li>
            <li>The product seems better fit for summer use or a warmer climate than Michigan in the winter.</li>
            <li>Kind of a strange way to use it, but a great product.</li>
            <li>With the summer heat in, I&#x27;m not so sure whether the Almond oil may be too moisturizing, but this gives us a fun shower experience each time!</li>
            <li>So easy to use while in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to moisturize, and you do it in in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Not too girly so could easily be used by a man or teenagers.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to cut out one more step in moisturizing - not having to get out of the shower, dry, then put on lotion.  </li>
            <li>and this felt like a very mild moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is easy to remember to use since it is applied during the shower.</li>
            <li>So easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>You easily apply it while still in the shower and then wash it off.</li>
            <li>Convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t something that I would want or need to use daily, but once or twice a week it is nice to get a really good hydration routine going on.</li>
            <li>It is fairly strong smelling to me when in the shower.</li>
            <li>This item is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>Leaves me feeling perfectly moisturized although I still lotion super dry parts.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Read the fine print.  </li>
            <li>This makes it so easy and no sticky feeling just smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Still need to wear lotion afterwards during winter but warmer months its fine wearing alone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating it 3 stars because I think it&#x27;s a fine moisturizer</li>
            <li>but if you are in a hurry just using this bodywash is fine.</li>
            <li>the smell is mild which I love as well.</li>
            <li>Love this product, great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as potent as after shower lotion, but certainly helps keep my skin feeling smooth!</li>
            <li>Huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li>The Nivea does make your skin silky smooth, but it also makes your tub fall on your a** slippery.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product to try.</li>
            <li>I use it in every shower and can genuinely feel that my skin is moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>,  it has a light fragrance,  which I really enjoy.</li>
            <li>Leaves a very slippery surface, feels nice on the skin though.</li>
            <li>Skin is lightly moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasantly light scent that fades so you won&#x27;t be smelling it all day</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic - not too flowery.</li>
            <li>This is great does not left you feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>and I have incredibly smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I told my husband how smooth my skin felt, he touched and agreed.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this stuff.</li>
            <li>and the same great scent as the lotion.</li>
            <li>Smells great the only reason</li>
            <li>and this has still been working great though it has only been the spring/summer</li>
            <li>It does not have any kind of &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell to it whatsoever, and my husband, who is not prone to moisturizing his body post-shower, will do the in-shower moisturization without too much kvetching.</li>
            <li>Great daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t care for it is because it works too well, lol.</li>
            <li>gave the product two stars because it has a light, non-offensive scent and no oily residue.</li>
            <li>But price and ability to moisturizer is a great back up!</li>
            <li>Wish it were unscented or lightly scented.</li>
            <li>in all though, I love how my skin feels, and love that it really lasts.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, feels nice, and has the basic Nivea scent to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good to go with the rest of my morning routine and my skin is prepared to step out in the wild Wisconsin winter.</li>
            <li>Very Easy to use, probably will not fully replace my regular body lotion, but it is better than no lotion of the days I am in a hurry!</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of using this luxurious moisturizing cream right in the shower.  </li>
            <li>so is very useful for me.</li>
            <li>But this is a very nice product overall.</li>
            <li>Especially with summer just around the corner~&lt;br /&gt;The smell is really pleasant and it really did make my skin feel nice and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super easy to use and keeps my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This in shower lotion should be advertise more because I&#x27;m sure many consumers are unaware it exists.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product</li>
            <li>I was really excited about getting lotion that&#x27;s for the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been lazy applying moisturizer after shower, the in-shower lotion is perfect as I get to remember using it every day.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent, not more flakes.</li>
            <li>In addition, the smell, which is great in the bottle, for some reason smells very strange when applied.</li>
            <li>It also has a clean linen type of scent , but isn&#x27;t too over powering in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Great skin product to use during those dry winter months.</li>
            <li>Super smooth and hydrated after.</li>
            <li>They recommend you then clean the tub/shower</li>
            <li>Clean scent.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry skin</li>
            <li>i still use my after shower moisturizer because of how dry my skin is, but i think this stuff will be great in the summer.</li>
            <li>i love the scent its very fresh and also really moisturizes your skin with out a greasy feel</li>
            <li>No oily residue, just nice soft skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, and you do it right in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy again but wouldn&#x27;t say not to try it, seems like a fine product and fresh scent that&#x27;s not overly strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product for people with very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and does a great job, but the price is really ridiculous.</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR SUPER DRY SKIN!</li>
            <li>Love it but makes your tub very slippery</li>
            <li>leaves to much slippery slim in the bottom of the tube and smells more lie shave cream</li>
            <li>I read a lot of good reviews prior to purchasing</li>
            <li>it does leave my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Only drawback doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the Olay.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product last year in germany and LOVED IT.</li>
            <li>For some reason, the american formula is not as good; it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling as moisturized.</li>
            <li>They love it so much.</li>
            <li>Good moisture that last about all day.</li>
            <li>No bad marks yet-just haven&#x27;t tried it as yet.</li>
            <li>but  it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>Love using this new in shower lotion, leaves skin silky smooth</li>
            <li>It builds up VERY quickly on the walls  requiring more frequent shower cleanings.  </li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and find baby oil is much more effective than this product.  </li>
            <li>It really has a lot of lotion characteristics but gets you very clean.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best!</li>
            <li>Step out of the shower feeling nice and clean and not &#x27;dry&#x27; but not greasy.</li>
            <li>and this helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li>but it gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s placebo effect because it&#x27;s essentially like putting hair conditioner all over your body, and since your palm is now slippery, your skin feels slippery and &amp;#34;moisturized.&amp;#34; Honestly doesn&#x27;t seem to be a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It goes on quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky at all.  </li>
            <li>as described with quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than most regular lotions on the market.  </li>
            <li>At this rate I will run out quickly and still have to use lotion to moisturize my body.</li>
            <li>This product is really easy to apply in the shower, has only a very light scent which doesn&#x27;t persist after rinsing, which I&#x27;m sure men will appreciate, and really works.</li>
            <li>Feels great on my skin while taking my showers, the only issue is that you must clean your shower or bathtub right away because it get really slippery and greasy</li>
            <li>it sure makes your skin nice and soft .so if you like soft skin like I do.</li>
            <li>First, this is a huge bottle -- I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention to this fact when I placed my order.  </li>
            <li>You do have to rinse shower out with very hot water after use or else will leave a sticky film.</li>
            <li>Really works and skin feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Good for dry skin in the shower.</li>
            <li>we bought some new bodywash, lol and tried this for it&#x27;s actual moisturizing purpose.</li>
            <li>Anyway after two weeks and a whole bottle of this my skin looks better, no dry skin itch, and I Love this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t use too much you will be fine</li>
            <li>I would have been happy with a little bit softer since this winter is making me itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product really does make my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Worth reordering.</li>
            <li>Stays effective for several days!</li>
            <li>So much better than the 32 dollar Lush version.</li>
            <li>I can never seem to fit in the time to apply standard moisturizer in the mornings, and find myself forgetting more times than not.</li>
            <li>so much fun.</li>
            <li>The intended results aren&#x27;t worth the safety risk.</li>
            <li>This gave me slightly better results, as I could tell my skin was somewhat soft immediately after use, but with no oily residue.</li>
            <li>The oil helps maintaining moisture levels of the skin and gets absorbed without blocking the pores.  </li>
            <li>Not only great for my laziness but also cuts lotion &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; time completely away.</li>
            <li>luckily, it fades, but for the first hour or so i can smell it.</li>
            <li>Both were great except Olay is very heavily scented, while Nivea is mild.</li>
            <li>For folks with severely dry skin this seems to be the best option to hydrate and moisturize dry skin.</li>
            <li>because who&#x27;s got time for that, right?</li>
            <li>But that would get rid of it, right?</li>
            <li>i got a sample from a magazine &amp; went out &amp; bought it right away.</li>
            <li>Okay, this might sound strange because I rated it 5 stars, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan.&lt;br /&gt;I rated it 5 stars because it does exactly what it says it does, this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>havent noticed any major changes in my skin , but i still believe its an ok product.</li>
            <li>An incredible lotion for extra dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had dry, sensitive skin; so this sounded like a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>it was sticky and i know they wared about making sure that its washed away to avoid slipping but its not that easy to do unless you9 have a hand held shower which i dont....</li>
            <li>I had tried this in place of my normal cheap baby oil.</li>
            <li>very light and clean, but within an hour my dry skin was itching again unless I used another lotion.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels great and it&#x27;s actually easier to use than regular lotion.  </li>
            <li>Super when you in a hurry, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an old lady perfume smell to me, and it&#x27;s fairly strong.</li>
            <li>After the first try I was hooked, my dry and itchy skin gone, amazing.</li>
            <li>My husband like this very much.</li>
            <li>After stepping out of the shower my skin is soft and not even close to being dry; best of all, it definitely stays that way</li>
            <li>I feel so fresh &amp; clean after I get out of the shower, plus my skin felt soft &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy this product, especislly with summer coming soon!</li>
            <li>Only thing that would make it better would be putting it in a pump bottle.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I do use a daily after shower spray to help with mildew buildup though, so I can&#x27;t say for sure that nothing would build up if I didn&#x27;t use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband even uses it ;) would defintely buy again.</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely softer and more nourished, but I still need to lotion my feet, elbows, and hands after showering to feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>(I did not notice that my shower/tub was more slippery, but I can definitely understand that you are NOT to put this on the bottom of your feet).  </li>
            <li>only criticism would be that I wish there were more scent options.</li>
            <li>So soft, so smooth.</li>
            <li>but I still have to be careful about touching my legs for a full day after I shave.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this for the first time yesterday and you don&#x27;t have to put lotion on after you</li>
            <li>Will most likely purchase it again</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t even begin to explain how much I adore it!</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Occitane and Neutrogena Oil work much better applied to damp skin once you are outside the shower/tub stall.</li>
            <li>Great, moisturizing, and long lasting in shower body lotion.</li>
            <li>first time trying it..</li>
            <li>and it makes life so much easier!</li>
            <li>I use it differently since I love to take baths instead of showers.</li>
            <li>This leaves more residue than regular lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell but it does not last.</li>
            <li>This product works at first</li>
            <li>Hot water does not wash it away.</li>
            <li>becomes evident.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft &amp; beautiful after the shower &amp; I love following it up with the regular Nivea lotion on those super dry days.</li>
            <li>Luckily I read the label carefully before using and I was able to return it.</li>
            <li>My skin is very, very dry year-round, and most lotions I have tried have either dried out, made me feel greasy, or don&#x27;t have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The scent itself is very neutral and smells as though it might change due to body chemistry (as in, smelling more feminine on females and more masculine on males).</li>
            <li>It might be suitable as a shaving cream or maybe as a product for someone without dry skin (maybe summer use?), but not for me!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and stays silky smooth after gently rinsing before toweling dry.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t leave the sticky lotion feel that I absolutely hate, and the smell is light and is good for guys and girls!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really moisturize very well!</li>
            <li>I have tried the other brand (Olay) of &amp;#34;in shower&amp;#34; lotion too and it isn&#x27;t anywhere near as good as this one is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely try to be conscious to not use too much at once, because I think it would be easy to run through the bottle pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Rinses off easily and your skin doesn&#x27;t feel like it has anything extra on it.</li>
            <li>Its creamy/oily, like, obviously putting on lotion, but it washed off easily</li>
            <li>I was so glad it came out around winter when skin is always dry.</li>
            <li>I feel like I rinse and towel dry off more of the lotion than what soaks into my skin.</li>
            <li>make sure you pat yourself dry.</li>
            <li>Great for new moms since we have such limited time to ourselves.</li>
            <li>There are certain items that Nivea manufactures in Europe that are still not sold in the U.S.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use a large amount of it each day so that could be why.</li>
            <li>This is a great substitute as you take your shower like normal, apply this on your body while in the shower, rinse yourself, hose down the shower quickly, pat dry, lotion on your face, lotion on your feet and night-night.</li>
            <li>I bought the formular for extreamly dry skin and it is really just OK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little luxury.</li>
            <li>Works so good on hard water effects of skin</li>
            <li>It is extremely soothing for dry skin; it&#x27;s great for irritation and inflammation of the skin too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize very well.</li>
            <li>It works precisely the same way in that you apply it after you soap up and rinse then apply the product and rinse accordingly.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Done and ready to towel off and go.</li>
            <li>Also take caution that if you use too much of this product, your shower floor will get very slippery.</li>
            <li>When I use it on my legs or abdomen it works really well.  </li>
            <li>I started using this and didn&#x27;t think it was doing that much, so I took a break.</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin wasn&#x27;t as smooth as it was when I was using it, so now I think it is making a big difference.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to apply as much lotion out of the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t care so much for the smell.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling smooth and nourished and there’s no sticky feel either.</li>
            <li>Idon&#x27;t have to use much at all</li>
            <li>And after using this for a couple weeks, I can really tell the difference in my skin</li>
            <li>so need as much moisture as I can get</li>
            <li>but this product really performed.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really do that much for me.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s no worse than bubble bath</li>
            <li>It rinses off well and really does leave your skin feel like you&#x27;ve used lotion.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see much difference in appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to start your day with the softest body ever.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing...not much foam.  </li>
            <li>Makes things so much easier than doing lotion after the shower...</li>
            <li>Really moisturizes for days.</li>
            <li>I took my time to really work this into my skin before the rinse; I think that made all the difference.  </li>
            <li>It really works really well.</li>
            <li>It really DOES cause the shower floor to be slippery.</li>
            <li>We just really didn&#x27;t care for it at all.</li>
            <li>I use this product after I shower at night, so that my skin has just enough moisture to help me sleep comfortably at night.</li>
            <li>Keeps the skin moisturizing for the whole day and stops my skin getting itchy in winter.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different lotions, but I really enjoy this product a lot.  </li>
            <li>On one hand, it does moisturize to a degree, and given time it feels like my skin really drinks it up.</li>
            <li>No matter how light I apply, and how well I rinse, I&#x27;m left feeling greasy after my shower.</li>
            <li>my skin&#x27;s condition has really improved a lot, with or without this lotion</li>
            <li>/&gt;He is very averse to perfumed anything on his body.</li>
            <li>This actually passed his nose; it has a light fragrance</li>
            <li>I really like how my skin feels after using this product.</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference when I do not use it.</li>
            <li>It keeps me moisturized and makes getting ready in the mornings so much easier.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in it</li>
            <li>This really does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t notice it making my shower unusually</li>
            <li>: The scent is very floral, and I&#x27;m not trying to smell like a funeral.</li>
            <li>, I really like the idea of this product</li>
            <li>but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Some products I have tried out, have really caused me to fall, but then again maybe I&#x27;m just clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t expect much, but i actually really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very greasy and once you emerge from the shower, your skin does feel moisturized and it lasts for maybe one hour.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I rinse off</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also smooth and silky enough to shave your legs with.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would work for me.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use this product without having to also apply lotion after showering, defeating the whole purpose of it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY SLIPPERY</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as a thick lotion</li>
            <li>I broke my first bottle from putting it down without the top secured.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not quite rich enough for my very dry skin, but for someone with normal to only slightly dry skin it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>my skin drinks it right up and is soft all day</li>
            <li>right arm is super soft, but your left is kind of rough.&amp;#34; I was extremely surprised that he noticed, after just a single application.</li>
            <li>Moisturize and absorbs better than other in shower lotions brands and does not leave the shower floor as slippery as the others.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this when I saw the commercial on TV.</li>
            <li>I would use this in conjunction with my other lotions jusy because i like the smells iof them more.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to  let the hot water run  for a few minutes after you rinse...</li>
            <li>This product is okay, but it&#x27;s not worth it because it made my shower floor tiles really slippery, so now I&#x27;ll have to degrease them.</li>
            <li>The absolute best part, is I don&#x27;t have weird slimy hands afterwards like regular lotion.</li>
            <li>The first time, I was amazed by how well it worked and how soft my skin felt all day;</li>
            <li>I purchased to try as I normally use the Olay in Shower and this one leaves my skin so much softer &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li>I fully intend to purchase a full bottle of this and use it daily.</li>
            <li>Great concept, but thumbs down on an application that puts you at risk of slipping!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you do rinse down your shower or tub well as it can get slippery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the scent just OK, but it doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin at all and washes down the drain with the lotion.</li>
            <li>Though you still feel a little slimy - this in-shower lotion offers a nice compromise.</li>
            <li>I told him about this new product I&#x27;m using from Nivea and he wanted to use it as well!</li>
            <li>am a very large man - bodybuilder, and the tube doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;Really loved the sheen that it leaves on the skin like nivea lotion, and the relief from dry skin in the winter from the dry</li>
            <li>As for its effectiveness -- it does leave my skin feeling less taut and tender after a shower, and I&#x27;m able to use a lighter body lotion once out of the shower than what I would need if I hadn&#x27;t already moisturized in the shower.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, or if you just want to feel silky and smooth after bathing, this is the ticket for you.  </li>
            <li>This product is decent.  </li>
            <li>Goes on quickly and it definitely makes your skin feel softer.</li>
            <li>I know that it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use mainly on legs and arms.</li>
            <li>It actually works, but would suggest investing in a good lotion too if you don&#x27;t shower everyday.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients in advance, but the main ingredient is petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>The product works really well, but the smell is very masculine.</li>
            <li>It really leaves my skin feeling soft and supple after bath or shower!  </li>
            <li>Recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt I will use the rest of what is in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend</li>
            <li>Has nice, clean, subtle smell that doesn&#x27;t last if you don&#x27;t like it, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>the firmuls is rich and you do have to be careful because it is kind of slick so avoid your soles of the feet.</li>
            <li>Three stars for this product is generous - I would give it two but to be fair I do have REALLY dry skin on the bottom half of my legs.</li>
            <li>I did purchase another bottle of this because I had a coupon, just have to be really careful that I don&#x27;t fall down, and I have to make sure to clean the tub after every shower so hubby doesn&#x27;t get in and fall on his arse.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that rough spots (elbows, for example) are completely smooth now.  </li>
            <li>I have super dry skin;  I wash with Dr Woods Almond Castile soap and then coat myself with The Body Shop Shea Butter just to make my skin comfortable thru the dry winters in the NE.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Apply normal lotion to bottom of feet once seated on bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin no longer is itchy and just feels normal.</li>
            <li>I use it anyway because it is worth the extra cleaning!</li>
            <li>At least it smells nice.</li>
            <li>and I am pretty sure it is clogging my pipes too, as the drain is running slowly since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, if you wear lotion normally, you&#x27;ll like this.</li>
            <li>You notice the smell first, it smells really nice and not like a usual drug store lotion (yes i am an indie snob)</li>
            <li>&amp; I don&#x27;t feel like it is any slicker than normal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a normal shower flor though</li>
            <li>It is not as thick as the Olay lotion, nor does it smell as nice.</li>
            <li>So quick notes -- I live in north wisconsin, from CA originally, dry winter weather is a whole new beast for me.</li>
            <li>Love the way this smells and that it gives enough moisture unless you have really dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to be able to cut out the lotion part and save some time in the morning with this in shower lotion for extra dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My very dry winter skin immediately felt smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I guess is not very eco friendly because you have to use water to rinse ir, but i like to get out the shower and get dress</li>
            <li>This product is great in theory, applying moisturing lotion to your skin while you are still in the shower, but it&#x27;s not worth the risk of slipping in the tub or shower by the residue left after you wash it off.</li>
            <li>I mean my legs were super smooth, but they didn&#x27;t feel sensitive at all!</li>
            <li>live in Arizona</li>
            <li>Please note that I did not tell him i used any new moisturizer</li>
            <li>Smell is slightly lemony, but very mild and not offensive at all.</li>
            <li>Using this daily really helps, and its so much faster to apply in the shower, quick rinse and dry off.  </li>
            <li>so I would often do without (despite my super dry and sometimes itchy skin).</li>
            <li>Great Product, you save time and no sticky feel afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect if you are in a hurry or are just tired of the lotion routine.&lt;br /&gt;However some extra is needed for just shaved legs if you want your skin to glow.</li>
            <li>My skin is super dry in the midAtlantic winters, so any additional sources of moisture that I can find, I will try.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin when I shave my legs</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>So silky soft!</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>But after a few hours my legs would look like cracked old dried out wood lol.</li>
            <li>Of all the body moisturises I have tried over the years at all price levels this is the first product that actually works.</li>
            <li>I skip lotion, unbelievable:)</li>
            <li>and this leaves my skin soft and moisturized, without leaving yucky feeling on my hands, or making my pants stick to my skin!</li>
            <li>I have tried one too many lotion brands in the past.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with this problem for years and boom just like that it has been fixed!</li>
            <li>Bought it just to try....ended up being pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>But it is thick and rich and I use it right after my shower and don&#x27;t rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>Great product barely scented and feels amazing only bad thing is that it took a long time to get here</li>
            <li>Feels nice but not better then actually moisturizing after a shower.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was at night and when I woke up the next morning, my skin was really soft.</li>
            <li>I like being able to put lotion in the shower, but even if this is for &amp;#34;very dry skin&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t seem as hydrating as other lotions you apply normally.</li>
            <li>I went through quite a bit, as I put it on all my appendages and torso (I am SO DRY AND ITCHY EVERYWHERE right now with this weather).</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too strong like some lotions and it&#x27;s not the plain smell either.</li>
            <li>It may not feel like your moistured iimmediately but after a little bit you can feel that your skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It does indeed leave shower surfaces very slick, so do make sure you rinse these down with a healthy dose of extra-hot water once you&#x27;re out of the shower to prevent any accidents from happening the next time someone bathes.</li>
            <li>Right after shower, skin really feels smooth and hidrated, but a few hours later, it starts getting dry, even flaky.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s very moisturizing--however: they warn you on the bottle to be careful, because you apply it in the shower, with the water running, which takes the runoff onto the tub or shower floor, which then becomes very slippery.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft- not sticky or greasy</li>
            <li>andI really wish they were; such as their bath oil</li>
            <li>Really surprised on how well this stuff washed off.</li>
            <li>It may not be for you in the end, but it&#x27;s fixed a lot of the issues I&#x27;ve been having.</li>
            <li>Though if you do not wash this off completely you will get a bit of that lotion feel on your skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but putting this on in the shower is much easier than using regular lotion after.</li>
            <li>I was surprised on both fronts.  </li>
            <li>I was using a product Called Ro... Argan Oil Body Conditioner from a natural store chain that Rhymes with BLUSH..</li>
            <li>Results, Soft Skin.</li>
            <li>If you do not scrub it off your shower floor after each use when you go to step in the next day its very slippery.</li>
            <li>Compare to Lush&#x27;s body conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and yet my skin felt soft.</li>
            <li>has complained of it being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t tell if it is completely washed off</li>
            <li>after using this, it left my skin feeling really greasy and it took forever to soak into my skin....</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, but not sticky.</li>
            <li>My skin is silky soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that it makes your shower floor really slippery.</li>
            <li>My legs are so soft after using this in the shower.  </li>
            <li>And, it leaves my skin feeling silky soft.</li>
            <li>Added work, but soft skin.</li>
            <li>It made me smell like an overly perfumed old woman.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel silky, soft, and hydrated.</li>
            <li>No messy hands</li>
            <li>However, I stopped using it because it left a very slippery film on the bottom of my shower tub.</li>
            <li>Overall works very well.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin really soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Really soft body after using.</li>
            <li>and wow it does get on Amazon and buy it</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like a old grandma&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both use this and have noticed that it has improved our complexion and restored a natural glow to our skin.  </li>
            <li>Now its nearly two months</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft after using this product.</li>
            <li>however  i am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I needed to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a bias from knowing that I put the lotion on, so I asked my partner to tough my right arm, then my left and see if he noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>My husband is a general contractor in Northern New Jersey.  </li>
            <li>When I first used this I was unsure about it because it had a very strange texture and feeling, but after a couple days of using it</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li>I take suoer hot showers and everytime i would dry myself with my towel</li>
            <li>If other scents become available, I would definitely recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li>It felt extremely oily, and made my whole shower VERY slippery, so use caution, and I would advise to have some sort of grip on the bottom of the shower or bath tub if there isn&#x27;t already one.</li>
            <li>As a daily swimmer my skin is super dry from the chemicals in the pool.</li>
            <li>After a week of use my skin is back to being super dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li>I love it and a little of it goes a long way to moisturized one&#x27;s skin .</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way; we use a nickel-size dollop at most.</li>
            <li>A bottle won&#x27;t last more than a month and a half or so if used daily.</li>
            <li>Also,  left a film in my shower that required more scrubbing than its usual cleaning.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t describe it exactly, but overall I&#x27;m left with an impression</li>
            <li>He is not typically a &amp;#34;lotion guy&amp;#34;, but when I brought home Nivea In-Shower Lotion, he had to try it.  </li>
            <li>This particular version has almond oil in the product, so anyone who may have an allergy to nuts may want to use a different version of this product.  </li>
            <li>I think its worth a try for anyone who normally applies body lotion everyday.</li>
            <li>No other lotions seem to make my skin feel as soft or as moisturized.</li>
            <li>The Olay is a little slippery on the tub, but not nearly as bad as the Nivea.  </li>
            <li>This is my second bottle the first one I got from Target me and my daughter saw the display and I was very curious about this product and if it would really work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the face cream since high school &amp; recently started using the body lotion.</li>
            <li>Generally I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li>The only complaint i have is that there isn&#x27;t a scent free option, as Niveas lotion scents are too much for me.</li>
            <li>First, if you follow the directions, you apply this to your wet skin and then rinse it off.</li>
            <li>This is honestly the only thing I&#x27;ve found that really helps my dry skin without irritating sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do feel a little greasy when I first get out of the shower but as soon as I towel off my skin feels well moisturized and normal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of the product, but I definitely won&#x27;t repurchase unless they make new scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the scent</li>
            <li>I had just enough to put on half of my body, so I applied evenly to just the right side after doing my normal washing.</li>
            <li>really helped with his dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>, my skin was dry, parched, and very itchy.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it does leave a residue on the shower/tub that requires more than just a rinse.</li>
            <li>It only takes a few seconds to rub on &amp; lightly rinse off.</li>
            <li>As for the product itself, I am finding that HOURS later, my skin is still nice and soft and not the least bit dry!</li>
            <li>only problem (and not really a problem ) is right after you rinse it off, get out of the shower immediately.</li>
            <li>Last step of my shower, pat dry, and I&#x27;m ready to get dressed!  </li>
            <li>This is the first product that has allowed me to shave daily without severe dry skin issues on my legs.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for me as I don&#x27;t like waiting for lotion to dry after the shower or having to apply cold lotion on freezing days!  </li>
            <li>I imagine if a single application has made a small difference, then using it often will turn my skin baby smooth!</li>
            <li>I use it for my eczema; it really helps with dry skin!</li>
            <li>much prefer putting on moisturizer AFTER i dry off!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I had rinsed it off enough as my skin felt very slick.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and after putting on this product it feels smooth and moisturized for less than an hour</li>
            <li>It has proven to be kind of a disappointment as After use of this product, I still need to lather myself in high end lotion after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, a little goes a long way, good base moiturizer.  </li>
            <li>Actually it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize for a long time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m outside a lot &amp; my skin still feels soft.</li>
            <li>It definitely made my skin irresistibly soft.</li>
            <li>This body lotion reminds me of using baby oil after showering only it&#x27;s no where near as oily.</li>
            <li>Skin still feels soft next morning.</li>
            <li>Skin stays soft until my shower the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>of warning: Rinse your tub well with hot water after using and dry the tub with a towel before your next shower or you could possibly die.</li>
            <li>Since using this product, I am 100% clear of&lt;br /&gt;all dry patches and my skin (legs) is completely healed.</li>
            <li>on my normal areas or on my dry areas.</li>
            <li>and I still slipped and fell due the oily residue it lleaves, and it also made my hair very greasy from just rinsing the conditioner out.</li>
            <li>It only takes an extra minute or so in the shower and it leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized for about 24 hours after applying it.</li>
            <li>No dry skin now.</li>
            <li>I find this has a strong perfume that is not pleasant for a man.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is curious or just loves lotion.</li>
            <li>Much beterm than other similar products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Also some complained of slippery tub afterwards which is true</li>
            <li>I live in AZ in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for that sample, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have heard of it or walked right past it at the store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, put it on right after I finished my usual routine and slathered this stuff on.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but also dry skin</li>
            <li>I have always had extremely dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I towel dry by blotting my skin with a soft towel and then finish drying using a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>And since you have to take an extra 5 minutes to wash your whole shower after, it&#x27;s really not worth it.</li>
            <li>I take my regular hot shower applied the lotion and dried myself</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product is great, because I just need to apply to my skin in the shower, then rinse off!</li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This product is great and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky or filmy.</li>
            <li> This is a great concept- Applying your lotion while you are in the shower.</li>
            <li> It is great for people like me who don&#x27;t take the time to apply lotion or procrastinate about doing it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product...especially when in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> Just what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li> great product.  </li>

            <li> This stuff works great</li>
            <li> The cost is great, compared to brick and mortar stores.  </li>
            <li> Great smell.</li>
            <li> It feels great but smells</li>
            <li> Great for my guy who hates lotioning and feeling &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve got to get more!!</li>
            <li> Very nice Scent.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice in-shower lotion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> but this is amazing!</li>
            <li> and he said he liked it!</li>
            <li> Its the best product and leaves my skin smooth nourished and happy.</li>
            <li> lol I just love it!</li>
            <li> Am thinking that whatever makes it continue to moisturize my skin after it&#x27;s rinsed off may not be good for my drain.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it works fairly well, and my skin does feel a bit softer and doesnt get any sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> A good idea if you want to cover your body in petroleum-based product.  </li>
            <li> , it seems like I have to use a lot of it to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> It is good if you want a lighter lotion, like for the summer.</li>
            <li> My mom loved it.</li>
            <li> What good is that?</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thinking this can&#x27;t be good for the drain as the oil will build up over time and clog the drain.</li>
            <li> And for me, I knew it was a winner even before we tried it, because it has earned the Good Housekeeping Seal...</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Gives good moisture to lock in hydration in the shower.</li>
            <li> Then everyone I bunked with this weekend had used it and loved it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> good- not greasy</li>
            <li> This product is so good that even after towel drying it still is on your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good solution for Psoriasis and Eczema as well.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job and feels good on my skin</li>
            <li> Great on your skin and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Awesome:):)</li>
            <li> Works great, but needs to smell better</li>
            <li> It smells ok, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work great?</li>
            <li> This is ok as a moisturizer but great as a shave lotion.</li>
            <li> This right here is the best thing ever</li>
            <li> and it has a very pleasant fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> We went out and got my husband  some magic too!</li>
            <li> During hot summer months, this in-shower lotion is great!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> but I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I promise you, you will love it and never want anything else!</li>
            <li> It also saves time because you don&#x27;t have to wait for the lotion to &amp;#34;soak in.&amp;#34;  Love it!</li>
            <li> Totally love!  </li>
            <li> but I love this!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> If youre any way like me who hates lotion then this is definetly for you :)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for close to a week now, and I love it!</li>
            <li> And it would have smelled better!</li>
            <li> Hopefully they&#x27;ll come out with a softer, more pleasant, feminine smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh, clean, wonderful smell that just makes you happy.</li>
            <li> Feels great while I&#x27;m in the shower, but the feeling wears off very quick and I still have to apply lotion afterwards</li>
            <li> If you have healthy skin and your looking for a very light moisturizer this is perfect (will leave you with smooth feeling</li>
            <li> : Amazing.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel amazing</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> How about some scents like lilac, rose, lavender, orchid, honeysuckle....</li>
            <li> Really liked this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It also rinses nicely</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice idea</li>
            <li> It feels nice, but I haven&#x27;t noticed an increased moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> A nice luxury product for your bath or shower.</li>
            <li> Had me rubbing across my own skin...</li>
            <li> Really nice.</li>
            <li> It shortens my morning routine which is nice.</li>
            <li> My skin is nice and moisturized, no slathered lotion post shower needed.</li>
            <li> Not sticky to touch skin after use which is nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear lotion, sunblock, foundation, creams, anything like that because honestly, it makes me sweat.</li>
            <li> I have used baby oil with aloe vera in my shower and have liked it.</li>
            <li> I received this at a discounted price from Amazon for an honest review</li>
            <li> I recieved a sample of this for an honest review, so here it is.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and smells very clean!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, has a wonderful clean but not overbearing scent, and rinses well but still leaves your skin silky throughout the day.</li>
            <li> But I found Nivea&#x27;s (out of shower) Essentially rich lotion &amp; I am happy with that for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this on Amazon at a great price (with a coupon) as I&#x27;ve been looking for an in-shower lotion to try to speed up my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Almond oil is rich in vitamin A, B and E, which are great for skin health.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it was  magic, my skin felt wonderful.</li>
            <li> and the idea is wonderful in saving time and making the most of moisturizing when it can really be locked in best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bought it &amp; from the first time, I loved it!</li>
            <li> Excitedly, I even told a woman in the grocery store how amazing this stuff was!</li>
            <li> It rubbed on very smoothly and because of the steam, the pleasant fragrance filled the shower.</li>
            <li> Nivea makes some wonderful products and I am glad to see they are expanding their product line because they are capable of so much more.</li>
            <li> The best in-shower moisturizer I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li> My favorite lotion now in the shower!!!!!LOVE!!I love saving time and being nice and warm in the shower while applying lotion.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how effective this product may be.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST shower lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> this product is a good choice if you will enjoy Nivea products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not flowery/girly, just a pleasant clean smell.</li>
            <li> The best in all the world is Ro&#x27;s Argon from Lush (in shower moisturizer).</li>
            <li> The lotion smells great and is priced right.</li>
            <li> SO easy and affective!</li>
            <li> My skin dries out easily and I can tell that the moisture is staying throughout the day!</li>
            <li> Love love love this, favorite item!</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and unisex.</li>
            <li> However, if you have a very smooth shower floor, it may be more slippery.  </li>
            <li> Love it so good for my  &amp;#34;psoriasis&amp;#34; thanks Walmart !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge relief for me!</li>
            <li> like Olay fragrance better.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this product works as described.</li>
            <li> Love this product for summer.</li>
            <li> But the more water I let run over me, it didn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> Oh, love.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok-</li>
            <li> I still prefer the baby oil much more.</li>
            <li> I want to compare it to some thing I have been using for many years made by Aveeno--their &amp;#34;Creamy Bath Oil&amp;#34; and their &amp;#34;Bath Oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a better fragrance, but it works the way it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> , I love this lotion , I love how it&#x27;s smells, how is leaving my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion.</li>
            <li> healthy option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.  </li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> My wife love this lotion thank you</li>
            <li> I have skin that flares up with eczema with many products.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll fall in love with it</li>
            <li> But the effect seems soso, just ok</li>
            <li> Winter requires more moisturizing that this can offer alone, however.</li>
            <li> This is why I love the concept of Nivea’s</li>
            <li> Ok but I still put lotion on</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but I do not think it moisturizes as well as the Olay in the shower lotion does.</li>
            <li> I love themild scent as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Better than the Jergens version</li>
            <li> Love this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been a day since I shaved and my legs are still smooth and they haven&#x27;t hurt a bit!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling wonderful, will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Also great for showering at the gym for example to skip the whole putting-lotion-extra-quick-naked-in-front-of-people thing.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> And talk about the price compared to oil of olay, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> This is just another marketing gimick to get you to buy more product.</li>
            <li> Personally I love it.</li>
            <li> &amp; it isn&#x27;t the easiest top to close.</li>
            <li> Love the concept.</li>
            <li> but my skins does feel softer :)  </li>
            <li> ( I am so glad that someone mentioned that it  causes the shower to get slippery because I took steps to make sure I didn&#x27;t slip and fall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Olay version and I think I like this one better.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell better too.</li>
            <li> an okay in shower lotion.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product I just wish they would get scented lotions as well.</li>
            <li> Would like more scents.</li>
            <li> I can feel that my skin is now more moisturized, smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> but I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of  this.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Hotel&#x27;s have more money than I do for drain opening services.</li>
            <li> love not having to get out of shower and then add lotion.</li>
            <li> I obtained a sample of this in my Walmart Beauty Box and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The scent is great, and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add more of a review after a couple of uses, but for now, thumbs up.</li>
            <li> My arms and legs were radiant and smooth!</li>
            <li> The concept of in-shower lotion is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the extra-dry formulation mostly out of curiosity and because I&#x27;d seen the ads on TV.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than remembering to put on lotion after the shower, which I always forgot to do.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love Nivea&#x27;s In-Shower body lotion</li>
            <li> I read the warning on the label before using and made sure to thoroughly rinse the shower floor, however, the lotion still seems to leave a slippery residue.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this.  </li>
            <li> and I would assume that most people that wear lotions</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t bother them will love it.</li>
            <li> everyone, this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> wish it came in fragrance free!</li>
            <li> Still love the the product.</li>
            <li> I believe this product lasts longer and better nourishes my skin.</li>
            <li> You would be better off using baby oil - which doesn&#x27;t moisturize well in my opinion - than using this product.</li>
            <li> I love the iea</li>
            <li> but if your looking for noticeably more moisturized skin</li>
            <li> would give this product more stars if it were not marketed for In-Shower use.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I will gladly repurchase over &amp; over again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not awful, but I would not bu again.</li>
            <li> The almond oil in this product is has so many benefits for your skin.  </li>
            <li> It rejuvenates your skin by promoting healthy skin renewal.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this.  </li>
            <li> But anyway--- This product has a great deal more in the bottle and costs a fair amount less $$ than my Aveeno products do, so if I like it as well (or even more?!)</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, smells good.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, though, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> formula for dry skin works the best as its thicker and won&#x27;t run off as you&#x27;re using it.  </li>
            <li> This seemed like an easy way to skip a step in the morning, and it&#x27;s an OK moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Another wonderful thing is when you get out of the shower and dry off there isn&#x27;t any residue on your towel</li>
            <li> the most nourishing bod lotion from Nivea just got cheaper and more available than ever.</li>
            <li> I then tried this product again by toweling off lightly, then applying the product followed by a VERY light rinse.</li>
            <li> My skin is beyond smooth and I smell fantastic!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, it last a full day.</li>
            <li> The product seems better fit for summer use or a warmer climate than Michigan in the winter.</li>
            <li> Kind of a strange way to use it, but a great product.</li>
            <li> With the summer heat in, I&#x27;m not so sure whether the Almond oil may be too moisturizing, but this gives us a fun shower experience each time!</li>
            <li> So easy to use while in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to moisturize, and you do it in in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Not too girly so could easily be used by a man or teenagers.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to cut out one more step in moisturizing - not having to get out of the shower, dry, then put on lotion.  </li>
            <li> and this felt like a very mild moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is easy to remember to use since it is applied during the shower.</li>
            <li> So easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> You easily apply it while still in the shower and then wash it off.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t something that I would want or need to use daily, but once or twice a week it is nice to get a really good hydration routine going on.</li>
            <li> It is fairly strong smelling to me when in the shower.</li>
            <li> This item is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Leaves me feeling perfectly moisturized although I still lotion super dry parts.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Read the fine print.  </li>
            <li> This makes it so easy and no sticky feeling just smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Still need to wear lotion afterwards during winter but warmer months its fine wearing alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating it 3 stars because I think it&#x27;s a fine moisturizer</li>
            <li> but if you are in a hurry just using this bodywash is fine.</li>
            <li> the smell is mild which I love as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product, great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as potent as after shower lotion, but certainly helps keep my skin feeling smooth!</li>
            <li> Huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li> The Nivea does make your skin silky smooth, but it also makes your tub fall on your a** slippery.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product to try.</li>
            <li> I use it in every shower and can genuinely feel that my skin is moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> ,  it has a light fragrance,  which I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> Leaves a very slippery surface, feels nice on the skin though.</li>
            <li> Skin is lightly moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasantly light scent that fades so you won&#x27;t be smelling it all day</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic - not too flowery.</li>
            <li> This is great does not left you feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> and I have incredibly smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I told my husband how smooth my skin felt, he touched and agreed.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this stuff.</li>
            <li> and the same great scent as the lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells great the only reason</li>
            <li> and this has still been working great though it has only been the spring/summer</li>
            <li> It does not have any kind of &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell to it whatsoever, and my husband, who is not prone to moisturizing his body post-shower, will do the in-shower moisturization without too much kvetching.</li>
            <li> Great daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t care for it is because it works too well, lol.</li>
            <li> gave the product two stars because it has a light, non-offensive scent and no oily residue.</li>
            <li> But price and ability to moisturizer is a great back up!</li>
            <li> Wish it were unscented or lightly scented.</li>
            <li> in all though, I love how my skin feels, and love that it really lasts.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, feels nice, and has the basic Nivea scent to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m good to go with the rest of my morning routine and my skin is prepared to step out in the wild Wisconsin winter.</li>
            <li> Very Easy to use, probably will not fully replace my regular body lotion, but it is better than no lotion of the days I am in a hurry!</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of using this luxurious moisturizing cream right in the shower.  </li>
            <li> so is very useful for me.</li>
            <li> But this is a very nice product overall.</li>
            <li> Especially with summer just around the corner~&lt;br /&gt;The smell is really pleasant and it really did make my skin feel nice and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super easy to use and keeps my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This in shower lotion should be advertise more because I&#x27;m sure many consumers are unaware it exists.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting lotion that&#x27;s for the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been lazy applying moisturizer after shower, the in-shower lotion is perfect as I get to remember using it every day.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent, not more flakes.</li>
            <li> In addition, the smell, which is great in the bottle, for some reason smells very strange when applied.</li>
            <li> It also has a clean linen type of scent , but isn&#x27;t too over powering in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great skin product to use during those dry winter months.</li>
            <li> Super smooth and hydrated after.</li>
            <li> They recommend you then clean the tub/shower</li>
            <li> Clean scent.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin</li>
            <li> i still use my after shower moisturizer because of how dry my skin is, but i think this stuff will be great in the summer.</li>
            <li> i love the scent its very fresh and also really moisturizes your skin with out a greasy feel</li>
            <li> No oily residue, just nice soft skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, and you do it right in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again but wouldn&#x27;t say not to try it, seems like a fine product and fresh scent that&#x27;s not overly strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and does a great job, but the price is really ridiculous.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR SUPER DRY SKIN!</li>
            <li> Love it but makes your tub very slippery</li>
            <li> leaves to much slippery slim in the bottom of the tube and smells more lie shave cream</li>
            <li> I read a lot of good reviews prior to purchasing</li>
            <li> it does leave my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Only drawback doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the Olay.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product last year in germany and LOVED IT.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the american formula is not as good; it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling as moisturized.</li>
            <li> They love it so much.</li>
            <li> Good moisture that last about all day.</li>
            <li> No bad marks yet-just haven&#x27;t tried it as yet.</li>
            <li> but  it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> Love using this new in shower lotion, leaves skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> It builds up VERY quickly on the walls  requiring more frequent shower cleanings.  </li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and find baby oil is much more effective than this product.  </li>
            <li> It really has a lot of lotion characteristics but gets you very clean.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best!</li>
            <li> Step out of the shower feeling nice and clean and not &#x27;dry&#x27; but not greasy.</li>
            <li> and this helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li> but it gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s placebo effect because it&#x27;s essentially like putting hair conditioner all over your body, and since your palm is now slippery, your skin feels slippery and &amp;#34;moisturized.&amp;#34; Honestly doesn&#x27;t seem to be a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It goes on quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky at all.  </li>
            <li> as described with quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than most regular lotions on the market.  </li>
            <li> At this rate I will run out quickly and still have to use lotion to moisturize my body.</li>
            <li> This product is really easy to apply in the shower, has only a very light scent which doesn&#x27;t persist after rinsing, which I&#x27;m sure men will appreciate, and really works.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin while taking my showers, the only issue is that you must clean your shower or bathtub right away because it get really slippery and greasy</li>
            <li> it sure makes your skin nice and soft .so if you like soft skin like I do.</li>
            <li> First, this is a huge bottle -- I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention to this fact when I placed my order.  </li>
            <li> You do have to rinse shower out with very hot water after use or else will leave a sticky film.</li>
            <li> Really works and skin feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin in the shower.</li>
            <li> we bought some new bodywash, lol and tried this for it&#x27;s actual moisturizing purpose.</li>
            <li> Anyway after two weeks and a whole bottle of this my skin looks better, no dry skin itch, and I Love this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t use too much you will be fine</li>
            <li> I would have been happy with a little bit softer since this winter is making me itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> product really does make my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Worth reordering.</li>
            <li> Stays effective for several days!</li>
            <li> So much better than the 32 dollar Lush version.</li>
            <li> I can never seem to fit in the time to apply standard moisturizer in the mornings, and find myself forgetting more times than not.</li>
            <li> so much fun.</li>
            <li> The intended results aren&#x27;t worth the safety risk.</li>
            <li> This gave me slightly better results, as I could tell my skin was somewhat soft immediately after use, but with no oily residue.</li>
            <li> The oil helps maintaining moisture levels of the skin and gets absorbed without blocking the pores.  </li>
            <li> Not only great for my laziness but also cuts lotion &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; time completely away.</li>
            <li> luckily, it fades, but for the first hour or so i can smell it.</li>
            <li> Both were great except Olay is very heavily scented, while Nivea is mild.</li>
            <li> For folks with severely dry skin this seems to be the best option to hydrate and moisturize dry skin.</li>
            <li> because who&#x27;s got time for that, right?</li>
            <li> But that would get rid of it, right?</li>
            <li> i got a sample from a magazine &amp; went out &amp; bought it right away.</li>
            <li> Okay, this might sound strange because I rated it 5 stars, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan.&lt;br /&gt;I rated it 5 stars because it does exactly what it says it does, this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> havent noticed any major changes in my skin , but i still believe its an ok product.</li>
            <li> An incredible lotion for extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry, sensitive skin; so this sounded like a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> it was sticky and i know they wared about making sure that its washed away to avoid slipping but its not that easy to do unless you9 have a hand held shower which i dont....</li>
            <li> I had tried this in place of my normal cheap baby oil.</li>
            <li> very light and clean, but within an hour my dry skin was itching again unless I used another lotion.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels great and it&#x27;s actually easier to use than regular lotion.  </li>
            <li> Super when you in a hurry, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an old lady perfume smell to me, and it&#x27;s fairly strong.</li>
            <li> After the first try I was hooked, my dry and itchy skin gone, amazing.</li>
            <li> My husband like this very much.</li>
            <li> After stepping out of the shower my skin is soft and not even close to being dry; best of all, it definitely stays that way</li>
            <li> I feel so fresh &amp; clean after I get out of the shower, plus my skin felt soft &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> I will most likely buy this product, especislly with summer coming soon!</li>
            <li> Only thing that would make it better would be putting it in a pump bottle.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I do use a daily after shower spray to help with mildew buildup though, so I can&#x27;t say for sure that nothing would build up if I didn&#x27;t use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband even uses it ;) would defintely buy again.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely softer and more nourished, but I still need to lotion my feet, elbows, and hands after showering to feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> (I did not notice that my shower/tub was more slippery, but I can definitely understand that you are NOT to put this on the bottom of your feet).  </li>
            <li> only criticism would be that I wish there were more scent options.</li>
            <li> So soft, so smooth.</li>
            <li> but I still have to be careful about touching my legs for a full day after I shave.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this for the first time yesterday and you don&#x27;t have to put lotion on after you</li>
            <li> Will most likely purchase it again</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t even begin to explain how much I adore it!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Occitane and Neutrogena Oil work much better applied to damp skin once you are outside the shower/tub stall.</li>
            <li> Great, moisturizing, and long lasting in shower body lotion.</li>
            <li> first time trying it..</li>
            <li> and it makes life so much easier!</li>
            <li> I use it differently since I love to take baths instead of showers.</li>
            <li> This leaves more residue than regular lotion.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell but it does not last.</li>
            <li> This product works at first</li>
            <li> Hot water does not wash it away.</li>
            <li> becomes evident.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft &amp; beautiful after the shower &amp; I love following it up with the regular Nivea lotion on those super dry days.</li>
            <li> Luckily I read the label carefully before using and I was able to return it.</li>
            <li> My skin is very, very dry year-round, and most lotions I have tried have either dried out, made me feel greasy, or don&#x27;t have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The scent itself is very neutral and smells as though it might change due to body chemistry (as in, smelling more feminine on females and more masculine on males).</li>
            <li> It might be suitable as a shaving cream or maybe as a product for someone without dry skin (maybe summer use?), but not for me!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and stays silky smooth after gently rinsing before toweling dry.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t leave the sticky lotion feel that I absolutely hate, and the smell is light and is good for guys and girls!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really moisturize very well!</li>
            <li> I have tried the other brand (Olay) of &amp;#34;in shower&amp;#34; lotion too and it isn&#x27;t anywhere near as good as this one is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely try to be conscious to not use too much at once, because I think it would be easy to run through the bottle pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Rinses off easily and your skin doesn&#x27;t feel like it has anything extra on it.</li>
            <li> Its creamy/oily, like, obviously putting on lotion, but it washed off easily</li>
            <li> I was so glad it came out around winter when skin is always dry.</li>
            <li> I feel like I rinse and towel dry off more of the lotion than what soaks into my skin.</li>
            <li> make sure you pat yourself dry.</li>
            <li> Great for new moms since we have such limited time to ourselves.</li>
            <li> There are certain items that Nivea manufactures in Europe that are still not sold in the U.S.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use a large amount of it each day so that could be why.</li>
            <li> This is a great substitute as you take your shower like normal, apply this on your body while in the shower, rinse yourself, hose down the shower quickly, pat dry, lotion on your face, lotion on your feet and night-night.</li>
            <li> I bought the formular for extreamly dry skin and it is really just OK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little luxury.</li>
            <li> Works so good on hard water effects of skin</li>
            <li> It is extremely soothing for dry skin; it&#x27;s great for irritation and inflammation of the skin too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize very well.</li>
            <li> It works precisely the same way in that you apply it after you soap up and rinse then apply the product and rinse accordingly.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Done and ready to towel off and go.</li>
            <li> Also take caution that if you use too much of this product, your shower floor will get very slippery.</li>
            <li> When I use it on my legs or abdomen it works really well.  </li>
            <li> I started using this and didn&#x27;t think it was doing that much, so I took a break.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin wasn&#x27;t as smooth as it was when I was using it, so now I think it is making a big difference.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to apply as much lotion out of the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t care so much for the smell.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling smooth and nourished and there’s no sticky feel either.</li>
            <li> Idon&#x27;t have to use much at all</li>
            <li> And after using this for a couple weeks, I can really tell the difference in my skin</li>
            <li> so need as much moisture as I can get</li>
            <li> but this product really performed.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really do that much for me.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no worse than bubble bath</li>
            <li> It rinses off well and really does leave your skin feel like you&#x27;ve used lotion.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see much difference in appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to start your day with the softest body ever.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing...not much foam.  </li>
            <li> Makes things so much easier than doing lotion after the shower...</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes for days.</li>
            <li> I took my time to really work this into my skin before the rinse; I think that made all the difference.  </li>
            <li> It really works really well.</li>
            <li> It really DOES cause the shower floor to be slippery.</li>
            <li> We just really didn&#x27;t care for it at all.</li>
            <li> I use this product after I shower at night, so that my skin has just enough moisture to help me sleep comfortably at night.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin moisturizing for the whole day and stops my skin getting itchy in winter.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different lotions, but I really enjoy this product a lot.  </li>
            <li> On one hand, it does moisturize to a degree, and given time it feels like my skin really drinks it up.</li>
            <li> No matter how light I apply, and how well I rinse, I&#x27;m left feeling greasy after my shower.</li>
            <li> my skin&#x27;s condition has really improved a lot, with or without this lotion</li>
            <li> /&gt;He is very averse to perfumed anything on his body.</li>
            <li> This actually passed his nose; it has a light fragrance</li>
            <li> I really like how my skin feels after using this product.</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference when I do not use it.</li>
            <li> It keeps me moisturized and makes getting ready in the mornings so much easier.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in it</li>
            <li> This really does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t notice it making my shower unusually</li>
            <li> : The scent is very floral, and I&#x27;m not trying to smell like a funeral.</li>
            <li> , I really like the idea of this product</li>
            <li> but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Some products I have tried out, have really caused me to fall, but then again maybe I&#x27;m just clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t expect much, but i actually really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very greasy and once you emerge from the shower, your skin does feel moisturized and it lasts for maybe one hour.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I rinse off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also smooth and silky enough to shave your legs with.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would work for me.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this product without having to also apply lotion after showering, defeating the whole purpose of it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY SLIPPERY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as a thick lotion</li>
            <li> I broke my first bottle from putting it down without the top secured.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not quite rich enough for my very dry skin, but for someone with normal to only slightly dry skin it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> my skin drinks it right up and is soft all day</li>
            <li> right arm is super soft, but your left is kind of rough.&amp;#34; I was extremely surprised that he noticed, after just a single application.</li>
            <li> Moisturize and absorbs better than other in shower lotions brands and does not leave the shower floor as slippery as the others.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this when I saw the commercial on TV.</li>
            <li> I would use this in conjunction with my other lotions jusy because i like the smells iof them more.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to  let the hot water run  for a few minutes after you rinse...</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but it&#x27;s not worth it because it made my shower floor tiles really slippery, so now I&#x27;ll have to degrease them.</li>
            <li> The absolute best part, is I don&#x27;t have weird slimy hands afterwards like regular lotion.</li>
            <li> The first time, I was amazed by how well it worked and how soft my skin felt all day;</li>
            <li> I purchased to try as I normally use the Olay in Shower and this one leaves my skin so much softer &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> I fully intend to purchase a full bottle of this and use it daily.</li>
            <li> Great concept, but thumbs down on an application that puts you at risk of slipping!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you do rinse down your shower or tub well as it can get slippery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the scent just OK, but it doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin at all and washes down the drain with the lotion.</li>
            <li> Though you still feel a little slimy - this in-shower lotion offers a nice compromise.</li>
            <li> I told him about this new product I&#x27;m using from Nivea and he wanted to use it as well!</li>
            <li> am a very large man - bodybuilder, and the tube doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;Really loved the sheen that it leaves on the skin like nivea lotion, and the relief from dry skin in the winter from the dry</li>
            <li> As for its effectiveness -- it does leave my skin feeling less taut and tender after a shower, and I&#x27;m able to use a lighter body lotion once out of the shower than what I would need if I hadn&#x27;t already moisturized in the shower.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, or if you just want to feel silky and smooth after bathing, this is the ticket for you.  </li>
            <li> This product is decent.  </li>
            <li> Goes on quickly and it definitely makes your skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> I know that it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use mainly on legs and arms.</li>
            <li> It actually works, but would suggest investing in a good lotion too if you don&#x27;t shower everyday.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients in advance, but the main ingredient is petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> The product works really well, but the smell is very masculine.</li>
            <li> It really leaves my skin feeling soft and supple after bath or shower!  </li>
            <li> Recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt I will use the rest of what is in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Highly recomend</li>
            <li> Has nice, clean, subtle smell that doesn&#x27;t last if you don&#x27;t like it, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> the firmuls is rich and you do have to be careful because it is kind of slick so avoid your soles of the feet.</li>
            <li> Three stars for this product is generous - I would give it two but to be fair I do have REALLY dry skin on the bottom half of my legs.</li>
            <li> I did purchase another bottle of this because I had a coupon, just have to be really careful that I don&#x27;t fall down, and I have to make sure to clean the tub after every shower so hubby doesn&#x27;t get in and fall on his arse.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that rough spots (elbows, for example) are completely smooth now.  </li>
            <li> I have super dry skin;  I wash with Dr Woods Almond Castile soap and then coat myself with The Body Shop Shea Butter just to make my skin comfortable thru the dry winters in the NE.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply normal lotion to bottom of feet once seated on bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin no longer is itchy and just feels normal.</li>
            <li> I use it anyway because it is worth the extra cleaning!</li>
            <li> At least it smells nice.</li>
            <li> and I am pretty sure it is clogging my pipes too, as the drain is running slowly since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, if you wear lotion normally, you&#x27;ll like this.</li>
            <li> You notice the smell first, it smells really nice and not like a usual drug store lotion (yes i am an indie snob)</li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t feel like it is any slicker than normal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a normal shower flor though</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as the Olay lotion, nor does it smell as nice.</li>
            <li> So quick notes -- I live in north wisconsin, from CA originally, dry winter weather is a whole new beast for me.</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and that it gives enough moisture unless you have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to be able to cut out the lotion part and save some time in the morning with this in shower lotion for extra dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My very dry winter skin immediately felt smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I guess is not very eco friendly because you have to use water to rinse ir, but i like to get out the shower and get dress</li>
            <li> This product is great in theory, applying moisturing lotion to your skin while you are still in the shower, but it&#x27;s not worth the risk of slipping in the tub or shower by the residue left after you wash it off.</li>
            <li> I mean my legs were super smooth, but they didn&#x27;t feel sensitive at all!</li>
            <li> live in Arizona</li>
            <li> Please note that I did not tell him i used any new moisturizer</li>
            <li> Smell is slightly lemony, but very mild and not offensive at all.</li>
            <li> Using this daily really helps, and its so much faster to apply in the shower, quick rinse and dry off.  </li>
            <li> so I would often do without (despite my super dry and sometimes itchy skin).</li>
            <li> Great Product, you save time and no sticky feel afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect if you are in a hurry or are just tired of the lotion routine.&lt;br /&gt;However some extra is needed for just shaved legs if you want your skin to glow.</li>
            <li> My skin is super dry in the midAtlantic winters, so any additional sources of moisture that I can find, I will try.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin when I shave my legs</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> So silky soft!</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> But after a few hours my legs would look like cracked old dried out wood lol.</li>
            <li> Of all the body moisturises I have tried over the years at all price levels this is the first product that actually works.</li>
            <li> I skip lotion, unbelievable:)</li>
            <li> and this leaves my skin soft and moisturized, without leaving yucky feeling on my hands, or making my pants stick to my skin!</li>
            <li> I have tried one too many lotion brands in the past.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with this problem for years and boom just like that it has been fixed!</li>
            <li> Bought it just to try....ended up being pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> But it is thick and rich and I use it right after my shower and don&#x27;t rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> Great product barely scented and feels amazing only bad thing is that it took a long time to get here</li>
            <li> Feels nice but not better then actually moisturizing after a shower.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was at night and when I woke up the next morning, my skin was really soft.</li>
            <li> I like being able to put lotion in the shower, but even if this is for &amp;#34;very dry skin&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t seem as hydrating as other lotions you apply normally.</li>
            <li> I went through quite a bit, as I put it on all my appendages and torso (I am SO DRY AND ITCHY EVERYWHERE right now with this weather).</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too strong like some lotions and it&#x27;s not the plain smell either.</li>
            <li> It may not feel like your moistured iimmediately but after a little bit you can feel that your skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It does indeed leave shower surfaces very slick, so do make sure you rinse these down with a healthy dose of extra-hot water once you&#x27;re out of the shower to prevent any accidents from happening the next time someone bathes.</li>
            <li> Right after shower, skin really feels smooth and hidrated, but a few hours later, it starts getting dry, even flaky.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s very moisturizing--however: they warn you on the bottle to be careful, because you apply it in the shower, with the water running, which takes the runoff onto the tub or shower floor, which then becomes very slippery.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft- not sticky or greasy</li>
            <li> andI really wish they were; such as their bath oil</li>
            <li> Really surprised on how well this stuff washed off.</li>
            <li> It may not be for you in the end, but it&#x27;s fixed a lot of the issues I&#x27;ve been having.</li>
            <li> Though if you do not wash this off completely you will get a bit of that lotion feel on your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but putting this on in the shower is much easier than using regular lotion after.</li>
            <li> I was surprised on both fronts.  </li>
            <li> I was using a product Called Ro... Argan Oil Body Conditioner from a natural store chain that Rhymes with BLUSH..</li>
            <li> Results, Soft Skin.</li>
            <li> If you do not scrub it off your shower floor after each use when you go to step in the next day its very slippery.</li>
            <li> Compare to Lush&#x27;s body conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and yet my skin felt soft.</li>
            <li> has complained of it being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t tell if it is completely washed off</li>
            <li> after using this, it left my skin feeling really greasy and it took forever to soak into my skin....</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft, but not sticky.</li>
            <li> My skin is silky soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it makes your shower floor really slippery.</li>
            <li> My legs are so soft after using this in the shower.  </li>
            <li> And, it leaves my skin feeling silky soft.</li>
            <li> Added work, but soft skin.</li>
            <li> It made me smell like an overly perfumed old woman.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel silky, soft, and hydrated.</li>
            <li> No messy hands</li>
            <li> However, I stopped using it because it left a very slippery film on the bottom of my shower tub.</li>
            <li> Overall works very well.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin really soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Really soft body after using.</li>
            <li> and wow it does get on Amazon and buy it</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like a old grandma&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both use this and have noticed that it has improved our complexion and restored a natural glow to our skin.  </li>
            <li> Now its nearly two months</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft after using this product.</li>
            <li> however  i am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I needed to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a bias from knowing that I put the lotion on, so I asked my partner to tough my right arm, then my left and see if he noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> My husband is a general contractor in Northern New Jersey.  </li>
            <li> When I first used this I was unsure about it because it had a very strange texture and feeling, but after a couple days of using it</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li> I take suoer hot showers and everytime i would dry myself with my towel</li>
            <li> If other scents become available, I would definitely recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li> It felt extremely oily, and made my whole shower VERY slippery, so use caution, and I would advise to have some sort of grip on the bottom of the shower or bath tub if there isn&#x27;t already one.</li>
            <li> As a daily swimmer my skin is super dry from the chemicals in the pool.</li>
            <li> After a week of use my skin is back to being super dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> I love it and a little of it goes a long way to moisturized one&#x27;s skin .</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way; we use a nickel-size dollop at most.</li>
            <li> A bottle won&#x27;t last more than a month and a half or so if used daily.</li>
            <li> Also,  left a film in my shower that required more scrubbing than its usual cleaning.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe it exactly, but overall I&#x27;m left with an impression</li>
            <li> He is not typically a &amp;#34;lotion guy&amp;#34;, but when I brought home Nivea In-Shower Lotion, he had to try it.  </li>
            <li> This particular version has almond oil in the product, so anyone who may have an allergy to nuts may want to use a different version of this product.  </li>
            <li> I think its worth a try for anyone who normally applies body lotion everyday.</li>
            <li> No other lotions seem to make my skin feel as soft or as moisturized.</li>
            <li> The Olay is a little slippery on the tub, but not nearly as bad as the Nivea.  </li>
            <li> This is my second bottle the first one I got from Target me and my daughter saw the display and I was very curious about this product and if it would really work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the face cream since high school &amp; recently started using the body lotion.</li>
            <li> Generally I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li> The only complaint i have is that there isn&#x27;t a scent free option, as Niveas lotion scents are too much for me.</li>
            <li> First, if you follow the directions, you apply this to your wet skin and then rinse it off.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the only thing I&#x27;ve found that really helps my dry skin without irritating sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do feel a little greasy when I first get out of the shower but as soon as I towel off my skin feels well moisturized and normal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of the product, but I definitely won&#x27;t repurchase unless they make new scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the scent</li>
            <li> I had just enough to put on half of my body, so I applied evenly to just the right side after doing my normal washing.</li>
            <li> really helped with his dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> , my skin was dry, parched, and very itchy.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does leave a residue on the shower/tub that requires more than just a rinse.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few seconds to rub on &amp; lightly rinse off.</li>
            <li> As for the product itself, I am finding that HOURS later, my skin is still nice and soft and not the least bit dry!</li>
            <li> only problem (and not really a problem ) is right after you rinse it off, get out of the shower immediately.</li>
            <li> Last step of my shower, pat dry, and I&#x27;m ready to get dressed!  </li>
            <li> This is the first product that has allowed me to shave daily without severe dry skin issues on my legs.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me as I don&#x27;t like waiting for lotion to dry after the shower or having to apply cold lotion on freezing days!  </li>
            <li> I imagine if a single application has made a small difference, then using it often will turn my skin baby smooth!</li>
            <li> I use it for my eczema; it really helps with dry skin!</li>
            <li> much prefer putting on moisturizer AFTER i dry off!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I had rinsed it off enough as my skin felt very slick.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and after putting on this product it feels smooth and moisturized for less than an hour</li>
            <li> It has proven to be kind of a disappointment as After use of this product, I still need to lather myself in high end lotion after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, a little goes a long way, good base moiturizer.  </li>
            <li> Actually it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize for a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outside a lot &amp; my skin still feels soft.</li>
            <li> It definitely made my skin irresistibly soft.</li>
            <li> This body lotion reminds me of using baby oil after showering only it&#x27;s no where near as oily.</li>
            <li> Skin still feels soft next morning.</li>
            <li> Skin stays soft until my shower the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> of warning: Rinse your tub well with hot water after using and dry the tub with a towel before your next shower or you could possibly die.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, I am 100% clear of&lt;br /&gt;all dry patches and my skin (legs) is completely healed.</li>
            <li> on my normal areas or on my dry areas.</li>
            <li> and I still slipped and fell due the oily residue it lleaves, and it also made my hair very greasy from just rinsing the conditioner out.</li>
            <li> It only takes an extra minute or so in the shower and it leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized for about 24 hours after applying it.</li>
            <li> No dry skin now.</li>
            <li> I find this has a strong perfume that is not pleasant for a man.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is curious or just loves lotion.</li>
            <li> Much beterm than other similar products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Also some complained of slippery tub afterwards which is true</li>
            <li> I live in AZ in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for that sample, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have heard of it or walked right past it at the store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, put it on right after I finished my usual routine and slathered this stuff on.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but also dry skin</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I towel dry by blotting my skin with a soft towel and then finish drying using a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> And since you have to take an extra 5 minutes to wash your whole shower after, it&#x27;s really not worth it.</li>
            <li> I take my regular hot shower applied the lotion and dried myself</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you don&#x27;t want to waste more time with applying pointless moisturisers or lotions after showering, grab a bottle of this asap!</li>
            <li> We live in South Texas, along the Gulf, and it&#x27;s all about heat and humidity down</li>
            <li> My right side was just a small amount softer than the left, just after that single use!</li>
            <li> but this year it just wasn&#x27;t helping as much as it used to and still found myself scratching my skin raw.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effect is long lasting and</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell</li>
            <li> It smells like the Nivea lotion, not bad but not great.  </li>
            <li> It does become embarrassing when I go to the gym or want to wear shorts outside, but have dry and scaly</li>
            <li> does the job but not enough moisturizing for the dry winter air.</li>
            <li> The Nivea In-Shower absorbs into your skin by the time you dry off, and I can FEEL the difference, after only two showers!  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, especially legs</li>
            <li> My skin feels totally hydrated after I dry off and for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> When I wash my hands or have the lotion removed altogether, the dry skin would come back.</li>
            <li> I have rather dry skin on my legs, especially during the winter and this product has been all of the difference.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a week</li>
            <li> Within an hour my skin was dry and itchy and I had to use regular lotion.</li>
            <li> However, once again my skin felt dry shortly after.</li>
            <li> So far I have only been using this product a few months</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and the rough patches by my elbows and backs of my arms is sooo much smoother now.</li>
            <li> I switched to the one for very dry and skin and still have the same problem.</li>
            <li> and my skin is a sensitive little five-year old.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It kind of feels like a film on your skin but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> Provided moisture long after the shower and even in places that I feel don&#x27;t hold moisture well.</li>
            <li> and I wait a few minutes, and then rinse off until it feels as if it is completely gone.</li>
            <li> -- I am still waiting for the long term results before i make my determination.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel soft for a few hours after use but not the 24 Nivea claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a fan,  made my skin feel sticky and felt like it never really soaked in like my regular lotion does.  </li>
            <li> Poured it into our bodywash pump and found it strange that it was like oil and water in that it wouldn&#x27;t mix.</li>
            <li> It leaves no greasy feeling and works for a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave you feel greasy or sticky, and it lasts all day or night long after you shower.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> As a man, I&#x27;m not good at applying lotion everyday, and even when I do it consistently, the dryness never heals up completely.</li>
            <li> Not moisturizing at all, rinses right off leaving behind no benefit.  </li>
            <li> not just because you can take of that need during shower, and its also extremely effective without creating the mess and awkward sticky</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do a thing, no moisturizer, no soft skin, nothing at all!</li>
            <li> Like any other lotion you must use regularly.</li>
            <li> Wow together we spent little over $16.00 for something we can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> We have 2 different skin types my husband purchased the extreme dry</li>
            <li> I have been using the Olay in shower lotion for a very long time and like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pat dry with towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> FYI, i have a horribly dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin gets really dry and itchy in the winter when the humidity drops.</li>
            <li> Then I pat myself dry.</li>
            <li> I do have severely dry skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> I turn off the shower, apply this lotion, then squeegee the shower doors giving it time to &#x27;sink in&#x27; - step out of the shower, pat myself dry.  </li>
            <li> but im still ashy after i dry off</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin from a medication that I take</li>
            <li> and I already have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It’s like getting a jump on your routine of having to put on lotion after you dry</li>
            <li> I struggle with EXTREMELY dry skin in the winter and some of it has become eczema.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> started using it in the winter time when my skin gets really dry</li>
            <li> I have had dry skin since.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, try this product.</li>
            <li> but I have a dry skin</li>
            <li> May not help with dry skin as well as using a lotion or body butter after shower.</li>
            <li> No need to wait for lotion to dry.</li>
            <li> I have rally dry skin and as soon as I get out of the shower, I have to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from exzema and dry skin for years.</li>
            <li> Just apply to your skin, rinse away, dry off</li>
            <li> for my dry skin, i feel like it makes no difference.  </li>
            <li> and I purchased the dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It prevents the dry cracking feeling after a shower but it does not have that greasy feeling that lotion can have.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> In the winter months I always suffer from dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> but once youre out of the shower and dry the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> I began having issues with dry skin (or eczema) when I turned 30.  </li>
            <li> It does work well for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s skin gets quite dry in the winter but getting him to remember to put on lotion….</li>
            <li> It has improved his dry skin dramatically without making him feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does not linger on the skin once you are dry.</li>
            <li> Some soaps dry you skin out.</li>
            <li> I just used it in the shower, and I must admit that I keep looking at my skin expecting it to look dry, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> you rinse off get out of the shower and go to dry off the towel sticks to your skin</li>
            <li> Perhaps this will change when the humid summertime arrives and my skin isn&#x27;t as dry; I can maybe see that the in-shower moisturization would be all I&#x27;d need at that</li>
            <li> I purchased the &amp;#34;very dry skin&amp;#34; version because of this.</li>
            <li> I have moderately dry skin in the winter, so I have no idea</li>
            <li> When I used it in the shower my skin was just as dry as if I had not used it.  </li>
            <li> Works as described and helps moisturize dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works well for me especially since I don&#x27;t like to spend the extra few minutes applying lotion afterwards</li>
            <li> THE ONLY WAY I CAN USE IT IS TO GET OUT OF SHOWER WHILE STILL WEL, APPLY THE LOTION AND DRY OFF SITTING DOWN.</li>
            <li> So my 3-star rating is the average of 4 stars for product on my skin and 2 stars for possible clogging issues.</li>
            <li> The fragrance, to begin with, is barely there and fades in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I wish it would dry less greasy and that is the sole reason I won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Yet, when my kids get out of the tub, I always rub them down with moisturizer, but often forget to do that extra pampering for myself.</li>
            <li> am such a lazy person when it comes to moisturizing my skin, but always ended up with itchy skin in the middle of sleeping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have stated, so maybe I&#x27;m using less or different flooring?  </li>
            <li> If this becomes a routine part of sower time, it is significantly less likely to be forgotten!</li>
            <li> in-shower lotion may work for those who don&#x27;t have VERY dry skin or have combination skin &amp; are always in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I tend to have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, you see, from head to toe.</li>
            <li> but then my skin feels very dry as before.</li>
            <li> But after drying it was a bit hard, so I applied a little baby lotion as well and with the two products combined, it left my hands very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Living in NY I was so excited when this product came out in hopes it would help me moisturize more routinely (its hard in the winter when its SO cold!!)</li>
            <li> The return policy requires me to send the squishy bag and contents back in order to get a replacement/refund, NOT fun!</li>
            <li> Even using daily shower spray is not helping to cut down on the slippery shower floor!</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of using moisturizing lotions that can leave a greasy feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> be careful because it does make the showers slippery..</li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this everyday.</li>
            <li> Be careful when stepping in and out of your shower as you progress in using this product.</li>
            <li> just what I expected it to be</li>
            <li> Keep some clorox wipes in the tub to avoid slipping.</li>
            <li> BTW, be careful with the bathroom floor while bathing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue, like I expected.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with slipping in the shower as I was careful when I rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We also thought the results were minimal when it came to leaving the skin feeling well-hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times after receiving it last week.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> No extra messy steps once you get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> so I am curious if this will be sufficient for the winter months as well.  </li>
            <li> After I rinsed of the lotion and dried off, I personally felt a difference.</li>
            <li> Even though I was really careful, I slipped and fell in the shower, severely twisting my ankle after using.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize your skin, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Dry skin is not fun</li>
            <li> I have to rewash or deal with stickiness all day (which is probably my fault but slightly unavoidable with long hair).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an oil slick in the shower but there is a little slipperiness near the drain.  </li>
            <li> Someone who lives in a less dry climate might not want to go with this so called level of the product, but that&#x27;s up to you and your skin.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t a total waste of money but its not worth it.</li>
            <li> This relieves his dry winter skin and his skin is noticeably less itchy when he uses this product in the shower.  </li>
            <li> This heavy duty line works well for those (I would assume) with very dry skin or live in climates where constant dry cold air in the negatives is a constant.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This results in very little of the product left on your skin.</li>
            <li> As a lady who has historically been too lazy to put on her lotion after her shower, this stuff is a game-changer.  </li>
            <li> Use carefully!</li>
            <li> At home, be careful to rinse the tub correctly thought and do not put any under you feet!</li>
            <li> I still have to use other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t made my shower slipperier like other reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just really disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t better.</li>
            <li> money well spent!</li>
            <li> I have heard other people complain about the shower being slippery.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like there was any slick, sticky, or greasy residue left on my body.</li>
            <li> The concept of an in-sower body lotion was foreign to me, so I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> You MUST rinse your shower well after using this, it will make the shower extremely slippery otherwise.</li>
            <li> Number two, I&#x27;m a grad student, with little time for &#x27;beauty&#x27; rituals, I hate putting on lotion and then pants (pet peeve, honestly)</li>
            <li> Holy cow.</li>
            <li> i could see dead dried up skin coming off (especially on my legs).</li>
            <li> , a little goes a long way, I used my very small sample for both of my entire legs.</li>
            <li> Sorry Nivea, I really do like your other products, just not this one.</li>
            <li> no more soreness due to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Skeptical about a &amp;#34;wash-off&amp;#34; lotion, expecting either something really greasy, or something that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> only complaint I have is the bottle design, I don&#x27;t like that the cap is on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I have at least three different Nivea products in my house.</li>
            <li> Not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This smells good in the bottle, but when you put it on and rinse it off it smells terrible!</li>
            <li> I feel like its money down the train .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for winter, no more dry skin for me!</li>
            <li> it came in, half the product was squirted out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a bottle and a half and have never had my shower be slippery</li>
            <li> I did notice slightly softer skin.</li>
            <li> way I never slip, I don&#x27;t have to mess with the tub, and I&#x27;m fully moisturized, all while still getting the convenience of using in-shower lotion.</li>
            <li> I have to set it down a few times while applying it</li>
            <li> But as an always late person with dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use my bath and body works sugar scrub, which can be a bit oily, and at least know that my skin won&#x27;t get dry within a couple</li>
            <li> Having no problems with the little bit of lotion on the towel coming out in the laundry either.</li>
            <li> The feeling takes a little getting used to, you notice that when you rinse it off in the shower, your skin sort of repels the water.</li>
            <li> It feels like putting on lotion in the shower and just a little bit of it lingers once you towel off.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried though because the reviews claimed that the shower floor would be slippery &amp; since I have a little boy</li>
            <li> It makes a small difference, but I still need to apply other lotion.</li>
            <li> The only warning I will share is that you&#x27;ll become addicted to this product, and the slight drawback that it can make you shower/tub floor surface slippery.</li>
            <li> so I got out of the shower and dried off.</li>
            <li> I immediately purchased a bottle and have had it a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use on the face - you&#x27;ll get breakouts if you&#x27;re prone to heavy creams and oils.</li>
            <li> but I would rather  put on NIEVEA lotion after I get dried off and let it absorb that way..</li>
            <li> and it took a few washes before I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now</li>
            <li> Pros: My skin was noticeably softer after I got out of the shower and dried off.</li>
            <li> and my skin is not smooth and silky</li>
            <li> Like the cream but not a huge fan of the smell</li>
            <li> It is not smoother, doesn&#x27;t feel more moisturized and what&#x27;s worst is the fact that the bottom of my shower is extremely slippery after using this product.</li>
            <li> (I only use Nivea brand body lotions), but unfortunately, it can be pretty dangerous.  </li>
            <li> It just leaves a thin film or coat of product on your skin, but your skin feels just as dry as before.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t want it either because it made his skin feel tight and like it had a thick film.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use this on my feet or face, and hit the shower floor with a few spritzes of common household cleaner (409) and a rinse after cause I&#x27;m paranoid about falling.</li>
            <li> No more skin flaking, no more itch,</li>
            <li> Usually if my legs don&#x27;t hurt immediately i figure it&#x27;s like a ticking time bomb</li>
            <li> I stay away from oil based lotions, because they leave me feeling slick and greasy.</li>
            <li> It has always been a necessary evil because my skin tends to get pretty dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like lotions</li>
            <li> so I usually mosturizes after the shower too</li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Literally after one use there was no more flakes of dead skin coming off!</li>
            <li> I received a small .31ml packet in the mail of this product today, and decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I always forget to put lotion on directly after my shower, so my skin suffers.</li>
            <li> I will usually change lotions with the seasons</li>
            <li> given up on fancy perfumed lotions and silly bath and body products a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product because slathering on lotion once you&#x27;ve dried off is annoying</li>
            <li> This product has found the delicate balance between oily and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for three days.</li>
            <li> and I purchase it at  least 3-4 times a year.</li>
            <li> Also, if even the least bit gets into my hair</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks.  </li>
            <li> I hate putting on lotion post-shower, because I feel really sticky.</li>
            <li> I usually forget so this helps a ton!</li>
            <li> MY BIG CRITICISM IS THAT THE BOTTLE IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HOLD ONTO IN THE SHOWER</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars as I think if you suffer from extremely dry skin or just what the winter can do to your skin in the cold</li>
            <li> my skin is crazy dry in the winter, so i need all the moisture i can get.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to try in-shower lotion.  </li>
            <li> Nivea is the only product that works for my skin without the painful burn and stinging.</li>
            <li> Not  surprising since it&#x27;s Nivea.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product due to the fact that i never heard of a in shower body lotion.</li>
            <li> The only annoying thing is that the shower does seem to get dirtier faster.</li>
            <li> I hate regular lotion</li>
            <li> gel leaves behind when you use this.</li>
            <li> I like this especially has I hate &amp;#</li>
            <li> I hate using water based lotion, because they just don&#x27;t work, and they usually are heavily scented.  </li>
            <li> I’m terrible about remembering to put on lotion and am notorious for applying only after it’s too late</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it disappointed me a little bit.</li>
            <li> This makes it too thick to use as a shave cream, and impossible to rinse off the razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Through weeks of use my shower never built up any grime, and my towels never got any sort of weird feeling or coating to them.</li>
            <li> (Weird, I know.)&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample of this lotion and just now used it.</li>
            <li> This product was totally useless.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> It smells weird</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> I have a horrible problem with forgetting the put lotion on - especially in the winter time.</li>
            <li> I hate applying lotion anywhere other than my hands because it makes my skin feel sticky, almost like I&#x27;m dirty.</li>
            <li> I hate the slimy feeling you get after you put lotion on almost as much as I hate having dry skin.</li>
            <li> I get cold when I get out of the shower and will put off putting on lotion until I get dressed or not at all somedays.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be dangerous used as directed, I scrubbed the bottom of my shower floor before getting into it after using the in shower lotion</li>
            <li> i was afraid of falling in the tub/shower gave it away ,</li>
            <li> useless item!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, but works just as described!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> This in shower body lotion has seriously changed my skin!!!</li>
            <li> When my husband came home I told him he could have because it made my skin feel bad all day.</li>
            <li> Like, bad.</li>
            <li> Winter wrecks havoc on my skin and this year was particularly bad</li>
            <li> But rest assured, it&#x27;s not as bad as people believe it to be.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> So if you wanted this product to make you smell like a fruity flower then you might be a bit disappointed about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product needs to be rinsed off in the shower after applying, which is a nuisance and dangerous!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this in shower lotion!</li>
            <li> Very unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Before I found out about this product, I absolutely hated applying moisturiser,</li>
            <li> I have always hated the sticky feeling of applying lotion after getting out of the shower</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I hate the scent !</li>
            <li> We tried and it&#x27;s awful!</li>
            <li> It was horrible, I needed to shower again.</li>
            <li> Awful I don&#x27;t know how anyone can stand this.</li>
            <li> instead it just feels disgusting</li>
            <li> It traveled well, with no leaking or anything terrible like that.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product works really well, but the smell is very masculine. Hopefully they&#x27;ll come out with a softer, more pleasant, feminine smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft- not sticky or greasy</li>
            <li> My skin feels great and it&#x27;s actually easier to use than regular lotion.  Don&#x27;t sling it around the shower though.  It builds up VERY quickly on the walls  requiring more frequent shower cleanings.  Ugh!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Olay in shower lotion for a very long time and like it a lot.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to try this when it came out.  I like the fragrance, but like Olay fragrance better.  The Nivea does make your skin silky smooth, but it also makes your tub fall on your a** slippery.  The Olay is a little slippery on the tub, but not nearly as bad as the Nivea.  I did purchase another bottle of this because I had a coupon, just have to be really careful that I don&#x27;t fall down, and I have to make sure to clean the tub after every shower so hubby doesn&#x27;t get in and fall on his arse.</li>
            <li> Very nice Scent.  So easy to use while in the shower.  Leaves skin feeling velvety!</li>
            <li> I was expecting more. It doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize very well. I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for awhile now and this is my process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn off water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply lotion to everywhere but bottom of feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat dry with towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throw towel in hamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply normal lotion to bottom of feet once seated on bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This way I never slip, I don&#x27;t have to mess with the tub, and I&#x27;m fully moisturized, all while still getting the convenience of using in-shower lotion. Having no problems with the little bit of lotion on the towel coming out in the laundry either. This is great stuff, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product to try. If it wasn&#x27;t for that sample, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have heard of it or walked right past it at the store. My skin is very, very dry year-round, and most lotions I have tried have either dried out, made me feel greasy, or don&#x27;t have a pleasant smell. It does become embarrassing when I go to the gym or want to wear shorts outside, but have dry and scaly legs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very nice to end my shower with this product! It rubbed on very smoothly and because of the steam, the pleasant fragrance filled the shower. The scent itself is very neutral and smells as though it might change due to body chemistry (as in, smelling more feminine on females and more masculine on males). That said, I would recommend it to all genders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really does make my skin feel silky smooth. I will most likely buy this product, especislly with summer coming soon! It is perfect year-round.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Don&#x27;t know what makes it work, but work it does. Only thing that would make it better would be putting it in a pump bottle. But if that never happens I will still be very happy.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Leaves my skin smooth and easy to use.  Not greasy!</li>
            <li> Love this product works as described.</li>
            <li> I love this! This makes my skin feel so smooth and soft. My husband asked me what soap I was using. I told him about this new product I&#x27;m using from Nivea and he wanted to use it as well! I can&#x27;t wait for winter, no more dry skin for me!</li>
            <li> This in shower lotion should be advertise more because I&#x27;m sure many consumers are unaware it exists.  It works as advertised and I&#x27;ve told all my friends and family about it.  I love it and a little of it goes a long way to moisturized one&#x27;s skin . This loition is the best moiturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. No putting on loition after getting out of shower.  Thank you Nivea, keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> Super when you in a hurry, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love this product for summer.</li>
            <li> Heaven! I have sensitive skin but also dry skin and this stuff is awesome! Heaven in a bottle! Hey nivea! How about some scents like lilac, rose, lavender, orchid, honeysuckle....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to leave my bethtub slimy and my towels gross.... No!&lt;br /&gt;Those were my two concerns with this product, but bother fears are non existent. I started using this because I received a sample in a magazine. I yanked it out and put it in my shower. The next morning I saw it, oh yeah, this thing. So at the end of my shower I used it and it felt amazing!!! I wasn&#x27;t sure I had rinsed it off enough as my skin felt very slick. But the more water I let run over me, it didn&#x27;t change. so I got out of the shower and dried off. I could feel the moisture through the entire day. There was enough in my sample for two uses so I used it again the next day. I shaved my legs that shower and used the condition after. Oh, love. I immediately purchased a bottle and have had it a few weeks now. I use it in every shower and can genuinely feel that my skin is moisturized all day. If I skip a day and don&#x27;t shower, I can still feel it the following day. I have showered without using it once, and can tell you that after showering without it, the moisture I had remaining washed off. So I wouldn&#x27;t think the moisture would last through swimming or any water activities.&lt;br /&gt;Through weeks of use my shower never built up any grime, and my towels never got any sort of weird feeling or coating to them. I do use a daily after shower spray to help with mildew buildup though, so I can&#x27;t say for sure that nothing would build up if I didn&#x27;t use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all though, I love how my skin feels, and love that it really lasts. The absolute best part, is I don&#x27;t have weird slimy hands afterwards like regular lotion. I can use this, get out of the shower, and immediately put contacts in my eyes without any lotion residue burning my eyes. I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting my hands wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok- does the job but not enough moisturizing for the dry winter air. I had tried this in place of my normal cheap baby oil. I still prefer the baby oil much more.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! And that&#x27;s coming from someone who hates the way lotion feels! (Weird, I know.)&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample of this lotion and just now used it. I am so amazed by how great this stuff is! My skin is beyond smooth and I smell fantastic! The scent isn&#x27;t too strong like some lotions and it&#x27;s not the plain smell either. It&#x27;s a fresh, clean, wonderful smell that just makes you happy. lol I just love it! You best believe I&#x27;ll be buying the biggest bottle they have.&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is curious or just loves lotion. (:</li>
            <li> Purchased this from a local retailer and I like it.  This one that you use AFTER your regular body wash.  This does not lather at all.  This great for those who do t care for lotion..  I use it when I take my shower at night so I can skip the lotion.....lol</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. Right after shower, skin really feels smooth and hidrated, but a few hours later, it starts getting dry, even flaky.</li>
            <li> Just the perfect product i was searching for. Great lotion... No dry skin now. FYI, i have a horribly dry skin. This lotion is a life-safer especially during winter.</li>
            <li> My skin gets really dry and itchy in the winter when the humidity drops. I switch to a moisturizing soap but this year it just wasn&#x27;t helping as much as it used to and still found myself scratching my skin raw. Not really a fan of using moisturizing lotions that can leave a greasy feeling on your skin. This product is really easy to apply in the shower, has only a very light scent which doesn&#x27;t persist after rinsing, which I&#x27;m sure men will appreciate, and really works. Rinses off easily and your skin doesn&#x27;t feel like it has anything extra on it. My skin no longer is itchy and just feels normal. Recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Really liked this moisturizer. Provided moisture long after the shower and even in places that I feel don&#x27;t hold moisture well. Plan on continuing usage.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Does what it says and I can definitely tell the days that I don&#x27;t use it! Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t leave the sticky lotion feel that I absolutely hate, and the smell is light and is good for guys and girls! My husband even uses it ;) would defintely buy again. Even got my sister to try it and she loves it too! the convince is awesome! Only wish it had a pump</li>
            <li> Lotion in the shower! So silky soft!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> No bad marks yet-just haven&#x27;t tried it as yet. I want to compare it to some thing I have been using for many years made by Aveeno--their &amp;#34;Creamy Bath Oil&amp;#34; and their &amp;#34;Bath Oil&amp;#34;. It works precisely the same way in that you apply it after you soap up and rinse then apply the product and rinse accordingly. The reason I want to compare the two is because I consider them to be *almost* equal in terms of the quality of the two brands. There are certain items that Nivea manufactures in Europe that are still not sold in the U.S. andI really wish they were; such as their bath oil-I would purchase that again in a second. But anyway--- This product has a great deal more in the bottle and costs a fair amount less $$ than my Aveeno products do, so if I like it as well (or even more?!) I will switch. Nivea makes some wonderful products and I am glad to see they are expanding their product line because they are capable of so much more.</li>
            <li> Holy cow. So quick notes -- I live in north wisconsin, from CA originally, dry winter weather is a whole new beast for me. Number two, I&#x27;m a grad student, with little time for &#x27;beauty&#x27; rituals, I hate putting on lotion and then pants (pet peeve, honestly) and my skin is a sensitive little five-year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, put it on right after I finished my usual routine and slathered this stuff on. I went through quite a bit, as I put it on all my appendages and torso (I am SO DRY AND ITCHY EVERYWHERE right now with this weather). Its creamy/oily, like, obviously putting on lotion, but it washed off easily (I didn&#x27;t have problems with a slipper tub). It kind of feels like a film on your skin but not in a bad way. Really surprised on how well this stuff washed off. (Ladies, I recommend washing your lady bits afterwards - don&#x27;t want this product getting in the undercarriage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Amazing. Step out of the shower feeling nice and clean and not &#x27;dry&#x27; but not greasy. This heavy duty line works well for those (I would assume) with very dry skin or live in climates where constant dry cold air in the negatives is a constant. I probably won&#x27;t use this in the summer, but for the winter this is a fix all. You might not &#x27;save time&#x27; by lotioning up in the shower because you&#x27;re lotioning in the shower instead of out, but you do avoid that lotion-legs pants situation. Someone who lives in a less dry climate might not want to go with this so called level of the product, but that&#x27;s up to you and your skin. Don&#x27;t use on the face - you&#x27;ll get breakouts if you&#x27;re prone to heavy creams and oils. Otherwise, give this a go. It may not be for you in the end, but it&#x27;s fixed a lot of the issues I&#x27;ve been having. So might as well try it.</li>
            <li> I found that if I use this in the shower &amp; rinse off, it gets the tube all slippery. So I put it on after I finished showering &amp; I&#x27;m out of the tub. Then I pat myself dry. It does work all day. I&#x27;m outside a lot &amp; my skin still feels soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really moisturize very well! I still feel I m ex to put lotion on after my shower!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do a thing, no moisturizer, no soft skin, nothing at all! useless item!</li>
            <li> I purchased this produce expecting a miracle. But only God is in the miracle giving business. It definitely made my skin irresistibly soft. But after a few hours my legs would look like cracked old dried out wood lol. Unless I followed up with baby oil....I would recommend using it for the softness. But not the moisture.</li>
            <li> The product does what it says. A convenient way to lotion your skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, it last a full day. I guess is not very eco friendly because you have to use water to rinse ir, but i like to get out the shower and get dress so is very useful for me.</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely dry sensitive skin. I really like this lotion.  Bonus,  it has a light fragrance,  which I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> i like this product. I wish it had a better fragrance, but it works the way it&#x27;s supposed to. I do think it clogs my drain, though. I&#x27;ve lived here for 25 yrs and never had a drainage problem...until I started using this product. Am thinking that whatever makes it continue to moisturize my skin after it&#x27;s rinsed off may not be good for my drain. So my 3-star rating is the average of 4 stars for product on my skin and 2 stars for possible clogging issues.</li>
            <li> Love it but makes your tub very slippery</li>
            <li> Really works and skin feels smooth and clean. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> This right here is the best thing ever, I love this lotion , I love how it&#x27;s smells, how is leaving my skin. The all family is using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It makes it so easy to moisturize, and you do it in in the shower.  Saves lots of time.  You put on in the shower after cleansing and rinse off, whallah done !  Done and ready to towel off and go. Smells great also.</li>
            <li> I was truly hoping this would be all that but ITS NOT . Why would I want to put it on and then shower it off. I feel like its money down the train . I do think it helps but I would rather  put on NIEVEA lotion after I get dried off and let it absorb that way..gg</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion.</li>
            <li> The best in-shower moisturizer I&#x27;ve found so far.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling &amp;#34;plasticized&amp;#34; like the Olay stuff did....and it has a very pleasant fresh scent.  Not too girly so could easily be used by a man or teenagers.  Overall the moisture doesn&#x27;t last me all day, it&#x27;s not quite rich enough for my very dry skin, but for someone with normal to only slightly dry skin it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This product was totally useless.  Did not moisturize at all.</li>
            <li> Leaves a very slippery surface, feels nice on the skin though.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product due to the fact that i never heard of a in shower body lotion. To my surprise it works fairly well, and my skin does feel a bit softer and doesnt get any sticky feeling. Though if you do not wash this off completely you will get a bit of that lotion feel on your skin. It also has a clean linen type of scent , but isn&#x27;t too over powering in my opinion. So if you wanted this product to make you smell like a fruity flower then you might be a bit disappointed about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I havent noticed any major changes in my skin , but i still believe its an ok product. Also take caution that if you use too much of this product, your shower floor will get very slippery.</li>
            <li> A good idea if you want to cover your body in petroleum-based product.  Not a healthy option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trashed it.</li>
            <li> This product is decent.  When I use it on my legs or abdomen it works really well.  But when I use it on my hands its almost like it did nothing.  I do have severely dry skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> I started using this and didn&#x27;t think it was doing that much, so I took a break. I noticed my skin wasn&#x27;t as smooth as it was when I was using it, so now I think it is making a big difference. This isn&#x27;t something that I would want or need to use daily, but once or twice a week it is nice to get a really good hydration routine going on. I did not feel like I could skip on lotion after getting out of the shower, which was the biggest reason I wanted to try this. My skin is definitely softer and more nourished, but I still need to lotion my feet, elbows, and hands after showering to feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it seems like I have to use a lot of it to get good coverage. A bottle won&#x27;t last more than a month and a half or so if used daily. Smell is slightly lemony, but very mild and not offensive at all.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.  As a lady who has historically been too lazy to put on her lotion after her shower, this stuff is a game-changer.  No longer do I dread the after shower lotioning...and waiting to dry....and my clothes sticking to me....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is like conditioner for your body.  It goes on nicely, feels nice, and has the basic Nivea scent to it.  It also rinses nicely (I did not notice that my shower/tub was more slippery, but I can definitely understand that you are NOT to put this on the bottom of your feet).  Upon drying off, my skin feels just like I put lotion on about 20-30 minutes ago.  I&#x27;m good to go with the rest of my morning routine and my skin is prepared to step out in the wild Wisconsin winter.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use. Goes on quickly and it definitely makes your skin feel softer. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, which is a plus. Much beterm than other similar products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but putting this on in the shower is much easier than using regular lotion after. And I remember to do it - Always forget lotion what with hair and makeup. Anyway after two weeks and a whole bottle of this my skin looks better, no dry skin itch, and I Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this on my feet or face, and hit the shower floor with a few spritzes of common household cleaner (409) and a rinse after cause I&#x27;m paranoid about falling. Very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing. i love it. the smell, the softness. Its awesome. desnt leave me feeliing greasy or sticky. Its an all around win!</li>
            <li> Dry skin is not fun but then neither is oily skin. This product has found the delicate balance between oily and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for three days. The fragrance, to begin with, is barely there and fades in a few minutes. My skin is noticibly softer. I would have been happy with a little bit softer since this winter is making me itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired this with Nivea body lotion at night and sleeping through the night is possible without waking up scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem (and not really a problem ) is right after you rinse it off, get out of the shower immediately. If you stay in for any length of time, the lotion rinses off and you will need to reapply</li>
            <li> I really like this.  It&#x27;s great to be able to cut out one more step in moisturizing - not having to get out of the shower, dry, then put on lotion.  I actually don&#x27;t rinse it off. I turn off the shower, apply this lotion, then squeegee the shower doors giving it time to &#x27;sink in&#x27; - step out of the shower, pat myself dry.  Done.  It&#x27;s a nice little luxury.</li>
            <li> My wife love this lotion thank you</li>
            <li> Great on your skin and easy to use!</li>
            <li> softens my skin but im still ashy after i dry off</li>
            <li> be careful because it does make the showers slippery..but if you don&#x27;t use too much you will be fine</li>
            <li> AMAZINGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have skin that flares up with eczema with many products. I was scared to try this product. I gave it a shot and it took a few washes before I noticed a difference. I am so happy I tried it. Its the best product and leaves my skin smooth nourished and happy. I don&#x27;t have to apply as much lotion out of the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition I use Ponds for my face and Nivea Essentially Enriches Body lotion (Almond Oil, &amp;Hydra IQ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given up on fancy perfumed lotions and silly bath and body products a long time ago. Nivea is the only product that works for my skin without the painful burn and stinging.</li>
            <li> When I first used this I was unsure about it because it had a very strange texture and feeling, but after a couple days of using it I love it.  I have extremely dry skin from a medication that I take and this helps tremendously.  I will definitely be using this everyday.</li>
            <li> As a daily swimmer my skin is super dry from the chemicals in the pool. I have suffered from chronic itching for years as a result. Of all the body moisturises I have tried over the years at all price levels this is the first product that actually works. No more skin flaking, no more itch, no more soreness due to dry skin. Hello beautiful silky skin on body and face after 3 days use. Thank you, thank you, thank you Nivea</li>
            <li> This lotion is Awesome --</li>
            <li> perfect product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am such a lazy person when it comes to moisturizing my skin, but always ended up with itchy skin in the middle of sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;this product is great not just because you can take of that need during shower, and its also extremely effective without creating the mess and awkward sticky feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;try it and you&#x27;ll fall in love with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient that you can use lotion while showering. But the effect seems soso, just ok</li>
            <li> Read the fine print.  This product needs to be rinsed off in the shower after applying, which is a nuisance and dangerous!  Label states that it will leave a slippery film on the tub/shower.  Luckily I read the label carefully before using and I was able to return it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Moisturize and absorbs better than other in shower lotions brands and does not leave the shower floor as slippery as the others. I would have given 5 stars but I didn&#x27;t care so much for the smell. If there is another smell for the product and it works the same,  it would definitely have 5 stars from me. I will still purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works great, but needs to smell better</li>
            <li> This is a time saving product.  Last step of my shower, pat dry, and I&#x27;m ready to get dressed!  Skin is lightly moisturized.  Winter requires more moisturizing that this can offer alone, however.</li>
            <li> I’m terrible about remembering to put on lotion and am notorious for applying only after it’s too late and I already have dry skin. Yet, when my kids get out of the tub, I always rub them down with moisturizer, but often forget to do that extra pampering for myself. This is why I love the concept of Nivea’s In-Shower Body Lotion, which you apply while still in the shower after you wash up. It left my skin feeling smooth and nourished and there’s no sticky feel either. It’s like getting a jump on your routine of having to put on lotion after you dry off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and the rough patches by my elbows and backs of my arms is sooo much smoother now. What a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism would be that I wish there were more scent options.</li>
            <li> Can do the same thing with hair conditioner, which I&#x27;ve been doing for years</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion now in the shower!!!!!LOVE!!I love saving time and being nice and warm in the shower while applying lotion.Awesome:):)</li>
            <li> I struggle with EXTREMELY dry skin in the winter and some of it has become eczema. I&#x27;m so thankful that I found this lotion. I despise the sticking feeling of lotions applied post shower so I would often do without (despite my super dry and sometimes itchy skin). This in shower body lotion has seriously changed my skin!!! So soft, so smooth. No sticky residue or feeling!!! My only complaint is that it does leave a residue on the shower/tub that requires more than just a rinse. I use it anyway because it is worth the extra cleaning!</li>
            <li> Works so good on hard water effects of skin</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> This is what I am been looking for.</li>
            <li> Ok but I still put lotion on</li>
            <li> Love this.I always forget to moisturize after my shower. This makes it so easy and no sticky feeling just smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed. Sorry. I have dry skin and this felt like a very mild moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t encounter the slippery effect. My shower floor is textured. So that was not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got soap in it and that would automatically strip some of the moisture out. Instead, I would prefer to use some after-bath oil or body wash with moisturizer in it (like Olay). But I found Nivea&#x27;s (out of shower) Essentially rich lotion &amp; I am happy with that for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;This in-shower lotion may work for those who don&#x27;t have VERY dry skin or have combination skin &amp; are always in a hurry. Also, I won&#x27;t use this on my face since it has perfume in it.</li>
            <li> Love it so good for my  &amp;#34;psoriasis&amp;#34; thanks Walmart !!</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but I do not think it moisturizes as well as the Olay in the shower lotion does. It is not as thick as the Olay lotion, nor does it smell as nice. It is good if you want a lighter lotion, like for the summer.</li>
            <li> An incredible lotion for extra dry skin. Idon&#x27;t have to use much at all and it keeps my skin hydrated all day. I love themild scent as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Better than the Jergens version</li>
            <li> Love this!&lt;br /&gt;I started using it in the winter time when my skin gets really dry but it works so well that I now use it all the time.  It has a pleasantly light scent that fades so you won&#x27;t be smelling it all day but if you do catch a whiff it&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;The formula for dry skin works the best as its thicker and won&#x27;t run off as you&#x27;re using it.  Just rub it in, rinse off and you&#x27;re all set.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I find this has a strong perfume that is not pleasant for a man.</li>
            <li> I get cold when I get out of the shower and will put off putting on lotion until I get dressed or not at all somedays. Getting it done in the shower makes sense for me. It&#x27;s not as good as a thick lotion but it gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just be sure to  let the hot water run  for a few minutes after you rinse... It  will lower the chance of a slippery spot.</li>
            <li> Feels great while I&#x27;m in the shower, but the feeling wears off very quick and I still have to apply lotion afterwards</li>
            <li> Skeptical about a &amp;#34;wash-off&amp;#34; lotion, expecting either something really greasy, or something that didn&#x27;t work.  I was surprised on both fronts.  And after using this for a couple weeks, I can really tell the difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin while taking my showers, the only issue is that you must clean your shower or bathtub right away because it get really slippery and greasy</li>
            <li> Be cautious of ordering this, mine arrived and it had exploded inside the plastic bag it came in, half the product was squirted out of the bottle. The return policy requires me to send the squishy bag and contents back in order to get a replacement/refund, NOT fun!</li>
            <li> I love this. Still need to wear lotion afterwards during winter but warmer months its fine wearing alone. You do have to rinse shower out with very hot water after use or else will leave a sticky film.</li>
            <li> I bought this Product because I am a user of in the shower skin conditioner/lotion. I was using a product Called Ro... Argan Oil Body Conditioner from a natural store chain that Rhymes with BLUSH.. Matter fact just take out the B... Anywho. I pay $33 dollars for the product and I purchase it at  least 3-4 times a year. It smells amazing and does a great job, but the price is really ridiculous. You use it the Same and while it may be stronger in some sense than Nivea In-Shower Nourishing Body Lotion, I am totally making the change. NISNBL works relatively the same. You hop into the shower, cleanse yourself, and then apply the body conditioner or shower lotion and I wait a few minutes, and then rinse off until it feels as if it is completely gone. Results, Soft Skin. I do feel RAOBC is great, but for the price I rather purchase this six times for a close result. I am now on Subscribe and Save..</li>
            <li> I found this product to be dangerous used as directed, I scrubbed the bottom of my shower floor before getting into it after using the in shower lotion and I still slipped and fell due the oily residue it lleaves, and it also made my hair very greasy from just rinsing the conditioner out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!! I was so glad it came out around winter when skin is always dry. I have had dry skin since.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a sample, but I will definitely buy this! I have very sensitive skin when I shave my legs (I also shave my arms, underarms and bikini zone) and I have found things that have almost done the trick but I still have to be careful about touching my legs for a full day after I shave. I used my sample to shave my legs with and it felt as though I hadn&#x27;t even shaved... I mean my legs were super smooth, but they didn&#x27;t feel sensitive at all! Usually if my legs don&#x27;t hurt immediately i figure it&#x27;s like a ticking time bomb and they&#x27;ll hurt later when get dressed or go to bed-- it&#x27;s been a day since I shaved and my legs are still smooth and they haven&#x27;t hurt a bit! It&#x27;s a huge relief for me! Especially with summer just around the corner~&lt;br /&gt;The smell is really pleasant and it really did make my skin feel nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Also, a little goes a long way, I used my very small sample for both of my entire legs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week and it seems to be keeping my skin hydrated -- I am still waiting for the long term results before i make my determination. The one thing that I was not prepared for is the death trap this makes your shower. If you do not scrub it off your shower floor after each use when you go to step in the next day its very slippery.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!  I have really dry skin.  I hate using water based lotion, because they just don&#x27;t work, and they usually are heavily scented.  I stay away from oil based lotions, because they leave me feeling slick and greasy. The Nivea In-Shower absorbs into your skin by the time you dry off, and I can FEEL the difference, after only two showers!  I am sold!!</li>
            <li> The product seems better fit for summer use or a warmer climate than Michigan in the winter. I feel like I rinse and towel dry off more of the lotion than what soaks into my skin. Also, if even the least bit gets into my hair I have to rewash or deal with stickiness all day (which is probably my fault but slightly unavoidable with long hair). My skin does feel soft for a few hours after use but not the 24 Nivea claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I will probably try using this again in the summer and stick to regular Nivea body creme through the winter.</li>
            <li> Not a fan,  made my skin feel sticky and felt like it never really soaked in like my regular lotion does.  Also,  left a film in my shower that required more scrubbing than its usual cleaning.</li>
            <li> Love love love this, favorite item! Leaves skin feeling wonderful, will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> This stuff works and smells very clean! I&#x27;d buy it again foresures!</li>
            <li> While I like how it softens my skin, it is leaving my shower floor like and ICE RINK!!! Be careful when stepping in and out of your shower as you progress in using this product. Even using daily shower spray is not helping to cut down on the slippery shower floor! Use carefully!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s placebo effect because it&#x27;s essentially like putting hair conditioner all over your body, and since your palm is now slippery, your skin feels slippery and &amp;#34;moisturized.&amp;#34; Honestly doesn&#x27;t seem to be a huge difference. I decided to try it because Nivea makes great products. At least it smells nice.</li>
            <li> At home, be careful to rinse the tub correctly thought and do not put any under you feet! Slippery as hell! Also great for showering at the gym for example to skip the whole putting-lotion-extra-quick-naked-in-front-of-people thing.</li>
            <li> Great Product, you save time and no sticky feel afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect if you are in a hurry or are just tired of the lotion routine.&lt;br /&gt;However some extra is needed for just shaved legs if you want your skin to glow.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and I have to moisturize daily. I still applied lotion after my shower. I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Compare to Lush&#x27;s body conditioner.  The scent is fantastic - not too flowery.</li>
            <li> This is the best......let me repeat. This is the best skin moisturizer I have found. Winter (heaters) suck the moisture from my skin and I end up scratching until I bleed. I have prescription pills to stop the itch. Since finding this product I have not used anything else and not used RX pills for itch. If you have dry skin, try this product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I live in Arizona so need as much moisture as I can get and this does the job!</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend - she LOVES this!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it. Appears great!</li>
            <li> Like the cream but not a huge fan of the smell</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft</li>
            <li> This is great does not left you feeling sticky. As a guy I don&#x27;t like lotion but I have a dry skin this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I like this product to use during a shower. It is easy to remember to use since it is applied during the shower. May not help with dry skin as well as using a lotion or body butter after shower.</li>
            <li> My mom loved it. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of Nivea In-Shower Body Lotion. I had doubt that it would do as promised but I was pleasantly surprised. I didn&#x27;t think that a product that would be applied in the shower would have lasting moisturizing effects. This product is a winner. It goes on silky, leaves no oily feel and yet my skin felt soft. I tend to have very dry skin but this product really performed. It saves me time each day because I can get dressed immediately after showering. No need to wait for lotion to dry. Thanks</li>
            <li> leaves to much slippery slim in the bottom of the tube and smells more lie shave cream</li>
            <li> Love using this new in shower lotion, leaves skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> This stuff is like using nothing. I have tried different amounts and followed the directions. I still have to use other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Great skin product to use during those dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how effective this product may be. Let&#x27;s just say I now have a monthly subscription for it. And talk about the price compared to oil of olay, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but it&#x27;s not worth it because it made my shower floor tiles really slippery, so now I&#x27;ll have to degrease them. This is just another marketing gimick to get you to buy more product. In my opinion, stick with your lotion outside of your shower so you don&#x27;t slip and fall.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really do that much for me.  I have super dry skin and find baby oil is much more effective than this product.  It&#x27;s not bad, though, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> i was afraid of falling in the tub/shower gave it away ,</li>
            <li> Does the job as promised</li>
            <li> just what I expected it to be</li>
            <li> I like being able to put lotion in the shower, but even if this is for &amp;#34;very dry skin&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t seem as hydrating as other lotions you apply normally. My husband hates how gunky it makes our shower.</li>
            <li> Tried this or and it did not work at all. I still have to apply my regular lotion.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product because slathering on lotion once you&#x27;ve dried off is annoying and it sticks to your clothes. I tried this for a week and there was zero increase in moisture level on my skin.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life??? This stuff is amazing! I have rally dry skin and as soon as I get out of the shower, I have to moisturize. That is until I found this! All it takes is a couple extra minutes in the shower and I have incredibly smooth skin. Just make this the last step in your shower routine. Apply it all over you body, I use it on my face also, then rinse and go.  I no longer have the hassle of drying off  then moisturizing after every shower. I can just do it while I am in the shower! I am amazed at how awesome my skin feels, I will never use anything else beside Nivea In shower body lotion.</li>
            <li> I find this easier to use than regular lotion. Unlike regular lotion, this does not leave my skin feeling sticky, greasy with a residue. This body lotion reminds me of using baby oil after showering only it&#x27;s no where near as oily. I like the flowery scent and not one relative has complained of it being overwhelming. Also some complained of slippery tub afterwards which is true but it&#x27;s no worse than bubble bath but I don&#x27;t use a lot either. Yes, it is still a lotion and yes, it doesn&#x27;t last for days. Like any other lotion you must use regularly. Personally I love it.</li>
            <li> Keep some clorox wipes in the tub to avoid slipping.</li>
            <li> I use it for my eczema; it really helps with dry skin!</li>
            <li> I put the lotion on the skin, and then I did not get the hose again</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff!  So easy to use in the shower. It rinses off well and really does leave your skin feel like you&#x27;ve used lotion.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning: Rinse your tub well with hot water after using and dry the tub with a towel before your next shower or you could possibly die. It leaves a slippery residue on your tub after using.</li>
            <li> Just using it for a week now and my skin is noticeably softer.  Quicker and easier than trying to remember to moisturize after my shower.  Hasn&#x27;t made my shower slipperier like other reviews have stated, so maybe I&#x27;m using less or different flooring?  Has nice, clean, subtle smell that doesn&#x27;t last if you don&#x27;t like it, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing... Recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product and it disappointed me a little bit. I can&#x27;t see much difference in appearance of my skin. It is not smoother, doesn&#x27;t feel more moisturized and what&#x27;s worst is the fact that the bottom of my shower is extremely slippery after using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from exzema and dry skin for years. This is the first product that has allowed me to shave daily without severe dry skin issues on my legs. I love this!</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of using this luxurious moisturizing cream right in the shower.  Just apply to your skin, rinse away, dry off and you&#x27;re ready to start your day with the softest body ever.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the commercial, I was skeptical, but willing to try. I hate applying lotion anywhere other than my hands because it makes my skin feel sticky, almost like I&#x27;m dirty. It has always been a necessary evil because my skin tends to get pretty dry.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it &amp; from the first time, I loved it! I feel so fresh &amp; clean after I get out of the shower, plus my skin felt soft &amp; moisturized. It bottle said to take care to not slip, but I haven&#x27;t had an issue with that. I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my drain.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is the bottle design, I don&#x27;t like that the cap is on the bottom. I have to set it down a few times while applying it &amp; it isn&#x27;t the easiest top to close. I broke my first bottle from putting it down without the top secured.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing...not much foam.  Worth reordering.</li>
            <li> This is the second in-shower lotion I&#x27;ve tried and I think I&#x27;ve given up on the idea altogether. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize your skin, plain and simple. It just leaves a thin film or coat of product on your skin, but your skin feels just as dry as before. It&#x27;s a nice idea and they got me to try it two different times, but it&#x27;s just a gimmick. I&#x27;ve used regular Nivea body lotion before, so I know that it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer. This product does not compare at all. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Makes things so much easier than doing lotion after the shower...I usually forget so this helps a ton!</li>
            <li> It feels nice, but I haven&#x27;t noticed an increased moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li> You have to use quite a bit and then it doesn&#x27;t last even 24 hours. It does not stand up to its claim.</li>
            <li> My husband like this very much.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes for days. But does make tub a bit slippery so I rinse after I shower it off. Great for new moms since we have such limited time to ourselves.</li>
            <li> for my dry skin, i feel like it makes no difference.  it just feels like another slippery soap that I might use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Love the concept. Leaves my skin very soft. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I hate the scent ! It smells like plastic.</li>
            <li> We tried and it&#x27;s awful! The first day I used it was  magic, my skin felt wonderful. I told my husband how smooth my skin felt, he touched and agreed. Excitedly, I even told a woman in the grocery store how amazing this stuff was! We went out and got my husband  some magic too! Next  day I used and immediately after drying off, my skin started itching and felt like I had a plastic film over it. It was horrible, I needed to shower again. Skin felt the same after the shower.  When my husband came home I told him he could have because it made my skin feel bad all day. He told me nooooo! He didn&#x27;t want it either because it made his skin feel tight and like it had a thick film. Wow together we spent little over $16.00 for something we can&#x27;t use. Never again, even after not using it for 2 weeks our skin still feels yukky. I read a lot of good reviews prior to purchasing however it&#x27;s just not the product for us. We have 2 different skin types my husband purchased the extreme dry and I purchased the dry. I usually love Nivea products but this one is a fail.</li>
            <li> I tried this one and the Olay in-shower lotion.  Both were great except Olay is very heavily scented, while Nivea is mild. I took my time to really work this into my skin before the rinse; I think that made all the difference.  Super smooth and hydrated after. I recommend using Dove Moisturizing Body Wash before hand.  Great combo.</li>
            <li> left me sort of itchy - like have soap stuck on your skin.  I don&#x27;t see where this a time saver because you have to wash the residue from the bottom of the shower to prevent slips and falls..</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST shower lotion I have ever used. My very dry winter skin immediately felt smooth and soft.No oily residue, just nice soft skin!</li>
            <li> Great all-over moisturizer for use while in the shower. It goes on smooth and stays silky smooth after gently rinsing before toweling dry. Stays effective for several days! A little goes a long way. Kind of a strange way to use it, but a great product. Will def buy again!</li>
            <li> I like it.  I just can&#x27;t tell if it is completely washed off but my skins does feel softer :)  the smell is mild which I love as well. BTW, be careful with the bathroom floor while bathing. it can get slippery.</li>
            <li> I use this for the first time yesterday and you don&#x27;t have to put lotion on after you this product is a good choice if you will enjoy Nivea products</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance. Works great</li>
            <li> It really works really well.( I am so glad that someone mentioned that it  causes the shower to get slippery because I took steps to make sure I didn&#x27;t slip and fall. It really DOES cause the shower floor to be slippery. It would help to maybe stand on a wash cloth or something before applying.) As for the product itself, I am finding that HOURS later, my skin is still nice and soft and not the least bit dry! SO easy and affective! Not  surprising since it&#x27;s Nivea. I have at least three different Nivea products in my house. I have subscribed to this so I won&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and that it gives enough moisture unless you have really dry skin. It&#x27;s easier and faster than applying after getting out of the shower. I haven&#x27;t noticed this getting on my clothes. The only annoying thing is that the shower does seem to get dirtier faster.</li>
            <li> During hot summer months, this in-shower lotion is great! I hate putting on lotion post-shower, because I feel really sticky. This moisturizes without the sticky feeling because you rinse it off in the shower. It&#x27;s not as potent as after shower lotion, but certainly helps keep my skin feeling smooth!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this actually keeps me moisturized. I skip lotion, unbelievable:)</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting lotion that&#x27;s for the shower. I&#x27;ve always had dry, sensitive skin; so this sounded like a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;But after using this, it left my skin feeling really greasy and it took forever to soak into my skin.... I&#x27;m just really disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t better.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mix well with bodywash... Not that it should! I mistakenly ordered this in a hurry, thinking I was trying out Nivea body wash. Poured it into our bodywash pump and found it strange that it was like oil and water in that it wouldn&#x27;t mix. Double checked the bottle and of course realized my mistake...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we bought some new bodywash, lol and tried this for it&#x27;s actual moisturizing purpose. We just really didn&#x27;t care for it at all. I&#x27;m rating it 3 stars because I think it&#x27;s a fine moisturizer and the idea is wonderful in saving time and making the most of moisturizing when it can really be locked in best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We just didn&#x27;t like the feel of using lotion in the shower. Won&#x27;t buy again but wouldn&#x27;t say not to try it, seems like a fine product and fresh scent that&#x27;s not overly strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a matter of personal preference. I like my essential oil mix and my husband likes his after shave and men&#x27;s moisturizer by Lemongrass Spa. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This product is not to be used for the ultimate moisturizing experience. I use this product after I shower at night, so that my skin has just enough moisture to help me sleep comfortably at night. When I shower during the day, I use the Nivea essentially enriched lotion. But this is perfect for me for my night time routine. It prevents the dry cracking feeling after a shower but it does not have that greasy feeling that lotion can have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Olay version and I think I like this one better.  I like the smell better too.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin so I was excited to try this when I saw the commercial on TV. It has proven to be kind of a disappointment as After use of this product, I still need to lather myself in high end lotion after getting out of the shower. Beware, it&#x27;s slippery and greasy and could cause a shower accident.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me as I don&#x27;t like waiting for lotion to dry after the shower or having to apply cold lotion on freezing days!  It goes on quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky at all.  Just make sure you do rinse down your shower or tub well as it can get slippery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do have an aversion to scented products though, this may not be for you. It is fairly strong smelling to me when in the shower.</li>
            <li> In the winter months I always suffer from dry itchy skin.  Using this daily really helps, and its so much faster to apply in the shower, quick rinse and dry off.  It leaves my skin soft, but not sticky.</li>
            <li> Great product barely scented and feels amazing only bad thing is that it took a long time to get here</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, a little goes a long way, good base moiturizer.  A nice luxury product for your bath or shower.</li>
            <li> my skin drinks it right up and is soft all day</li>
            <li> Seriously the best! I don&#x27;t need lotion anymore because this does everything. Super easy to use, smells good. I have very dry skin and it helps a lot!</li>
            <li> Actually it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize for a long time but  it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  Works so well, and saves time in the morning!</li>
            <li> Love it!  My skin is silky soft after using it.  I don&#x27;t have to use lotion after each shower, only where I have the drier area.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this stuff. It smells ok, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work great? Over glorified body wash, without the use of being a cleaner. The biggest problem, is that it leaves the tub/shower incredibly slippery. Like, bad. And since you have to take an extra 5 minutes to wash your whole shower after, it&#x27;s really not worth it. Sorry Nivea, I really do like your other products, just not this one.</li>
            <li> Great for moisture!  Had me rubbing across my own skin... Lol! Rather pricy but an okay in shower lotion.</li>
            <li> This Shower lotion works great. It leaves no greasy feeling and works for a long time. It smells weird but once youre out of the shower and dry the smell goes away. The only downside is that it makes your shower floor really slippery.</li>
            <li> Really nice. I don&#x27;t like how it felt when I accidentally got some on my face, it just made it feel greasy. I still felt the need to put on lotion but if you are in a hurry just using this bodywash is fine.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. So much better than the 32 dollar Lush version.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work!!!! Its the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Does everything it says it does</li>
            <li> This is a life saver for people like me! I can never seem to fit in the time to apply standard moisturizer in the mornings, and find myself forgetting more times than not. This product is great, because I just need to apply to my skin in the shower, then rinse off! I definitely try to be conscious to not use too much at once, because I think it would be easy to run through the bottle pretty quick. I do have to say that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel quite like it does after standard moisturizer, but that I can still tell the difference. Will most likely purchase it again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works but I LOVE it! I hate regular lotion but this is amazing! I have dry skin, especially legs and this leaves my skin soft and moisturized, without leaving yucky feeling on my hands, or making my pants stick to my skin!</li>
            <li> Works well for me especially since I don&#x27;t like to spend the extra few minutes applying lotion afterwards</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been lazy applying moisturizer after shower, the in-shower lotion is perfect as I get to remember using it every day.  The lotion smells great and is priced right. Keeps the skin moisturizing for the whole day and stops my skin getting itchy in winter. One star taken off as one of the bottles arrived with the cap open and contents leaked, just as well it was packaged individually in a plastic bag by Amazon and didn&#x27;t ruin the rest of the items in the shipment.</li>
            <li> Before I found out about this product, I absolutely hated applying moisturiser, because who&#x27;s got time for that, right? Well Nivea has the solution! An in-shower body lotion. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and I can&#x27;t even begin to explain how much I adore it! You easily apply it while still in the shower and then wash it off. But that would get rid of it, right? Wrong. After stepping out of the shower my skin is soft and not even close to being dry; best of all, it definitely stays that way all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you don&#x27;t want to waste more time with applying pointless moisturisers or lotions after showering, grab a bottle of this asap! I promise you, you will love it and never want anything else!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. It makes my skin feel amazing</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, but works just as described!</li>
            <li> I began having issues with dry skin (or eczema) when I turned 30.  I have tried a lot of different lotions, but I really enjoy this product a lot.  My skin feels totally hydrated after I dry off and for the rest of the day.  I have noticed that rough spots (elbows, for example) are completely smooth now.  Plus it&#x27;s perfect if you&#x27;re going to spend the day at the beach, because it locks the moisture into your skin before you start applying sunblock.  It also saves time because you don&#x27;t have to wait for the lotion to &amp;#34;soak in.&amp;#34;  Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks.  Not moisturizing at all, rinses right off leaving behind no benefit.  Wife is using it to shave her legs I think instead of throwing it out so it wasn&#x27;t a total waste of money but its not worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this product I just wish they would get scented lotions as well. The thing I do not like is that you wash away any scent your shower gel leaves behind when you use this. For this reason I do not use it as often as I would if it had a scent.</li>
            <li> Totally love!  Doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue, like I expected.  My legs are so soft after using this in the shower.  The boyfriend can tell the difference as well.</li>
            <li> moderately moisturizing</li>
            <li> I like it--it&#x27;s very moisturizing--however: they warn you on the bottle to be careful, because you apply it in the shower, with the water running, which takes the runoff onto the tub or shower floor, which then becomes very slippery.  They recommend you then clean the tub/shower well when you get out.  That&#x27;s not what I want to do when I get out of the shower, so I like it but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with slipping in the shower as I was careful when I rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very large man - bodybuilder, and the tube doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;Really loved the sheen that it leaves on the skin like nivea lotion, and the relief from dry skin in the winter from the dry heat.&lt;br /&gt;I only used it on problem areas, but also found that if I used the residual conditioner left on my hands after conditioning my hair - it work just as well.</li>
            <li> It works! I am moisturized after my shower.... Happy with product. Would like more scents.</li>
            <li> Great product - don&#x27;t have to use lotion after getting out of the shower!  Only negatitive is makes shower slippery.</li>
            <li> This product is great in theory, applying moisturing lotion to your skin while you are still in the shower, but it&#x27;s not worth the risk of slipping in the tub or shower by the residue left after you wash it off. It&#x27;s a product that claims to save you time, but also advises you to spend extra time cleaning the shower/tub floor after use to avoid spills. What good is that? We also thought the results were minimal when it came to leaving the skin feeling well-hydrated. L&#x27;Occitane and Neutrogena Oil work much better applied to damp skin once you are outside the shower/tub stall. Great concept, but thumbs down on an application that puts you at risk of slipping!</li>
            <li> This product works great! I don&#x27;t usually like lotions but I love this! Doesn&#x27;t leave my shower floor slippery. I use mainly on legs and arms. Clean scent. Husband loves it, too.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m on the fence with this product. On one hand, it does moisturize to a degree, and given time it feels like my skin really drinks it up. The &amp;#34;given time&amp;#34; part is the problem, though. No matter how light I apply, and how well I rinse, I&#x27;m left feeling greasy after my shower. In addition, the smell, which is great in the bottle, for some reason smells very strange when applied. I can&#x27;t describe it exactly, but overall I&#x27;m left with an impression like I smeared canola oil all over myself. Hence, I only use this before bed when I can wear pajamas and socks and give it time to soak in. For this, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great, moisturizing, and long lasting in shower body lotion. For folks with severely dry skin this seems to be the best option to hydrate and moisturize dry skin. No other lotions seem to make my skin feel as soft or as moisturized. This is honestly the only thing I&#x27;ve found that really helps my dry skin without irritating sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave you feel greasy or sticky, and it lasts all day or night long after you shower.</li>
            <li> It actually works, but would suggest investing in a good lotion too if you don&#x27;t shower everyday.</li>
            <li> I have tried one too many lotion brands in the past. I have very dry skin, you see, from head to toe. I have to say that this is the only brand and variety that has given my skin a permanent relief and moisture. All the others would keep moisturized for a couple of hours. When I wash my hands or have the lotion removed altogether, the dry skin would come back. Not with this. It&#x27;s effect is long lasting and my skin&#x27;s condition has really improved a lot, with or without this lotion I can feel that my skin is now more moisturized, smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> first time trying it.. but I am pleased. it does leave my skin feeling nice and soft. and the same great scent as the lotion.</li>
            <li> works really great.  And, it leaves my skin feeling silky soft.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in the April 2015 Cosmopolitan Magazine and decided to try it on my hands since it was only a sample size. Instantly I felt a difference on my skin. But after drying it was a bit hard, so I applied a little baby lotion as well and with the two products combined, it left my hands very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It does work well for dry skin. I do not scrub my bathtub every time I take a shower. Using this product makes it essential to scrub the bathtub after each use as it makes the tub slippery. Added work, but soft skin.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s skin gets quite dry in the winter but getting him to remember to put on lotion…. So, as I was looking for a moisturizing shower gel, I came across this product. Hooray - he remembers to use it and he likes it. I keep the bottle on the floor under the shower head - he can&#x27;t miss it in that spot. It has improved his dry skin dramatically without making him feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is very averse to perfumed anything on his body. This actually passed his nose; it has a light fragrance but it does not linger on the skin once you are dry. It&#x27;s not flowery/girly, just a pleasant clean smell. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oil slick in the shower but there is a little slipperiness near the drain.  However, if you have a very smooth shower floor, it may be more slippery.  My floor is textured so does not make it dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it too. It only takes a few seconds to rub on &amp; lightly rinse off. A little goes a long way; we use a nickel-size dollop at most.</li>
            <li> My wife like to use this because she doesnt like the feel of lotion on her hands.. so this is great.</li>
            <li> used it several times like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times after receiving it last week. The first time, I was amazed by how well it worked and how soft my skin felt all day; however, the subsequent times I&#x27;ve used that it hasn&#x27;t worked as well. I&#x27;m doing everything the same, so I don&#x27;t know why it would be different.</li>
            <li> Softest skin all over!</li>
            <li> the most nourishing bod lotion from Nivea just got cheaper and more available than ever.</li>
            <li> I really like how my skin feels after using this product. Non greasy is also a plus. I do not need to wait to get dressed like I do when I apply lotion.</li>
            <li> Awful I don&#x27;t know how anyone can stand this. The smell was so overpowering I had to re-wash my body to get it off. It made me smell like an overly perfumed old woman. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer</li>
            <li> Works well. A bit expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> I hate the slimy feeling you get after you put lotion on almost as much as I hate having dry skin. Though you still feel a little slimy - this in-shower lotion offers a nice compromise.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It works great! It mosturizes just like it claims and it makes life so much easier! I have pretty dry skin so I usually mosturizes after the shower too but it gives me a one-up on my lotion and makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> Feels nice but not better then actually moisturizing after a shower.</li>
            <li> Just got this today hubby use it tonight and he said he liked it!</li>
            <li> Smells great the only reason im giving four stars cause you have to use a lot</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> This seemed like an easy way to skip a step in the morning, and it&#x27;s an OK moisturizer.  BUT it leaves the shower slippery and has to be scrubbed off and I am pretty sure it is clogging my pipes too, as the drain is running slowly since I started using it.  Skip one step (sort of, it&#x27;s not that great a moisturizer) but add two?  No thanks.</li>
            <li> Great product. This is a product I use daily. As directed it is used after washing your skin with soap. It makes my skin feel silky, soft, and hydrated. Some soaps dry you skin out. This rehydrates the skin and gives you skin the luscious, moisturized feel I am looking for all day. I can really tell a difference when I do not use it.</li>
            <li> I like this in shower body lotion it sure makes your skin nice and soft .so if you like soft skin like I do. you will like it too. I will be buying more of  this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a local retailer. I live in AZ in a very dry climate. I am very happy with the results. I use it differently since I love to take baths instead of showers. When I am done in the bath, I stand up and rub it all over me. Then I step out of the bath without rinsing. I towel dry by blotting my skin with a soft towel and then finish drying using a blow dryer. I do this to keep maximum product on my skin. This is fabulous! My skin feels like silk with no stickiness.</li>
            <li> When you rinse off..make sure you pat yourself dry. If not, you&#x27;ll rub it off. I wish it would dry less greasy and that is the sole reason I won&#x27;t use it. Plus, I&#x27;m not sure but I&#x27;m thinking this can&#x27;t be good for the drain as the oil will build up over time and clog the drain. I used it at once at home and then took it with me when I was traveling. Hotel&#x27;s have more money than I do for drain opening services.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful....love not having to get out of shower and then add lotion.</li>
            <li> My husband is a general contractor in Northern New Jersey.  He is not typically a &amp;#34;lotion guy&amp;#34;, but when I brought home Nivea In-Shower Lotion, he had to try it.  He LOVED IT!  It&#x27;s easy to apply, and you do it right in the shower.  No messy hands and it did not leave any residue in the shower. No extra messy steps once you get out of the shower.  And it worked...really helped with his dry winter skin.  So I guess now he&#x27;s a &amp;#34;lotion guy&amp;#34;.  And for me, I knew it was a winner even before we tried it, because it has earned the Good Housekeeping Seal...money well spent!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used this product for about a week now. The first time I used it was at night and when I woke up the next morning, my skin was really soft. The feeling takes a little getting used to, you notice that when you rinse it off in the shower, your skin sort of repels the water. It shortens my morning routine which is nice. Do NOT use it on your feet...it says that on the bottle but I&#x27;m telling you now. I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I obtained a sample of this in my Walmart Beauty Box and I absolutely love it. It goes on smoothly, has a wonderful clean but not overbearing scent, and rinses well but still leaves your skin silky throughout the day. Another wonderful thing is when you get out of the shower and dry off there isn&#x27;t any residue on your towel and you don&#x27;t feel sticky. Def reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> Very Easy to use, probably will not fully replace my regular body lotion, but it is better than no lotion of the days I am in a hurry!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to try in-shower lotion.  I have heard other people complain about the shower being slippery.  But as an always late person with dry skin I thought I would give it a go.  It has cut about 5 minutes out of my morning and for that I am thankful.  That&#x27;s an extra five I get to stay in bed!  I&#x27;ve been through a bottle and a half and have never had my shower be slippery and it moisturizes my skin so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This product is great and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky or filmy. However, I stopped using it because it left a very slippery film on the bottom of my shower tub. I won&#x27;t be cleaning my shower after every use!</li>
            <li> This is a great concept- Applying your lotion while you are in the shower. It is great for people like me who don&#x27;t take the time to apply lotion or procrastinate about doing it. It only takes an extra minute or so in the shower and it leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized for about 24 hours after applying it. The scent is great, and the price is reasonable. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin in the shower.</li>
            <li> After just one use there was noticeable difference in my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy and it smells great.  I&#x27;m definitely buying again</li>
            <li> Whoa, this stuff is awesome. I&#x27;m really impressed at how well it works. I just used it in the shower, and I must admit that I keep looking at my skin expecting it to look dry, but it&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s so freaky. I&#x27;ll add more of a review after a couple of uses, but for now, thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Love this product, great for dry skin. Gives good moisture to lock in hydration in the shower.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! It keeps me moisturized and makes getting ready in the mornings so much easier. I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in it making the bathtub slippery, but I don&#x27;t use a large amount of it each day so that could be why. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product seems to work as advertised, however beware how slippery it will make your shower! Not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this product. Unfortunately, it smells terrible. Threw it out after one use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product...especially when in a hurry.  I gave it four stars as I think if you suffer from extremely dry skin or just what the winter can do to your skin in the cold, you may need lotion.  I like this especially has I hate &amp;#34;lubing-up&amp;#34; my body before bed if I happen to take a shower at night or if you&#x27;re doing a quickie shower to rinse off (ex. after mowing or after cleaning up a baby explosion).  This is a great substitute as you take your shower like normal, apply this on your body while in the shower, rinse yourself, hose down the shower quickly, pat dry, lotion on your face, lotion on your feet and night-night.</li>
            <li> I have always hated the sticky feeling of applying lotion after getting out of the shower so i never used it. I take suoer hot showers and everytime i would dry myself with my towel i could see dead dried up skin coming off (especially on my legs). I saw this on tv and thought why not? I take my regular hot shower applied the lotion and dried myself and i was soooooo surpried! Literally after one use there was no more flakes of dead skin coming off! My arms and legs were radiant and smooth! I have struggled with this problem for years and boom just like that it has been fixed! If youre any way like me who hates lotion then this is definetly for you :)!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t moisturizer as well as regular lotion.</li>
            <li> I like Nivea products but can take or leave this one .</li>
            <li> This leaves more residue than regular lotion.  Do not care for it.</li>
            <li> This really does what it&#x27;s supposed to. My skin is nice and moisturized, no slathered lotion post shower needed. The only complaint i have is that there isn&#x27;t a scent free option, as Niveas lotion scents are too much for me.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li> Love the smell but it does not last. Not sticky to touch skin after use which is nice.</li>
            <li> Pros: My skin was noticeably softer after I got out of the shower and dried off. I didn&#x27;t feel like there was any slick, sticky, or greasy residue left on my body. I also didn&#x27;t notice it making my shower unusually slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The scent is very floral, and I&#x27;m not trying to smell like a funeral. It&#x27;s not an overpowering scent, I just don&#x27;t care for it. I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of the product, but I definitely won&#x27;t repurchase unless they make new scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the scent, I really like the idea of this product and it&#x27;s something I can definitely see myself using regularly. I like the formula and I think the product works well. If other scents become available, I would definitely recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li> great product.  I purchased to try as I normally use the Olay in Shower and this one leaves my skin so much softer &amp; moisturized. Would recommend.  Only drawback doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the Olay.  It smells like the Nivea lotion, not bad but not great.  Overall works very well.</li>
            <li> Smells like a citronella candle when you put it on then the smell seems to go away you rinse off get out of the shower and go to dry off the towel sticks to your skin and my skin is not smooth and silky instead it just feels disgusting</li>
            <li> So far I have only been using this product a few months but I really like it.  It cuts a lot of time out of my morning routine.  I do feel a little greasy when I first get out of the shower but as soon as I towel off my skin feels well moisturized and normal.  Generally I have pretty dry skin and this has still been working great though it has only been the spring/summer so I am curious if this will be sufficient for the winter months as well.  If nothing else I think its worth a try for anyone who normally applies body lotion everyday.</li>
            <li> I received a small .31ml packet in the mail of this product today, and decided to give it a shot. The concept of an in-sower body lotion was foreign to me, so I was skeptical at first. I had just enough to put on half of my body, so I applied evenly to just the right side after doing my normal washing. It felt extremely oily, and made my whole shower VERY slippery, so use caution, and I would advise to have some sort of grip on the bottom of the shower or bath tub if there isn&#x27;t already one. After I rinsed of the lotion and dried off, I personally felt a difference. My right side was just a small amount softer than the left, just after that single use! I needed to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a bias from knowing that I put the lotion on, so I asked my partner to tough my right arm, then my left and see if he noticed a difference. Please note that I did not tell him i used any new moisturizer, I only asked if my arm felt different to him. After a minute or so of going back and forth on my arms, he said &amp;#34;your right arm is super soft, but your left is kind of rough.&amp;#34; I was extremely surprised that he noticed, after just a single application. I fully intend to purchase a full bottle of this and use it daily. I imagine if a single application has made a small difference, then using it often will turn my skin baby smooth! The concept of in-shower lotion is fantastic! I always forget to put lotion on directly after my shower, so my skin suffers. If this becomes a routine part of sower time, it is significantly less likely to be forgotten! So without ado, I give this product 5 stars for creativity and quality.</li>
            <li> Recently I added this to my shower routine, which seems to be getting longer but so much fun. I have rather dry skin on my legs, especially during the winter and this product has been all of the difference.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a week, I took this with me on a weekend trip. It traveled well, with no leaking or anything terrible like that. Then everyone I bunked with this weekend had used it and loved it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on after I wash my body and shave my legs. Let it set on my skin for an extra minute then wash off. It&#x27;s not overly slippery so you don&#x27;t have to be concerned with it causing you to fall in the shower. Some products I have tried out, have really caused me to fall, but then again maybe I&#x27;m just clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to continue to use and repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the extra-dry formulation mostly out of curiosity and because I&#x27;d seen the ads on TV. My skin is super dry in the midAtlantic winters, so any additional sources of moisture that I can find, I will try. First, this is a huge bottle -- I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention to this fact when I placed my order.  I find the scent just OK, but it doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin at all and washes down the drain with the lotion. It does indeed leave shower surfaces very slick, so do make sure you rinse these down with a healthy dose of extra-hot water once you&#x27;re out of the shower to prevent any accidents from happening the next time someone bathes. As for its effectiveness -- it does leave my skin feeling less taut and tender after a shower, and I&#x27;m able to use a lighter body lotion once out of the shower than what I would need if I hadn&#x27;t already moisturized in the shower. But I do still feel it necessary to moisturize once out of the shower.  Perhaps this will change when the humid summertime arrives and my skin isn&#x27;t as dry; I can maybe see that the in-shower moisturization would be all I&#x27;d need at that time.&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add that this product is excellent for men.  It does not have any kind of &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell to it whatsoever, and my husband, who is not prone to moisturizing his body post-shower, will do the in-shower moisturization without too much kvetching. This relieves his dry winter skin and his skin is noticeably less itchy when he uses this product in the shower.  Maybe the ads for this product should target men as well as women? Seems to be an ideal product for them.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle the first one I got from Target me and my daughter saw the display and I was very curious about this product and if it would really work. Winter wrecks havoc on my skin and this year was particularly bad, my skin was dry, parched, and very itchy.  This product works at first I was wondering where the suds were, but then I realized its a lotion not a bath wash.  After the first try I was hooked, my dry and itchy skin gone, amazing. This is so much better than remembering to put on lotion after the shower, which I always forgot to do.  I will be a customer of this product and would recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> Not a fan.  Ended up throwing it away. Gets the shower flower all slimy. Hot water does not wash it away.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love Nivea&#x27;s In-Shower body lotion (I only use Nivea brand body lotions), but unfortunately, it can be pretty dangerous.  Even though I was really careful, I slipped and fell in the shower, severely twisting my ankle after using.  I read the warning on the label before using and made sure to thoroughly rinse the shower floor, however, the lotion still seems to leave a slippery residue.  The intended results aren&#x27;t worth the safety risk.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this.  This did nothing to moisturize my skin.  It made me break out in a rash.  It also made me smell like I was wearing men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I tried this product last year in germany and LOVED IT. For some reason, the american formula is not as good; it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling as moisturized. Smells great, though.</li>
            <li> Great daily moisturizer. The scent is very light and unisex. One definite plus is that it doesn&#x27;t have any sparkly stuff in it (unlike the Olay in-shower moisturizers).</li>
            <li> Excellent, not more flakes.</li>
            <li> Okay, this might sound strange because I rated it 5 stars, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan.&lt;br /&gt;I rated it 5 stars because it does exactly what it says it does, this stuff works great. The only reason I don&#x27;t care for it is because it works too well, lol. I am one of those people that can&#x27;t stand to have any type of lotion on. I don&#x27;t wear lotion, sunblock, foundation, creams, anything like that because honestly, it makes me sweat. We live in South Texas, along the Gulf, and it&#x27;s all about heat and humidity down here.&lt;br /&gt;I thought since this was an &amp;#34;in shower&amp;#34; lotion, maybe I could handle it. This stuff works great and I would assume that most people that wear lotions and it doesn&#x27;t bother them will love it. I have tried the other brand (Olay) of &amp;#34;in shower&amp;#34; lotion too and it isn&#x27;t anywhere near as good as this one is.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you wear lotion normally, you&#x27;ll like this. It does make your skin really soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Every winter my skin turns into the desert and I find myself scratching my legs to the point that they almost bleed.  As a man, I&#x27;m not good at applying lotion everyday, and even when I do it consistently, the dryness never heals up completely. Since using this product, I am 100% clear of&lt;br /&gt;all dry patches and my skin (legs) is completely healed. I understand that the product may make your floor slippery in the shower, but I simply get out and turn the water temp to max and rinse it. I have no problem with a slippery floor. The tub would be another story, but read the bottle, it clearly&lt;br /&gt;states that its for the shower! Hence the name &amp;#34;In-Shower Body Lotion&amp;#34;. Good luck everyone, this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Just used this yesterday..Loved it. Skin still feels soft next morning.</li>
            <li> Bought it just to try....ended up being pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t expect much, but i actually really like this stuff. i got a sample from a magazine &amp; went out &amp; bought it right away. my skin is crazy dry in the winter, so i need all the moisture i can get. i still use my after shower moisturizer because of how dry my skin is, but i think this stuff will be great in the summer. it&#x27;s super easy to use and keeps my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing i don&#x27;t like is the smell...it&#x27;s an old lady perfume smell to me, and it&#x27;s fairly strong. my b/f thinks it smells like chemicals. luckily, it fades, but for the first hour or so i can smell it. wish it came in fragrance free!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as moisturized as I thought it would. Still love the the product.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product.....it was sticky and i know they wared about making sure that its washed away to avoid slipping but its not that easy to do unless you9 have a hand held shower which i dont....much prefer putting on moisturizer AFTER i dry off!</li>
            <li> Very good product and it is neutral for men or women.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the 3 men of the house. They love it so much. That now they are refusing to use anything else. Great size wonderful smell, and does every thing it says for your skin</li>
            <li> This is a very nice in-shower lotion. I have used baby oil with aloe vera in my shower and have liked it. I believe this product lasts longer and better nourishes my skin. However, I have yet to figure out a way to use it on my back while in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly looking for short-cuts and saw the commercial advertising this product and had to have it. It feels like putting hair conditioner on your skin - it&#x27;s the same consistency. It isn&#x27;t very greasy and once you emerge from the shower, your skin does feel moisturized and it lasts for maybe one hour. You would be better off using baby oil - which doesn&#x27;t moisturize well in my opinion - than using this product. If you aren&#x27;t going to use lotion at all, then this would beat doing nothing. I like the Nivea smell and will use it until it&#x27;s gone but will definitely not reorder.</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves my skin so sticky! No matter how much I rinse off I cannot get the sticky feeling to go away.</li>
            <li> Good moisture that last about all day. Wish it had a sweeter fragrance.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for close to a week now, and I love it! My skin dries out easily and I can tell that the moisture is staying throughout the day!</li>
            <li> It really leaves my skin feeling soft and supple after bath or shower!  The cost is great, compared to brick and mortar stores.  If you have dry skin, or if you just want to feel silky and smooth after bathing, this is the ticket for you.  It&#x27;s also smooth and silky enough to shave your legs with.  I like how it doesn&#x27;t suds up a lot too.  It really has a lot of lotion characteristics but gets you very clean.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.  One step with extra moisturizing during a shower.  It didn&#x27;t work for me.  I did like the smell..very light and clean, but within an hour my dry skin was itching again unless I used another lotion.  I can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would work for me.  I have super dry skin;  I wash with Dr Woods Almond Castile soap and then coat myself with The Body Shop Shea Butter just to make my skin comfortable thru the dry winters in the NE.  I was hoping to be able to cut out the lotion part and save some time in the morning with this in shower lotion for extra dry skin.  I love the iea but this just doesn&#x27;t work for my skin.  After a week of use my skin is back to being super dry and itchy.  Back to shea body butter for me.</li>
            <li> Three stars for this product is generous - I would give it two but to be fair I do have REALLY dry skin on the bottom half of my legs. I purchased the &amp;#34;very dry skin&amp;#34; version because of this. Living in NY I was so excited when this product came out in hopes it would help me moisturize more routinely (its hard in the winter when its SO cold!!) however, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference having used it for about a week now- on my normal areas or on my dry areas. I still feel the need to use my regular moisturizing lotion afterwards- so whats the point? If you have healthy skin and your looking for a very light moisturizer this is perfect (will leave you with smooth feeling skin)- but if your looking for noticeably more moisturized skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really soft body after using. Great smell. I received this at a discounted price from Amazon for an honest review</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome plus is good for ur skin I will usually change lotions with the seasons just wanted to see if this works and wow it does get on Amazon and buy it</li>
            <li> Very unpleasant smell. Maybe they were trying to stay gender neutral but pee-ew! It feels like putting on lotion in the shower and just a little bit of it lingers once you towel off. I did notice slightly softer skin. But I also think I could have just put on any lotion in the shower and toweled off... And it would have smelled better!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people with very dry skin. It stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> This does not work for me. I tried the one for dry skin and after a few days my legs were super dry, flakey and itchy. I switched to the one for very dry and skin and still have the same problem.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well initially . I find I need to apply lotion during the day or dryness becomes evident. I will keep using it for the convince of it to see if continued use will improve this products performance.</li>
            <li> I recieved a sample of this for an honest review, so here it is. This item is pretty nice. You notice the smell first, it smells really nice and not like a usual drug store lotion (yes i am an indie snob) the firmuls is rich and you do have to be careful because it is kind of slick so avoid your soles of the feet. It may not feel like your moistured iimmediately but after a little bit you can feel that your skin is soft and smooth. I would use this in conjunction with my other lotions jusy because i like the smells iof them more. But this is a very nice product overall.</li>
            <li> This is ok as a moisturizer but great as a shave lotion. You MUST rinse your shower well after using this, it will make the shower extremely slippery otherwise.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this on Amazon at a great price (with a coupon) as I&#x27;ve been looking for an in-shower lotion to try to speed up my morning routine. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this product. First, if you follow the directions, you apply this to your wet skin and then rinse it off. This results in very little of the product left on your skin. Within an hour my skin was dry and itchy and I had to use regular lotion. I have moderately dry skin in the winter, so I have no idea how this could be a product for extra-dry skin, let alone a 24-hr moisturizer. I then tried this product again by toweling off lightly, then applying the product followed by a VERY light rinse. This gave me slightly better results, as I could tell my skin was somewhat soft immediately after use, but with no oily residue. However, once again my skin felt dry shortly after. I can&#x27;t use this product without having to also apply lotion after showering, defeating the whole purpose of it. I&#x27;d rather use my bath and body works sugar scrub, which can be a bit oily, and at least know that my skin won&#x27;t get dry within a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product two stars because it has a light, non-offensive scent and no oily residue. It might be suitable as a shaving cream or maybe as a product for someone without dry skin (maybe summer use?), but not for me!</li>
            <li> When I used it in the shower my skin was just as dry as if I had not used it.  But it is thick and rich and I use it right after my shower and don&#x27;t rinse it off.  Skin stays soft until my shower the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product more stars if it were not marketed for In-Shower use.  Very good lotion for hands and body otherwise.</li>
            <li> A perfect way to apply moisturizer without any fuss. Convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> as described with quick delivery.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> smells good- not greasy</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients in advance, but the main ingredient is petroleum jelly. This makes it too thick to use as a shave cream, and impossible to rinse off the razor. As an actual lotion I didn&#x27;t notice any moisturizing effects. I highly doubt I will use the rest of what is in the bottle.</li>
            <li> oh my goodness ! This is my favorite product I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have been a Nivea product lover for years now. I&#x27;ve used the face cream since high school &amp; recently started using the body lotion. When I saw this product on Amazon, I had to have it. I have a horrible problem with forgetting the put lotion on - especially in the winter time. I was a little worried though because the reviews claimed that the shower floor would be slippery &amp; since I have a little boy I was nervous about using it in the shower we share. But rest assured, it&#x27;s not as bad as people believe it to be. I don&#x27;t end up cleaning the shower floor &amp; I don&#x27;t feel like it is any slicker than normal. I don&#x27;t have a normal shower flor though, it&#x27;s a grained floor so maybe that&#x27;s why. My skin feels soft &amp; beautiful after the shower &amp; I love following it up with the regular Nivea lotion on those super dry days. This is a product that I will gladly repurchase over &amp; over again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like a old grandma&#x27;s perfume. It also leaves a gross frothy film on my bathtub and made my skin feel like it just had the same film on it! Yuck!</li>
            <li> this does not leave you greasy or like your pores cant breath. Highly recomend</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good! The best in all the world is Ro&#x27;s Argon from Lush (in shower moisturizer). But price and ability to moisturizer is a great back up!</li>
            <li> I bought the formular for extreamly dry skin and it is really just OK. It makes a small difference, but I still need to apply other lotion. It&#x27;s not awful, but I would not bu again.</li>
            <li> This smells good in the bottle, but when you put it on and rinse it off it smells terrible! Smells like you work on cars or something. It feels great but smells yuk!!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.  Once you&#x27;ve showered you apply this liberally to your skin and allow it to sit for a minute or so then simply rinse off.  This product is so good that even after towel drying it still is on your skin. This particular version has almond oil in the product, so anyone who may have an allergy to nuts may want to use a different version of this product.  The almond oil in this product is has so many benefits for your skin.  Almond oil is rich in vitamin A, B and E, which are great for skin health. The oil helps maintaining moisture levels of the skin and gets absorbed without blocking the pores.  It actually provides nourishment for your skin. It is extremely soothing for dry skin; it&#x27;s great for irritation and inflammation of the skin too. It&#x27;s a good solution for Psoriasis and Eczema as well.  My wife and I both use this and have noticed that it has improved our complexion and restored a natural glow to our skin.  It rejuvenates your skin by promoting healthy skin renewal.  It&#x27;s better than most regular lotions on the market.  I will continue to purchase this as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> Works as described and helps moisturize dry skin. Wish it were unscented or lightly scented.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I got hooked onto their shea butter version and we&#x27;ve been using it religiously every time we shower. Now its nearly two months and I&#x27;ve got to get more!! With the summer heat in, I&#x27;m not so sure whether the Almond oil may be too moisturizing, but this gives us a fun shower experience each time!</li>
            <li> Not only great for my laziness but also cuts lotion &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; time completely away. Leaves me feeling perfectly moisturized although I still lotion super dry parts. Great for my guy who hates lotioning and feeling &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR SUPER DRY SKIN!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this.  It totally works, men and women.</li>
            <li> Not as good as advertised!! I have dry skin and after putting on this product it feels smooth and moisturized for less than an hour but then my skin feels very dry as before. I still have to moisturize with oil or moisturizing cream. I will NOT buy it ever again.</li>
            <li> MY BIG CRITICISM IS THAT THE BOTTLE IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HOLD ONTO IN THE SHOWER THE ONLY WAY I CAN USE IT IS TO GET OUT OF SHOWER WHILE STILL WEL, APPLY THE LOTION AND DRY OFF SITTING DOWN. IT IS VERY SLIPPERY AND THERE IS A DANGER GETTING IT ON  FLOOR OF SHOWER. It does a good job and feels good on my skin and I fill continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Huge fan of this product. The only warning I will share is that you&#x27;ll become addicted to this product, and the slight drawback that it can make you shower/tub floor surface slippery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use lotion anymore!  My skin is so soft after using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shower lotion several times and it seems like you have to use a lot in order to cover your entire body and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my skin all that softer. At this rate I will run out quickly and still have to use lotion to moisturize my body. Not very impressed.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this in shower lotion! however  i am pleasantly surprised. i love the scent its very fresh and also really moisturizes your skin with out a greasy feel</li>
