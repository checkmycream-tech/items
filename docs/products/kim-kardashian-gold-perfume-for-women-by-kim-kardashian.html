            <li> I was a little skeptical of whether or not it would be a genuine perfume since the price was a steal!</li>
            <li> I had hoped was not watered down, but instead like my french perfumes.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon was only half the price at other retailers.  </li>
            <li> Not very florally.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have listened to other reviews instead of buying it.</li>
            <li> the other 3 seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After Dark, she steals a lot of fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is defiantly my everyday fragance...</li>
            <li> its not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> what a waste of $30</li>
            <li> I felt like i wasted money.</li>
            <li> The smell was so powerful and sickening.</li>
            <li> Poor poor quality.</li>
            <li> i could smell the horrible ordor through the box before i even opened that package and it was a total knockoff</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> It was a fake!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> but then it got sickening.</li>
            <li> This is a knock off and it smells horrible!</li>
            <li> it was disgusting!</li>

            <li> I bought this because it looked I interesting, the smell however was toxic to my nose and would not leave me until I showered</li>
            <li> This perfume has an incredibly Beautiful warm scent.  My Husband loves it which is an obvious plus. If you like warm woodsy sweet scents you will like this one.  Not very florally.</li>
            <li> Say what you want about the Kardashian&#x27;s. This perfume smells quite nice. My daughter has all of their perfumes. This one is the nicest. I bought it for my wife as it really matches her body chemistry and smell fantastic on her.</li>
            <li> I love the smell!,,,,,</li>
            <li> It was a fake! Its a definite 0 stars but it doesn&#x27;t allow you.</li>
            <li> Son bought for girlfriend for her birthday. She wears it all the time and now I like it.  Can&#x27;t wait to buy it for myself.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the gragrance.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of whether or not it would be a genuine perfume since the price was a steal! It&#x27;s real! I was soooo happy since this perfume is hard to find these days. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Do not buy! This is a knock off and it smells horrible! The box and bottle were different too! As soon as I sprayed it, I had a instant headache. The smell was so powerful and sickening. Wish I would have listened to other reviews instead of buying it. Now its in the trash.</li>
            <li> I wanted to smell this product because it&#x27;s one that I have always over looked and by my surprise it was awesome! I feel beautiful and sophisticated every time I spray it on! I think most people overlooked it as well but I happen to enjoy it! It&#x27;s mature and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Let me translate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;3.4-ounce eau de parfum&amp;#34; - 3.4 ounces of smelly water they expect you to pay $25 for. That&#x27;s over $1000 a gallon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Summer Fragrance&amp;#34; - It&#x27;s just not chic to smell like a skank the other 3 seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;A precious fragrance that glimmers with opulence&amp;#34; - Sucker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This item is not for sale in Catalina Island&amp;#34; - Because they have standards there.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance but doesn&#x27;t last. If you like this one you&#x27;re better off getting Glow After Dark By J.Lo which is EXACTLY the same fragrance.  Of course Kim Gold is a cheap copy of Glow After Dark, she steals a lot of fragrances.</li>
            <li> The person I purchased this for loved it and recently asked where I purchased it from. It&#x27;s time to refill.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume. Excellent selling price! I hope I can find a deal like this when I run out</li>
            <li> Love it so does my boyfriend</li>
            <li> i could smell the horrible ordor through the box before i even opened that package and it was a total knockoff it was disgusting! i threw it away the minute i opened the box. i will never purchase a perfume online ever again! what a waste of $30</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> hi, I bought this perfume because I just Looooove Kim. but I had a nice surprise when I tried it... it is a strong perfume, but later it turns very sweet. Maybe its not meant for girls. Im 43 and I feel this perfume is right for me!!!</li>
            <li> SURPRISINGLY WITH ALL THAT IS SAID ABOUT THE KARDASHIANS I FIND THIS HAS A GREAT SCENT AT A GREAT PRICE.  I CAN&#x27;T SEEM TO GET ENOUGH.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I got this same fragrance free from the link below:https://www.listia.com/signup/7132912 I&#x27;ve gotten all types of brand name products free!(ex.Apple,Samsung,Amazon,LG,Disney,Coach,Chanel,Katy Perry,Beyoncé,Jessica Simpson,Nikki Minaj,Halle Berry,bath and body works,Victoria secret,Fisher Price,Nike) products like(ex.tablets,smartphones,toys,health &amp; beauty, household product,chromecast,furniture) that&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg! Believe me this site is worth checking out!! Join,have fun,and enjoy!!</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this perfume its for younger women its not too strong .  The only thing i dont like is that the scent goes away fast. I wished it last longer.</li>
            <li> OMGGGG my favorite perfume of all time. Thank you Amazon for having it!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the real one. It smells nice, but it wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was getting. I saved the sample smells and they didn&#x27;t match up.</li>
            <li> Its a little too strong. At first i liked the scent but then it got sickening. It kinda smells like guys cologne. I felt like i wasted money.</li>
            <li> I dont care for the scent..</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,  very sexy scent. My friend loved it.I highly recommend this to any girl,  or someone special in your life</li>
            <li> one of my  daughter&#x27;s  favorite perfumes  she loves this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great deal for perfume.  ships right to your door FAST</li>
            <li> If you like Britney Speard Fantasy or Heidi Klum Shine, you will love this. I smelled it on a friend, and had to get me a bottle. My husband loves it on me too. I am 31, so I don&#x27;t think this smells &#x27;old&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Unless this is an overseas version I am pretty certain I got a knockoff. It looks like the original  KK perfume color with the gold label  on top. The bottle isn&#x27;t golden colored. I googled images of it and everyone is holding a gold bottle not this one. I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> bought for a present to a friend and she loved it, so thank you. about the delivery it came exactly at the time it say it would took.</li>
            <li> nice job.. this was a perfect gift for my sister. she is very happy and i am with you with a excellent service.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume. I have gotten compliments on it and I would purchase it again. The price was great for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Fake. Bottle broke. Perfume went all over my bag, ruined my bag.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, but the spray did not work properly for my friend. Hope next time y buy something like this, it will be in perfect conditions.</li>
            <li> my niece had this in her Christmas list so the item is excellent (as described), but yet to smell it since it has been packaged up as a gift.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty good but u will need to reapply in 5 mins cause it leaves u that fast. Poor poor quality. Don&#x27;t get scammed buy real parfumes</li>
    </ol>
