            <li>pot-shower of most body washes.</li>
            <li>This formula is my favorite</li>
            <li>and I was able to buy 2 cases here.</li>
            <li>Love this body wash.</li>

            <li>I bought this before and would love to do so again when available.</li>
            <li>What a great value i love this wash and it was far cheaper to buy this way than individual bottles prompt delivery packed great</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find the original online and have bought two cartons now.  </li>
            <li>It is easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to find it on Amazon and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Thank you for having it available at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I do not feel any soap residue after rinsing, which is an important thing to me.</li>
            <li>I love the light fresh scent of the original Lever 2000.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks again!!!</li>
            <li>i love the powerful clean scent.</li>
            <li>But that isn&#x27;t possible anymore, so I am very glad to be able to order it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is an effective, gentile, product and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Originally bought a case of this from another online seller.  </li>
            <li>I hope they continue to produce the original and put it on store shelves again.</li>
            <li>Leaves you smelling and feeling clean all day.</li>
            <li>Almost smells like a clean batch of laundry.</li>
            <li>when someone else who uses it walks into a room, i can smell it right away because of how strong it is.</li>
            <li>They had a one time special going on.  </li>
            <li>All that the product claim is true.  </li>
            <li>The young Lady at Amazon was extremely nice and apologitic.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t scented but rather has that fresh, clean smell (and leaves your skin smelling the same).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li>I hesitated to write a review about soap, but I have to say that I discovered this particular brand (and type) of body wash years ago and love the fact that I can purchase six-packs on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a product that doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like an over body sprayed teenage boy.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t find it in the store love this lotion its not like the original blue</li>
            <li>I purchased the original scent Lever 2000 Body Wash based upon other reviews by women who indicated how nice the fragrance was.</li>
            <li>This is the nice thick and creamy version of my favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>The new Original, Lever is putting on store shelves now, is nothing like this.</li>
            <li>Greasy, slippery feel on skin persisted after thorough attempt to wash skin with hot water.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what I wanted and it arrived in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>My first encounter with Lever 2000 was on a cruise ship.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for helping me out!</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE ORIGINAL LEVER 2000 , THE NEW STUFF IN THE STORES IS WEAKER &amp; REALLY</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a Lever product that didn&#x27;t leave my skin, soft, clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It leaves you feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>This wash has a fresh scent and is effective without being harsh.</li>
            <li>NOT GOOD, WE LOVE THE ORIGINAL &amp; THE ORIGINAL PURE RAIN,</li>
            <li>the new improved origianl which is blue, still good but not the same.  </li>
            <li>In general, it gives me that \\&quot;clean feeling\\&quot; when I hop out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I used the original formula of Lever 2000 for over 20 years and after trying one bottle of the new, improved, non anti-bacterial formula switched to a competing brand that offers an anti-bacterial formula.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like the bars that I have used, which has very rick lather.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to smell like fruit or my whole body to smell like deodorant I put under my arm.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>however, this body wash smells absolutely nothing like the bar soap.</li>
            <li>they really should not call this \\&quot;original\\&quot; scent because of that.</li>
            <li>i have been using Lever 2000 original bar soap for the last 6 or 7 years.</li>
            <li>The package arrived as expected and very quickly.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not unpleasant, if it is intended to be used by a man or a teenage boy --</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m highly allergic to everything.</li>
            <li>I use the Lever 2000 original bar soap - at least they are still around, although sometimes not always available.</li>
            <li>Have used it for quite a few years and used to be able to find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li>It is worth a try for those looking to alternate to bar soaps.</li>
            <li>There are other types of the same product (blue, green) but the original white is so cleansing, with (for me) a perfect level of &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; (NONE).</li>
            <li>I love this product but it&#x27;s hard to find now and very costly when I do find it.</li>
            <li>I will contunue to order Perfectly Fresh through Amazon as long as I can find this product the there.</li>
            <li>Glad I could order online and will do in a few months again!</li>
            <li>Dr. Recommended this soap to help prevent frequent skin boils.</li>
            <li>The body wash is not available in the local stores; therefore, I was pleased when I found it online at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Leaves you clean, without skin feeling dried out.  </li>
            <li>BTW this has a 1.5 ounces more than the new green watered down junk.</li>
            <li>definitely not a scent that most women (at least those I know) would consider for themselves.  </li>
            <li>Why does every company have to mess with a proven success?</li>
            <li>Not sure if the contents were changed or altered from the original formula or not</li>
            <li>I was getting the one with the great fragrance everyone raved about, but this is a remake and a bad one.</li>
            <li>So many of the body washes, including some from Lever, are much too heavy on the fragrances they leave behind on the body after a shower.</li>

            <li> So many of the body washes, including some from Lever, are much too heavy on the fragrances they leave behind on the body after a shower.</li>
            <li> The original Lever 2000 body wash has become very hard to find.</li>
            <li> , soap is a pretty boring subject, but Lever 2000 is good enough to warrant the review time.</li>
            <li> AS LONG AS I CAN GET IT, PLEASE LEVER 2000</li>
            <li> Because of a dry skin problem after showering, my dermatologist recommended I use Lever 2000</li>
            <li> Not greatly available and way to expensive, but I love this wash.</li>
            <li> If I cannot get this thick and creamy version, I will have to find a new soap.</li>
            <li> This scent is hard to find in our local stores but it is the only soap I use for my 2000 parts.  </li>
            <li> My husband will ONLY use Lever 2000 and has been missing his &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> they went a little heavy on the moisturizer too, so your skin feels a little slick after using it as compared to their bar soap.</li>
            <li> Somehow, my rating was entered wrong, and not given enough stars.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is being discontinued by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This Lever Body Wash formula has been very difficult to find in my local stores.</li>
            <li> This is the least offensive of any I have tried....not too bad at all.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I am oleased to know that Lever still makes this product as it has become impossible for me to find in a store in a shelf.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t find this product anymore.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that Lever changed the body wash found in stores.  </li>

The store I went to last night didn&#x27;t have this product and I went through almost every body wash and none of them gave that \\&quot;shower clean\\&quot; smell.  I don&#x27;t want to smell like fruit or my whole body to smell like deodorant I put under my arm.  This lever 2000 product is awesome for smell, texture, it washes off well, and moisturizes.  In general, it gives me that \\&quot;clean feeling\\&quot; when I hop out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in the time promised. Because of a dry skin problem after showering, my dermatologist recommended I use Lever 2000 and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Greasy, slippery feel on skin persisted after thorough attempt to wash skin with hot water. I used bar soap to get rid of the grease. Nough said.</li>
            <li> Originally bought a case of this from another online seller.  They had a one time special going on.  I have since purchased online with Amazon.  Product is exactly what I wanted and it arrived in a timely manner.  Can&#x27;t find this product in local stores.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Of course I love it I bought a box of six.  This scent is hard to find in our local stores but it is the only soap I use for my 2000 parts.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t find this product anymore. The best bath soap!!</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash.  It acts as good as any deodorant soap, plus it eliminates enlarged pours, yeast problems and is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My husband will ONLY use Lever 2000 and has been missing his &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; body wash. Thankfully I found it here! The package arrived as expected and very quickly. Love this product. It smells great and works nicely.</li>
            <li> I could no longer find this in stores and was glad it is available on line.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to find out that I am able to purchase Lever 2000 Body Wash. I was so upset when they discontinued to sell it. Amazon is a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> Leaves you clean, without skin feeling dried out.  It&#x27;s nice to have a product that doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like an over body sprayed teenage boy.</li>
            <li> I still love this lever body wash.  It is easy on the skin.  the new improved origianl which is blue, still good but not the same.  Until the supply runs out, I am sticking to this one.</li>
            <li> No sticky or residue feeling after showering. I love the light fresh scent of the original Lever 2000. I&#x27;ve been using this body wash since it came out on the shelves. I&#x27;ve tried others but always come back. Thanks</li>
            <li> Somehow, my rating was entered wrong, and not given enough stars.  I am correcting it now and was very happy with the packaging of the Body Wash.  The bottles arrived in perfect condition in a box inside of a packing box.  We received it in two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only body wash that we use.  Have used it for quite a few years and used to be able to find it in the stores.  But that isn&#x27;t possible anymore, so I am very glad to be able to order it from Amazon.  We both love the fragrance and the mildness of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering from this company again!</li>
            <li> Why does every company have to mess with a proven success? The original Lever 2000 body wash has become very hard to find. It is the only one my wife will use. Thank goodness - most of the others are so strongly scented that when she uses them and comes to bed I get stuffy and can&#x27;t breath! I use the Lever 2000 original bar soap - at least they are still around, although sometimes not always available. So we are happy to find the body wash available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> My first encounter with Lever 2000 was on a cruise ship.  Impressed with the product I started using Lever 2000 at home.  I has been two months.  I prefer Lever 2000 more than bar soap.  All that the product claim is true.  It is worth a try for those looking to alternate to bar soaps.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it&#x27;s hard to find now and very costly when I do find it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the original scent Lever 2000 Body Wash based upon other reviews by women who indicated how nice the fragrance was. The fragrance is not unpleasant, if it is intended to be used by a man or a teenage boy -- definitely not a scent that most women (at least those I know) would consider for themselves.  I have given the rest of the case I purchased to some of the men in my family.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores. Dr. Recommended this soap to help prevent frequent skin boils. It works great!</li>
            <li> So many of the body washes, including some from Lever, are much too heavy on the fragrances they leave behind on the body after a shower. This is the least offensive of any I have tried....not too bad at all.</li>
            <li> The product is winderfu just as I remembered. It cam in a 5 pack not 6. The young Lady at Amazon was extremely nice and apologitic. She offered me options for resolution and made sure that I was satisfied with that resolutuin. I am oleased to know that Lever still makes this product as it has become impossible for me to find in a store in a shelf. I will contunue to order Perfectly Fresh through Amazon as long as I can find this product the there. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to write a review about soap, but I have to say that I discovered this particular brand (and type) of body wash years ago and love the fact that I can purchase six-packs on Amazon. There are other types of the same product (blue, green) but the original white is so cleansing, with (for me) a perfect level of &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; (NONE). I recommend this for anyone who dislikes the greasy feel pot-shower of most body washes. This product isn&#x27;t scented but rather has that fresh, clean smell (and leaves your skin smelling the same).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, soap is a pretty boring subject, but Lever 2000 is good enough to warrant the review time. EXCELLENT body wash.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!! I can always count on this site to find things that no one else carries. This Lever Body Wash formula has been very difficult to find in my local stores. Not sure if it is being discontinued by the manufacturer. This formula is my favorite and I was able to buy 2 cases here. Thanks again!!!</li>
            <li> IORIGINALITY purchased this thinking I was getting the one with the great fragrance everyone raved about, but this is a remake and a bad one.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I bought this before and would love to do so again when available.</li>
            <li> I used the original formula of Lever 2000 for over 20 years and after trying one bottle of the new, improved, non anti-bacterial formula switched to a competing brand that offers an anti-bacterial formula.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but then it became unavailable in my area.  I have searched for it everywhere and finally found it through Amazon.  It is an effective, gentile, product and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and the smell is so relaxing.  I searched in stores and no one had the scent I purchased here.  Thank you for having it available at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> What a great value i love this wash and it was far cheaper to buy this way than individual bottles prompt delivery packed great will definetly order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Not greatly available and way to expensive, but I love this wash.</li>
            <li> This is the nice thick and creamy version of my favorite body wash. The new Original, Lever is putting on store shelves now, is nothing like this. If I cannot get this thick and creamy version, I will have to find a new soap. I bought 3 cases of this, so I will not have to cross that bridge for a while. BTW this has a 1.5 ounces more than the new green watered down junk.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the store for years and loved it, but when I purchased it through this site it made me itchy all over and I got a rash.  Not sure if the contents were changed or altered from the original formula or not but I had to throw it all out!</li>
            <li> This is a great price and perfect product. This product is perfect for people who are very sensitive and can&#x27;t use perfume products.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash. Leaves you smelling and feeling clean all day. Almost smells like a clean batch of laundry.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find it in the store love this lotion its not like the original blue it&#x27;s thicker and latheta up much better</li>
            <li> I think this soap does a good cleaning job, and I like the scent. I do not feel any soap residue after rinsing, which is an important thing to me.</li>
            <li> i have been using Lever 2000 original bar soap for the last 6 or 7 years. i love the powerful clean scent. when someone else who uses it walks into a room, i can smell it right away because of how strong it is. however, this body wash smells absolutely nothing like the bar soap. not even close to it. they really should not call this \\&quot;original\\&quot; scent because of that. they went a little heavy on the moisturizer too, so your skin feels a little slick after using it as compared to their bar soap. i probably would not recommend the body wash to a friend.</li>
            <li> Lever 2000 has stopped selling this product and I&#x27;m highly allergic to everything. Thank you so much for helping me out!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that Lever changed the body wash found in stores.  The replacement is a cheaper version and I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.  I was so glad to find the original online and have bought two cartons now.  I hope they continue to produce the original and put it on store shelves again.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ORIGINAL LEVER 2000 , THE NEW STUFF IN THE STORES IS WEAKER &amp; REALLY NOT GOOD, WE LOVE THE ORIGINAL &amp; THE ORIGINAL PURE RAIN, WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER THIS AS LONG AS I CAN GET IT, PLEASE LEVER 2000 QUIT CHANGING IT!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite soap but can&#x27;t find at store anymore. Glad I could order online and will do in a few months again!</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a Lever product that didn&#x27;t leave my skin, soft, clean and hydrated. This wash has a fresh scent and is effective without being harsh. If you try wash, you will be hooked. My skin was about a 1 before this wash and now I&#x27;m a 7!</li>
            <li> I love Lever 2000.  It leaves you feeling clean and soft. My kids were to use Lever 2000to help keep acne away and it worked so well.</li>
