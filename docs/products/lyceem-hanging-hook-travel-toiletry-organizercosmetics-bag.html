            <li>she loved it.</li>
            <li>So, I tried here at Amazon and found many with beautiful colors and nice prices.  </li>
            <li>it looks like it could hold a great deal more.  </li>
            <li>The fabric is very nice, the stitching could have been better.</li>
            <li>A bag I hope to use for many years to come!</li>
            <li>love it!  </li>
            <li>doen&#x27;t zip real smoothly.</li>
            <li>I too, girlie as it is, liked the color options.</li>
            <li>Purchased the toiletry bag organizer for my granddaughter; she really likes it and it is the perfect size.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for a friend who had admired my own..</li>
            <li>Nice product and will use this company again.  :-)</li>
            <li>Cute color, sturdy design.  </li>
            <li>and I love the color.</li>
            <li>More Roomy than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>My daughters love there cosmetic bag they use it when we travel for the weekend.</li>
            <li>I am really glad to have the hook option, but haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li>Delivery was prompt and I was thoroughly pleased with my order.</li>
            <li>I bought this bag for my grand European vacation and it worked wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love the color.</li>
            <li>Was perfect for travel toiletry bag on a week long trip!</li>
            <li>I am able to put all my supplies in one place, easy to view contents, and I still have room for more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great bag for our 3 young girls to use as a toiletry bag!  </li>
            <li>I loved that i could put a whole bunch of stuff in it, but i think with another row it would be more organized and better accessible.</li>
            <li>But onto more important features.  </li>
            <li>I think that if if the fabric continues to loosen with use around the zipper area they will move more freely and probably not break.  </li>
            <li>Bright pink, although not as bright as the picture.  </li>
            <li>I just got this bag recently after reading a great many reviews.  </li>
            <li>All of the storage pockets and dividers made it easy to organize all of my cosmetics and toiletries.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and strong bag.</li>
            <li>However, I would much rather buy this pretty much perfect bag for under $15 than pay $40 or much higher.  </li>
            <li>It can fit full sized bath gel, too!  </li>
            <li>I just sit the bag on the table while I do my makeup and that works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Even going through security I was able to access it quickly and use it with ease.</li>
            <li>but I imagine if I was going on a trip, this would fit all my toiletries -- even full-size stuff -- just fine.</li>
            <li>you can fit a lot of things in the bag</li>
            <li>The zipper isn&#x27;t that smooth though.</li>
            <li>Great present.</li>
            <li>She can fit all her toiletries in the pockets inside</li>
            <li>That is important to me for trips where I am trying to take a week of clothes and etc, in a carry on, and I plan to borrow or buy toiletries at my destination if needed.  </li>
            <li>Well organized - will be very useful.</li>
            <li>I was able to give this as gifts at a girlfriend gathering and I was so pleased to be able to give each one a different color.  </li>
            <li>The ability to hang it on a towel rack is great when staying at a hotel where there is very limited counter space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>fits everything very well and love the organization.</li>
            <li>It is the PERFECT SIZE for me: medium, not small and not huge.  </li>
            <li>I put a good handful of things 3 oz on up to a full size tube of gel the main back compartment and to my surprise</li>
            <li>I fit so much stuff in here</li>
            <li>Nicely divided inside with multiple pockets to keep items separated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also kind of flimsy when you have it completely open on the counter</li>
            <li>I wanted a new toiletry bag and when I looked at LL Bean, they didn&#x27;t have any colors I liked and the price was a bit high.  </li>
            <li>Every little important toiletry could be safely stowed in this bag and easily tucked into my checked luggage.  </li>
            <li>This bag is just the right size.</li>
            <li>The middle compartments are looser and do not seem as useful so far, but they may end up being good for a sparse make-up supply.</li>
            <li>All my things fit nicely has a few lil compartments here and there</li>
            <li>The best feature to me is when the bag is expanded at all in the base, it sits nicely on a counter</li>
            <li>will order one for travel and one as a home first aid kit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it held absolutely everything i could think of to put in it!</li>
            <li>Longer handle would&#x27;ve been even better but not big problem</li>
            <li>I got the smaller and it fits everything and a bit more.  </li>
            <li>The bag was attractive, very well constructed so should last a long time.  </li>
            <li>But for more local trips I can load it up and expand it as much as I want.</li>
            <li>Great size for pre-teen girls with a few toiletries but not a whole drawer full.  </li>
            <li>But the first time I used it I was pleasantly surprised!!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really use that part of it</li>
            <li>Plenty of pockets &amp; inside space, I really like that feature since I like to separate my makeup by uses (eye stuff,</li>
            <li>I also really like the feature</li>
            <li>Very well made as well.</li>
            <li>and it wants to cave in.</li>
            <li>Fits literally so much?</li>
            <li>I really love the pink color!</li>
            <li>I bought these because I needed something that would be wash able in case something spilled due to plane travel.</li>
            <li>So they are nothing like the high end (usually finer toothed) indestructible zippers you find on nice goretex shell jackets, for instance.  </li>
            <li>Eventually got a little holenin the top</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how much it holds.  </li>
            <li>A place for band aids and such and a nice deep spot for my shampoo and such.  </li>
            <li>This was a purchase for our 8 year old granddaughter, she loved it If the purchase had been for myself I would have been disappointed and returned the item for better quality.</li>
            <li>When I arrived at a new hotel, I pulled the bag out and hung it on the clothes hook in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>That said, I did like how one of the narrow end compartments held my toothbrush upright and snugly, separated from everything else and easily seen and retrievable.</li>
            <li>things I like to have clean and use every night in the flat upper inside mesh compartment.</li>
            <li>My order came fast and I was initially Leary about the size.</li>
            <li>I really like solid option</li>
            <li>And practically speaking the color does help me to locate it in my suitcase or even on a busy, shared, bathroom counter during a trip.  </li>
            <li>As far as materials, I think the fabric is good-looking and probably quite durable, and probably water-resistant too.  </li>
            <li>that my old bathroom bag couldn&#x27;t fit and it is a lot small.  </li>
            <li>So far I have found the mesh compartments limited in usefulness, but I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>and I chose fuchsia or hot pink, cannot what it was called.</li>
            <li>It is large enough to hold my supplies,but small enough to fit into my larger work bag.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s small enough to fit in her travel bag.</li>
            <li>(I also prefer purses that have enough of a base to be able to stand and not topple over at the slightest push) and I can easily see what I am looking for as I rifle through everything: yay.</li>
            <li>I will admit the zippers are only a fair-medium quality (the mesh seems fair-medium too, but it is not so important to me or hard for me to be careful with).  </li>

            <li> It does hold a ton of stuff though - I can pack full-size items for long trips and have them all in the same spot.</li>
            <li> I needed something that was going to hold all of my crap but not be this super huge bag i had to drag around along with the rest of my things.</li>
            <li> Actually sometimes its a little unwieldy when there&#x27;s not enough in it!</li>
            <li> But this bag is big, it has a few pockets for smaller items and it&#x27;s not bulky.</li>
            <li> I usually has a problem of finding a bag big enough for my toiletries.</li>
            <li> Until then I am being careful working the zipper.  </li>
            <li> , I read other reviews that stated that was flimsy</li>
            <li> The only negative comment I have is that the zipper</li>
            <li> The only complaint from my daughter is the embroidered name on the front.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday makeup bag</li>
            <li> It is the size of a small purse</li>
            <li> Because the zippers or mesh could fail, I am only rating it a 4.</li>
            <li> Small, compact but carries a TON of stuff like body wash, deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrush, dental floss, nail clippers, lip gloss, hand cream, etc.,</li>
            <li> that if I am flying and really minimally load it (or perhaps don&#x27;t load it at all, but use it only after arrival) with all the annoying 3 oz bottles for security, it will collapse and take up little space.  </li>
            <li> I am so sick of stuffing my toiletries into ugly plastic-lined single compartment paisley make-up bags I have had laying around for years--or worse toting around an assortment of confusing plastic zip-lock bags during a trip.</li>
            <li> I will be quite disappointed if the zipper breaks--I do not like to waste my money in nickels and dimes--but I am gambling it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Drives me crazy.  </li>
            <li> I hate having all my toiletries (makeup, contact case, etc.)</li>

            <li> Helps keep all things baby organized while traveling.</li>
            <li> you can fit a lot of things in the bag</li>
            <li> Cute color, sturdy design.  I was surprised by how much it holds.  Zips great.  Was perfect for travel toiletry bag on a week long trip!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She says:  Works for what I need it to do. I don&#x27;t use the hanger inside, I read other reviews that stated that was flimsy but I don&#x27;t really use that part of it so it&#x27;s flimsiness doesn&#x27;t bother me. I just sit the bag on the table while I do my makeup and that works fine for me. Plenty of pockets &amp; inside space, I really like that feature since I like to separate my makeup by uses (eye stuff, face stuff, lip stuff, etc). This is my everyday makeup bag but I imagine if I was going on a trip, this would fit all my toiletries -- even full-size stuff -- just fine.</li>
            <li> I usually has a problem of finding a bag big enough for my toiletries. But this bag is big, it has a few pockets for smaller items and it&#x27;s not bulky. I like it. The zipper isn&#x27;t that smooth though.</li>
            <li> I am a in home nurse and carry a lot of supplies.  I had my supplies in 4 bags and spend a lot of time looking for them. I am able to put all my supplies in one place, easy to view contents, and I still have room for more.&lt;br /&gt;The bag is well made-great zippers- and I love the color. It is large enough to hold my supplies,but small enough to fit into my larger work bag.&lt;br /&gt;I will order one for travel and one as a home first aid kit.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this bag enough!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great toiletry bag! I fit so much stuff in here that my old bathroom bag couldn&#x27;t fit and it is a lot small.  I really love the pink color!</li>
            <li> Very nice bag. More Roomy than I thought it would be. A bag I hope to use for many years to come!</li>
            <li> I go out on my boyfriends dad&#x27;s boat every summer and we use the bath houses for our showers. I needed something that was going to hold all of my crap but not be this super huge bag i had to drag around along with the rest of my things. It is the size of a small purse but it held absolutely everything i could think of to put in it! I had my deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, makeup, hair accessories, shampoo, conditioner, soap, washrag, shower gel, heat protectant, sunscreen, big thing of body spray, two brushes and i still had room. I used the front three pockets for my shampoo, conditioner, and soap (in a case), and in the pack i just piled the rest of my stuff. I used the outside pocket for my retainer brite (cleaner tablets), but im going to use it to store my phone in the future. Over all im really happy with this bag, its the perfect girl shower bag :) My only suggestion to the manufacturer, is to make another row of mesh pockets. I loved that i could put a whole bunch of stuff in it, but i think with another row it would be more organized and better accessible. I would buy it again !</li>
            <li> The bag is actually roomy. The only negative comment I have is that the zipper doen&#x27;t zip real smoothly.</li>
            <li> My order came fast and I was initially Leary about the size. Especially because im known to over pack. But the first time I used it I was pleasantly surprised!! All my things fit nicely has a few lil compartments here and there and im happy with it!</li>
            <li> The bag was attractive, very well constructed so should last a long time.  Well organized - will be very useful.</li>
            <li> My daughters love there cosmetic bag they use it when we travel for the weekend. love it!  wouldn&#x27;t mind getting one for me</li>
            <li> Sturdy and strong bag. Perfect size for my makeup items as there are separate sections/compartments.&lt;br /&gt;Love the colo too. Longer handle would&#x27;ve been even better but not big problem</li>
            <li> I have not had the opportunity to use the bag, but I am going away tomorrow and will take it with me.  I can already tell that it will meet my needs for carrying make-up and toiletries.  Seems well constructed and is attractive too!</li>
            <li> I wanted a new toiletry bag and when I looked at LL Bean, they didn&#x27;t have any colors I liked and the price was a bit high.  So, I tried here at Amazon and found many with beautiful colors and nice prices.  It came promptly and I put all my needs in it.  Fit perfectly!  A separate place for my hair pins and such in front.  A place for band aids and such and a nice deep spot for my shampoo and such.  It can fit full sized bath gel, too!  I got the smaller and it fits everything and a bit more.  Nice product and will use this company again.  :-)</li>
            <li> Girlfriend uses it as her permanent bag now and not just for the gym. Great present.</li>
            <li> Bright pink, although not as bright as the picture.  Great size for pre-teen girls with a few toiletries but not a whole drawer full.  The only complaint from my daughter is the embroidered name on the front.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mother who travels 4 times a month. She can fit all her toiletries in the pockets inside and it&#x27;s small enough to fit in her travel bag. I bought these because I needed something that would be wash able in case something spilled due to plane travel. She&#x27;s only had to wash it once but it is still in great condition.</li>
            <li> I just got this bag recently after reading a great many reviews.  I too, girlie as it is, liked the color options. I really like solid option and I chose fuchsia or hot pink, cannot what it was called. I am so sick of stuffing my toiletries into ugly plastic-lined single compartment paisley make-up bags I have had laying around for years--or worse toting around an assortment of confusing plastic zip-lock bags during a trip. And practically speaking the color does help me to locate it in my suitcase or even on a busy, shared, bathroom counter during a trip.  But onto more important features.  It is the PERFECT SIZE for me: medium, not small and not huge.  I also really like the feature that if I am flying and really minimally load it (or perhaps don&#x27;t load it at all, but use it only after arrival) with all the annoying 3 oz bottles for security, it will collapse and take up little space.  That is important to me for trips where I am trying to take a week of clothes and etc, in a carry on, and I plan to borrow or buy toiletries at my destination if needed.  But for more local trips I can load it up and expand it as much as I want. I put a good handful of things 3 oz on up to a full size tube of gel the main back compartment and to my surprise it looks like it could hold a great deal more.  The best feature to me is when the bag is expanded at all in the base, it sits nicely on a counter (I also prefer purses that have enough of a base to be able to stand and not topple over at the slightest push) and I can easily see what I am looking for as I rifle through everything: yay. So far I have found the mesh compartments limited in usefulness, but I don&#x27;t really care. That said, I did like how one of the narrow end compartments held my toothbrush upright and snugly, separated from everything else and easily seen and retrievable. I will probably use the others for a sparse make-up supply. I put my toothpick floss things I like to have clean and use every night in the flat upper inside mesh compartment. The middle compartments are looser and do not seem as useful so far, but they may end up being good for a sparse make-up supply. I am really glad to have the hook option, but haven&#x27;t used it yet. As far as materials, I think the fabric is good-looking and probably quite durable, and probably water-resistant too.  I will admit the zippers are only a fair-medium quality (the mesh seems fair-medium too, but it is not so important to me or hard for me to be careful with).  I think that if if the fabric continues to loosen with use around the zipper area they will move more freely and probably not break.  Until then I am being careful working the zipper.  So they are nothing like the high end (usually finer toothed) indestructible zippers you find on nice goretex shell jackets, for instance.  However, I would much rather buy this pretty much perfect bag for under $15 than pay $40 or much higher.  Because the zippers or mesh could fail, I am only rating it a 4. I will be quite disappointed if the zipper breaks--I do not like to waste my money in nickels and dimes--but I am gambling it won&#x27;t. If I have this bag after a year and it still functions well, and I think of it, I may write a review to update it, and possibly raise (or lower) the rating.  The business mind that designed this bag, its materials and price, gets a 5 star rating.  But for a consumer report from me to you it is a 4.</li>
            <li> Great bag for our 3 young girls to use as a toiletry bag!  Nicely divided inside with multiple pockets to keep items separated. Very well made as well.</li>
            <li> This bag is just the right size. It holds a lot and is quite sturdy. The ability to hang it on a towel rack is great when staying at a hotel where there is very limited counter space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was able to give this as gifts at a girlfriend gathering and I was so pleased to be able to give each one a different color.  The size is perfect and holds much more than you think.  Delivery was prompt and I was thoroughly pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> The fabric is very nice, the stitching could have been better. This was a purchase for our 8 year old granddaughter, she loved it If the purchase had been for myself I would have been disappointed and returned the item for better quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this bag for my grand European vacation and it worked wonderfully!  I could not have survived without this bag!  Small, compact but carries a TON of stuff like body wash, deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrush, dental floss, nail clippers, lip gloss, hand cream, etc., etc., etc.  Every little important toiletry could be safely stowed in this bag and easily tucked into my checked luggage.  When I arrived at a new hotel, I pulled the bag out and hung it on the clothes hook in the bathroom.  This was the best $12 expenditure ever!</li>
            <li> This make-up bag is ultimately too flimsy to work as a hanging bag; with any amount of product in the front portion it leans forward while hanging, threatening to dump all of my stuff on the floor. It&#x27;s also kind of flimsy when you have it completely open on the counter and it wants to cave in. It does hold a ton of stuff though - I can pack full-size items for long trips and have them all in the same spot. But I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Fits literally so much? Actually sometimes its a little unwieldy when there&#x27;s not enough in it! Eventually got a little holenin the top but I bought this a couple years ago. Still holding up great.</li>
            <li> This thing saved us on a recent vacation.  I hate having all my toiletries (makeup, contact case, etc.) scattered all over the hotel sink and then housekeeping moves them all while we are out of the hotel room.  Drives me crazy.  So now I put all my toiletries in this and hang them on the towel bar.  LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> Great for travel.  I travel a lot and just keep mini sized toiletries in here all the time and I&#x27;m all set!</li>
            <li> great purchase. fits everything very well and love the organization. using it currently for makeup.</li>
            <li> Purchased the toiletry bag organizer for my granddaughter; she really likes it and it is the perfect size.  Thinking of getting myself one!</li>
            <li> I would rather return..</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend who had admired my own..she loved it.</li>
            <li> Great for my travel and great for a carry on. Even going through security I was able to access it quickly and use it with ease. Plus, I love the color. All of the storage pockets and dividers made it easy to organize all of my cosmetics and toiletries.</li>
