            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>This is nice</li>
            <li>Nice lotion.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy or have a waxy feeling, it absorbs into your skin very easily, doesn&#x27;t clog your pores and of course the bonus is the SPF.</li>
            <li>By far the best zinc oxide sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried,</li>
            <li>Love the Philosophy line, this is by far one of the best oil-free moisturizer and it</li>
            <li>The formulation is very effective and has a light clean fragrance that is almost not there.  </li>
            <li>and i absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>Best facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer - it makes my skin feel silky without a greasy oily feel to it.</li>
            <li>But many people in Sephora and Ulta raved about it</li>
            <li>This is the best daily moisturizer with spf.</li>
            <li>One tube lasted me many months.</li>
            <li>I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Works well on top of philosophy Miracle Worker Anti-Age Concentrate.</li>
            <li>I heard about it on acne.org and I am glad I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Also, it does seem to be more oily than an oil-free moisturizer should feel.</li>
            <li>so it works great for me and my particular type of skin.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin as well!</li>
            <li>Just good - not tight, not greasy, not waxy, just very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It spreads easily and it reduces the sheen on my face throughout the day-- even giving me a boost of spf to protect.</li>
            <li>This product was not shine free like I thought it would be; however, it does not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>There is another Hope in a Jar that isn&#x27;t oil free or have SPF protection.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find a product with SPF that didn&#x27;t feel gross on my face and doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out.</li>
            <li>And I have liked it the whole time.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>- it is more moisturizing but feels and makes my skin waxy, makes it look like I have very large pores, and seems to clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has a better price than beauty stores, but I would recommend going to a store to buy the first one - Ulta and Sephora and such have a great return policy, which is a must with higher-end beauty products for me.  </li>
            <li>wanted something that I could wear every day that was light weight, didn&#x27;t smell too much and most importantly</li>
            <li>I tried both the original and SPF versions in a store and settled on the SPF.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be a reasonably priced product, arund $40, so don&#x27;t scarf up some for an extravagant price and then find out you can&#x27;t buy any more.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff because it smooth but not greasy!</li>
            <li>The real reason why I LOVE this product is because it virtually eliminated ALL of my acne.</li>
            <li>sunscreen is great, though a little pricey.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>its totally worth the price..</li>
            <li>I am a true believer in this product-- with a general clearasil routine and moisturizer twice a day, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth it...</li>
            <li>This particular one is oil free</li>
            <li>It is pretty pricey, but I think the combination of high quality oil free +SPF justifies the price.</li>
            <li>I first started using this product in November</li>
            <li>Excellent product, which only takes a small amount</li>
            <li>Very economical and worth the price for such a quality product.</li>
            <li>Works fine but smells too much like sunscreen for daily use.</li>
            <li>So just be careful when choosing which one to buy :)</li>
            <li>The product also made me skin very oil which caused the cream to run into my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to pay as much as this costs</li>
            <li>Seems to be the real deal.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, the texture is smooth, the scent is \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; but disappears pretty quickly, sinks into my skin well and leaves it feeling good.  </li>
            <li>Hope in a Jar seemed to get decent reviews on performance and iffy ones on smell/texture.  </li>
            <li>I do like that it has SPF (and quite a lot of it), so I have high hopes for it for summer.  </li>
            <li>I need a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>As soon as I ran out, my skin went right back to being splotchy.</li>
            <li>and I use this product every day, wouldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers trying to help with the excessive dryness the Accutane causes and none so far have compared to Hope in a Jar.</li>
            <li>Beyond that, I am very prone to acne breakouts, even though I am in my mid twenties.</li>
            <li>They completely nailed it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
            <li>but I recivecd the product that has been opened and old .</li>
            <li>I tried some samples from Sephora, and this one exceeded the rest by FAR..</li>
            <li>My skin got a itchy rash after one application and it took over two days for my face and neck to get back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several years and my old face loves it.  </li>
            <li>Considering switching back to olay complete due to the high price.</li>
            <li>I recently started Accutane so not only is my skin sensitive, but it also gets very, very dry.</li>

            <li> I recently started Accutane so not only is my skin sensitive, but it also gets very, very dry.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, as I only use it during the day.</li>
            <li> so it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> This toxic chemical is added for enhanced skin absorption but can cause:  Biochemical or cellular level changes, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive) plus it has &amp;#34;Persistence and bioaccumulation&amp;#34; which means it stays in your body for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good makeup base.</li>
            <li> Also,  I only need a little every morning so a tube last between 6-8 months.</li>
            <li> Dry powder sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It definitely does NOT make my skin feel tight neither.</li>
            <li> my dermatologist recommends for daily use, and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy in the summer with a little mineral powder to finish.</li>
            <li> My friend gave me a sample of this moisturizer last christmas, and I wore it everyday for about a month.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it&#x27;s super expensive and small, thus the 4-star rating.</li>
            <li> I use this on my kids too and a little amount goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> With Hope in a Jar my skin stays moisturized throughout the day with no signs of peeling whatsoever due to the Accutane.</li>
            <li> Proactiv didn&#x27;t work, nor did about 30 other</li>
            <li> and I always have a hard time with finding one that doesn&#x27;t feel oily and gives me a high spf (at least spf 30) protection.  </li>
            <li> * - my skin would feel tight after application but then would get oily within an hour or two even if not stressed.  </li>
            <li> this one is a little heavier.</li>
            <li> I have normal/oily skin that tends to get very oily in the T-zone when stressed (cold, heat, lack of sleep, dehydrated, etc).  </li>
            <li> Non-greasy yet still thick, keeps face moist all day.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too thick and goes on evenly.  </li>
            <li> and I was a little skeptical about it because of the price.</li>
            <li> I hate Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion</li>
            <li> There are some scary scary products out there, and like this one, it pays to do the research before you buy it!</li>
            <li> I  am very disappointed in the product that amazon send it to me .</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product was not shine free like I thought it would be; however, it does not feel greasy at all. Nice product.</li>
            <li> its totally worth the price..its perfect for oily skin and ur skin doesnt look oily until the end of the day and i absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer but I prefer the Take a Deep Breath.  this one is a little heavier.</li>
            <li> Best facial sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t make the face look oily. It doesn&#x27;t break me out. It&#x27;s a good makeup base.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer - it makes my skin feel silky without a greasy oily feel to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different facial moisturizers with spf and I always have a hard time with finding one that doesn&#x27;t feel oily and gives me a high spf (at least spf 30) protection.  This is the only product I will use from now on for my face.  It absorbs beautifully and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing moisturizer.  I use this on my kids too and a little amount goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years and my old face loves it.  Since I can&#x27;t find it on the Philosophy website, I suspect it&#x27;s being discontinued. It&#x27;s supposed to be a reasonably priced product, arund $40, so don&#x27;t scarf up some for an extravagant price and then find out you can&#x27;t buy any more.</li>
            <li> I prefer this Hope in the jar ocer the one that actually gomes in the jar.  It is ealier to apply.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product in November and I was a little skeptical about it because of the price. But many people in Sephora and Ulta raved about it so I took the chance to try it. A little goes a long way! It isn&#x27;t greasy or have a waxy feeling, it absorbs into your skin very easily, doesn&#x27;t clog your pores and of course the bonus is the SPF. I recently started Accutane so not only is my skin sensitive, but it also gets very, very dry. With Hope in a Jar my skin stays moisturized throughout the day with no signs of peeling whatsoever due to the Accutane. It definitely does NOT make my skin feel tight neither. It&#x27;s even lasted me thru a work-out session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers trying to help with the excessive dryness the Accutane causes and none so far have compared to Hope in a Jar. This particular one is oil free so it works great for me and my particular type of skin. There is another Hope in a Jar that isn&#x27;t oil free or have SPF protection. So just be careful when choosing which one to buy :)</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff because it smooth but not greasy! Great for sensitive skin as well! Great buy will surely purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is the best daily moisturizer with spf. Non-greasy yet still thick, keeps face moist all day. I wish it were cheaper but I&#x27;d still continue buying it because it works the best with my face. One tube lasted me many months.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer with SPF 30 is the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t slide off my face or smother my face through the day.  For me, Hope is a Joy.</li>
            <li> As per the EWG, this product has Oxybenzone.  This toxic chemical is added for enhanced skin absorption but can cause:  Biochemical or cellular level changes, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive) plus it has &amp;#34;Persistence and bioaccumulation&amp;#34; which means it stays in your body for a long time.  There are some scary scary products out there, and like this one, it pays to do the research before you buy it!</li>
            <li> Works fine but smells too much like sunscreen for daily use.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen for a fair skinned person.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something that I could wear every day that was light weight, didn&#x27;t smell too much and most importantly, didn&#x27;t clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is great, though a little pricey.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> This is the perfect SPF moisturizer.  It isn&#x27;t too thick and goes on evenly.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion. I was so happy to find a product with SPF that didn&#x27;t feel gross on my face and doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out. It is pretty pricey, but I think the combination of high quality oil free +SPF justifies the price. It lasts a long time, as I only use it during the day.</li>
            <li> This is nice but I noticed that once it&#x27;s on, it can be rubbed off. Felt like there was some residue on my skin. If you leave it and don&#x27;t touch it, then you won&#x27;t have this issue. I need a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My skin got a itchy rash after one application and it took over two days for my face and neck to get back to normal.  The product also made me skin very oil which caused the cream to run into my eyes.  I am sticking with. Dry powder sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Works well on top of philosophy Miracle Worker Anti-Age Concentrate. I have oily skin and this is the only moisturizer that I have been using for some years now, plus it has SPF 30. Also,  I only need a little every morning so a tube last between 6-8 months. Very economical and worth the price for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> I have normal/oily skin that tends to get very oily in the T-zone when stressed (cold, heat, lack of sleep, dehydrated, etc).  I recently bought this to replace my Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel because the gel just wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough* - my skin would feel tight after application but then would get oily within an hour or two even if not stressed.  Hope in a Jar seemed to get decent reviews on performance and iffy ones on smell/texture.  I tried both the original and SPF versions in a store and settled on the SPF.  I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for almost two weeks now, and I wear it for 12-14 hours a day.  And I have liked it the whole time.  A little goes a long way, the texture is smooth, the scent is \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; but disappears pretty quickly, sinks into my skin well and leaves it feeling good.  Just good - not tight, not greasy, not waxy, just very comfortable.  It is not a mattifying moisturizer - when my skin does get oily, the lotion doesn&#x27;t prevent or absorb the oil, but I haven&#x27;t had problems with clogged pores or breakouts, my skin continues to feel like it can breathe throughout the day.  I do like that it has SPF (and quite a lot of it), so I have high hopes for it for summer.  Can&#x27;t comment on how it does with flash photos as I haven&#x27;t taken any yet.  All in all, I am very pleased with this product.  Amazon has a better price than beauty stores, but I would recommend going to a store to buy the first one - Ulta and Sephora and such have a great return policy, which is a must with higher-end beauty products for me.  *I hate Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion - it is more moisturizing but feels and makes my skin waxy, makes it look like I have very large pores, and seems to clog my pores.  This is why I was looking for a different moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find liquid Hope in a Bottle, so I got this tube instead.  It turns out to be very handy for traveling (2oz) and I especially like that it has the SPF 30 included. The formulation is very effective and has a light clean fragrance that is almost not there.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly oily skin. Beyond that, I am very prone to acne breakouts, even though I am in my mid twenties. My friend gave me a sample of this moisturizer last christmas, and I wore it everyday for about a month. It spreads easily and it reduces the sheen on my face throughout the day-- even giving me a boost of spf to protect. The real reason why I LOVE this product is because it virtually eliminated ALL of my acne. As soon as I ran out, my skin went right back to being splotchy. I am a true believer in this product-- with a general clearasil routine and moisturizer twice a day, my skin has never looked better. Proactiv didn&#x27;t work, nor did about 30 other things-- but this is my miracle!!</li>
            <li> By far the best zinc oxide sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried probably 20 of them. They completely nailed it. The only problem is that it&#x27;s super expensive and small, thus the 4-star rating.</li>
            <li> Everytime I go to Ulta &amp; Sephora to buy this ($34/tube), they never have it in stock. Price here is comparable and always in stock.&lt;br /&gt;Great oil-free moisturizer with the SPF30 my dermatologist recommends for daily use, and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy in the summer with a little mineral powder to finish.</li>
            <li> this is a great sunblock. I have sensitive and acne prone skin and it was suitable for my skin and felt great going on.  I heard about it on acne.org and I am glad I made this purchase.  The only DRAWBACK is the price.  Considering switching back to olay complete due to the high price.</li>
            <li> Philosophy never disappoints! Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Love the Philosophy line, this is by far one of the best oil-free moisturizer and it SPF-30. You can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I  am very disappointed in the product that amazon send it to me . I like philosophy  skin care for my face but I recivecd the product that has been opened and old . It expires in 4 month when I got this  sun skin</li>
            <li> Great product....light and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, which only takes a small amount so it is long lasting. Non greasy.</li>
            <li> Great for sunscreen and moisturizer.  Goes on perfectly, I use on my face and it feels wonderful!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I tried some samples from Sephora, and this one exceeded the rest by FAR.. I don&#x27;t like to pay as much as this costs but it is definitely worth it...I feel moisturized without an ounce of greasy even at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> Nice lotion. I only wish it didn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. Also, it does seem to be more oily than an oil-free moisturizer should feel.</li>
            <li> Wonderful mouisturizer</li>
            <li> I deliver mail for a living and I use this product every day, wouldn&#x27;t live without it. Works great, not greasy, great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Seems to be the real deal. Love this stuff!!!</li>
