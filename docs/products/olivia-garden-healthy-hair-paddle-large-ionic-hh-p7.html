            <li>Aesthetically this brush is quite nice.  </li>

            <li>I bought the Olivia Healthy Hair Bamboo Brush for myself and loved it.  </li>
            <li>one of the best hair brushes  i have own, it leaves my hair shiner and straight,</li>
            <li>Really nice paddle hairbrush.</li>
            <li>Nice brush until nobs on bristles started falling out.  </li>
            <li>It detangles nicely and the bristles seem to massage my scalp as well.</li>
            <li>The grip is nice.</li>
            <li>and I had to have my own for home.</li>
            <li>Very nice and light.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product that I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the brush is good except that the nylon bristle tips break off easily and it scratches your scalp.</li>
            <li>This type of brush is great for quickly drying my below shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite brush - love it! :)</li>
            <li>This brush is so nice, the size is big and just perfect.  </li>
            <li>It not only feels great combing through my hair, it leaves my hair feeling great too.  </li>
            <li>Olivia garden makes great sturdy brushes that are very reasonable priced</li>
            <li>This brush is great quality and so pretty.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>Very smooth bamboo.  </li>
            <li>It makes detangling easy and provides nice scalp stimulation.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and good sized</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s enjoyable to brush my hair now.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m so glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>And, I love the bamboo handle/base.</li>
            <li>I compared prices on brushes before I bought it, and am quite satisfied with that aspect as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t s**t ya&#x27;! :)</li>
            <li>I can feel it massages scalp better than my drugstore bought Revlon nylon pin brush.</li>
            <li>I had a Paul Mitchell brush for many years and that never happened.  </li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>
            <li>Excellent and simple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also anti-static, unlike most boar bristle style brushes and plastic combs.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this brush.  </li>
            <li>She loves it, says that it works very well and is happy with it in every way that she would expect from a brush of this type.</li>
            <li>I love the hole; i thread a ribbon thru and hang on my bathroom</li>
            <li>hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a paddle brush freak and this one is top notch.</li>
            <li>I love the paddle brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>The brush is ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite brush to use now.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Not even sure how it happened.</li>
            <li>Love this semi sustainable brush.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>and I really love the stripped look.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush</li>
            <li>I might buy a couple more just to tuck away</li>
            <li>sure what it is.</li>
            <li>It also is rather attractive; I much prefer this to one of the plastic options.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>and i love it.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through many brushes with four daughters.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Cute and functional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I was worried this large paddle was for ladies with hip-length hair as this is the kind of brush you see them using on television!  </li>
            <li>My mother loved it so much I&#x27;m going to have to buy her one as well!</li>
            <li>Especially great for long hair.</li>
            <li>The paddle head is quite large but the handle is good to grip.</li>
            <li>I knew better than to bring along my cheap plastic paddle brush</li>
            <li>It feels good and makes hair look better than similar paddle brushes we own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light background makes it very easy to see when it needs to be clean</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Good buy, decent price.</li>
            <li>Despite that tho,it&#x27;s still going strong and still being used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the striped design, but functionally, it is great on my hair and really helps keep it smooth and frizz-free.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a wooden brush , this hairbrush brushes beautifully .</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>and it still looks good as new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine as a brush by its self but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This hurts my fine hair head..</li>
            <li>this arrived quickly!  </li>
            <li>Nice large paddle.</li>
            <li>I totally loved this hair brush, when I first started using it.&lt;br /&gt;However, most of the bristle tops came of pretty quick and</li>
            <li>This is a nice lightweight paddle brush that works very well</li>
            <li>It does now, however, feel cheap in</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively easy to clean off oils and hair using soapy water and a comb or pick.</li>
            <li>The natural wood is very beautiful and the filegry design on the back just puts it over the top.</li>
            <li>The brush also does not feel cheap, like some brushes that I have purchased at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and relatively light weight.</li>
            <li>Love the brush and love how it makes my hair soft!!</li>
            <li>So super easy to remove hair that even I do it without thinking about once a month when I see the brush on the counter.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to a friend looking for a unique brush and/or to someone who cares about the environment.</li>
            <li>This is a gorgeous paddle brush, really well made and has nice etched carvings on the back.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was excited to pamper myself.  </li>
            <li>This one feels nice on the scalp, it is definitely a mini-massage, but I still get a lot of static when I brush my hair with it.</li>
            <li>Bristles are just right and bamboo makes it light and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Unless you like bristles that rip right out of the brush into your hair!</li>
            <li>Nice soft bristles.</li>
            <li>She loves the size and how fast she can brush her hair (and I appreciate that the most when we&#x27;re trying to leave the house).  </li>
            <li>Good solid brush.</li>
            <li>The olivia garden brush swiped through my hair nicely without getting caught vs my old one.</li>
            <li>The wood grain is pretty, and it is fairly easy to remove hair from.</li>
            <li>- I can&#x27;t believe you could purchase such a nice brush so cheaply</li>
            <li>I love this brand and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a very pretty brush.</li>
            <li>Still looks new:)</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and my hair has been super healthy since I started using it.</li>
            <li>After one week of use in straight, fine hair, the bristles are bent as if I have owned this brush for years.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Nice big comb.</li>
            <li>- Highly recommend this brush and seller - quick response and delivery!</li>
            <li>At first I gave this brush a great review, but about 6 months after owning it; 3/4 of the little balls on the tips of the bristles have fallen off.  </li>
            <li>This brush just glides right through my hair.</li>
            <li>It works great on my long hair, leaving it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Good balance and grip, detangles well with minimal ouch-factor (I&#x27;m pretty &amp;#34;tender-headed&amp;#34; as we say in the South).</li>
            <li>It does a good job though to blow long straight hair.</li>
            <li>but we really needed the full size paddle.</li>
            <li>Very nice hair brush, I like it better than the one I have been swiping from my husband for the last  few years....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter than typical plastic-handled ones I&#x27;ve owned, making it good for travel.</li>
            <li>My old Aveda brush had plastic bristles and bristle end; I love the ionic bristle tips on this brush which seem to glide through my hair much easier.</li>
            <li>I am buying a 3rd today:)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The darker ones seem to show more dirt, so I am happier with the white.    </li>
            <li>Has a big HH in cursive at the top of the scroll for Healthy Hair.    </li>
            <li>The paint wears off after about a week or so, which makes the brush look funny, and pieces of the paint come off into your hair and look like dandruff.</li>
            <li>but this hairbrush really hurts!</li>
            <li>That may be partly because it&#x27;s slightly smaller than most of those, but also the paddle is thinner, trimming weight.</li>
            <li>any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back has an elegant design motif scorched into it, too.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more brushes by this company.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever purchased a Olivia Garden brush, and I will now forever purchase them.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that the bristles on this brush would be larger, but I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not inspecting it more closely before ordering.</li>
            <li>I lost 2 the first day</li>
            <li>The shipping on this brush was lightening fast!</li>
            <li>Looks exactly how the image is.</li>
            <li>This one is pretty, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, and the bristles feel good on my scalp.</li>
            <li>and this is more gentle than using a standard comb</li>
            <li>Works great and is very sturdy and fashionable brush with soft, but firm bristles.</li>
            <li>It works better for long hair,  </li>
            <li>Gentle, detangling, pretty sturdy, and doesn&#x27;t break off hair like some paddle brushes.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t already know, this kind of brush is good for thick hair because of the wide, sturdy bristles.</li>
            <li>I have fine long hair that touches right under my armpits.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to flex it like a lung to blow any water that gets in the hole out before letting it dry; don&#x27;t want to encourage mold inside it.</li>
            <li>but it works like magic , it detangles my long hair very easely.</li>
            <li>but it works like magic , it detangles my long hair very easely.</li>
            <li>, the back of the brush has a very light trademark but very classy.</li>
            <li>Mostly keeps static off my hair, at least better than other brushes.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s large, but it feels decadent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never again spend large sums for a Mason Pearson brush.</li>
            <li>this brush is very soothing on my scalp and goes through my hair...</li>
            <li>I really like bamboo products - and after reading reviews for the brush figured I would give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>I really missed having a woodpinned brush.  </li>
            <li>The colors are contrasting, on the stripes, and very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>The pins of this brush come out almost straight.  </li>
            <li>It truly is for brushing...not so much for styling.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so much happier with this one.  </li>
            <li>It has arrived and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference over my old, cheap conair paddle brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t pay that much for a brush.  </li>
            <li>or maybe I just harder to see dirt on it :)</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>I have very thick/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my girl friend and she seems to really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like the look of the paddle.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps me.  </li>
            <li>The brush is made up of wood which is smooth &amp; two different colors.</li>
            <li>This brush has held up very well since I&#x27;ve purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the brush</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product that is a hair glooming dream.</li>
            <li>I like mine so much</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t mind this too much, in terms of product quality, this is a real fault.</li>
            <li>For such a great price I was expecting just a basic brush, but my hair actually does come out smoother with this one.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really have much to say, I&#x27;ve been using this brush, and I like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush, and the way it glides through my hair and sort of massages my head.</li>
            <li>I think the smaller \\&quot;paddle\\&quot; brush with the boar bristles would have been a far better option</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice enough but really BIG.  </li>
            <li>so the large paddle makes it easy to comb and help dry.</li>
            <li>Your hair becomes flat against your scalp and it&#x27;s a nice different feeling but to get to that point</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause much static like other brushes.</li>
            <li>Such significant difference in the feel, texture, volume and shine.</li>
            <li>Was a good brush but completely falls apart after a few months of use!</li>
            <li>although a smaller round brush would fit the contours of your head better.      </li>
            <li>I have purchased many brushes lately trying to find the right one.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>high quality item.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s being used in the salon, so it will certainly be used frequently.</li>
            <li>kind of a still brush, hard on the head...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>The round brush might be better if you want the angled pins for flipping curls.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased a Olivia Garden round brush, which I also love.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I like Bamboo products (because they are a renewable low cost resource), the alternating light dark colors make it look unique and the pattern on the back is pretty as well.  </li>
            <li>but I like a stiff boar bristle better.</li>
            <li>I have super long hair and this brush doesn&#x27;t yank like others.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for those with long or quick knotted hair.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t like that it has so much text on the handle and a large design on the back of the paddle.</li>
            <li>Picked this up for my wife because she needed a new brush.</li>
            <li>I consider myself picky about hairbrushes and combs, and I buy new ones probably six times a year.</li>
            <li>I not the best, once i got it, i notice that I don&#x27;r like the fact of the white part, because with use it turn dirty.</li>
            <li>One positive thing is tat beside been a big brush, its not heavy at all, and feels really got while I brush my hair.</li>
            <li>The brush is very large:  10 inches long, with 5 inches being the brush head and 5 inches the handle.   </li>
            <li>When I blow dry my hair, I get a nice &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; without getting the curl that I get with a round brush.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a natural comb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised they don&#x27;t show it off</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive head you will not like this brush.  </li>
            <li>Since I have naturally wavy hair that is always tangled</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want or need curl since I have a natural curl.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend an exorbitant amount, but had been spoiled by my old brush.</li>
            <li>My four year old says it doesn&#x27;t hurt to get the tangles out, my husband loves it, and I do too.</li>
            <li>i compared the brush with my old Swisco plastic one</li>
            <li>It says bamboo, but only the handle is bamboo--not the bristles (which in my opinion, defeats the whole purpose).</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiney</li>
            <li>I was a bit disappointed because I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good quality full size paddle brush that isn&#x27;t too \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; on the hair.  </li>
            <li>Just remember to break it up into sections if you have thick hair. :)</li>
            <li>This brush is prettier, and does just as good of a job as the old expensive salon brush.</li>
            <li>The little knubbies on the ends of the bristles do not pop off when you clean your brush with a comb, either.  </li>
            <li>but it snapped in half on me rather quickly.</li>
            <li>However I wish they had shown a photo of the back of the paddle, because there is a large swirly graphic that is incongruous with the rest of the natural bamboo brush design.</li>
            <li>This brush works very well for brushing long hair.</li>
            <li>Having used an Aveda wooden paddle brush for years, I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair, and this brush tames it easily.  </li>
            <li>I find it is not any more or less antistatic than any other regular brush.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just an extra benefit as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>Edit to original review (above): After only a few months of use, the plastic caps on the tips of the brush bristles started to fall off.  </li>
            <li>I just brush it right through a few times &amp; it untangles all of my hair in a jiff.</li>
            <li>I had been wanting a flat paddle brush for a long time, however most of them just wouldn&#x27;t go through my fairly thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see this brush lasting very long under normal use, and ordered a different brush within a week of receiving this one.</li>
            <li>My first reaction was to send it back because it looked like a pin was missing.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick, long hair, and winter static is a big problem for me.</li>

            <li> one of the best hair brushes  i have own, it leaves my hair shiner and straight,</li>
            <li> Really nice paddle hairbrush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush until nobs on bristles started falling out.  </li>
            <li> It detangles nicely and the bristles seem to massage my scalp as well.</li>
            <li> The grip is nice.</li>
            <li> and I had to have my own for home.</li>
            <li> Very nice and light.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is good except that the nylon bristle tips break off easily and it scratches your scalp.</li>
            <li> This type of brush is great for quickly drying my below shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite brush - love it! :)</li>
            <li> This brush is so nice, the size is big and just perfect.  </li>
            <li> It not only feels great combing through my hair, it leaves my hair feeling great too.  </li>
            <li> Olivia garden makes great sturdy brushes that are very reasonable priced</li>
            <li> This brush is great quality and so pretty.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very smooth bamboo.  </li>
            <li> It makes detangling easy and provides nice scalp stimulation.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and good sized</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s enjoyable to brush my hair now.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m so glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> And, I love the bamboo handle/base.</li>
            <li> I compared prices on brushes before I bought it, and am quite satisfied with that aspect as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t s**t ya&#x27;! :)</li>
            <li> I can feel it massages scalp better than my drugstore bought Revlon nylon pin brush.</li>
            <li> I had a Paul Mitchell brush for many years and that never happened.  </li>
            <li> but I still love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent and simple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also anti-static, unlike most boar bristle style brushes and plastic combs.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this brush.  </li>
            <li> She loves it, says that it works very well and is happy with it in every way that she would expect from a brush of this type.</li>
            <li> I love the hole; i thread a ribbon thru and hang on my bathroom</li>
            <li> hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a paddle brush freak and this one is top notch.</li>
            <li> I love the paddle brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite brush to use now.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Not even sure how it happened.</li>
            <li> Love this semi sustainable brush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li> and I really love the stripped look.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush</li>
            <li> I might buy a couple more just to tuck away</li>
            <li> sure what it is.</li>
            <li> It also is rather attractive; I much prefer this to one of the plastic options.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> and i love it.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through many brushes with four daughters.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Cute and functional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I was worried this large paddle was for ladies with hip-length hair as this is the kind of brush you see them using on television!  </li>
            <li> My mother loved it so much I&#x27;m going to have to buy her one as well!</li>
            <li> Especially great for long hair.</li>
            <li> The paddle head is quite large but the handle is good to grip.</li>
            <li> I knew better than to bring along my cheap plastic paddle brush</li>
            <li> It feels good and makes hair look better than similar paddle brushes we own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light background makes it very easy to see when it needs to be clean</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Good buy, decent price.</li>
            <li> Despite that tho,it&#x27;s still going strong and still being used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the striped design, but functionally, it is great on my hair and really helps keep it smooth and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a wooden brush , this hairbrush brushes beautifully .</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> and it still looks good as new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine as a brush by its self but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This hurts my fine hair head..</li>
            <li> this arrived quickly!  </li>
            <li> Nice large paddle.</li>
            <li> I totally loved this hair brush, when I first started using it.&lt;br /&gt;However, most of the bristle tops came of pretty quick and</li>
            <li> This is a nice lightweight paddle brush that works very well</li>
            <li> It does now, however, feel cheap in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively easy to clean off oils and hair using soapy water and a comb or pick.</li>
            <li> The natural wood is very beautiful and the filegry design on the back just puts it over the top.</li>
            <li> The brush also does not feel cheap, like some brushes that I have purchased at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and relatively light weight.</li>
            <li> Love the brush and love how it makes my hair soft!!</li>
            <li> So super easy to remove hair that even I do it without thinking about once a month when I see the brush on the counter.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to a friend looking for a unique brush and/or to someone who cares about the environment.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous paddle brush, really well made and has nice etched carvings on the back.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was excited to pamper myself.  </li>
            <li> This one feels nice on the scalp, it is definitely a mini-massage, but I still get a lot of static when I brush my hair with it.</li>
            <li> Bristles are just right and bamboo makes it light and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Unless you like bristles that rip right out of the brush into your hair!</li>
            <li> Nice soft bristles.</li>
            <li> She loves the size and how fast she can brush her hair (and I appreciate that the most when we&#x27;re trying to leave the house).  </li>
            <li> Good solid brush.</li>
            <li> The olivia garden brush swiped through my hair nicely without getting caught vs my old one.</li>
            <li> The wood grain is pretty, and it is fairly easy to remove hair from.</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t believe you could purchase such a nice brush so cheaply</li>
            <li> I love this brand and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a very pretty brush.</li>
            <li> Still looks new:)</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and my hair has been super healthy since I started using it.</li>
            <li> After one week of use in straight, fine hair, the bristles are bent as if I have owned this brush for years.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice big comb.</li>
            <li> - Highly recommend this brush and seller - quick response and delivery!</li>
            <li> At first I gave this brush a great review, but about 6 months after owning it; 3/4 of the little balls on the tips of the bristles have fallen off.  </li>
            <li> This brush just glides right through my hair.</li>
            <li> It works great on my long hair, leaving it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Good balance and grip, detangles well with minimal ouch-factor (I&#x27;m pretty &amp;#34;tender-headed&amp;#34; as we say in the South).</li>
            <li> It does a good job though to blow long straight hair.</li>
            <li> but we really needed the full size paddle.</li>
            <li> Very nice hair brush, I like it better than the one I have been swiping from my husband for the last  few years....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter than typical plastic-handled ones I&#x27;ve owned, making it good for travel.</li>
            <li> My old Aveda brush had plastic bristles and bristle end; I love the ionic bristle tips on this brush which seem to glide through my hair much easier.</li>
            <li> I am buying a 3rd today:)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The darker ones seem to show more dirt, so I am happier with the white.    </li>
            <li> Has a big HH in cursive at the top of the scroll for Healthy Hair.    </li>
            <li> The paint wears off after about a week or so, which makes the brush look funny, and pieces of the paint come off into your hair and look like dandruff.</li>
            <li> but this hairbrush really hurts!</li>
            <li> That may be partly because it&#x27;s slightly smaller than most of those, but also the paddle is thinner, trimming weight.</li>
            <li> any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back has an elegant design motif scorched into it, too.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more brushes by this company.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever purchased a Olivia Garden brush, and I will now forever purchase them.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the bristles on this brush would be larger, but I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not inspecting it more closely before ordering.</li>
            <li> I lost 2 the first day</li>
            <li> The shipping on this brush was lightening fast!</li>
            <li> Looks exactly how the image is.</li>
            <li> This one is pretty, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, and the bristles feel good on my scalp.</li>
            <li> and this is more gentle than using a standard comb</li>
            <li> Works great and is very sturdy and fashionable brush with soft, but firm bristles.</li>
            <li> It works better for long hair,  </li>
            <li> Gentle, detangling, pretty sturdy, and doesn&#x27;t break off hair like some paddle brushes.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t already know, this kind of brush is good for thick hair because of the wide, sturdy bristles.</li>
            <li> I have fine long hair that touches right under my armpits.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to flex it like a lung to blow any water that gets in the hole out before letting it dry; don&#x27;t want to encourage mold inside it.</li>
            <li> but it works like magic , it detangles my long hair very easely.</li>
            <li> but it works like magic , it detangles my long hair very easely.</li>
            <li> , the back of the brush has a very light trademark but very classy.</li>
            <li> Mostly keeps static off my hair, at least better than other brushes.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s large, but it feels decadent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never again spend large sums for a Mason Pearson brush.</li>
            <li> this brush is very soothing on my scalp and goes through my hair...</li>
            <li> I really like bamboo products - and after reading reviews for the brush figured I would give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> I really missed having a woodpinned brush.  </li>
            <li> The colors are contrasting, on the stripes, and very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> The pins of this brush come out almost straight.  </li>
            <li> It truly is for brushing...not so much for styling.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so much happier with this one.  </li>
            <li> It has arrived and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference over my old, cheap conair paddle brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t pay that much for a brush.  </li>
            <li> or maybe I just harder to see dirt on it :)</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> I have very thick/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my girl friend and she seems to really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like the look of the paddle.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps me.  </li>
            <li> The brush is made up of wood which is smooth &amp; two different colors.</li>
            <li> This brush has held up very well since I&#x27;ve purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I really like the brush</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product that is a hair glooming dream.</li>
            <li> I like mine so much</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t mind this too much, in terms of product quality, this is a real fault.</li>
            <li> For such a great price I was expecting just a basic brush, but my hair actually does come out smoother with this one.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really have much to say, I&#x27;ve been using this brush, and I like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush, and the way it glides through my hair and sort of massages my head.</li>
            <li> I think the smaller \\&quot;paddle\\&quot; brush with the boar bristles would have been a far better option</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice enough but really BIG.  </li>
            <li> so the large paddle makes it easy to comb and help dry.</li>
            <li> Your hair becomes flat against your scalp and it&#x27;s a nice different feeling but to get to that point</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause much static like other brushes.</li>
            <li> Such significant difference in the feel, texture, volume and shine.</li>
            <li> Was a good brush but completely falls apart after a few months of use!</li>
            <li> although a smaller round brush would fit the contours of your head better.      </li>
            <li> I have purchased many brushes lately trying to find the right one.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> high quality item.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s being used in the salon, so it will certainly be used frequently.</li>
            <li> kind of a still brush, hard on the head...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> The round brush might be better if you want the angled pins for flipping curls.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased a Olivia Garden round brush, which I also love.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I like Bamboo products (because they are a renewable low cost resource), the alternating light dark colors make it look unique and the pattern on the back is pretty as well.  </li>
            <li> but I like a stiff boar bristle better.</li>
            <li> I have super long hair and this brush doesn&#x27;t yank like others.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for those with long or quick knotted hair.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t like that it has so much text on the handle and a large design on the back of the paddle.</li>
            <li> Picked this up for my wife because she needed a new brush.</li>
            <li> I consider myself picky about hairbrushes and combs, and I buy new ones probably six times a year.</li>
            <li> I not the best, once i got it, i notice that I don&#x27;r like the fact of the white part, because with use it turn dirty.</li>
            <li> One positive thing is tat beside been a big brush, its not heavy at all, and feels really got while I brush my hair.</li>
            <li> The brush is very large:  10 inches long, with 5 inches being the brush head and 5 inches the handle.   </li>
            <li> When I blow dry my hair, I get a nice &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; without getting the curl that I get with a round brush.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a natural comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised they don&#x27;t show it off</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive head you will not like this brush.  </li>
            <li> Since I have naturally wavy hair that is always tangled</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want or need curl since I have a natural curl.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend an exorbitant amount, but had been spoiled by my old brush.</li>
            <li> My four year old says it doesn&#x27;t hurt to get the tangles out, my husband loves it, and I do too.</li>
            <li> i compared the brush with my old Swisco plastic one</li>
            <li> It says bamboo, but only the handle is bamboo--not the bristles (which in my opinion, defeats the whole purpose).</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiney</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed because I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good quality full size paddle brush that isn&#x27;t too \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to break it up into sections if you have thick hair. :)</li>
            <li> This brush is prettier, and does just as good of a job as the old expensive salon brush.</li>
            <li> The little knubbies on the ends of the bristles do not pop off when you clean your brush with a comb, either.  </li>
            <li> but it snapped in half on me rather quickly.</li>
            <li> However I wish they had shown a photo of the back of the paddle, because there is a large swirly graphic that is incongruous with the rest of the natural bamboo brush design.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well for brushing long hair.</li>
            <li> Having used an Aveda wooden paddle brush for years, I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair, and this brush tames it easily.  </li>
            <li> I find it is not any more or less antistatic than any other regular brush.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just an extra benefit as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> Edit to original review (above): After only a few months of use, the plastic caps on the tips of the brush bristles started to fall off.  </li>
            <li> I just brush it right through a few times &amp; it untangles all of my hair in a jiff.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting a flat paddle brush for a long time, however most of them just wouldn&#x27;t go through my fairly thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see this brush lasting very long under normal use, and ordered a different brush within a week of receiving this one.</li>
            <li> My first reaction was to send it back because it looked like a pin was missing.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair, and winter static is a big problem for me.</li>
            <li> I do have thick long hair, so it might be fine for other folks with shorter, thinner hair.</li>
            <li> Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I looked at the cheaper Bass brushes at the natural store.  </li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new paddle brush to use when blow drying my hair, but something different than the usual Conair products sold at Target.  </li>
            <li> While this brush is large (as others have complained), I do not find it unwieldy.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, however, it really pulled and snagged on both my daughters hair, as well as mine (2 of us have thick hair and 1 has fine hair).  </li>
            <li> I will have it a long time.  </li>
            <li> Works well even for someone with long hair (my daughter).  </li>
            <li> The paddle is wide enough for straightening.</li>
            <li> I would like to say that once you entirely brush your hair out with this brush it will leave absolutely not one tangle in your hair.  </li>
            <li> My nephew never wants his hair brushed and he puts up with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle has a professional finish, the bristles firmly attached.</li>
            <li> I think it lasted as long as anyone would expect tho</li>
            <li> Its big enough to brush my hair in half the time.  </li>
            <li> I mostly only use this for untangling my hair as I have other brushes to blow dry/straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected too!</li>
            <li> The bristles are still made of the same plastic material that all other brushes are.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I have very long hair.  </li>
            <li> I think I will use it even for brushing my hair as I blow it dry.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected and not clear in the description.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick and wavy hair that I wear straight half the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple months and over half of them have come off as I&#x27;ve been brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok when my hair is dry but so painful when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> Somehow it also makes brushing easier, allowing me to get a little crazy and start brushing out my wet hair after a shower from the middle / close to the top rather than making progress with the little tangles at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Just know that these pins are almost straight/perpendicular to the paddle, so not much flipping can be done with this brush.  </li>
            <li> So I do not really buy into all this ionic deal.</li>
            <li> My current rubber tipped blow-dry brush just plain hurts.  </li>
            <li> I have long slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair which takes forever to brush with a regular brush</li>
            <li> Not much else to say!</li>
            <li> I had other brushes to use.</li>
            <li> This brush does  not pull or tug like other brushes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to other stylists.</li>
            <li> It also helped dry my hair in less time!  </li>
            <li> Was under the impression the bristles of the brush were wooden too, because it looked like at least the tips were.</li>
            <li> You also have to make room in your drawer for this  BIG sucker.  </li>
            <li> and now I think I&#x27;m down like 10 or so.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need to work so hard with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have been using a brush with the typical plastic pins and they downright hurt and scratch your head.    </li>
            <li> I have also noticed less hair falling out on to my vanity during styling!🙋</li>
            <li> I bought this brush 2 and a half years ago.  </li>
            <li> Small bristles tend to tear my hair if I&#x27;m not super careful.</li>
            <li> Handle is slightly awkward at first</li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair....</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair</li>
            <li> I have had this item for a few months now and it has held up quite well.</li>
            <li> waste of time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> It took a few uses for the &amp;#34;no static&amp;#34; claim to kick in.</li>
            <li> The brush is not as sturdy as I thought it might be, and one of the bristles was missing when I got it out of the box, but it does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> It lasted until part of the colored &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; broke off a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Other brushes ive used have either broken from the little clips or something..</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and brushing it can be painful due to all of the knots.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if the brush has bamboo teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even a cute brush instead of boring black or something, and the bristles haven&#x27;t broken at all yet.</li>
            <li> We have a bass brush that looks like this one which hasn&#x27;t broken on us yet.  </li>
            <li> The rubber base is white, instead of the green or black ones some companies make.  </li>
            <li> This brush is a piece of junk &amp; of course, it is too late to return it.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s below my shoulders and thick).  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have medium/long hair (depending who you ask), thick hair.</li>
            <li> , I have thick hair</li>
            <li> At one point a group of 4 or 5 came out at once, it was not a good experience and this is not a good brush.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I had an expensive hairbrush from a salon for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not perfect for what my needs are.</li>
            <li> a relatively expensive brush, this is disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is faded, ugly, and worn but hasn&#x27;t broken so I will be getting another of those.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I am disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought two of these...I have long thick wavy hair....this brush is very soothing on my scalp and goes through my hair...I am buying a 3rd today:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite brush - love it! :)</li>
            <li> I bought it because I like Bamboo products (because they are a renewable low cost resource), the alternating light dark colors make it look unique and the pattern on the back is pretty as well.  I have had this item for a few months now and it has held up quite well. I would recommend it to a friend looking for a unique brush and/or to someone who cares about the environment.</li>
            <li> Nice gift. I can&#x27;t speak for the recipent, but she loves it. I know the bamboo on the scalp feels quite nice and it&#x27;s a natural comb.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair. My scalp hurt as I brushed. The bristles are too flexible. It is not as good as my Aveda paddle brush. Sorry.</li>
            <li> kind of a still brush, hard on the head...</li>
            <li> I have long, thick and wavy hair that I wear straight half the time.  I was in the market for a new paddle brush to use when blow drying my hair, but something different than the usual Conair products sold at Target.  I purchased this based on reviews and the price and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  The brush moves through my hair so easily--it helps it become straighter and smoother so I don&#x27;t need to work so hard with the flat iron. It also helped dry my hair in less time!  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I only wanted this brush for wooden bristles. But these are plastic! Not what I expected and not clear in the description. It&#x27;s fine as a brush by its self but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy. A nice brush that is not plastic. Should last a long time. Nice soft bristles.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lightweight paddle brush that works very well getting tangles out of hair after washing. Attractive as well!</li>
            <li> Really good brush. Exactly what I was looking for. Reminds me of one I had when I was younger.</li>
            <li> Luvvv the brush ! Was looking for a wooden brush , this hairbrush brushes beautifully . Olivia garden makes great sturdy brushes that are very reasonable priced</li>
            <li> My daughters and I have very long hair.  I really like bamboo products - and after reading reviews for the brush figured I would give this one a try.  Aesthetically this brush is quite nice.  Unfortunately, however, it really pulled and snagged on both my daughters hair, as well as mine (2 of us have thick hair and 1 has fine hair).  I was a bit disappointed because I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good quality full size paddle brush that isn&#x27;t too \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; on the hair.  I think the smaller \\&quot;paddle\\&quot; brush with the boar bristles would have been a far better option but we really needed the full size paddle.</li>
            <li> I really missed having a woodpinned brush.  I have been using a brush with the typical plastic pins and they downright hurt and scratch your head.    The wood pins have a ball shape on the end of the pins, and they just glide over your head.  It&#x27;s enjoyable to brush my hair now.  No scratches....more like a massage.    The brush is very large:  10 inches long, with 5 inches being the brush head and 5 inches the handle.   3 and 5/8 across.  Very smooth bamboo.  The colors are contrasting, on the stripes, and very pleasing.  The rubber base is white, instead of the green or black ones some companies make.  The darker ones seem to show more dirt, so I am happier with the white.    There is a scroll-work design, cut or burnt into the back of the paddle for interest. Has a big HH in cursive at the top of the scroll for Healthy Hair.    I was worried this large paddle was for ladies with hip-length hair as this is the kind of brush you see them using on television!  But I&#x27;m so glad I got it.  Yes, it&#x27;s large, but it feels decadent.  This brush size could be used for all lengths of hair, I think....although a smaller round brush would fit the contours of your head better.      The pins of this brush come out almost straight.  I noticed on the pictures of the smaller round-head brush that they extend out at an angle.  The round brush might be better if you want the angled pins for flipping curls.  Just know that these pins are almost straight/perpendicular to the paddle, so not much flipping can be done with this brush.  It truly is for brushing...not so much for styling.    I looked at the cheaper Bass brushes at the natural store.  Not cheaper in price, but felt cheaper in hand.  I&#x27;m so much happier with this one.  I will have it a long time.  Very happy with this purchase.  I think I will use it even for brushing my hair as I blow it dry.  My current rubber tipped blow-dry brush just plain hurts.  Like dragging nails through your tender head.</li>
            <li> Was under the impression the bristles of the brush were wooden too, because it looked like at least the tips were. Instead, they were plastic, and the tips were painted a wooden color. The paint wears off after about a week or so, which makes the brush look funny, and pieces of the paint come off into your hair and look like dandruff. ;-;</li>
            <li> Purchased three years ago my wife and it&#x27;s still her one and only brush to this day.  She loves the size and how fast she can brush her hair (and I appreciate that the most when we&#x27;re trying to leave the house).  So super easy to remove hair that even I do it without thinking about once a month when I see the brush on the counter.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairbrush last week. I have very thick, long hair, and winter static is a big problem for me. I was hoping to add a hairbrush to my static-reducing routine this winter and I decided on this one. It has arrived and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference over my old, cheap conair paddle brush. This one feels nice on the scalp, it is definitely a mini-massage, but I still get a lot of static when I brush my hair with it. It seems to be well-made. However, I don&#x27;t like that it has so much text on the handle and a large design on the back of the paddle. It&#x27;s a good quality brush but don&#x27;t get it if your goal is to reduce static.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this hair brush ever since I used my sister&#x27;s - it brushes well, and it&#x27;s like massaging your head everytime you brush. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I read so many great reviews but this hairbrush really hurts! I have long slightly wavy hair. It&#x27;s ok when my hair is dry but so painful when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and brushing it can be painful due to all of the knots. This brush just glides right through my hair. And, I love the bamboo handle/base. I compared prices on brushes before I bought it, and am quite satisfied with that aspect as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking for a well-priced, sturdy brush that works well on all hair types, and is eco-friendly, this one is for you! I wouldn&#x27;t s**t ya&#x27;! :)</li>
            <li> Really good brush.  I had been wanting a flat paddle brush for a long time, however most of them just wouldn&#x27;t go through my fairly thick hair.  That is with the exception of the brand that costs well over $100.  I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t pay that much for a brush.  This brush had some good reviews plus it was made of bamboo.  That&#x27;s just an extra benefit as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  The brush also leaves my hair shiny and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;REALLY GREAT BRUSH!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works well even for someone with long hair (my daughter).  She swears that it helps to prevent split-ends.  I don&#x27;t know but her hair does look really good.</li>
            <li> Very nice and light. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush.I can feel it massages scalp better than my drugstore bought Revlon nylon pin brush.I find it is not any more or less antistatic than any other regular brush.So I do not really buy into all this ionic deal.I still like it.It is well made,looks nice and does not get dirty or maybe I just harder to see dirt on it :)</li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy hair brush. The quality of the product is good. The wood grain is pretty, and it is fairly easy to remove hair from.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. Nice large paddle. The quality is great. It&#x27;s a nice hair brush. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. The paddle is wide enough for straightening. Bristles are just right and bamboo makes it light and comfortable.</li>
            <li> At first I gave this brush a great review, but about 6 months after owning it; 3/4 of the little balls on the tips of the bristles have fallen off.  I had a Paul Mitchell brush for many years and that never happened.  This brush is a piece of junk &amp; of course, it is too late to return it.  waste of time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> My hair feels absolutely amazing after using this brush.  I have very thick/wavy hair.  Running this brush through my hair after I straighten it or after I put product in my damp hair just feels so amazing.  I&#x27;ve using it to do blow outs, which takes a lot of time with my hair, and I don&#x27;t even need to straighten it afterwards!  Just remember to break it up into sections if you have thick hair. :)</li>
            <li> Very nice hair brush, I like it better than the one I have been swiping from my husband for the last  few years.... now if he&#x27;ll just keep his hands off mine....</li>
            <li> I like the feel and the look of the wood.  The bristles do not hurt my scalp when I brush my hair (it&#x27;s below my shoulders and thick).  The little knubbies on the ends of the bristles do not pop off when you clean your brush with a comb, either.  Nice and a good buy!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mom, am going to buy for my son and one for me. Really nice brush.</li>
            <li> it felt great while the rubber tips are still attached.  After about 3 months they start to fall off...</li>
            <li> Works great and is very sturdy and fashionable brush with soft, but firm bristles. This brush works very well for brushing long hair.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery. I bought this for my girl friend and she seems to really like it. Has a nice sturdy feel to it amd she says it glides through her hair removing any and all tangles. If shes happy I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Worked the tangles out wonderfully. I have super long hair and this brush doesn&#x27;t yank like others. Great brush!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t overly thrilled with this brush. I would say I&#x27;ve had nicer paddle brushes that were cheaper. The bristles feel like they are scratching my scalp. It does a good job though to blow long straight hair.</li>
            <li> The size of the brush itself was larger than I had anticipated brush but I still love it. I have thick curly hair so it&#x27;s not often that I find a paddle that won&#x27;t completly yank out all of my hair when I try to detangle it in the shower</li>
            <li> Excellent and simple. I was surprise how lightweight it is, too. It&#x27;s lighter than typical plastic-handled ones I&#x27;ve owned, making it good for travel. That may be partly because it&#x27;s slightly smaller than most of those, but also the paddle is thinner, trimming weight. It does now, however, feel cheap in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back has an elegant design motif scorched into it, too. I&#x27;m surprised they don&#x27;t show it off here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t already know, this kind of brush is good for thick hair because of the wide, sturdy bristles. It&#x27;s also anti-static, unlike most boar bristle style brushes and plastic combs. It&#x27;s relatively easy to clean off oils and hair using soapy water and a comb or pick. Just be sure to flex it like a lung to blow any water that gets in the hole out before letting it dry; don&#x27;t want to encourage mold inside it.</li>
            <li> Good solid brush. Not much else to say!</li>
            <li> I bought the Olivia Healthy Hair Bamboo Brush for myself and loved it.  I really like the look of the paddle.  My sister came over and also loved it.  So we sent one to one of our sisters and I snuck in another one for my sister.  When my sister&#x27;s daughters came for the holidays - I heard that they claimed it as theirs!   - Highly recommend this brush and seller - quick response and delivery!</li>
            <li> OMFG.  I need to say that again.  OMFG.  This brush is MURDER on your scalp.  If you have a sensitive head you will not like this brush.  I&#x27;ve always used a Mason Pearson brush so I was weary to try this.  Since I have naturally wavy hair that is always tangled I wanted to love this brush.  I would like to say that once you entirely brush your hair out with this brush it will leave absolutely not one tangle in your hair.  Your hair becomes flat against your scalp and it&#x27;s a nice different feeling but to get to that point you have to brush your hair in big fist sized chunks.  You also have to make room in your drawer for this  BIG sucker.  Would never buy again.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars except the tiny balls that are at the end of each bristle come off just after 2 months make it feel scratchy on the scalp when you brush your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice enough but really BIG.  I don&#x27;t remember if the dimensions are listed in the posting.  You need LOTS of hair for this brush.  I wish this was smaller.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  It holds up well when blow drying my hair.  I have purchased many brushes lately trying to find the right one.  I will definitely buy more brushes by this company.</li>
            <li> Picked this up for my wife because she needed a new brush. She loves it, says that it works very well and is happy with it in every way that she would expect from a brush of this type.</li>
            <li> This is  a great brush.  I have thick long hair and it really helps me.  Bought my second one just to keep it in the car.</li>
            <li> Love the brush and love how it makes my hair soft!!</li>
            <li> one of the best hair brushes  i have own, it leaves my hair shiner and straight, well i s a good rush</li>
            <li> This is a beauty and functional too. I love the hole; i thread a ribbon thru and hang on my bathroom hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a paddle brush freak and this one is top notch. It makes detangling easy and provides nice scalp stimulation. My nephew never wants his hair brushed and he puts up with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light background makes it very easy to see when it needs to be clean</li>
            <li> I love the paddle brush. It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause much static like other brushes. It feels great on my scalp!</li>
            <li> Having used an Aveda wooden paddle brush for years, I decided to try something new. My old Aveda brush had plastic bristles and bristle end; I love the ionic bristle tips on this brush which seem to glide through my hair much easier. Good buy, decent price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a minimalist type of gal. I like to jump out of the shower &amp; go. This is my go to brush. I have medium/long hair (depending who you ask), thick hair. I just brush it right through a few times &amp; it untangles all of my hair in a jiff. I&#x27;ve dropped this brush a number of times &amp; I&#x27;m not concerned with it breaking. It&#x27;s sturdy &amp; still has all of it&#x27;s bristles/ the tops of the bristles that are coated. It&#x27;s not too heavy, and the bristles feel good on my scalp. The brush is made up of wood which is smooth &amp; two different colors. It&#x27;s really a very pretty brush. It&#x27;s definitely my favorite brush. I mostly only use this for untangling my hair as I have other brushes to blow dry/straighten my hair. I would definitely buy this brush again &amp; again. high quality item.</li>
            <li> I wish I bought one of these years ago! Such significant difference in the feel, texture, volume and shine. I have also noticed less hair falling out on to my vanity during styling!🙋</li>
            <li> Great brush I love this brand and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Creates knots in my hair instead of brushing them out.  I would not recommend for those with long or quick knotted hair.</li>
            <li> I totally loved this hair brush, when I first started using it.&lt;br /&gt;However, most of the bristle tops came of pretty quick and brushing got quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;For a relatively expensive brush, this is disappointing.</li>
            <li> The brush is ok buT i ThougT ThaT The brush TeeTh were wood Too buT Thier noT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite brush to use now. the bristles are still attached, the rubber hasn&#x27;t come out, it&#x27;&#x27;s great.  I&#x27;ve had this brush for 9 months now.</li>
            <li> This brush has held up very well since I&#x27;ve purchased it.  It feels really great on your scalp and gets the tangles out well.  My mother loved it so much I&#x27;m going to have to buy her one as well!</li>
            <li> I not the best, once i got it, i notice that I don&#x27;r like the fact of the white part, because with use it turn dirty. But ill keep it because its not terrible. One positive thing is tat beside been a big brush, its not heavy at all, and feels really got while I brush my hair.</li>
            <li> A lovely brush, feels great on the head. The paddle head is quite large but the handle is good to grip.</li>
            <li> I broke my $20 plastic paddle brush close to Christmas. Saw this and thought why not. I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s heavier which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, but makes total sense. It works better than the plastic and is cheaper! Buy it peeps...it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I ordered. It came earlier than expected too! I really like the brush, I have thick hair so the large paddle makes it easy to comb and help dry.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It makes my hair so soft and my hair has been super healthy since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Really nice paddle hairbrush. For the price, it&#x27;s an excellent buy. I&#x27;m not crazy about the striped design, but functionally, it is great on my hair and really helps keep it smooth and frizz-free. I&#x27;d never again spend large sums for a Mason Pearson brush.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product that is a hair glooming dream.</li>
            <li> This brush is great quality and so pretty. The natural wood is very beautiful and the filegry design on the back just puts it over the top.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous paddle brush, really well made and has nice etched carvings on the back. My girlfriend loved it as a gift and uses it every day. It&#x27;s comfortable on your head and is a perfect example of a great hair brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair brush i have ever try. It works defrent than the others. I don&#x27;t know why but it works like magic , it detangles my long hair very easely. and i will buy the same brush for my future daughter.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is good except that the nylon bristle tips break off easily and it scratches your scalp. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple months and over half of them have come off as I&#x27;ve been brushing. I do have thick long hair, so it might be fine for other folks with shorter, thinner hair. I have since switched to another paddle brush that has 100% wood bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush is so nice, the size is big and just perfect.  It is easy to hold and is a very nice texture.  All in all, its a very nice brush and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I consider myself picky about hairbrushes and combs, and I buy new ones probably six times a year. This is the first time I have ever purchased a Olivia Garden brush, and I will now forever purchase them. I also purchased a Olivia Garden round brush, which I also love. I never thought a brush would make my hair softer, but it does. The brush also does not feel cheap, like some brushes that I have purchased at Walmart or Target. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great hairbrush but it snapped in half on me rather quickly. Not even sure how it happened.</li>
            <li> I think I would purchase this else where.....I am still waiting for it to arrive. Good thing I had other brushes to use.</li>
            <li> My first reaction was to send it back because it looked like a pin was missing.  My second reaction was to send it back because it was too big.  Then I decided to try it.  It feels great on my head.  When I blow dry my hair, I get a nice &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; without getting the curl that I get with a round brush.  I don&#x27;t want or need curl since I have a natural curl.  So I like this brush.</li>
            <li> Feels like a massage.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not wooden.</li>
            <li> Love this semi sustainable brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair brush i have ever try. It works defrent than the others. I don&#x27;t know why but it works like magic , it detangles my long hair very easely.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush as a gift for my wife for Christmas. It&#x27;s now August and all the tips have come off the bristles. She&#x27;s had a cheaper brush last 15 years with no problems. I won&#x27;t be buying this again</li>
            <li> I had an expensive hairbrush from a salon for about 10 years. I finally broke. I didn&#x27;t want to spend an exorbitant amount, but had been spoiled by my old brush. This on looked a lot like it, so I took a chance. This brush is prettier, and does just as good of a job as the old expensive salon brush. I like mine so much, I&#x27;m thinking of giving them as gifts. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am currently stationed in southern Afghanistan. I have very long thick hair which takes forever to brush with a regular brush so I have always used paddle brushes. I knew better than to bring along my cheap plastic paddle brush but I brought it anyway and on my second day in-country the handle broke off.  I ordered this one which shipped within a week and, even using an APO address.  It is an outstanding and very beautiful brush. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was excited to pamper myself.  Nice brush until nobs on bristles started falling out.  About one week into owning it.&lt;br /&gt;Junk</li>
            <li> While this brush is large (as others have complained), I do not find it unwieldy.  It not only feels great combing through my hair, it leaves my hair feeling great too.  Edit to original review (above): After only a few months of use, the plastic caps on the tips of the brush bristles started to fall off.  Although I don&#x27;t mind this too much, in terms of product quality, this is a real fault.</li>
            <li> I wanted one with boar bristles with or without plastic added.. This hurts my fine hair head.. Very pretty and good sized but I like a stiff boar bristle better.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the bristles on this brush would be larger, but I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not inspecting it more closely before ordering. Small bristles tend to tear my hair if I&#x27;m not super careful. But this is a sturdy, attractive, good-quality brush, so I&#x27;m keeping it and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. It&#x27;s just not perfect for what my needs are.</li>
            <li> This brush does  not pull or tug like other brushes. It detangles nicely and the bristles seem to massage my scalp as well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush. It feels great and I really love the stripped look. Very comfortable to hold and perfect size.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush&lt;br /&gt;It detangles well and it just enough for massaging my scalp&lt;br /&gt;Love it!1</li>
            <li> Unless you like bristles that rip right out of the brush into your hair! I lost 2 the first day and now I think I&#x27;m down like 10 or so. At one point a group of 4 or 5 came out at once, it was not a good experience and this is not a good brush.</li>
            <li> The shipping on this brush was lightening fast! The quality is unsurpassed. The handle has a professional finish, the bristles firmly attached. It&#x27;s being used in the salon, so it will certainly be used frequently. I would recommend this brush to other stylists.</li>
            <li> For such a great price I was expecting just a basic brush, but my hair actually does come out smoother with this one.  How that happens I do not know!  I might buy a couple more just to tuck away so when this one wears out I have a replacement on hand.</li>
            <li> Was a good brush but completely falls apart after a few months of use! I would not buy this brush again</li>
            <li> Works great and well made.  Also great for DoD</li>
            <li> Bought this specifically because it said it had wooden tipped bristles. Bristles and tips are all synthetic. Will be returning for an actual wooden brush.</li>
            <li> Bought at the recommendation of my hair dresser and love this brush! It works great on my long hair, leaving it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Mostly keeps static off my hair, at least better than other brushes. Handle is slightly awkward at first but you get used to it. It&#x27;s even a cute brush instead of boring black or something, and the bristles haven&#x27;t broken at all yet. Very nice brush.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome feeling brush. I should have ordered three. My four year old says it doesn&#x27;t hurt to get the tangles out, my husband loves it, and I do too. It feels good and makes hair look better than similar paddle brushes we own. I can never find it because my family keeps stealing it from me.</li>
            <li> After one week of use in straight, fine hair, the bristles are bent as if I have owned this brush for years.  some are even curved all the way around such that the ball on the end is pointed back into the rubber pad.  I can&#x27;t see this brush lasting very long under normal use, and ordered a different brush within a week of receiving this one.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly how the image is. I feel very elegant when I have it, the back of the brush has a very light trademark but very classy. It took a few uses for the &amp;#34;no static&amp;#34; claim to kick in. Im not sure if the brush has bamboo teeth but the balls are plastic- that is what i assume. The grip is nice. i compared the brush with my old Swisco plastic one and it has a different brush to it, im not sure what it is. The olivia garden brush swiped through my hair nicely without getting caught vs my old one. I have fine long hair that touches right under my armpits.</li>
            <li> I have a brush for my travel bag and home.  It&#x27;s a great brush great quality for the price</li>
            <li> The brush is not as sturdy as I thought it might be, and one of the bristles was missing when I got it out of the box, but it does what it is supposed to do.  This type of brush is great for quickly drying my below shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now and it still looks good as new. The bristles are all intact, and while I&#x27;ve managed to drop it onto our tile bathroom floor on countless occasions, it&#x27;s also still in one piece. Somehow it also makes brushing easier, allowing me to get a little crazy and start brushing out my wet hair after a shower from the middle / close to the top rather than making progress with the little tangles at the bottom. Causes no frizziness/static. It also is rather attractive; I much prefer this to one of the plastic options.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really have much to say, I&#x27;ve been using this brush, and I like it. I would recommend this product .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard on the scalp.  It&#x27;s ok but I think I&#x27;ll go back to softer bristles.</li>
            <li> Great brush! I have one and each of our horses do too. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Nice brush - good looking and works well - I can&#x27;t believe you could purchase such a nice brush so cheaply</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had! It makes you want to brush your hair more!</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair, and this brush tames it easily.  Wonderful product that I highly recommend.  Does not leave my hair &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this arrived quickly!  and then 8 months later the plastic pieces were melting</li>
            <li> I really like this brush, and the way it glides through my hair and sort of massages my head. However I wish they had shown a photo of the back of the paddle, because there is a large swirly graphic that is incongruous with the rest of the natural bamboo brush design.</li>
            <li> It says bamboo, but only the handle is bamboo--not the bristles (which in my opinion, defeats the whole purpose). The bristles are still made of the same plastic material that all other brushes are. If you&#x27;re an all-natural buyer, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> use it at night and i love it.  Its big enough to brush my hair in half the time.  It makes my hair so soft and shiney</li>
            <li> I have gone through many brushes with four daughters. These wood ones LAST!  This one is pretty, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush 2 and a half years ago.  It stood up to a lot of abuse by myself, my husband, and our two daughters.  It lasted until part of the colored &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; broke off a few weeks ago.  I think it lasted as long as anyone would expect tho so I&#x27;m still happy. Despite that tho,it&#x27;s still going strong and still being used.  We have a bass brush that looks like this one which hasn&#x27;t broken on us yet.  It is faded, ugly, and worn but hasn&#x27;t broken so I will be getting another of those.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser got my hooked and I had to have my own for home. Love it. Gave all my daughter&#x27;s one for Christmas. Go ahead and treat yourself. Well made and great price.</li>
            <li> Cute and functional. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Used after a year or so, the plastic tips will start to fall off.  It works better for long hair,  Maybe it&#x27;s good to use to massage pets.</li>
            <li> Good brush for the money. Gentle, detangling, pretty sturdy, and doesn&#x27;t break off hair like some paddle brushes. Especially great for long hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this earlier this year and use it daily and the rounded tips on the teeth of the brush are falling off. This is my 2nd brush 3 years and I am disappointed. They work great about 6 months then start coming apart.</li>
            <li> Nice big comb. I&#x27;m trying to grow out my hair and this is more gentle than using a standard comb</li>
            <li> Brushes evenly through my hair!!! Still have it up to this point.. Other brushes ive used have either broken from the little clips or something.. Still looks new:)</li>
            <li> Sturdy and relatively light weight. Good balance and grip, detangles well with minimal ouch-factor (I&#x27;m pretty &amp;#34;tender-headed&amp;#34; as we say in the South).</li>
