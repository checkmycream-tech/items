            <li>They just aren&#x27;t good quality blades.  </li>
            <li>Design is good.</li>
            <li>FYI, good DE blades are 33 cents each.  </li>
            <li>Good shaver, cheaper.</li>

            <li>For anyone who uses the headblade system, this is a good buy.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a good upgrade from the 3 blade.  </li>
            <li>Works good, no irritation and gets me bald in one pass.</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>The head shaver, the blades, the gel not as good as advertised for me.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>This is the best product out there for men who want a clean shaven head.</li>
            <li>Great product excellent service THANKS!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had to change blades yet, but I&#x27;m sure these will work great.  </li>
            <li>I have been a very satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>These blades work amazingly well</li>
            <li>The absolute best razor I have found yet.</li>
            <li>so you push it instead, kind of like a toy car.  </li>
            <li>This new 4-blade Headblade set is GREAT!  </li>
            <li>I started with the 3 blade system but love the 4 blade even more!  </li>
            <li>I liked the way it connects and swivels, the packaging protects them well and it would be five star if I could get more then three shaves per blade.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast service!</li>
            <li>blades is smooth, I&#x27;m still adjusting from the classic Headblade to the ATX, but the blades are excellent.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Fusion blade system I was using.</li>
            <li>I love the head blade concept, but this review is about the blades themselves.  </li>
            <li>So for the price I think the manufacturer could do better.</li>
            <li>I will try the five blade one soon to see if they&#x27;re any better.</li>
            <li>I use these blades on my Headblade Sport just because I think it works better than the ATX on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not find it better than my fusion.</li>
            <li>Too many nicks with this blade.  </li>
            <li>was looking for a better way to shave head</li>
            <li>Would love to see them for a bit of a lower price.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love Headblade.</li>
            <li>Ok but I want to try the newest one might work a lil better, but this one is ok.</li>
            <li>I had so many cuts in my head</li>
            <li>glad that they sell replacment blades,  </li>
            <li>or if I go more than 2 days without shaving.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My brother love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best razors to shave your head.  </li>
            <li>so it is more flexible around the head</li>
            <li>However, the adapter requires so much more pressure to use that it prevents a smooth shave and causes more nicks.  </li>
            <li>In the course of that search, found many guys recommending Gilette blades that also fit.</li>
            <li>Better than a Mach 4 smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I got this the next day and it is the right replacement blades for the headblade i also ordered for my boyfriend...got love a sexy bald head!!!</li>
            <li>But you&#x27;ve got to get used to it; because the system is so easy to use and glides so well over your head, you can be lulled into a sense of complacency.</li>
            <li>Gel clogs up the razor head and doesn&#x27;t wash out easily.</li>
            <li>These blades are hands down the best blades to use for your head.</li>
            <li>Like the old original better, still rate it over a Gillette for a great shave quick -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Curious how good the blades would be with the new ATX or S4 Shark (Which they were designed</li>
            <li>Works fine, wish it lasted longer for the price.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I never could get a smooth, against the grain shave with these blades.  </li>
            <li>and I am cheap.</li>
            <li>I try to shave these areas at, the 4-blade won&#x27;t get them smooth like the 3-blade would.</li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The triple blade refills are brilliant--close shave, smooth when done.</li>
            <li>To me it seems that this one doesn&#x27;t clog as quickly as the three blade and when hair does get backed up in it, clears out easily under a stream of water.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone wishing to have a clean shaven head.</li>
            <li>Shave my head once a week, same blade good for up to 16 weeks.</li>
            <li>I blow the excess water out to prevent premature edge dulling, but can only get three good shaves per blade.</li>
            <li>Always a good thing especially on your dome.  </li>
            <li>These are the same blades that came in my HeadBlade and they do a good job on my head.</li>
            <li>There needs to be a better way to adapt it to the classic than requiring this bulky adapter.</li>
            <li>It also seemed that I had to replace them twice as quick as my others.</li>
            <li>However, these new HB4 blades - in a word - suck!!!!  </li>
            <li>comes first!</li>
            <li>Purchased my first pack of these in the store and was worried because the adapter that came with the first set broke, seems like like its made from flimsy plastic, however the adapter in this pack has been working just fine.</li>
            <li>They always give me a nice close shave and last about a month.</li>
            <li>One would think that a fourth blade would improve an already effective and efficient product.  </li>
            <li>as good as other blades</li>
            <li>because , my head lube razor tore my right up.  </li>
            <li>I clean them very well during shaving and after shave.</li>
            <li>I used the HeadBlade with 3 blades and recommend the design for anyone that wants the clean bald look.  </li>
            <li>Both blade systems have the same drawback of not being easy to clean though.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Headblade for close to 10 years now, first with the 2-blade cartridges then with the 3-blade cartridges.</li>
            <li>Just remember when you change blades, you are more likely to cut yourself for the first shave as you get to used to using a sharper blade.</li>
            <li>After recently deciding to rock the shaved head look, I decided to get a headblade ATX and love it, These are the blades it came with</li>
            <li>However, I have thrown good money after bad, trying to find the good in this product.  </li>
            <li>I use these every other day and they are a huge step up from my 3 blade razors, which were a huge step up from the two blades.  </li>
            <li>Liked it very much BUTTT I am having trouble replacing the blade.</li>
            <li>Blades are not nearly as sharp as the original.</li>
            <li>If Headblade were to make a more level adapter for these new cartridges to fit their Classic model better, that would be a solve, otherwise this upgrade is no good for Classic users.</li>
            <li>These simply clog too easily.  </li>
            <li>Good blades, last a long time</li>
            <li>Certainly on par with Gillette or Schick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to find cheaper alternatives, but I really have no quarrels with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift but the person really likes it.</li>
            <li>The Mach 3 gives me a closer shave that is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>The razor and blades are very well thought out.</li>
            <li>Much rather use the gillette pro glide</li>
            <li>The very BEDT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for the past 4 years or so and have tried EVERY razor, the HeadBlade has worked the best for me hands down.</li>
            <li>It is true that the spring pressure to get the blades to press flat against the skin is higher than the HB3 blades.</li>
            <li>one might have to push more than usual to get the blades at the right camber to shave.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve totally adapted to it and enjoyed using it for the last six months.</li>
            <li>Decent razor blades.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I thought the 4-blade would be an improvement over the already great 3-blade razors, but unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li>I actually used on on my face when my electric shaver was broken and it was probably one of the best facial</li>
            <li>Was a bit different than the actual blades made for the shaver, but with the attachment included they work just fine.</li>
            <li>When I saw this new 4-blade system, I ordered the replacement blades, and it came with an adapter for my shaver.  </li>
            <li>I hope the triple blade won&#x27;t be discontinued in favor of this new four blade design.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this new 4 blade version and the new headblade razon</li>
            <li>But when I tried this new 4 blade design, I was blown away.  </li>
            <li>One thing, I own the heavy duty metal holder that you can buy of the head-blade website which of course only holds the 3 blade style.  </li>
            <li>We bought these as we read they retrofit the Headblade Classic, but the reality is that the cartridge&#x27;s adapter makes this sit too far away from the razor&#x27;s body, so to compensate</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>All of the blades in the package I ordered had sharp burrs or imperfections that caused significant cuts.</li>
            <li>For the first time in 10 years, I&#x27;ve gone back to using a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; razor and blade to shave my head.</li>
            <li>More is better, but boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li>The downside of this is that when we first tried it, we pushed a bit too hard and cut the bejeezus out of our scalp in doing so, and fear that many who have stuck with the Headblade Classic will overcompensate and have the same experience.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I took a chunk out of my scalp in the bony, edgy area behind my right ear because I was &amp;#34;on a roll.&amp;#34; I find the Headblade system with the FourBlades is best used as the initial cut.</li>
            <li>The blades last so much longer that normal razors</li>
            <li>These blades are smooth and have allowed me to shave everyday without pain.</li>
            <li>In fact, i would rather have the HB4 because i feel like they are easier to clean the blades than the tightly packed HB6.</li>
            <li>The older system the blade is on the front of the holder, the wheels on the back</li>
            <li>My hair is really thick and easily clogs the blades if I don&#x27;t rinse frequently</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that with the new 4 blade system you use a pulling motion across your head since the blade is located at the back of the holder.  </li>
            <li>This quad-blade refill pack sadly falls short of the excellent shave I&#x27;ve received from their products in the past.</li>
            <li>These blades shave very close and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Never shaved bare before and I won&#x27;t do it without there.</li>
            <li>You will be pleased if you buy these, seriously!</li>
            <li>I switched to the four blade system about 2 weeks ago after using the 3 blade system for several years, and honestly I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li>the blades are not sharp enough to cut the hair on your head.</li>
            <li>it was fun the first month of shaving my head but now its getting expensive.</li>
            <li>It sits in my shower until I am brave enough or stupid enough to use it again.</li>

            <li> I try to shave these areas at, the 4-blade won&#x27;t get them smooth like the 3-blade would.</li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The triple blade refills are brilliant--close shave, smooth when done.</li>
            <li> To me it seems that this one doesn&#x27;t clog as quickly as the three blade and when hair does get backed up in it, clears out easily under a stream of water.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone wishing to have a clean shaven head.</li>
            <li> Shave my head once a week, same blade good for up to 16 weeks.</li>
            <li> I blow the excess water out to prevent premature edge dulling, but can only get three good shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> Always a good thing especially on your dome.  </li>
            <li> These are the same blades that came in my HeadBlade and they do a good job on my head.</li>
            <li> There needs to be a better way to adapt it to the classic than requiring this bulky adapter.</li>
            <li> It also seemed that I had to replace them twice as quick as my others.</li>
            <li> However, these new HB4 blades - in a word - suck!!!!  </li>
            <li> comes first!</li>
            <li> Purchased my first pack of these in the store and was worried because the adapter that came with the first set broke, seems like like its made from flimsy plastic, however the adapter in this pack has been working just fine.</li>
            <li> They always give me a nice close shave and last about a month.</li>
            <li> One would think that a fourth blade would improve an already effective and efficient product.  </li>
            <li> as good as other blades</li>
            <li> because , my head lube razor tore my right up.  </li>
            <li> I clean them very well during shaving and after shave.</li>
            <li> I used the HeadBlade with 3 blades and recommend the design for anyone that wants the clean bald look.  </li>
            <li> Both blade systems have the same drawback of not being easy to clean though.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Headblade for close to 10 years now, first with the 2-blade cartridges then with the 3-blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> Just remember when you change blades, you are more likely to cut yourself for the first shave as you get to used to using a sharper blade.</li>
            <li> After recently deciding to rock the shaved head look, I decided to get a headblade ATX and love it, These are the blades it came with</li>
            <li> However, I have thrown good money after bad, trying to find the good in this product.  </li>
            <li> I use these every other day and they are a huge step up from my 3 blade razors, which were a huge step up from the two blades.  </li>
            <li> Liked it very much BUTTT I am having trouble replacing the blade.</li>
            <li> Blades are not nearly as sharp as the original.</li>
            <li> If Headblade were to make a more level adapter for these new cartridges to fit their Classic model better, that would be a solve, otherwise this upgrade is no good for Classic users.</li>
            <li> These simply clog too easily.  </li>
            <li> Good blades, last a long time</li>
            <li> Certainly on par with Gillette or Schick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to find cheaper alternatives, but I really have no quarrels with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift but the person really likes it.</li>
            <li> The Mach 3 gives me a closer shave that is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> The razor and blades are very well thought out.</li>
            <li> Much rather use the gillette pro glide</li>
            <li> The very BEDT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for the past 4 years or so and have tried EVERY razor, the HeadBlade has worked the best for me hands down.</li>
            <li> It is true that the spring pressure to get the blades to press flat against the skin is higher than the HB3 blades.</li>
            <li> one might have to push more than usual to get the blades at the right camber to shave.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve totally adapted to it and enjoyed using it for the last six months.</li>
            <li> Decent razor blades.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought the 4-blade would be an improvement over the already great 3-blade razors, but unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li> I actually used on on my face when my electric shaver was broken and it was probably one of the best facial</li>
            <li> Was a bit different than the actual blades made for the shaver, but with the attachment included they work just fine.</li>
            <li> When I saw this new 4-blade system, I ordered the replacement blades, and it came with an adapter for my shaver.  </li>
            <li> I hope the triple blade won&#x27;t be discontinued in favor of this new four blade design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this new 4 blade version and the new headblade razon</li>
            <li> But when I tried this new 4 blade design, I was blown away.  </li>
            <li> One thing, I own the heavy duty metal holder that you can buy of the head-blade website which of course only holds the 3 blade style.  </li>
            <li> We bought these as we read they retrofit the Headblade Classic, but the reality is that the cartridge&#x27;s adapter makes this sit too far away from the razor&#x27;s body, so to compensate</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> All of the blades in the package I ordered had sharp burrs or imperfections that caused significant cuts.</li>
            <li> For the first time in 10 years, I&#x27;ve gone back to using a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; razor and blade to shave my head.</li>
            <li> More is better, but boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> The downside of this is that when we first tried it, we pushed a bit too hard and cut the bejeezus out of our scalp in doing so, and fear that many who have stuck with the Headblade Classic will overcompensate and have the same experience.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I took a chunk out of my scalp in the bony, edgy area behind my right ear because I was &amp;#34;on a roll.&amp;#34; I find the Headblade system with the FourBlades is best used as the initial cut.</li>
            <li> The blades last so much longer that normal razors</li>
            <li> These blades are smooth and have allowed me to shave everyday without pain.</li>
            <li> In fact, i would rather have the HB4 because i feel like they are easier to clean the blades than the tightly packed HB6.</li>
            <li> The older system the blade is on the front of the holder, the wheels on the back</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and easily clogs the blades if I don&#x27;t rinse frequently</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that with the new 4 blade system you use a pulling motion across your head since the blade is located at the back of the holder.  </li>
            <li> This quad-blade refill pack sadly falls short of the excellent shave I&#x27;ve received from their products in the past.</li>
            <li> These blades shave very close and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Never shaved bare before and I won&#x27;t do it without there.</li>
            <li> You will be pleased if you buy these, seriously!</li>
            <li> I switched to the four blade system about 2 weeks ago after using the 3 blade system for several years, and honestly I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> the blades are not sharp enough to cut the hair on your head.</li>
            <li> it was fun the first month of shaving my head but now its getting expensive.</li>
            <li> It sits in my shower until I am brave enough or stupid enough to use it again.</li>
            <li> The blades are pressed into a soft plastic shell, not the regular case that every other set of blades come in.  </li>
            <li> These blades seem to become dull very fast.</li>
            <li> For me this is a non issue, the combination of the heft of the S4 and the glide from Head Slick makes for a fast close shave.</li>
            <li> My other name brand 3 and 5 blade razors give me a much closer shave with less irritation.  </li>
            <li> have completely worn out the previous ones</li>
            <li> The product was creativedid not work as well as I would have liked--awkward and hard to use in certain parts of the head</li>
            <li> not all stores carry these blades so they can be hard to find especially if you live in a rural area.</li>
            <li> The 4-blade has trouble shaving shallow recesses in the skull (think back of the head, neck area) which means I have to clean up about 25% of my head with another razor.  </li>
            <li> but i dont see myself using this product for long.</li>
            <li> and I have not had a single cut.  </li>
            <li> This is the first batch of blades that I have ever purchased from HeadBlade that were of poor quality.</li>
            <li> These 4-blade cartridges are the first that I&#x27;ve used that don&#x27;t clog, which has sped up shave time and decreased blood-loss.</li>
            <li> 3 blades a little too likely to cut --</li>
            <li> I found a YouTube how-to video finally that helped (a little).  </li>
            <li> It shaves my scalp incredibly smooth and without cutting me.</li>
            <li> I tried the 3-blade system, and I loved the shaver, but hated the blades that came with it.  </li>
            <li> Also, one has to reverse the direction of the Headblade Classic for these cartridges so they get dragged like a plow instead of pushed like a broom, which then positions the finger ring&#x27;s opening in the direction you&#x27;re dragging, as opposed to the closed curve when you were previously pushing, which is also awkward, and leading with the Classic&#x27;s back-end displaces a line of your shaving cream, which is counter-productive to your skin-prep.</li>
            <li> Wish the blades stayed sharp longer.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t just throw these in the drawer like my other blades.  </li>
            <li> I shave while in the shower using other HeadBlade products (shaving cream)</li>
            <li> I tried two and threw the other 2 away unused.</li>
            <li> The other reason is because of the expense of these blades.  </li>
            <li> No need to get the HB6, there is no difference other than the price.</li>
            <li> and I couldnt imagine having to use any other type of blades.</li>
            <li> The razor clogged like any other.</li>
            <li> And I have been a faithful head blade user since the beginning, and I actually bought a second set just thinking that I had a bad adapter, but the second one was the same, and now I have 2 four packs that I can&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> Rather let down.</li>
            <li> In 10 years, they never let me down.  </li>
            <li> The open design mean no clogging between the blades as often happened with the HB3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it with the other Headblade products!</li>
            <li> Another blade, means less strokes.  </li>
            <li> They are a little tight and you have to stretch the razor connector part a lot</li>
            <li> It is quite a trick to figure out how to get it on the little Headblade car.  </li>
            <li> Just a little FYI</li>
            <li> You can go too fast, or position the handle at an awkward angle.</li>
            <li> and/or missing scalp...</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The shave was a lot smoother and easier, and I even let my hair grow a few days sometimes because I get lazy</li>
            <li> You have to press down so hard and it fails to contour to my head that it takes twice as long to shave, and I still end up having to finish with my face razor.  </li>
            <li> no more cuts on his head after he shaves with using this system.</li>
            <li> These blades have a small gap between each one that lets the hair fall through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the flow through design though.</li>
            <li> The blades are dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product since the beginning--the late &#x27;90s.</li>
            <li> Not good quality.</li>
            <li> Not for the faint of heart or the clumsy shaver,&lt;br /&gt;whichever</li>
            <li> This product is worse one yet.  </li>
            <li> I think I bought the wrong size or model</li>
            <li> It lets you use them way longer before they stop cutting.  </li>
            <li> On the contrary, the three times I have purchased these blades (thinking I got a bad batch)</li>
            <li> I have been extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate when I cut my grape.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Smooth shave. No cuts. Shave my head once a week, same blade good for up to 16 weeks.</li>
            <li> These blades shave very close and last a long time. Much better than the Fusion blade system I was using.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking four blades &#x3D; smoother shave.  However, the adapter requires so much more pressure to use that it prevents a smooth shave and causes more nicks.  You have to press down so hard and it fails to contour to my head that it takes twice as long to shave, and I still end up having to finish with my face razor.  And I have been a faithful head blade user since the beginning, and I actually bought a second set just thinking that I had a bad adapter, but the second one was the same, and now I have 2 four packs that I can&#x27;t use.  There needs to be a better way to adapt it to the classic than requiring this bulky adapter.</li>
            <li> For those going &amp;#34;all bald&amp;#34; this system ROCKS. I&#x27;d like to find cheaper alternatives, but I really have no quarrels with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to change blades yet, but I&#x27;m sure these will work great.  Not for the faint of heart or the clumsy shaver,&lt;br /&gt;whichever comes first!</li>
            <li> Does not seem up the the standard of their two blade or even using a disposable!</li>
            <li> I love the head blade concept, but this review is about the blades themselves.  They just aren&#x27;t good quality blades.  My other name brand 3 and 5 blade razors give me a much closer shave with less irritation.  I never could get a smooth, against the grain shave with these blades.  It also seemed that I had to replace them twice as quick as my others.</li>
            <li> Design is good. Wish the blades stayed sharp longer.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast service!</li>
            <li> This is the first batch of blades that I have ever purchased from HeadBlade that were of poor quality. All of the blades in the package I ordered had sharp burrs or imperfections that caused significant cuts. For the first time in 10 years, I&#x27;ve gone back to using a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; razor and blade to shave my head.</li>
            <li> Liked it very much BUTTT I am having trouble replacing the blade. I have no connection between the included instructions and the &amp;#34;wagon&amp;#34; itself.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift but the person really likes it.</li>
            <li> Great blades for the car razor.</li>
            <li> 3 blades a little too likely to cut -- I hate when I cut my grape.&lt;br /&gt;4 blades is smooth, I&#x27;m still adjusting from the classic Headblade to the ATX, but the blades are excellent.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it connects and swivels, the packaging protects them well and it would be five star if I could get more then three shaves per blade. I clean them very well during shaving and after shave. I blow the excess water out to prevent premature edge dulling, but can only get three good shaves per blade. So for the price I think the manufacturer could do better. I will try the five blade one soon to see if they&#x27;re any better.</li>
            <li> I use these every other day and they are a huge step up from my 3 blade razors, which were a huge step up from the two blades.  I use these blades on my Headblade Sport just because I think it works better than the ATX on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I have is that packaging.  The blades are pressed into a soft plastic shell, not the regular case that every other set of blades come in.  So I can&#x27;t just throw these in the drawer like my other blades.  Rather let down.</li>
            <li> I started with the 3 blade system but love the 4 blade even more!  Best device in the marketplace to shave your head.</li>
            <li> I use the HeadBlade three times a week. My head is as &amp;#34;smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt&amp;#34; as they say after using it. I shave while in the shower using other HeadBlade products (shaving cream) and the combination is awesome. I would recommend this product to anyone wishing to have a clean shaven head.</li>
            <li> as good as other blades</li>
            <li> Great product!  It shaves my scalp incredibly smooth and without cutting me.</li>
            <li> I bought the four Blade thinking More is better, but boy was I wrong! Not only do they not shave as close but they leave a &#x27;razor rash&#x27;. I tried two and threw the other 2 away unused. I will stick with the triple blade from now on.</li>
            <li> Blades are not nearly as sharp as the original. Not good quality.</li>
            <li> The absolute best razor I have found yet. The blades last so much longer that normal razors and it is the closest, smoothest shave I have ever  had. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I did not find it better than my fusion. Too many nicks with this blade.  It sits in my shower until I am brave enough or stupid enough to use it again.</li>
            <li> If shaving your head is what you want to do, this is the shaver you want to do it with, end of story. It&#x27;s a great shaver and I&#x27;ve totally adapted to it and enjoyed using it for the last six months. HeadBlade is tha&#x27; bomb!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the HB system and one reason is because of design. The other reason is because of the expense of these blades.  I&#x27;ve opted to go old-school with a double edge razor and blades.  FYI, good DE blades are 33 cents each.  I paid $50.00 for my solid aluminum DE razor.  Good shaver, cheaper.</li>
            <li> One of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started shaving my head with these products I have been happy.  The four and six blade razors are THE best.  I&#x27;ll keep coming back.</li>
            <li> I ordered the HB4 blades to replace the HB3 blades in my S4 Eclipse. It is true that the spring pressure to get the blades to press flat against the skin is higher than the HB3 blades. For me this is a non issue, the combination of the heft of the S4 and the glide from Head Slick makes for a fast close shave. The open design mean no clogging between the blades as often happened with the HB3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curious how good the blades would be with the new ATX or S4 Shark (Which they were designed for.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product form a great company.</li>
            <li> Like the old original better, still rate it over a Gillette for a great shave quick -</li>
            <li> Never shaved bare before and I won&#x27;t do it without there. Best investment for a bald head and I am cheap.</li>
            <li> the blades are not sharp enough to cut the hair on your head. was looking for a better way to shave head but this is not the way</li>
            <li> This new 4-blade Headblade set is GREAT!  I have been shaving my head for a couple years now.  I tried the 3-blade system, and I loved the shaver, but hated the blades that came with it.  So, I used the Gillette Sensor 3 blades with their adapter, and that worked well.  When I saw this new 4-blade system, I ordered the replacement blades, and it came with an adapter for my shaver.  I LOVE IT!  It shaves cleaner than anything I have ever tried, and have not gotten nicked or cut yet.</li>
            <li> The product was creativedid not work as well as I would have liked--awkward and hard to use in certain parts of the head</li>
            <li> The big difference is that they are vented, as in as you shave, any hair, skin, shaving lotion slide through to the back. The three blade models do not and often bend the blades out of line causing nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I thought the 4-blade would be an improvement over the already great 3-blade razors, but unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t the case.  The 4-blade has trouble shaving shallow recesses in the skull (think back of the head, neck area) which means I have to clean up about 25% of my head with another razor.  Doesn&#x27;t matter which direction I try to shave these areas at, the 4-blade won&#x27;t get them smooth like the 3-blade would.</li>
            <li> Good blades, but a bit pricey. Would love to see them for a bit of a lower price. On the good side it does not nick or cut when used with the atx headblade.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for over a year. They always give me a nice close shave and last about a month. I shave my head only about every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> After starting my bald head shaving with the 4 blade headblades, I decided to try a Mach 3. The Mach 3 gives me a closer shave that is very noticeable. I think it has to do with the instructions to not add extra pressure to the headblade.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this all the time time.  no more cuts on his head after he shaves with using this system.</li>
            <li> Good blades. Headblade system works well. But you&#x27;ve got to get used to it; because the system is so easy to use and glides so well over your head, you can be lulled into a sense of complacency. You can go too fast, or position the handle at an awkward angle. Watch out. I took a chunk out of my scalp in the bony, edgy area behind my right ear because I was &amp;#34;on a roll.&amp;#34; I find the Headblade system with the FourBlades is best used as the initial cut. After I&#x27;ve made my with and against the grain passes, I revert to a women&#x27;s five blade system for the close work and finishing touches. A women&#x27;s razor had plenty of glide moisturizer and flexes with the shape of head. Smooth.</li>
            <li> Does an awesome job and my husband doesnt want to use anything else. Truely a wonderful product. Its Excalibur for your head.</li>
            <li> I switched to the four blade system about 2 weeks ago after using the 3 blade system for several years, and honestly I was not impressed.  One thing, I own the heavy duty metal holder that you can buy of the head-blade website which of course only holds the 3 blade style.  I have also noticed that with the new 4 blade system you use a pulling motion across your head since the blade is located at the back of the holder.  The older system the blade is on the front of the holder, the wheels on the back so you push it instead, kind of like a toy car.  To me I get a closer shave that way.  Both blade systems have the same drawback of not being easy to clean though.  I shave in the shower, which helps in the cleaning process somewhat.  I think I will stick with the 3 blade system.</li>
            <li> Good blades, last a long time</li>
            <li> These blades work amazingly well and I have not had a single cut.  The razor and blades are very well thought out. You will be pleased if you buy these, seriously!</li>
            <li> I used to use the Atra heads, but could only shave every 3 or 4 days because it hurt my scalp. These blades are smooth and have allowed me to shave everyday without pain. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> These simply clog too easily.  Will stick to the 2 blade Atras.</li>
            <li> No need to get the HB6, there is no difference other than the price. In fact, i would rather have the HB4 because i feel like they are easier to clean the blades than the tightly packed HB6.</li>
            <li> I never have any complaints about these blades because they work!</li>
            <li> Its good. but i dont see myself using this product for long. it was fun the first month of shaving my head but now its getting expensive. Much rather use the gillette pro glide</li>
            <li> Great product excellent service THANKS!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and they worked great. I will buy them again when I need refills.</li>
            <li> Great product for my headblade!  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> These blades are hands down the best blades to use for your head. They dont cause no irritation or leave you razor burn once your done! I have used these blades for about a year now and I couldnt imagine having to use any other type of blades.</li>
            <li> I love Headblade. I&#x27;ve been using the product since the beginning--the late &#x27;90s. This quad-blade refill pack sadly falls short of the excellent shave I&#x27;ve received from their products in the past. The shave is not close, and misses entire sections despite repeated attempts to go over the area from various angles. The one advantage; I have yet to cut myself with the fourblade refill. That said, I&#x27;d rather have the occasional nick and close shave than the sub-standard shave with no-nicks the fourblade provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The triple blade refills are brilliant--close shave, smooth when done. Every time. I hope the triple blade won&#x27;t be discontinued in favor of this new four blade design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I&#x27;ve given the four-blade a fair shake. I&#x27;ve used them repeatedly, and from two different packs in case one was a dud. It simply doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard - or the stubble.</li>
            <li> For anyone who uses the headblade system, this is a good buy.  not all stores carry these blades so they can be hard to find especially if you live in a rural area.</li>
            <li> We bought these as we read they retrofit the Headblade Classic, but the reality is that the cartridge&#x27;s adapter makes this sit too far away from the razor&#x27;s body, so to compensate one might have to push more than usual to get the blades at the right camber to shave. The downside of this is that when we first tried it, we pushed a bit too hard and cut the bejeezus out of our scalp in doing so, and fear that many who have stuck with the Headblade Classic will overcompensate and have the same experience. Also, one has to reverse the direction of the Headblade Classic for these cartridges so they get dragged like a plow instead of pushed like a broom, which then positions the finger ring&#x27;s opening in the direction you&#x27;re dragging, as opposed to the closed curve when you were previously pushing, which is also awkward, and leading with the Classic&#x27;s back-end displaces a line of your shaving cream, which is counter-productive to your skin-prep. If Headblade were to make a more level adapter for these new cartridges to fit their Classic model better, that would be a solve, otherwise this upgrade is no good for Classic users.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good upgrade from the 3 blade.  To me it seems that this one doesn&#x27;t clog as quickly as the three blade and when hair does get backed up in it, clears out easily under a stream of water.  Easier than with the three blade.</li>
            <li> My husband recently shaved his head because he was thinning in the middle. This is the best product out there for men who want a clean shaven head.</li>
            <li> Ok but I want to try the newest one might work a lil better, but this one is ok.</li>
            <li> Was a bit different than the actual blades made for the shaver, but with the attachment included they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations</li>
            <li> I think I bought the wrong size or model</li>
            <li> Works fine, wish it lasted longer for the price.  It is quite a trick to figure out how to get it on the little Headblade car.  I found a YouTube how-to video finally that helped (a little).  In the course of that search, found many guys recommending Gilette blades that also fit.</li>
            <li> My son won&#x27;t use anything but his HeadBlade shaving system.  Says nothing else comes close.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet :because , my head lube razor tore my right up.  I had so many cuts in my head it was regular war zone up my nugget. This product is worse one yet.  You couldn&#x27;t pay me to give this product away!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i am so happy that i got the headblade &amp;#34;car&amp;#34; to shave my head, it is the fastest and the best way to shave your head.  glad that they sell replacment blades,  have completely worn out the previous ones</li>
            <li> I have used a Headblade for close to 10 years now, first with the 2-blade cartridges then with the 3-blade cartridges. My hair is really thick and easily clogs the blades if I don&#x27;t rinse frequently or if I go more than 2 days without shaving. Clogged blades leads to unshaved hair and/or missing scalp... good times! These 4-blade cartridges are the first that I&#x27;ve used that don&#x27;t clog, which has sped up shave time and decreased blood-loss. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Best friend for a bald man</li>
            <li> These blades seem to become dull very fast.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I ALWAYS cut or nicked my head when using the earlier 2 blade version.&lt;br /&gt;With this new 4 blade version and the new headblade razon I no longer have any issue shaving my head.</li>
            <li> Works good, no irritation and gets me bald in one pass.</li>
            <li> 4 blades is the way to go. Will recommend to all my friends that shave there head.  Use with teh ATX all terrain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for the past 4 years or so and have tried EVERY razor, the HeadBlade has worked the best for me hands down.</li>
            <li> The ones with 3 blades used to always get clogged with hair when I shaved my head. These blades have a small gap between each one that lets the hair fall through. It lets you use them way longer before they stop cutting.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My brother love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best razors to shave your head.  Use it with the other Headblade products!</li>
            <li> Fiance swears on these razor blades. They are a little tight and you have to stretch the razor connector part a lot so it is more flexible around the head</li>
            <li> A great,comfortable shave. Best blade to shave your head with.</li>
            <li> Another blade, means less strokes.  Always a good thing especially on your dome.  Purchased my first pack of these in the store and was worried because the adapter that came with the first set broke, seems like like its made from flimsy plastic, however the adapter in this pack has been working just fine.</li>
            <li> I got this the next day and it is the right replacement blades for the headblade i also ordered for my boyfriend...got love a sexy bald head!!!</li>
            <li> Better than a Mach 4 smooth shave.  The very BEDT</li>
            <li> These are the same blades that came in my HeadBlade and they do a good job on my head. I actually used on on my face when my electric shaver was broken and it was probably one of the best facial shaves I&#x27;ve ever experienced with a blade type razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using head blade products for years and have no complaints. Just remember when you change blades, you are more likely to cut yourself for the first shave as you get to used to using a sharper blade. Just a little FYI</li>
            <li> Wow!  I used the HeadBlade with 3 blades and recommend the design for anyone that wants the clean bald look.  But when I tried this new 4 blade design, I was blown away.  The shave was a lot smoother and easier, and I even let my hair grow a few days sometimes because I get lazy so I know it&#x27;s my fault for the shave being  more difficult at times.  The 4 blades also last WAY longer than the 3 blades.  I guess it&#x27;s because of the design.  I can&#x27;t recommend the 4 blade design highly enough if you&#x27;re already using or thinking about buying the Headblade.</li>
            <li> Good deal. Good product.  No issues.</li>
            <li> I have been using HeadBlade products for 10 years.  I have been a very satisfied customer.  However, these new HB4 blades - in a word - suck!!!!  One would think that a fourth blade would improve an already effective and efficient product.  On the contrary, the three times I have purchased these blades (thinking I got a bad batch) I have been extremely disappointed. The blades are dull. Each time I have had to resort to shaving my head with my Gillette face shaver to get the close shave to which I have become accustomed.  HeadBlade products are pricey, but I justify the expense with my satisfaction.  However, I have thrown good money after bad, trying to find the good in this product.  I am going back to the HB3.  In 10 years, they never let me down.  Simply put, this generation of HeadBlade blades DOES NOT cut it.  Pun intended!</li>
            <li> The head shaver, the blades, the gel not as good as advertised for me. Gel clogs up the razor head and doesn&#x27;t wash out easily. Shaver unwieldily to use. Probably me not getting used to. Defiantly for the face. I wasted my money. Back to gillette.</li>
            <li> After recently deciding to rock the shaved head look, I decided to get a headblade ATX and love it, These are the blades it came with and I find they last about 4-5 shaves.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Decent razor blades. Certainly on par with Gillette or Schick. I&#x27;m not sure about the flow through design though. The razor clogged like any other. On the plus side, I didn&#x27;t cut myself at all.</li>
