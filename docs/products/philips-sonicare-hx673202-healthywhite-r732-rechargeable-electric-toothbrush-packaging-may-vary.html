            <li>I am very happy with.  </li>
            <li>Best toothbrush I have ever bought and couldn&#x27;t imagine changing it.  </li>
            <li>This does an excellent job cleaning all our teeth (family of 4).</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2 of these and they are great!</li>
            <li>I rated this toothbrush 3 stars because Sonicare is still the best toothbrush out there, but downgraded it because of the durability issues mentioned here.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is amazing!!  </li>
            <li>Battery power is very good.  </li>
            <li>The Philips two-in-one design charger is also very good.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist says I do a very good job manually.  </li>
            <li>But because it is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever experienced, it gets bumped to a 4 star.</li>
            <li>All in all, great product at a great price!</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a good toothbrush, if they would have included a couple features from the R910 it would have been perfect.</li>
            <li>Battery life is superb, and the cleaning power is exceptional.</li>
            <li>It is a great product.</li>
            <li>Also, in shipment my toothbrush never made it to me and Amazon was great about sending another one.  </li>
            <li>The triple function provides great choice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product for under $150 now on Amazon.</li>
            <li>of these are great</li>
            <li>The battery life is also great, I brought the toothbrush on a 10 day trip and didn&#x27;t have to charge it at all.   </li>
            <li>This product is great, although not</li>
            <li>I will give the Sonicare HealthyWhite Toothbrush 5 stars because it is so great on the pearly whites.  </li>
            <li>Been going great ever since.</li>
            <li>The battery is great, maintaining charge for 2+ weeks at a time (I haven&#x27;t tested it longer than that).  </li>
            <li>The electronic toothbrush is great.</li>
            <li>The product is great.</li>
            <li>Great at the beginning.</li>
            <li>and he always tells me to keep doing what I am doing because the results are great .</li>
            <li>Bought this when it was on sale at Amazon and am happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>Now to the question why would you need this great customer service: I bough the brush in March and it came with 1-year warranty.</li>
            <li>feels great and cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Great electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Makes a great gift for any occasion.</li>
            <li>The three settings is a great option.</li>
            <li>so I emailed Philips and they were happy to replace it.  </li>
            <li>Great customer service.  </li>
            <li>A great value for the price.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>(but he has great teeth).</li>
            <li>I am so happy I purchased this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>i look forward to using - always leaves my mouth tasting great - which i didn&#x27;t expect</li>
            <li>Great.  </li>
            <li>but my dentist still wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is a joy.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for two years and one month then it died one month beyond the warranty</li>
            <li>It worked great, and gave me a just from the dentist</li>
            <li>It was a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>happy customers</li>
            <li>Definitely happy I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what others have experienced with durability, but that is mine.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m actually confident my teeth and gums feel their best ever.  </li>
            <li>The design is good and she is happy with the cleaning capability of the device.</li>
            <li>Good speed and feels very effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, if you&#x27;re a coffee drinker, a tobacco user or even just someone who likes a clean mouth, YOU NEED THIS BRUSH!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be good for kids too, so they&#x27;re not doing a swipe and say they&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be good for kids too, so they&#x27;re not doing a swipe and say they&#x27;re done.     </li>
            <li>I know that it sounds cliche, even trite, to say that I&#x27;ve never used a toothbrush that is as good as this one, but it is nevertheless true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good...</li>
            <li>in all this is a good investment that should be under $100.  </li>
            <li>The good thing about this one over the Elite series is that it works on 110V as well as 220V</li>
            <li>I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the setting that gradually increases the brush&#x27;s power over a period of 2 weeks to get you used to it.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li>We ordered this Sonicare to replace it and it feels SO GOOD.  </li>
            <li>Had a good check-up, too.  </li>
            <li>So it is a good product,  </li>
            <li>as well you could say I&#x27;m a good judge when it comes to whitening.  </li>
            <li>It has been, after a month, almost as good as a visit to a dentist without the cost.</li>
            <li>and I got a good deal on it</li>
            <li>Does a good job at cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Our dentist also thought this is a good product.</li>
            <li>I sprung for the Sonicare, and have been delighted with the choice.  </li>
            <li>This is really a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Must admit this is superior to the orignal by a factor of three.</li>
            <li>The performance is good.</li>
            <li>good purchase.</li>
            <li>It does a good job.</li>
            <li>Price was good.</li>
            <li>This one does not do as good a job of cleaning</li>
            <li>I have used an Oral-B brush for about a year, and this product is superior.  </li>
            <li>I have used vibrating ultrasonic types like Sonicare, and the rotary type brushes like those by Oral B, and they each have good points, as well as shortcomings.  </li>
            <li>The brush does a fairly good job of cleaning, but of course supplementary cleaning, like flossing is still required.  </li>
            <li>The brush does a fairly good job of cleaning, but of course supplementary cleaning, like flossing is still required.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After two weeks of using the \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; mode, I did notice my teeth to be at best a shade whiter.</li>
            <li>Clean is the best word I can think of to describe this model&#x27;s design.</li>
            <li>I am very happy and recommended it to several people who also bought the toothbrush and are also very happy!</li>
            <li>The Sonicare line of power toothbrushes is an excellent tool for maintenance of healthy teeth and gums and this latest example adds an element of portability that lets you take it on the road in a minimum of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charged quickly and worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li>As I thought I would be, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great design, powerful, and my mouth feels GREAT afterwards!!  </li>
            <li>I have now used two electric toothbrushes, both Philips Sonicaare models and have been very pleased with each on.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Have been through 3 of them now, and my gums are healthy again and my teeth are in great shape.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the product and am very glad that I bit the bullet (no pun intended) and paid $100</li>
            <li>I am exceedingly happy and satisfied with this model.  </li>
            <li>Also, I lost a cap and needed one from Philips and they wre more than happy to send me one.</li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job of cleaning - I got it right after a trip to the dentist and my teeth still feel dentist-clean.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed after the first time use.</li>
            <li>I love this one!</li>
            <li>And the customer service is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>The Phillip&#x27;s Sonicare was recommended to me by my dentist and love it!</li>
            <li>Over all I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this electric toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love my Sonicare!</li>
            <li>Outstanding service!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a wise investment in better dental care that will pay off with fewer Dentist visits.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nice to know that I have the option if I start having sensitivity problems.    </li>
            <li>The quad timer is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I liked my sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>thing that I particularly liked about the Sonicare Toothbrush is the shape of the brush head.</li>
            <li>One thing that I particularly liked about the Sonicare Toothbrush is the shape of the brush head.</li>
            <li>toothbrush comes with a nice compact case that carries the handle and two brushes.</li>
            <li>While I like this, a bonus head would&#x27;ve been nice.  </li>
            <li>I am unsure whether this is a good thing because it makes the cap stand out more.</li>
            <li>I honestly think I can go both ways - stay with my Oral B Triumph or continue using the Sonicare HW.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is a nice touch</li>
            <li>The portable travel case is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I even got my kids their own as well.</li>
            <li>And I heard that a water pick wasn&#x27;t really an effective alternative.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it took some time for me to warm up to the price tag...</li>
            <li>It seems to claim that it comes with two chargers: a travel charger and a deluxe charger.  </li>
            <li>I found good reviews of the Philips \\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li>All good :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest,</li>
            <li>Also included is a handy plastic travel case for the handle and brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also included is a handy plastic travel case for the handle and brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Sonicare is awesome: quiet, very effective and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>The 3 stages it has to clean, is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use, and most importantly, does an excellent job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>The HealthyWhite brush was a great sonic toothbrush that got my teeth quite clean.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy that I upgraded to this particular model.</li>
            <li>in all, this is the best toothbrush I have ever owned, and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are very pleased with its performance; it is a unique tool in our effort to achieve optimum dental care.</li>
            <li>Leaves your teeth super smooth!!!</li>
            <li>Both systems seem to do a great job at keeping teeth clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>So far I am very impressed by it.</li>
            <li>I would think Phillips would treat their customers better if they wanted to develop any kind of brand loyalty.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say for sure that I now whiter teeth</li>
            <li>So far, the best of the lot that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>And, okay, I am kind of a gadget guy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, very glad I got it and can&#x27;t wait until my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, very glad I got it and can&#x27;t wait until my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li>I spend the full 2 minutes brushing plus the whitening feature gives another 30 seconds of brushing!!  </li>
            <li>The dental hygienist was super happy to see my gums are getting healthier, when they do the measurements I&#x27;ve been getting mostly 4&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The dental hygienist was super happy to see my gums are getting healthier, when they do the measurements I&#x27;ve been getting mostly 4&#x27;s</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE my toothbrush!    </li>
            <li>This one stays clean and does a really good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>As of right now, I am more than happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>We were quite happy with the first.  </li>
            <li>This is the first sonic toothbrush I have tried and it is great.  </li>
            <li>so I am pretty happy with the way it performed and would get a Sonicare brush again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is the first problem I have experienced.  </li>
            <li>It is very light</li>
            <li>So easy to deal with, amazing customer service from Philips.  </li>
            <li>Quite a nice power toothbrush that I find easy to recommend.</li>
            <li>Also included in the box is a charger with a handy cord wrap for easy portability, a storage case for the brush heads (together with travel caps for brush head hygiene), and a travel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the toothbrush&#x27;s functionality - it works fast, charges quickly, does what it promises to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the e-series Sonicare Toothbrush for more than a year and have been very pleased with it, so I was excited to try the newest Sonicare power toothbrush with a whitening feature.  </li>
            <li>The flossing makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>The power toothbrush does a much better job of cleaning my teeth and keeping my gums healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m expecting the hygenist to be pleased w/ my teeth.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE my toothbrush!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t like the smaller \\&quot;detail\\&quot; brush, my wife has braces and finds that it is perfect for cleaning around her</li>
            <li>I am just glad that I did.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>White\\&quot;, it seems that it would make more sense for this to be the default setting.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth better</li>
            <li>and i have to restart the cycle manually once more, because as soon as 2 minutes are up</li>
            <li>What more to you want?</li>
            <li>and I still don&#x27;t like it when I accidentally touch my teeth with the plastic head moving, but I think this will keep my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Your mouth is the cause to most sickness, and gum disease is a lot more than about losing teeth.  </li>
            <li>HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush should be on the top of your list.  </li>
            <li>And if it&#x27;s a quality product, the customer will use it more than two years.  </li>
            <li>it does the job, well, and more than you would expect.  </li>
            <li>You will appreciate the brushing modes and routines, and feel confident it is doing quite a bit of work for you.  </li>
            <li>The battery operated should stay on for 2 minutes more, its more like 15 seconds and shuts off.</li>
            <li>They need to press the button many times in order to get it work.  </li>
            <li>The design of Philips is much better than oral-B.</li>
            <li>Almost no bathroom is fitted with more than one electric razor/toothbrush power socket, so buying two separate chargers will not solve this problem.</li>
            <li>but I love the Philips Sonicare R732/</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I like the Sonicare R910 better.</li>
            <li>While I still think that the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush cleans a bit better and longer than the Sonicare products, all of the Sonicare products, including the HealthyWhite Toothbrush, are top notch.  </li>
            <li>While I still think that the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush cleans a bit better and longer than the Sonicare products, all of the Sonicare products, including the HealthyWhite Toothbrush, are top notch.  </li>
            <li>With time, I may get better at it.    </li>
            <li>in many ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to do this with the toothbrush in your mouth if you don&#x27;t want toothpaste all over the bathroom mirror and sink.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amanda Richards, July 3, 2008ite and healthy smiles.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it can deal with anything but the most superficial stains.</li>
            <li>Bite the bullet &amp; buy this brush, you&#x27;ll be glad you did &amp; your mouth will thank you almost immidiately after</li>
            <li>With the Sonicare HealthyWhite, I was able to use both brush heads</li>
            <li>But I am inclined to say that this is more ad hype than anything else...    </li>
            <li>I love ultrasonic toothbrushes and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>(most ultrasound toothbrushes do this, I&#x27;ll add) - and remain so for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>and I love the ease of use, the way it makes  my teeth feel and look.  </li>
            <li>I think my dentist is going to be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The best things in life are the simplest: the R732 is simple and effective.&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li>So pleased with this product that I bought one for my daughter and her family.  </li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit to get used to because it is more vigorous than I would brush myself.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had started using one of these many years ago</li>
            <li>My teeth feel and look way better.</li>
            <li>The handle is the most comfortable yet!</li>
            <li>It just feels better in one&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>I love this electric brush.</li>
            <li>I use it much more than 2 minutes.(probably 12) per brushing.  </li>
            <li>I should be able to choose the brushes I want.  </li>
            <li>I chose the HealthyWhite mostly because of the travel case.  </li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I had kept my Amazon invoice and was able to tell them when I bought it and since it was under warranty, they sent me a replacement toothbrush.</li>
            <li>We love the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>This seems to me to do an even better job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you turn it off while it&#x27;s still in your mouth</li>
            <li>However, I have always just stuck to using the whatever toothbrush was on sale method for the better part of my life; until now that is.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the stronger battery power, better brushing motion or improved brush head, but this is awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>everything else is ok....</li>
            <li>Excellent product....have already seen improvement in only a week of use!</li>
            <li>Told me I had a 2 yr warranty which I wasn&#x27;t sure about.  </li>
            <li>do think the ORAL B toothbrush has more bang and just seems like a better product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have more of a plaque issue, so that may be why.  </li>
            <li>Just the fact that it makes me brush for a specific amount of time and tells me when to switch locations is priceless in my book.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy!</li>
            <li>could be an overkill for what I needed/wanted, but definitely glad that I got this one</li>
            <li>Now, consider the fact I am someone who thought the idea of paying more than $7 for a toothbrush was madness</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>so she was pleased.  </li>
            <li>and I love mine, too.  </li>
            <li>The On/Off button seems to be most anyplace on the unit and not just the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; circle intended.</li>
            <li>My dentist never recommended a electronic toothbrush to me (the cleaners always said I just need to brush better and longer), but 1 day I asked about electronic toothbrushes</li>
            <li>White\\&quot; so I bought it and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>We love our Philips Sonicare HX6732/02 Rechargable Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>+ every 2 years if a more reliable alternative exists.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m sure this will resolve favorably.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush keeps my pearly whites nice and clean and smooth!  </li>
            <li>I called Phillips customer service, they were very friendly and helpful.</li>
            <li>After that, my teeth just didn&#x27;t feel as clean when I used my own manual tooth brush.    </li>
            <li>And I love the way the head comes off so you can clean!  </li>
            <li>This new one is a great replacement, love the Sonicare movement.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean after using the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare toothbrushes since they first came out and have loved each one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty good for smokin&#x27; singles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty good for smokin&#x27; singles.        </li>
            <li>I also liked that its timer reminded me to brush the full two minutes</li>
            <li>The battery life is also supposed to be pretty good</li>
            <li>I am a long time user of Sonicare power toothbrushes and think they are the best toothbrushes you can buy.  </li>
            <li>The new brush heads are great.</li>
            <li>How about make it easy for a customer and make the handle from a better material???</li>
            <li>Convenient, attractive, quiet, and so effective at what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I love my original Philips Sonicare toothbrush so was looking forward to seeing what the \\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li>but it certainly does a good job.</li>
            <li>results of modern dentistry can be impressive, but the costs of the newer dental technologies can get quite high.  </li>
            <li>results of modern dentistry can be impressive, but the costs of the newer dental technologies can get quite high.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it as a superior way to clean teeth and he was right.</li>
            <li>And while I&#x27;m a fervent changer of toothbrushes, the heads on this baby are kind of pricey, although they&#x27;re holding up pretty well after many uses.      </li>
            <li>My experience with electric tooth brushes is based mostly on lower end Braun Oral B, first the kind that took batteries then their entry level spin brush.</li>
            <li>Arrived faster than expected,  and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, we bought another just as near to it that we could find and it is great.</li>
            <li>This works great, just like my old one.  </li>
            <li>My son, being a normal boy, isn&#x27;t the greatest fan of the mundane task of brushing his teeth and tended to not do a great job with the manual brush.  </li>
            <li>(1&#x27;s are ideal, 5&#x27;s are no good), but this time, they were at mostly 2&#x27;s with a couple of 3&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li>(1&#x27;s are ideal, 5&#x27;s are no good), but this time, they were at mostly 2&#x27;s with a couple of 3&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li>You are not offering the kind I had before, and I can not remember it&#x27;s name right now.</li>
            <li>It is now easy to use, very useful and, most importantly, gets my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>Other than that i&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>This is the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on tooth brushes!</li>
            <li>Using the Philips Sonicare Power Toothbrush is easy.</li>
            <li>it was easy to set up.</li>
            <li>This setting can be easily turned on and off whenever you need (or don&#x27;t) it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to set up and easy to use</li>
            <li>My teeth are much more clean using this electric toothbrush vs an old-fashioned manual brush.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li>I just love the fact that it is easier to keep clean.    </li>
            <li>Love how it works, easy to clean, the quadpacer (a MANDATORY feature for my money)--</li>
            <li>im making there job to easy</li>
            <li>It is easy to plug and remove the brush head.</li>
            <li>It feels good, it works well, and it is a great improvement over the battery operated one I had had for a few months.</li>
            <li>Durable and easy to take care of.  </li>
            <li>Replacing a tooth can easily run $1000 for a crown, or $4000 for an implant.  </li>
            <li>Replacing a tooth can easily run $1000 for a crown, or $4000 for an implant.  </li>
            <li>I had an older Sonicare model which seemed to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend a Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The sonic cleaning of this toothbrush is like no other I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>I liked it until it died exactly 2 years to the day.</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m a very happy customer &amp; it came with a 2 year warranty &amp; from reading other reviews, they fully honor those warranties hassle free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine now, but it took a while.</li>
            <li>After using the Sonicare HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush for two weeks,&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be an excellent product, consistent with all recent Sonicare electric</li>
            <li>If price isnât an issue for you, this is a fine brush.</li>
            <li>The price was better than anywhere else including Walmart,  who usually has the best price.</li>
            <li>If anyone from Sonicare wishes to contact me with any other options, I would be more than happy to HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOOTHBRUSH!!!!!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has had his Sonicare Elite for several years, and it&#x27;s still going strong and working great.  </li>
            <li>So whether you get this model or an older one, I think you will be very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>But overall I am very pleased!</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference in my dental check ups.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in my dental health.</li>
            <li>The timer function is remarkably accurate, and</li>
            <li>It is powerful and does an outstanding job cleaning your teeth and gum line.</li>
            <li>felt like a light bulb exploded in my head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably choose a more economical model.  </li>
            <li>The travel case for this one is fantastic.</li>
            <li>(no color chart available), but they feel noticeably cleaner than before --</li>
            <li>It is important to keep a light touch on the brush handle and just touch it against your teeth, rather than pushing it.</li>
            <li>It is important to keep a light touch on the brush handle and just touch it against your teeth, rather than pushing it.</li>
            <li>smooth surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Equally important, the design of the the unit and the way the brush head attaches eliminates the problem of gunk building up.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy how my teeth feel after using this machine.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt better and my smile has been noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li>Using the Philips Sonicare R732 guarantees a better, brighter smile.</li>
            <li>It is sealed and cleaner to use and rinses clean easily.    </li>
            <li>My teeth stay build-up free longer.</li>
            <li>night I was brushing my teeth and as I tried to turn the brush to reach an area, I heard a \\&quot;bzzz\\&quot; sound.</li>
            <li>Overall happy with this model.</li>
            <li>its my primary toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is a great sonic brush overall.</li>
            <li>The timer is great and it gives sonic pulse makes you feel like you just came back from the dentist.</li>
            <li>For years I was just using the free toothbrushes my dentist provided me after check-ups.  </li>
            <li>The whitening setting does help remove some light surface stains, and I have used this with whitening and non-whitening tooth paste as well.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean where the brush head attaches the unit.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t measure time properly and so results weren&#x27;t great -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy brushing with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Great battery life, white teeth</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>So far it is good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>before, this one is far superior to it.</li>
            <li>Thought I had a good toothbrush with the old one, this one is far superior.  </li>
            <li>This product is also good for me as I have mildly sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been keeping it on its charging stand, reasoning that the battery is more likely to give good service if kept fully charged.</li>
            <li>so i use it full cycle on top teeth then full cycle bottom teeth</li>
            <li>Now more than ever, practicing good dental hygiene, might save you a bundle in future dental bills.  </li>
            <li>Now more than ever, practicing good dental hygiene, might save you a bundle in future dental bills.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, not bad looking design</li>
            <li>Highly recommended. !!!!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!</li>
            <li>very powerful -- I can feel my teeth are cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth with a very fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>I also knew I wasn&#x27;t happy with OralB - because my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean, and I knew that it was definitely not getting into all the contours of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved my &#x27;Elite&#x27; &amp; I know I&#x27;m gonna love this new brush just as much</li>
            <li>My teeth felt really smooth, polished, and clean -</li>
            <li>The remaining two settings feel comfortable;  since my teeth feel clean at cycle&#x27;s end, I believe the Sonicare is doing a thorough job.  </li>
            <li>Instructions were easy to follow and quick to comprehend.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first Sonicare from my dentist about three years ago, and I&#x27;ve always loved how it made my teeth feel so much cleaner than after a manual brushing.</li>
            <li>Also, while the three cleaning modes are a nice feature, I have found myself rarely using anything but the first one.</li>
            <li>But brushes are easy to purchase and very reasonable on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>This is such an amazing toothbrush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time for me to try a Phillips, and i must say: I love it&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you have used the Philips Sonicare Elite series before, you&#x27;re already familiar with this brush.</li>
            <li>It holds the charge for a long time which is great.  </li>
            <li>but I like it better than my first.  </li>
            <li>First time owner of an electric toothbrush &amp; I can&#x27;t believe I went these many years w/o one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend keeping it fully charged as there is a significant difference in power and effectiveness between &amp;#34;just charged&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;charged a couple weeks ago&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have been using my Sonicare for over a year and am as satisfied now as when it first arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the different cleaning modes and the Healthy &amp; White mode is awesome</li>
            <li>bought this originally for my wife, who did not like it.</li>
            <li>If you are a regular, healthy individual, this one works excellent -no</li>
            <li>I also liked the new design and whitening feature of this Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>it were nice as was the ability to get new ones.</li>
            <li>He loves how clean his teeth feel after using it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that they are whiter, but immediately after the brushing they look whiter, and feel dentist clean.  </li>
            <li>The one drawback is that if I choose to turn the toothbrush on to clean my tongue, after the brush has completed it&#x27;s rotation through my teeth, I must turn the brush off 3 times before it goes off.</li>
            <li>You get that clean, just-from-the-dentist feeling every time you brush.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super smooth against my tongue and they do seem noticeably whiter.  </li>
            <li>my teeth havent been this clean in years.  </li>
            <li>feel clean again.  </li>
            <li>It gives you that &#x27;just got out of the dentist&#x27; clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Philips claims by using the \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; mode, you&#x27;re guaranteed to have your teeth two shades whiter in two weeks.</li>
            <li>Clean Feel:  </li>
            <li>, i.e. the surfaces of my teeth feel just as clean after the Oral B cleaning than after using the Sonicare.     </li>
            <li>clean.</li>
            <li>There would be two reasons to buy this toothbrush: to clean your teeth and/or to whiten them.  </li>
            <li>As for the cleaning, my teeth haven&#x27;t felt as clean after using this before anything aside from a dentist visit and it even come close to that.  </li>
            <li>My teeth had never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li>After using the tooth brush for the 2 minutes or so, I feel like my teeth are quite clean.</li>
            <li>I feel an all day clean from my teeth to my gums.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean afterward</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powered handle has three brushing modes, \\&quot;Clean\\&quot;, \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this new version every bit as good as the &#x27;Elite&#x27; brush, but it really is better!  </li>
            <li>I ordered the HealthyWhite after reading so many positive reviews about the cleanliness issue (the Elites get gunky around the connection).  </li>
            <li>am surprised more people have not had this experience!</li>
            <li>I have had many electric rotary toothbrushes but this sonic action is in a class of it&#x27;s own when it comes to really cleaning teeth to free them of all food particles.</li>
            <li>I have been using the full clean and whitening setting for over a week</li>
            <li>I like the small brush head, which I&#x27;d think would be ideal for children, the replacement brush heads are very reasonably priced and my teeth genuinely feel very clean</li>
            <li>If price is, youâll probably get just as good a clean from one of the lesser, cheaper models.</li>
            <li>They also clean better because this difference in mechanics allows the sonicare toothbrush heads to be shaped in a way that it&#x27;s much easier to reach the spaces between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Been two weeks of daily usage, teeth look and feel good.</li>
            <li>These were the old, rotating kind.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare is superb at cleaning gums, between teeth and removing the accumulated plaque and grunge that anyone who eats is forced to deal with.</li>
            <li>Since the whole system is called \\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li>and it is more gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full capacity.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>more than anything, this cleans your teeth really well.</li>
            <li>Much better brushing, easier to fit in the mouth, and the 30 second beep helps to distribute the time better and keeps the mind from wandering.</li>
            <li>For the month before I bought a replacement, I was using a hand-held brush, and thought I was doing a good job.  </li>
            <li>3 years is not bad for something you use every day, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The design and handling is good to maneuver and slim enough for an adequate grip.</li>
            <li>Also, I liked being able to use a very small amount of toothpaste for effective brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I liked being able to use a very small amount of toothpaste for effective brushing.    </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great, I can&#x27;t compare it with other electric toothbrushes because I have never owned one before</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s due to the instrument or to the time I&#x27;m investing in the process, but the result makes me happy.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve favored those because I felt they did a better job cleaning an entire tooth, and not just part of it which I feel is what rectangular brush heads tend to do (i.e. either along the gum line or more on the other end).     </li>
            <li>This Phillips Sonicare is great at removing the stuff that builds up on my teeth, but I have to be very, very careful with it so as to not irritate my gums.  </li>
            <li>I found that my breath was fresh longer and my teeth felt clean all day.</li>
            <li>My mouth and teeth have never looked and felt so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>and he makes me use a toothbrush to clean all the dirt stains in the fun house as punishment.  </li>
            <li>Instead, the main charger comes apart so you can use a more compact version when traveling.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my Sonicare Healthy White.  </li>
            <li>Seems too quick.</li>
            <li>Lucky me.</li>
            <li>It has a On the Go mode, which means it&#x27;s a quick version of the quadpacer timing for those times when you are in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>things I like better about this particular model though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it makes a tremendous difference in teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li>Love this way more than the last version I had.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has made a tremendous difference in his dental care.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves your mouth feeling clean and your teeth much whiter.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use it on tooth whitening, mainly because I do drink a lot of coffee which takes it&#x27;s toll on my front teeth.</li>
            <li>fact that I&#x27;ve been loyal for 15 years?&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Charging is quick.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it beeps to get all 4 quadrants AND the extended setting included extra time for top front and bottom front teeth.</li>
            <li>Recharge time is quick, and the charging stand also has provisions for holding two brushes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a negative thing, just interesting.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a travel case and a deluxe travel charger like most other Sonicare toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I could feel a difference the very first time that I used it.  </li>
            <li>My very first Sonicare lasted 11 years</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and one full charge will last for many brushings.</li>
            <li>What could be worth that much money, when you get the old fashioned kind at the dentist office for free with every visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a wise investment in better dental care that will pay off with fewer Dentist visits.een to the Dentist after first couple uses, and then never go back to a normal toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already had the &#x27;Sonicare Elite&#x27; toothbrush for some time now, so I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect from the new &#x27;R732&#x27;</li>
            <li>This model is easier to hold with its slimmer handle, appears to have greater charge capacity and the new toothbrush design</li>
            <li>I am exceedingly impressed with the capability, quality and power of this particular model under review; it&#x27;s cleaning power far exceeds the prior model that I owned.  </li>
            <li>To me the Sonicare is a great example of new technology improving one&#x27;s daily life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The 30 second tone is a very handy way to ensure you get a complete clean within your recommended two minutes of brushing&lt;</li>
            <li>When I first started using a power toothbrush, I found it a bit strong at first.</li>
            <li>It feels very different from the Oral B, more of a vibrating, almost tickling sensation that actually feels quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>did find the packaging to be somewhat of an impediment to removing the&lt;br /&gt;unit from its protective plastic casing, but once out, the unit felt solid and well built; it was also very straightforward and easy to figure out.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem with that, but it should be more clearly advertised.</li>
            <li>Even when I do a careful check, I can&#x27;t find any remnants after a good brushing.  </li>
            <li>I had many fewer episodes of \\&quot;seeing stars\\&quot; when inadvertantly scraping across a sensitive tooth or patch of gum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the \\&quot;precision\\&quot; brush head that they include in the package - it seems a bit superfluous to me.    </li>
            <li>So is it worth the money?  </li>
            <li>As for the brush itself, it contains a few more nice bonuses.</li>
            <li>Initially I liked it a lot and convinced multiple family members to switch to these brushes.</li>
            <li>(My husbands toothbrush is still going strong after almost 6 years and is an older model)</li>
            <li>Yes, it is pricy, but it is worth spending money for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually fun to brush my teeth</li>
            <li>This is one powerful toothbrush and our teeth</li>
            <li>motor is powerful and works well in all cleaning modes.</li>
            <li>Once you use a good electric toothbrush, there is simply no going back to a manual brush.ee better results.   </li>
            <li>so for now, my conclusion is that this seemed to have worked on the capped tooth better than on my natural teeth.</li>
            <li>so well worth the 5 minutes doing so.</li>
            <li>Since I travel, I also liked the smaller design of the newer models.</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush so far .... but did find it $40 cheaper at Walmart after I had opened and used it ....</li>
            <li>I was ashamed to smile my teeth were getting so stained.  </li>
            <li>Only one kind is offered.</li>
            <li>Product lives up to its description and features, though it wasnt clear how many brush heads came in the box.  </li>
            <li>My gum feels much better after using this model than my old one.</li>
            <li>but so far I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>While they both were solid items, they weren&#x27;t as nearly effective as the Philips Sonicare R732.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite happy with this tooth brush and would recommend it to my friends that want a well made powered tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Nearly seven years later and the on off button wore out.</li>
            <li>Works the same as my old one, which is great.  </li>
            <li>But the final difference, and the most important, is that using the Sonicare leaves teeth feeling noticeably</li>
            <li>Had the toothbrush for 2-3 weeks now, and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The feel of the vibrating ultrasonic brushes is about the same, but having a choice is a nice option.  </li>
            <li>when I think of the money I have saved at the dentist, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The replacement was very easy and Philips sent the new model without much hassle.  </li>
            <li>This new head design is so much better than the older model because it is a lot easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>I have a really strong gag reflex and have issues using a normal toothbrush, I do not have any problems with this thing.</li>
            <li>I like the smaller brush head and the product itself is outstanding in helping me achieve clean teeth.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommends both as good and does not have a preference for one over the other.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this on sale because I thought the other functions would be good to use.</li>
            <li>so I know I&#x27;m doing the right amount.</li>
            <li>Sonicare method centers around getting you to spend the right amount of time on brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>It also makes my teeth feel very clean--nearly dentist clean with flossing.</li>
            <li>First, the travel case and smaller travel charger are a nice touch.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to keep clean also.</li>
            <li>The brushing action of this premium sonicare is fine, but not any better than the far cheaper single-mode version of this</li>
            <li>It would also sell more units, and better to sell at half the price and keep the customer.  </li>
            <li>Apparently there is a way to pause the unit, although I have not been able to master it&#x27;s function.</li>
            <li>As usual I am also happy with Amazon&#x27;s service and shipment of anything that I order from their website.  </li>
            <li>We had an old one that we had used for so many years that we could no longer buy brush replacements to fit, but we are not complaining because it really is old.</li>
            <li>First, the reviewers that stated your teeth feel fresh from the dentist are not kidding.  </li>
            <li>I made a long research before buying that particular brush and it seems i&#x27;ve made a good choice.</li>
            <li>The charge light is just right ( not annoying like my former brush. )</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing other than a longer timer!&lt;br /&gt;You could easily just start the quadrant timer all over again if you wanted more brushing time and stop it when you&#x27;ve had enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few more days went by, my teeth stayed with that smooth clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare is easy on sensitive teeth as well.</li>
            <li>Let the brush do the work and after a week or so your gums will become acclimated to the more intense cleaning action.</li>
            <li>Let the brush do the work and after a week or so your gums will become acclimated to the more intense cleaning action.</li>
            <li>I love how much easier this one is to clean than the last one</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and not too loud.</li>
            <li>It makes your teeth feel super clean; has several different settings; and is EASY to clean and keep clean.  </li>
            <li>While the price on these seems high to me (about what a DVD player might be), it will probably - and I&#x27;m not being facetious here - save its cost in great dental check-ups, the prevention of cavities and the excruciating pain-in-the-butt of lengthy cleanings, as previous Sonicare toothbrushes have.  </li>
            <li>Kids may enjoy this due to the electronic aspect, beeps and tech feel, which in turn will promote better brushing habits.  </li>

            <li>so far, mine has worked just fine since AUG 2012.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m fairly happy with the unit, but I&#x27;m hoping that the battery does not crap out prematurely, as has happened with the previous Sonicares I have owned.  </li>

            <li>Whatever \\&quot;superior clean\\&quot; this gives is not worth the risk of damaging teeth!</li>
            <li>The bristles really move with \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; speed and give your teeth an intense power clean.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to knock the brush off of the stand and the extra wand really doesn&#x27;t want to stay put either.</li>
            <li>It comes in a hard case with space for the body of the brush and two brush heads, which is great for traveling.  </li>
            <li>addition, you get a hard case with the HX6732, which is great if you travel.  </li>
            <li>It claims to have a whitening technology by using a special brush vibration at the end of the normal teeth cleaning cycle</li>
            <li>Philips was very good about replacing the brush handle and told me they would send me a replacement handle under the warranty and that I should send back the old one in the same box with the UPS label provided.  </li>
            <li>I suggest the Healthy White.</li>
            <li>this toothbrush arrived timely and does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>first use with my Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My gums/teeth and mouth are overall getting better with each visit.</li>
            <li>My gums/teeth and mouth are overall getting better with each visit.</li>
            <li>For those who find it difficult to floss, as I do, it will come as welcome news that the Sonicare is quite good at acting as a \\&quot;super-flosser\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Maybe because it&#x27;s at a higher intensity.  </li>
            <li>It is my first electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>noticed it&#x27;s cleaning from the first 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>First of all, price.  </li>
            <li>When I spend $80.00 to $100.00 or $40.00 on a battery operated one I expect it to last more than one year.</li>
            <li>After all, if you&#x27;re going to spend this much money on a tooth brush, you don&#x27;t want it breaking in your suit case!    </li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare - I&#x27;ve been using a Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrush.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another consideration is that these are almost the most expensive electric toothbrushes on the market, but worth it if you value good dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>Love the 30 second timer for each quadrant while brushing.</li>
            <li>My first week of usage I could feel the difference.</li>
            <li>if you have teeth that are stained from coffee, red wine, or tobacco, you will probably see better results.  </li>
            <li>one is recommended for the couple that smokes and/or drinks coffee, tea or red wine together, to make sure they stay together with white and healthy smiles.  </li>
            <li>I do think the extra attention is almost sure to result in whiter teeth.     </li>
            <li>I personally prefer that the brush does not auto-shut off, so I like the Oral B better here, but this is just a preference of mine...    </li>
            <li>But because I feel that the brush head of the Sonicare is overall doing a better job and is gentler, I am giving my vote to it.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey BUT very well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have now used this product, Sonicare Healthy White, for over one month.</li>
            <li>but I have yet to experience this first hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have been flakey in consistently using it.  </li>
            <li>this was our first porew toothbrush purchase.</li>
            <li>and they are aware of the problem</li>
            <li>This review is for my Philips Sonicare Healthy White.</li>
            <li>This is not my first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first one</li>
            <li>I had to wait for the gums to heal before I could use it again, but I knew better how to use it the 2nd time.  </li>
            <li>Solid build, long  battery charge and cleans great.</li>
            <li>am not a careless person.</li>
            <li>but with the very slightest contact of my front tooth onto the shaft, another \\&quot;bzzz\\&quot; and some of my tooth was clipped away!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This happened to me on one more occasion, bringing me a total of three chipped teeth in my mouth!</li>
            <li>And believe me, after the first time, I was hyper-cautious -</li>
            <li>Now, I was aware of this fact before using it-</li>
            <li>The first one sent to me was defective, but Amazon promptly sent a replacement.  </li>
            <li>The second time around, I am extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>Even after the first brush, there was a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>My first experience with an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I do floss 6 out of 7 days a week but this electric brush will get better results) in addition to the overall cleaning of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(this is my logical theory)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I understood the value of the Sonicare system after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I finally purchased an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric tooth brush I have owned</li>
            <li>I have used a sonicare since they first came out</li>
            <li>This was an upgrade to my first electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I recommend reading the enclosed literature as you charge this for your first use.  </li>
            <li>it has definitely cleaned my teeth better and helping with the whitening</li>
            <li>I still want to push the brush back and forth :)</li>
            <li>I love the smaller size of this one!!!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because brushing my teeth properly using a normal toothbrush was not that effective for me.</li>
            <li>many of the reviews here state that the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; option differs only from the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; option in terms of length (with the whitening option adding an additional 30 seconds).  </li>
            <li>I really would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>The first time, the handle would just not turn on.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Phillips and they were aware of the problem and were willing to replace it if the brush fell under the two year warranty.  </li>
            <li>and I will give a higher rating</li>
            <li>It also stays charged for a lengthy period of time (more so that the Oral B one I had last).</li>
            <li>bought the Sonicare Healthy White R732 because it was $70 as a Deal of the Day, saving about $50.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After 16 months of use, the part on the top of the Healthywhite brush handle where the toothbrushes attach by sliding the toothbrush on broke (it wiggles back and forth)</li>
            <li>But given the durability I have found, I think I would still buy the basic model with the e-series brush until Sonicare comes up with a better way to attach the brushes on their newer models.  </li>
            <li>I specifically wanted to buy a Sonicare tooth brush because I started using my boyfriend&#x27;s Sonicare Elite a few months ago and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>This additional time will help clean coffee, tea, tobacco and other stains from your most visible teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean and White (Clean mode plus 30 seconds for whitening your front teeth)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Easy, simple, and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Much easier to clean because there&#x27;s no buildup like in the older designs.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean afterwards, i dont think i can go back to the regular kind after having this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Unless there&#x27;s been some kind of redesign recently that has affected my brush, I&#x27;m surprised so many people think they&#x27;re the same thing.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the brush heads are fairly inexpensive as compared to some of the other brands, (particularly the Ultreo) which is a real selling point and advantage to me.       </li>
            <li>I had to get a new one quick.  </li>
            <li>and it has a charger built into the stand&lt;br /&gt;- 3 Modes: Clean, Sensitive Teeth and</li>
            <li>This latest, however, is much better from a a number of factors, not the least of which is the cleanliness of toothbrush attachment to the handle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good toothbrush, but the only whitening benefit you get from this is from running it an extra 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>so it fails in that; however as a power toothbrush, you can&#x27;t do better than a Philips Sonicare so on that point alone, it succeeds.  </li>
            <li>Once you use a good electric toothbrush, there is simply no going back to a manual brush.</li>
            <li>Overall, my initial impression of this product is good...</li>
            <li>Sadly, although a great power toothbrush that certainly does a better job of cleaning your teeth than a manual type or even a regular cheap battery toothbrush, I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in the color of my teeth after over two weeks&#x27; use.  </li>
            <li>(not sure how many \\&quot;shades\\&quot; worth) and left them feeling nice.</li>
            <li>so it is to long to be able to return it.  </li>
            <li>I have had electric toothbrushes before, but this one is pretty intense.  </li>
            <li>each, so you&#x27;d better to prepare a long term investment.</li>
            <li>So much better than a manual brush, and the charge lasts up to two weeks, depending on how long you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s why: first, it stays charged much longer.  </li>
            <li>To help in the acclimation process, the toothbrush has a built-in \\&quot;easy-start\\&quot; mode, which gradually increases intensity with repeated usage, until the full action is attained.</li>

            <li>You need to press the start button to turn the motor on, then press it two more times (Clean &gt; Sensitive &gt; Clean and White), and if you have toothpaste on the brush head, it WILL vibrate off instantly.</li>

            <li>I feel that it more thoroughly cleans my teeth, particularly at the gum line, then I could ever do with the traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>new Sonicare has a smaller diameter handle that feels very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>so you have a 30 second period of brushing for each quadrant of your mouth, cool!  </li>
            <li>The right toothpaste or a whitening chemical agent is really the main thing that can help whiten your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Along the same lines, another reviewer mentioned that it&#x27;s easy to knock the brush off the charger.</li>
            <li>I have a super sensitive mouth</li>
            <li>It is August year and a half after purchase and the brush doesn&#x27;t switch modes now, turns on and off on its own.</li>
            <li>Much better than my Oral B, although I keep both and alternate between them as they clean differently.  </li>
            <li>I often get complimented at the dentist by hygentist about how nice my teeth are (odd, I know).  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to swap out the different brush heads</li>
            <li>After using this toothbrush my dental health went up because it makes it so easy to properly brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>It seems to add a different sort of motion on top of the vibration of the clean option, or maybe it just moves faster, but in any case something different happens during the whitening option.  </li>
            <li>I started using it, it felt funny the first couple of days, but then it seemed perfectly normal.</li>
            <li>It comes with a travel box, which i guess is useful, but i must admit not for the kind of travels i usually go to.</li>
            <li>Given my positive experience with this toothbrush, I ordered the newer Healthywhite version, primarily because it looked like a more advanced model and used the new pro results toothbrushes which cost less than the e-series brushes (presumably because they do not have the plastic screw-on attachment head to the brush handle so 3 cost of these cost the same as 2 e-series</li>
            <li>brush has multiple settings, but I found the general cleaning setting most useful.  </li>
            <li>The heads need to be replaced every few months and are pretty affordable, I am happy I made the switch, now 1 year later, the novelty has not worn off, nor have the results.</li>
            <li>As stated in the product info, this new brush is for \\&quot;healthy whitening\\&quot;, and with myself being not only a smoker, but a coffee drinker</li>
            <li>Then the screw that holds the top piece that the tooth brush fits over vibrates itself loose and the toothbrush no longer works.</li>
            <li>so I recommend starting with the clean setting only to get used to the powerful brushing that you will inevitably get from this amazing toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that my teeth seem to retain the clean, fresh brushed feeling most of the day, something I never noticed with the other brushes.      </li>
            <li>This comes with a little travel thing, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the price of replacement brush heads can be quite high, the price of dental repair can be much higher, not to mention the \\&quot;cost\\&quot; of dental discomfort.</li>

            <li>Switching from a regular toothbrush to this one made a huge difference, my gums are much healthier now.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for having my receipt so easily available to make this situation simple to rectify!</li>
            <li>it really deserves a 5 star.  </li>
            <li>My gums are much tighter as well.</li>
            <li>However, I prefer to charge my toothbrush once a week and keep the base/charger off the counter altogether, so this really isn&#x27;t an issue for me either.</li>
            <li>Really get a sense of cleanliness.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t really curse, but she stared at my teeth and said, \\&quot;That thing is f----- amazing!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>However, he has been using it for over 2 months with whitening tooth paste and haven&#x27;t really seen a difference.</li>
            <li>what to add that others didn&#x27;t say yet...not much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The whole family can share one handle and just buy heads.  </li>
            <li>Much, much nicer in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so haven&#x27;t seen too much difference, but it may take a bit longer to see a difference.  </li>
            <li>It breaks you in gently to the sonic cleaning experience</li>
            <li>This can come from applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li>This can come from applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li>While it is supposed to be a whitening toothbrush, I don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in that department.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to feel</li>
            <li>as I couldn&#x27;t imagine that there could&#x27;ve been that much of an improvement.  </li>
            <li>It really tickles on your teeth &amp; used to make me kinda nausious (not to say the brush will make everyone nausited</li>
            <li>This toothbrush makes a sound every 30 seconds to prompt you to move your toothbrush to a different quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>the brush heads arenât much cheaper</li>
            <li>Or, go with the Diamondclean which runs quieter, doesnât vibrate as much as this unit and just looks cooler.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed much change.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush</li>
            <li>I had used a competitor&#x27;s brush for a couple years and it really was not the same.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>My dentist measures my gum recession and says that my gums are much healthier now.</li>
            <li>I find that the Sonicare cleans my teeth much cleaner for this reason.</li>
            <li>I was not moving the brush in a swift or fast motion  when it happened, yet-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Our teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>A fantastic purchase, don&#x27;t know how I ever used a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My dentist cleanings are so fast, and no cavities since I have been brushing with Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re faithful in using this product, along with flossing &amp; mouthwash (i would recommend both) then you shouldn&#x27;t get cavities which can become root canals (more pain &amp; money) and the money spent for the head replacements should be cheaper than paying a dentist to fix any cavities.</li>
            <li>This sonicare works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very quite brush.</li>
            <li>I called Philips and they were very helpful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been Real, Philips.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the memories.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who wants to have that \\&quot;Just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist\\</li>
            <li>Its made a real difference</li>
            <li>and I really like this style.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>Bacteria won&#x27;t build up much since you need to be changing the brush head</li>
            <li>After even a couple of days the Oral-B would start spinning slower, the timer would go much longer than 2 minutes, and it basically needed to stay on the charger at all times to be functional.  </li>
            <li>so the whole handle would need to be rinsed.  </li>
            <li>Our teeth feel so much cleaner and are already whiter.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush and to keep it short and sweet....</li>
            <li>I EVER SURPRISED!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty new experience for me</li>
            <li>My son said right away that he had tried it and his teeth are too sensitive for it</li>
            <li>had other sonic care, but really love this one, makes you feel like you have come straight from the dentist ever time you use it</li>
            <li>Also, there is a certain amount of vibration with this model vs the older ones I had.  </li>
            <li>The Philips rep told me they would only replace within the Warranty of the original toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and my teeth feel so fresh and so clean!  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for twenty years and can never get enough of the clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>and did not get the same clean feeling or whiteness as with the Sonicare series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, whitening mode an additional 30 seconds of cleaning of the front visible teeth after you&#x27;ve done the initial 2 minute Clean mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare toothbrush range utilises ultrasonic cleaning (as used in hospital sterile service units to clean the gunk off surgical instruments) in addition to the physical vibration of the bristles on the teeth.</li>
            <li>I use the clean and white mode because I want those whiter teeth it promises.    </li>
            <li>The Sonicare HW promises whiter teeth after two weeks of continuous use of the Clean &amp; White mode, which is what I did.</li>
            <li>Where they differ: The Sonicare HW stops brushing altogether after that time (or, in case of the Clean &amp; White mode, after two additional rounds of 15 seconds each for the front teeth), whereas the Oral B keeps going.</li>
            <li>It is a great size - not too big and not too small.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel extra clean and shiny after use.</li>
            <li>dentist recommended a Sonicare to help keep my gums clean and low</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the last one, though this one seems easier to clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anyone, if asked, would say that they wanted their teeth clean but not white, which is what you get with one button</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and look so white and shiny.</li>
            <li>clean teeth feeling every time I brushed.  </li>
            <li>If this is your first electric toothbrush beware that the vibrating sensation can be overwhelming the first day or two, but I promise after the initial shock of the new vibrating sensation it stops feeling strange at all.  </li>
            <li>The compact brush is more maneuverable, and better for getting at some hard to reach areas, like the back teeth.  </li>
            <li>so I am not sure if it is whitening my teeth yet, but the feel of the toothbrush is amazing.  </li>
            <li>had the old style with the larger head; the unit has worked fine for 5-6 years.</li>
            <li>The old model still worked fine after four years; my hope is that this one will have similar reliability.</li>
            <li>am giving the Philips quality control ZERO stars, Amazon - 5 stars, and the toothbrush - 5 stars (it cleans indeed better that anything I tried before), so, (0+5+5)/3&#x3D;3.3&lt;br /&gt;Rounding down to 3.</li>
            <li>I finally traded up to the new small design; it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Have a saw handy, or some other super sharp object.</li>
            <li>I really like the new style of brush heads (\\&quot;Pro\\&quot; they&#x27;re calling them now)</li>
            <li>Better than previous sonicares.  </li>
            <li>All that said, I&#x27;ve used the toothbrush without charging for a week and a half, so I doubt most people will ever need to take the charger with them.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I decided to upgrade was because the replacement brush heads for the Elite series cost so much more than the newer model brush heads, so I figured I&#x27;d actually save money this way.</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace an older model.</li>
            <li>The extra handle means both you and your partner can use it, charging it alternately in the charger, which makes it a better bargain.</li>
            <li>Your teeth will seriously never feel cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Considering you could spend (with insurance ) $100 for a simple filling, this is a worthy investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just replaced an older model Sonicaire toothbrush with this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>We had an older Sonicare brush and compared to this model it was clunky.</li>
            <li>Battery last at least 2 weeks without recharging making it great for travel.</li>
            <li>But: I believe that the Sonicare HW does a significantly better job with removing plaque and sometimes food particles (sorry, but this is just a fact of life :-))</li>
            <li>When my last one was slowly dying, I bought this model because it was on a great deal of the day sale.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one as a replacement to an older model.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The older E series also collected a lot of gunk between the brush head and the electrical unit.</li>
            <li>Reading some of the reviews I was hesitant to purchase this particular model.  </li>
            <li>I had an older model and decided to update.  </li>
            <li>Based on my experience, if I were buying a Sonicare toothbrush now, I would buy the older model one that has the e-series toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Philips first thought it was a charger problem and sent me a new charger, but then the new charger didn&#x27;t charge the toothbrush so they have sent me a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I wish I had bought the new R732 sooner; light weight with the same power; just the right amount of options without overkill like the R900 series and not enough like the R710.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>etc - which in the long run proved to be not as good and more expensive and environmentally unfriendly as they eat up AA</li>
            <li>prior Sonicare was an older version of the more expensive HX6911, and I have to say that I think the HX6732 is far superior.  </li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this product to everybody.</li>
            <li>For those of you, who have never used a Sonicare toothbrush, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, and also bought units for my wife and daughters.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I wanted one that had storage placement for two heads and that had high ratings.  </li>
            <li>But THE reason I paid the high price, instead of buying a cheaper option with disposable batteries, is RECHARGEABILITY.  </li>
            <li>(so much easier) and the prior versions were able to be used in the shower, and with this model I am not sure whether that still holds true.  </li>
            <li>But my teeth feel clean all day long - even when it&#x27;s time to brush again -</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve been using it every other night and the results are pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the two other settings, Sensitive (for the gumline) and CleanWhite for my bottom and top teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little more used to it now.</li>
            <li>An electric toothbrush takes a little more time and effort.  </li>
            <li>It claims to whiten two shades in two weeks, and I am expecting that it&#x27;s fairly accurate, especially if you are a nicotine addict or major coffee drinker etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve not used an electric toothbrush before, you&#x27;ll be surprised by how intense it can feel.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t guess as to how much whiter they are, but I can clearly see an improvement.</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference between this one and the old Oral B I had had for 10 years.</li>
            <li>The three modes are practical and useful when you might need that extra care.  </li>
            <li>Looking at it that way, I don&#x27;t know why anyone would use a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>just a few things I think could be better.</li>
            <li>I had one of these a few years ago and the battery went out after many years.</li>
            <li>As far as the healthy white aspect of it, it just brushes your front teeth for 30 extra seconds at the end, so</li>
            <li>overall good quality, slightly larger than I expected.</li>
            <li>Normally.</li>
            <li>I always do an upgrade when replacing older models but this one blew my old Sonic toothbrush away!</li>
            <li>There are three cleaning modes, \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; which is the standard two minute brushing mode, \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; for people who have sensitive gums (this mode may also be useful if you&#x27;re new to electric toothbrushes and want to start out with a gentler cleaning cylce at first), and \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; which adds an extra thirty seconds to the standard \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode so you can focus on the front teeth.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare R732 generally does a decent job of cleaning, and really stimulates the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once charged, I use it essentially like an ordinary toothbrush but with far superior results.</li>
            <li>and if I and feeling too much pain from the normal setting, there is a soft pulsating sensitive teeth setting.  </li>
            <li>Purchased a new battery operated one.</li>
            <li>(There&#x27;s almost no difference that I can detect between the cleaning power of his tooth brush and my new one.)  </li>
            <li>But in spite of all that, I think this is my new electric toothbrush of choice - it works well and</li>
            <li>They immediately told me it was gone and no longer under warranty, so I could have 15% off a new brush from their website.</li>
            <li>With my new HealthyWhite model I get all of that plus a bonus whitening option and a \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; design.    </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve now had them for almost two years and they still work like new.  </li>
            <li>Well, not the new but refurbished one.</li>
            <li>Boy, did I ever need a new toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I received the new one, and tried it out, I was amazed at the improvement in the teeth cleaning process.  </li>
            <li>As a result, the new model is not my backup.....</li>
            <li>You will realize a new way of brushing and see and feel it in the results.  </li>
            <li>now I need to spend another $100 on a new one.  </li>
            <li>Replaced a new brush head on the handle but still not work.</li>
            <li>Granted it may have be slight change after each cleaning and maybe I should have taken before and after pictures to get a better idea of how much whiter they actually are.  </li>
            <li>It has a distinct vibrating feeling that can sometimes feel uncomfortable around the gumline, but definitely the most clean feeling I&#x27;ve had on my teeth at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is both subtle and effective.  </li>
            <li>You feel like you have been to the Dentist after first couple uses, and then never go back to a normal toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li>So far a few of my freinds also say the ORAL B works better and seems sturdier then this SONICARE.</li>
            <li>Like the last Sonicare that I owned, this toothbrush does a fantastic job cleaning my teeth, and it does it in only 3 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li>The first one I owned, which had screw-on e-series toothbrushes and the quadpacer feature (don&#x27;t know model number), was very durable and lasted so long</li>
            <li>This is kind of a clever idea, but not entirely successful, as all of the cord can be accommodated.  </li>
            <li>This is kind of a clever idea, but not entirely successful, as all of the cord can be accommodated.  </li>
            <li>My last cleaning was very intense at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My gums are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>My old sonicare died, yea it was old!!  </li>
            <li>Might I also point out that I am only 22 years old, and do not suffer from weak or brittle teeth that can sometimes come from old age and make teeth more prone to chipping easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it is electric it requires a charging, but one overnight charge lasted me over a week of twice daily brushing, so the battery is pretty hardy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since it is electric it requires a charging, but one overnight charge lasted me over a week of twice daily brushing, so the battery is pretty hardy.      </li>
            <li>as a red wine drinker I&#x27;ll be interested to see if it does keep my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li>As of this point (not sure about the battery life), the Philips is 110% better than the oral-B.  </li>
            <li>The small charging stand can have its cord wrapped inside to make it even more compact.</li>
            <li>The first difference I noticed was that the shape of the included brush heads was rectangular like a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Both systems have \\&quot;quadrant notifications\\&quot;, i.e. the system makes the user aware to switch to a different section (quadarant) of their mouth after 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>The damage left is something I now see every day and feel stressed about every day (the damage on the tooth supporting my bridge,</li>
            <li>No more mold buildup under cap as they redesigned the top and brush connection.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time she is moving from a regular brush to an electric one.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the smaller handle of this brush over the larger one I had.  </li>
            <li>It can brush way better than what I could have done with a regular toothbrush in hard to reach places (in the right way).</li>
            <li>As to my love for the new \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; design, if you also have an older model, you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t have any use for the extra features (clean and white)</li>
            <li>With this model, I&#x27;m  reminded to give an extra 30 seconds attention to my visible front teeth when I select the optional clean and white mode.</li>
            <li>HealthyWhite toothbrush has a Clean and White mode, which adds two additional 15-second timer periods, during which you should give additional brushing time to your front teeth, upper and lower.</li>
            <li>handle has a light that indicates when the battery is running down, and needs to be charged.  </li>
            <li>- they&#x27;re a little bit slimmer over-all than the older style brush heads, but the bristle portion is actually bigger, so it covers more tooth area at a time.</li>
            <li>I was young, maybe 10 or 11, my parent&#x27;s received some advice from our family dentist that these new electric toothbrushes were the thing to use to protect your teeth.  </li>
            <li>A huge improvement over previous models I have owned.</li>
            <li>The general cleaning setting leave my mouth feeling fresh and tingly, similar to after a visit to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Smokers and coffee drinkers would have the most white to gain, and not the average user.  </li>
            <li>My gums (behind my top teeth) were a bit &amp;#34;ticklish&amp;#34; to it at first</li>
            <li>The price I paid for it on Amazon was only average, but OK.</li>
            <li>So I read up on all the Philips models (and a few non-Philips models, too, like Oral B and Water Pik) and chose the Healthy White mainly for the Sensitive cleaning option.  </li>
            <li>(There&#x27;s also the regular two-minute clean mode if you don&#x27;t have an extra 30 seconds to spare, and the sensitive option for those with sensitive teeth.)</li>
            <li>this just proves how dangerous this could be, and are most people really that cautious when they brush their teeth?!</li>
            <li>The second button was precisely positioned on the handle so that I always accidentally pushed it once or twice while brushing my teeth causing me to have to keep pushing it to rotate it through the various modes to get back to normal mode.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for extra whitening action and can give another 30 sec to your brushing routine, the R732 makes it easy for you.</li>
            <li>It is my first quality electric tooth brush, although I have had other very inexpensive models</li>
            <li>all with different pulses and locations to brush at certain intervals.  </li>
            <li>I had chipped a large corner of my upper canine tooth away!</li>
            <li>There are two prongs on the back of the charger for the brush heads, which are a little more sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I also chose the Healthy White because I didn&#x27;t care about the little UV cleaning things.  </li>
            <li>My Oral B toothbrush lasted significantly longer and cost less.</li>
            <li>I just purchased two of these at once - one was fine, the other one was dis-balanced - was vibrating so hard that literally jumped of hands, was making loud screeching noise, and had some dirt marks on it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon - just got a replacement, better, but when I put a good one from the original order and the replacement one next to each other and turn them on in the same operating mode with the same type of head attached - they make different noises, one is a way louder than the other one, and tone and strength of vibration are different too.&lt;br /&gt;Where is manufacturer&#x27;s quality control?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in the health of your teeth and gums, in my humble opinion.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that is really anything but a gimmick, but I do like the sensitive versus regular option.  </li>
            <li>I assume that is what is making the loud noise.  </li>
            <li>was a dreaded time when it came to using my old standby manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is gentle on my gums and gets my teeth really white.</li>
            <li>With the Sonicare, it oscillates back and forth, mimicking real tooth brushing motion.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, when you brush your teeth, it feels like you&#x27;ve just had a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Overall this doesn&#x27;t seem any better than the basic Sonicare, but it&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
            <li>I really believe it is the only way I will brush my teeth for two minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>and she always waits until timer is complete.</li>
            <li>We have decided to replace our Sonicare every 3 years just so we don&#x27;t end up with a flaccid brushing experience like we did with the old one.</li>
            <li>I had an electric toothbrush (an old Philips sonicare)</li>
            <li>It seems in order to really tell one would need a color chart from the dentist and see if there is an actual change or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>direct comparisson to this one.</li>
            <li>I do not like the power button (a soft button).  </li>
            <li>There is also a sensitive mode, with a permanently reduced intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is also a sensitive mode, with a permanently reduced intensity.    </li>
            <li>I was used to it within a couple days with my old &#x27;Elite&#x27; &amp; didn&#x27;t have any problems at all with this</li>
            <li>My capped front tooth became quite sensitive so that I switched to using the Sensitive mode.</li>
            <li>I do attribute this to the Sonicare because this is not an old crown and I have not had any problems when using my Oral-B on it.</li>
            <li>Bought this product as a replacement for my old Sonicare...</li>
            <li>I used an old fashioned toothbrush and just did not feel that it did the job of my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Philips Sonicare for myself as well as one for my then 10 year old son.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Sonicare to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>I will never use an electric toothbrush again in my life, especially sonic, thanks to my experience with this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush to replace an old one that was about 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>I knew that regular flossing wasn&#x27;t going to happen, no matter how much they cajoled me.  </li>
            <li>After a year, my dentist also said that my gum health was markedly improved (and stopped threatening me with horror stories of gingivitis and tooth decay).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The old sonicare had two buttons.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old unit, one of the oldest Sonicare models, with this unit.  </li>
            <li>or it might splash tooth paste on your clothes, something a Braun tooth brush never did as far as I recall.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery life is pretty long.</li>
            <li>So if you want to take the charger with you, you either need to take the whole thing, or take it apart, unwrap the cord and take just the smaller travel charger.  </li>
            <li>When my old brush wore out (after 15+ years), I decided to try this Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>The whitening option vibrates in a different pattern from the cleaning option -- this is obvious from the different sound the two options make, as well as how the brush feels on your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was beginning to find it difficult to locate good replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li>A timer is incorporated which issues an audible signal every 30 seconds, repeated four times to ensure upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right areas are cleaned</li>
            <li>Without the crevices and cavities of previous models, this design is always clean and fresh with no more effort than the simple rinse with hot water that you would normally give a manual brush after use.</li>
            <li>The charger is small and lets you easily wind up the cord and toss it in a toiletry bag.</li>
            <li>Though the UV lamp that comes in other other more expensive products seem attractive, I don&#x27;t think it is necessary.</li>
            <li>product is great for small mouths, hard to reach areas/crevices and for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you are a backpacker, the last thing you want to take with you is a bulky unnecessarily big plastic box which will take up a lot of space and in the same time not offer any special functionality.</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff to clean my teeth but gentle enough to get into the gums w/o causing bleeding.</li>
            <li>While the Oral-B electric toothbrushes&#x27; round heads &#x27;shake&#x27; in relatively large, circular motions, the Sonicare toothbrushes &#x27;vibrate&#x27; at a much higher frequency.</li>
            <li>Only charge it when the light turns orange/red showing low power, this will save the rechargeable battery life by a long shot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to brush your back teeth than with a normal toothbrush, the timer even times you by beeping after every 30 seconds for each quadrant and an extra 30 seconds for whitening.</li>
            <li>It is not worth spending more than this as the ones above still have the Health White setting.</li>
            <li>You need to take dental hygiene more seriously.  </li>
            <li>This model is obviously not as well made as my older model so time will tell.</li>
            <li>I attribute this mainly to the shape of the brush head, which in addition to being rectangular is also raised in places, creating something like a \\&quot;wave\\&quot; pattern which enables the bristles to actually get in-between and do their job.</li>
            <li>I purchased this model to replace an older Sonicare toothbrush that I had used for several years.</li>
            <li>Since I thought that it might be on its last leg, I decided to order this model, mainly as a backup.</li>
            <li>Very much worth it especially if it lasts as long.</li>
            <li>So the brush gets one stars for being a great toothbrush,  Phillips loses four stars for building a brush designed to break just past warranty.</li>
            <li>The first two last 2 minutes, and the third runs 30 seconds longer.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers have commented, you have to push the button 3 times to put it into clean AND white mode.  </li>
            <li>It is the same high quality product I have come to expect from Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I looked thru the different reviews for Sonicare and decided to go with this one instead of the high end</li>
            <li>No way I&#x27;m going back to a normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to move or agitate the brush: just hold it to the teeth upper, lower, left, right, inside, outside then rinse when finished.</li>
            <li>You open a chat, connect to a representative who asks you couple of question and send you the new brush, if you have a problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to order a new one than shipping it back.</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive teeth and have had to use sensitive tooth paste for several years consecutively.)  </li>
            <li>and I did experience some initial tenderness (especially near the back of the teeth and along the gumlines)</li>
            <li>It also comes with two different sized brushes, a large one for general cleaning and a smaller one for \\&quot;detail\\&quot; work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It suddenly became very loud and noisy.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating brush works well for general cleaning, while the rotary type is generally better for focusing on specific hard to reach area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are 3 settings, and if you are on the first setting,  you have to go through the other 2 settings</li>
            <li>All of these times, the toothbrush had just barely came into contact with the tooth - I can tell you the contact was almost feather-light!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; basically means this mode has 30 extra seconds, nothing significant...3 modes, simple use, no complicated fragile technology.</li>
            <li>I would like to suggest that the manufacturer include with purchase a little chart showing various shades of white, along with shades of stain, so the user can easily measure progress.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately both the handle and the brushes are pretty easy to tip over.  </li>
            <li>This one is smaller than my prior brushes but appears to work just like the last which cost me nearly twice as much.</li>
            <li>(However, this additional cleaning mode seemed somewhat of a gimmick to me, since it&#x27;s no more than a longer cycle to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>thing that I feel could be improved about the product is that you&#x27;re not able to start in the \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; mode.</li>
            <li>(However, this additional cleaning mode seemed somewhat of a gimmick to me, since it&#x27;s no more than a longer cycle to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>One thing that I feel could be improved about the product is that you&#x27;re not able to start in the \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; mode.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE of this I still keep an ordinary toothbrush to clean these areas in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new [to me] charging base is a definite improvement, very easy to keep everything clean.</li>
            <li>The travel case that came with it is compact and cute (hard case, not soft).</li>
            <li>This is a minor design fault, as mentioned by another reviewer, which quickly becomes obvious (and slightly irksome) to the new user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>General:  </li>
            <li>The brush heads have small plastic covers that protects the bristles and help keep them free of external dust and debris.</li>
            <li>I got this in October and as of December I have clear visual improvements.</li>
            <li>like that it has options for sensitive and regular or whitening.</li>
            <li>I am old enough to have gum issues and using Sonicare halted degeneration and, in some cases, improved it.  </li>
            <li>My sister&#x27;s brush recently died as well at near the 2 year mark.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush offers the quality of a Sonicare with the added feature of whitening (which is just a different &#x27;pulse&#x27; of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used my old toothbrush last about 4 years using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li>You can only switch between modes when the toothbrush is turned on, so if you want the Sensitive mode, you have to apply toothpaste and press the start button twice.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums, and it seems to me that the Sonicare overall was a lot gentler than the Oral B.</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that the charger is 110/240 volt as we travel internationally frequently.  </li>
            <li>This thing is *thorough* and will leave your teeth utterly and completely clean--one still needs to floss however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has modes for standard, sensitive, and whitening.  </li>
            <li>I wish and suggest that Phillips Sonicare offer an extra soft brush head for its electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>If you should choose to use one, you must be extremely careful to not touch the shaft to your teeth from any angle, and you must use the utmost care not to add much pressure to the brush as you move it along your teeth.</li>
            <li>I was starting to have issues with receding gums in my early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Recently I have developed \\&quot;carney elbow\\&quot; and needed some assistance in completing this task</li>
            <li>I used to own three oral-B sonic for eight years and two of them fail on me</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for extra whitening action and can give another 30 sec to your brushing routine, the R732 makes it easy for you.d slightly making the brush a little smaller and the brush head is easier to clean than the earlier screw-on brush heads.     </li>
            <li>Like little etches right into the surface of my enamel.</li>
            <li>so you have enough time in your brushing routine to brush your tongue and other areas of your teeth that may need a little more attention.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush has a few nice features that really set it apart from other rechargeable power toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>The first HealthyWhite died less than 1 year after purchase</li>
            <li>But I actually haven&#x27;t needed to use the Sensitive option at all; the regular brushing option (as well as the extra 30 seconds tagged on at the end to whiten teeth) hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive teeth at all.  </li>
            <li>had other makes of electric toothbrush in the past which use the word \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; in the product description but few actually employ genuine ultrasonic cleaning technology like these from Philips (the Oral B range also uses genuine ultrasonic cleaning).&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s so hard to clean.</li>
            <li>Also, I noticed when I went to the dentist for my cleaning, they did not have to work as hard to clean the teeth and gum area.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever use the gentle mode or other modes.  </li>
            <li>(I should note that this Sonicare model does not have a audible sound for each thirty-second interval like other Sonicare models, but one gets used to the pauses in the motor in lieu of the typical</li>
            <li>I bought this model over the Elite because of the negative reviews regarding keeping the Elite clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this long enough to get used to the slightly awkward tilt of the brush&#x27;s angle - which (oddly) now seems more comfortable than a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Not only are they cheaper, but they also attach to the brush differently than the old ones, so you don&#x27;t get that buildup of gunk under the brush head</li>
            <li>The white booster time is really a hype because all you have to do is turn the thing on again to run for 30 sec.</li>
            <li>I was confused by how many different Sonicare there are.</li>
            <li>One cool feature is that the brush \\&quot;pauses\\&quot; if you press it too hard against your teeth or gums.</li>
            <li>It was easy to set up, but it was a little difficult for me to learn how to \\&quot;program\\&quot; the toothbrush to the \\&quot;clean and whiten\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li>Luckily this chip was only a small groove, but is still visible to family, friends and dentist -</li>
            <li>Then again, not so much that other people would necessarily notice.</li>
            <li>I find this much easier to manuever around the back of my mouth than the other ultrasonic toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used (another Sonicare, an Ultreo and an Oral B).</li>
            <li>The small brush is not as useful.</li>
            <li>The first 30 times I used it, it took me about 4 minutes to brush my teeth while they recommend 2 minutes, and it actually shuts down after 2 minutes with 30 second warnings so you can time your brushing.</li>
            <li>The other day I had to use a regular toothbrush and it felt like each individual bristle was so large.</li>
            <li>I wish they hadn&#x27;t tried to &#x27;simplify&#x27; the design - all they succeeded in doing is making this toothbrush more inconvenient to use than older models.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel the need to bear down with too much pressure when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>It was ridiculous how clean my teeth felt, as if I just had them cleaned and polished at my dentist.</li>
            <li>I have also been using less toothpaste - it really foams it up.</li>
            <li>and apparently they now make them to last only 2 years.</li>
            <li>Then 3 of my friends, all in different social circles, who bought the Sonicare and raved about the difference.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that the pro results toothbrushes do not last as long as the old e-series ones.  </li>
            <li>Sorry, Bryan told me, the warranty was only good for the life of the original (2 years, and both toothbrushes failed within 2.5 years).  </li>
            <li>This is because the toothbrush must hit each cycle, i.e. normal, sensitive, and white before turning off--unless I&#x27;m missing something.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare works just fine, and I am using it diligently, maybe not happily.  </li>
            <li>Its first use left my gums raw in some places.  </li>
            <li>I also really appreciate the holder where I can park the toothbrush heads, the travel case, and the little caps that go over each brush head.  </li>
            <li>Power toothbrushes can be a bit large and often generic plastic travel covers do not fit over the heads, making them impractical to pack.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also this little feature on the toothbrush that really annoys the hell out of me - when you turn the toothbrush on, the program will only work in 2 minute cycles.</li>
            <li>The design of the brush head has also changed slightly making the brush a little smaller and the brush head is easier to clean than the earlier screw-on brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good cleaning but battery is so bad.</li>

            <li> They work great; even my dentist noticed a difference!  </li>
            <li> Best thing about this is the timer - tells you when you need to move the toothbrush around your mouth!</li>
            <li> Great product!  </li>
            <li> It does the best job cleaning ones teeth as well!</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s best for my teeth!</li>
            <li> The travel case is excellent and I am thankful to have it.  </li>
            <li> It is best to set it on the 2 Â½ minute setting</li>
            <li> Great product!  </li>
            <li> Every time i go in for cleaning dentist tells me how awesome my teeth are and that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad that I fell for the marketing scheme because my teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been cleaned by the dentist!!</li>
            <li> I wonder how it&#x27;d work with the Diamond head, but I&#x27;m very happy with the stock brush heads.</li>
            <li> Awesome, I thought!  </li>
            <li> In summation this is the best sonicare I&#x27;ve owned to date</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Really great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with.  </li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever bought and couldn&#x27;t imagine changing it.  </li>
            <li> This does an excellent job cleaning all our teeth (family of 4).</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these and they are great!</li>
            <li> I rated this toothbrush 3 stars because Sonicare is still the best toothbrush out there, but downgraded it because of the durability issues mentioned here.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing!!  </li>
            <li> Battery power is very good.  </li>
            <li> The Philips two-in-one design charger is also very good.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist says I do a very good job manually.  </li>
            <li> But because it is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever experienced, it gets bumped to a 4 star.</li>
            <li> All in all, great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Good product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a good toothbrush, if they would have included a couple features from the R910 it would have been perfect.</li>
            <li> Battery life is superb, and the cleaning power is exceptional.</li>
            <li> It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Also, in shipment my toothbrush never made it to me and Amazon was great about sending another one.  </li>
            <li> The triple function provides great choice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product for under $150 now on Amazon.</li>
            <li> of these are great</li>
            <li> The battery life is also great, I brought the toothbrush on a 10 day trip and didn&#x27;t have to charge it at all.   </li>
            <li> This product is great, although not</li>
            <li> I will give the Sonicare HealthyWhite Toothbrush 5 stars because it is so great on the pearly whites.  </li>
            <li> Been going great ever since.</li>
            <li> The battery is great, maintaining charge for 2+ weeks at a time (I haven&#x27;t tested it longer than that).  </li>
            <li> The electronic toothbrush is great.</li>
            <li> The product is great.</li>
            <li> Great at the beginning.</li>
            <li> and he always tells me to keep doing what I am doing because the results are great .</li>
            <li> Bought this when it was on sale at Amazon and am happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Now to the question why would you need this great customer service: I bough the brush in March and it came with 1-year warranty.</li>
            <li> feels great and cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Makes a great gift for any occasion.</li>
            <li> The three settings is a great option.</li>
            <li> so I emailed Philips and they were happy to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Great customer service.  </li>
            <li> A great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> (but he has great teeth).</li>
            <li> I am so happy I purchased this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> i look forward to using - always leaves my mouth tasting great - which i didn&#x27;t expect</li>
            <li> Great.  </li>
            <li> but my dentist still wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is a joy.  </li>
            <li> Worked great for two years and one month then it died one month beyond the warranty</li>
            <li> It worked great, and gave me a just from the dentist</li>
            <li> It was a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> happy customers</li>
            <li> Definitely happy I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what others have experienced with durability, but that is mine.  </li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m actually confident my teeth and gums feel their best ever.  </li>
            <li> The design is good and she is happy with the cleaning capability of the device.</li>
            <li> Good speed and feels very effective.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, if you&#x27;re a coffee drinker, a tobacco user or even just someone who likes a clean mouth, YOU NEED THIS BRUSH!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be good for kids too, so they&#x27;re not doing a swipe and say they&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be good for kids too, so they&#x27;re not doing a swipe and say they&#x27;re done.     </li>
            <li> I know that it sounds cliche, even trite, to say that I&#x27;ve never used a toothbrush that is as good as this one, but it is nevertheless true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good...</li>
            <li> in all this is a good investment that should be under $100.  </li>
            <li> The good thing about this one over the Elite series is that it works on 110V as well as 220V</li>
            <li> I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the setting that gradually increases the brush&#x27;s power over a period of 2 weeks to get you used to it.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> We ordered this Sonicare to replace it and it feels SO GOOD.  </li>
            <li> Had a good check-up, too.  </li>
            <li> So it is a good product,  </li>
            <li> as well you could say I&#x27;m a good judge when it comes to whitening.  </li>
            <li> It has been, after a month, almost as good as a visit to a dentist without the cost.</li>
            <li> and I got a good deal on it</li>
            <li> Does a good job at cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Our dentist also thought this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I sprung for the Sonicare, and have been delighted with the choice.  </li>
            <li> This is really a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Must admit this is superior to the orignal by a factor of three.</li>
            <li> The performance is good.</li>
            <li> good purchase.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.</li>
            <li> Price was good.</li>
            <li> This one does not do as good a job of cleaning</li>
            <li> I have used an Oral-B brush for about a year, and this product is superior.  </li>
            <li> I have used vibrating ultrasonic types like Sonicare, and the rotary type brushes like those by Oral B, and they each have good points, as well as shortcomings.  </li>
            <li> The brush does a fairly good job of cleaning, but of course supplementary cleaning, like flossing is still required.  </li>
            <li> The brush does a fairly good job of cleaning, but of course supplementary cleaning, like flossing is still required.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After two weeks of using the \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; mode, I did notice my teeth to be at best a shade whiter.</li>
            <li> Clean is the best word I can think of to describe this model&#x27;s design.</li>
            <li> I am very happy and recommended it to several people who also bought the toothbrush and are also very happy!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare line of power toothbrushes is an excellent tool for maintenance of healthy teeth and gums and this latest example adds an element of portability that lets you take it on the road in a minimum of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charged quickly and worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li> As I thought I would be, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great design, powerful, and my mouth feels GREAT afterwards!!  </li>
            <li> I have now used two electric toothbrushes, both Philips Sonicaare models and have been very pleased with each on.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Have been through 3 of them now, and my gums are healthy again and my teeth are in great shape.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product and am very glad that I bit the bullet (no pun intended) and paid $100</li>
            <li> I am exceedingly happy and satisfied with this model.  </li>
            <li> Also, I lost a cap and needed one from Philips and they wre more than happy to send me one.</li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job of cleaning - I got it right after a trip to the dentist and my teeth still feel dentist-clean.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed after the first time use.</li>
            <li> I love this one!</li>
            <li> And the customer service is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The Phillip&#x27;s Sonicare was recommended to me by my dentist and love it!</li>
            <li> Over all I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this electric toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love my Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Outstanding service!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a wise investment in better dental care that will pay off with fewer Dentist visits.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s nice to know that I have the option if I start having sensitivity problems.    </li>
            <li> The quad timer is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I liked my sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> thing that I particularly liked about the Sonicare Toothbrush is the shape of the brush head.</li>
            <li> One thing that I particularly liked about the Sonicare Toothbrush is the shape of the brush head.</li>
            <li> toothbrush comes with a nice compact case that carries the handle and two brushes.</li>
            <li> While I like this, a bonus head would&#x27;ve been nice.  </li>
            <li> I am unsure whether this is a good thing because it makes the cap stand out more.</li>
            <li> I honestly think I can go both ways - stay with my Oral B Triumph or continue using the Sonicare HW.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is a nice touch</li>
            <li> The portable travel case is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I even got my kids their own as well.</li>
            <li> And I heard that a water pick wasn&#x27;t really an effective alternative.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it took some time for me to warm up to the price tag...</li>
            <li> It seems to claim that it comes with two chargers: a travel charger and a deluxe charger.  </li>
            <li> I found good reviews of the Philips \\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li> All good :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest,</li>
            <li> Also included is a handy plastic travel case for the handle and brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also included is a handy plastic travel case for the handle and brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is awesome: quiet, very effective and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> The 3 stages it has to clean, is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use, and most importantly, does an excellent job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> The HealthyWhite brush was a great sonic toothbrush that got my teeth quite clean.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy that I upgraded to this particular model.</li>
            <li> in all, this is the best toothbrush I have ever owned, and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with its performance; it is a unique tool in our effort to achieve optimum dental care.</li>
            <li> Leaves your teeth super smooth!!!</li>
            <li> Both systems seem to do a great job at keeping teeth clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> So far I am very impressed by it.</li>
            <li> I would think Phillips would treat their customers better if they wanted to develop any kind of brand loyalty.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say for sure that I now whiter teeth</li>
            <li> So far, the best of the lot that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> And, okay, I am kind of a gadget guy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, very glad I got it and can&#x27;t wait until my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, very glad I got it and can&#x27;t wait until my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li> I spend the full 2 minutes brushing plus the whitening feature gives another 30 seconds of brushing!!  </li>
            <li> The dental hygienist was super happy to see my gums are getting healthier, when they do the measurements I&#x27;ve been getting mostly 4&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The dental hygienist was super happy to see my gums are getting healthier, when they do the measurements I&#x27;ve been getting mostly 4&#x27;s</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE my toothbrush!    </li>
            <li> This one stays clean and does a really good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> As of right now, I am more than happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> We were quite happy with the first.  </li>
            <li> This is the first sonic toothbrush I have tried and it is great.  </li>
            <li> so I am pretty happy with the way it performed and would get a Sonicare brush again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is the first problem I have experienced.  </li>
            <li> It is very light</li>
            <li> So easy to deal with, amazing customer service from Philips.  </li>
            <li> Quite a nice power toothbrush that I find easy to recommend.</li>
            <li> Also included in the box is a charger with a handy cord wrap for easy portability, a storage case for the brush heads (together with travel caps for brush head hygiene), and a travel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the toothbrush&#x27;s functionality - it works fast, charges quickly, does what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the e-series Sonicare Toothbrush for more than a year and have been very pleased with it, so I was excited to try the newest Sonicare power toothbrush with a whitening feature.  </li>
            <li> The flossing makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> The power toothbrush does a much better job of cleaning my teeth and keeping my gums healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m expecting the hygenist to be pleased w/ my teeth.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE my toothbrush!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t like the smaller \\&quot;detail\\&quot; brush, my wife has braces and finds that it is perfect for cleaning around her</li>
            <li> I am just glad that I did.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> White\\&quot;, it seems that it would make more sense for this to be the default setting.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth better</li>
            <li> and i have to restart the cycle manually once more, because as soon as 2 minutes are up</li>
            <li> What more to you want?</li>
            <li> and I still don&#x27;t like it when I accidentally touch my teeth with the plastic head moving, but I think this will keep my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Your mouth is the cause to most sickness, and gum disease is a lot more than about losing teeth.  </li>
            <li> HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush should be on the top of your list.  </li>
            <li> And if it&#x27;s a quality product, the customer will use it more than two years.  </li>
            <li> it does the job, well, and more than you would expect.  </li>
            <li> You will appreciate the brushing modes and routines, and feel confident it is doing quite a bit of work for you.  </li>
            <li> The battery operated should stay on for 2 minutes more, its more like 15 seconds and shuts off.</li>
            <li> They need to press the button many times in order to get it work.  </li>
            <li> The design of Philips is much better than oral-B.</li>
            <li> Almost no bathroom is fitted with more than one electric razor/toothbrush power socket, so buying two separate chargers will not solve this problem.</li>
            <li> but I love the Philips Sonicare R732/</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I like the Sonicare R910 better.</li>
            <li> While I still think that the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush cleans a bit better and longer than the Sonicare products, all of the Sonicare products, including the HealthyWhite Toothbrush, are top notch.  </li>
            <li> While I still think that the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush cleans a bit better and longer than the Sonicare products, all of the Sonicare products, including the HealthyWhite Toothbrush, are top notch.  </li>
            <li> With time, I may get better at it.    </li>
            <li> in many ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to do this with the toothbrush in your mouth if you don&#x27;t want toothpaste all over the bathroom mirror and sink.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amanda Richards, July 3, 2008ite and healthy smiles.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it can deal with anything but the most superficial stains.</li>
            <li> Bite the bullet &amp; buy this brush, you&#x27;ll be glad you did &amp; your mouth will thank you almost immidiately after</li>
            <li> With the Sonicare HealthyWhite, I was able to use both brush heads</li>
            <li> But I am inclined to say that this is more ad hype than anything else...    </li>
            <li> I love ultrasonic toothbrushes and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li> (most ultrasound toothbrushes do this, I&#x27;ll add) - and remain so for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> and I love the ease of use, the way it makes  my teeth feel and look.  </li>
            <li> I think my dentist is going to be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The best things in life are the simplest: the R732 is simple and effective.&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li> So pleased with this product that I bought one for my daughter and her family.  </li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get used to because it is more vigorous than I would brush myself.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had started using one of these many years ago</li>
            <li> My teeth feel and look way better.</li>
            <li> The handle is the most comfortable yet!</li>
            <li> It just feels better in one&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> I love this electric brush.</li>
            <li> I use it much more than 2 minutes.(probably 12) per brushing.  </li>
            <li> I should be able to choose the brushes I want.  </li>
            <li> I chose the HealthyWhite mostly because of the travel case.  </li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had kept my Amazon invoice and was able to tell them when I bought it and since it was under warranty, they sent me a replacement toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We love the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> This seems to me to do an even better job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you turn it off while it&#x27;s still in your mouth</li>
            <li> However, I have always just stuck to using the whatever toothbrush was on sale method for the better part of my life; until now that is.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the stronger battery power, better brushing motion or improved brush head, but this is awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> everything else is ok....</li>
            <li> Excellent product....have already seen improvement in only a week of use!</li>
            <li> Told me I had a 2 yr warranty which I wasn&#x27;t sure about.  </li>
            <li> do think the ORAL B toothbrush has more bang and just seems like a better product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have more of a plaque issue, so that may be why.  </li>
            <li> Just the fact that it makes me brush for a specific amount of time and tells me when to switch locations is priceless in my book.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy!</li>
            <li> could be an overkill for what I needed/wanted, but definitely glad that I got this one</li>
            <li> Now, consider the fact I am someone who thought the idea of paying more than $7 for a toothbrush was madness</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so she was pleased.  </li>
            <li> and I love mine, too.  </li>
            <li> The On/Off button seems to be most anyplace on the unit and not just the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; circle intended.</li>
            <li> My dentist never recommended a electronic toothbrush to me (the cleaners always said I just need to brush better and longer), but 1 day I asked about electronic toothbrushes</li>
            <li> White\\&quot; so I bought it and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> We love our Philips Sonicare HX6732/02 Rechargable Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> + every 2 years if a more reliable alternative exists.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m sure this will resolve favorably.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush keeps my pearly whites nice and clean and smooth!  </li>
            <li> I called Phillips customer service, they were very friendly and helpful.</li>
            <li> After that, my teeth just didn&#x27;t feel as clean when I used my own manual tooth brush.    </li>
            <li> And I love the way the head comes off so you can clean!  </li>
            <li> This new one is a great replacement, love the Sonicare movement.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean after using the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes since they first came out and have loved each one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty good for smokin&#x27; singles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty good for smokin&#x27; singles.        </li>
            <li> I also liked that its timer reminded me to brush the full two minutes</li>
            <li> The battery life is also supposed to be pretty good</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Sonicare power toothbrushes and think they are the best toothbrushes you can buy.  </li>
            <li> The new brush heads are great.</li>
            <li> How about make it easy for a customer and make the handle from a better material???</li>
            <li> Convenient, attractive, quiet, and so effective at what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I love my original Philips Sonicare toothbrush so was looking forward to seeing what the \\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li> but it certainly does a good job.</li>
            <li> results of modern dentistry can be impressive, but the costs of the newer dental technologies can get quite high.  </li>
            <li> results of modern dentistry can be impressive, but the costs of the newer dental technologies can get quite high.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it as a superior way to clean teeth and he was right.</li>
            <li> And while I&#x27;m a fervent changer of toothbrushes, the heads on this baby are kind of pricey, although they&#x27;re holding up pretty well after many uses.      </li>
            <li> My experience with electric tooth brushes is based mostly on lower end Braun Oral B, first the kind that took batteries then their entry level spin brush.</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than expected,  and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, we bought another just as near to it that we could find and it is great.</li>
            <li> This works great, just like my old one.  </li>
            <li> My son, being a normal boy, isn&#x27;t the greatest fan of the mundane task of brushing his teeth and tended to not do a great job with the manual brush.  </li>
            <li> (1&#x27;s are ideal, 5&#x27;s are no good), but this time, they were at mostly 2&#x27;s with a couple of 3&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> (1&#x27;s are ideal, 5&#x27;s are no good), but this time, they were at mostly 2&#x27;s with a couple of 3&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> You are not offering the kind I had before, and I can not remember it&#x27;s name right now.</li>
            <li> It is now easy to use, very useful and, most importantly, gets my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> Other than that i&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> This is the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on tooth brushes!</li>
            <li> Using the Philips Sonicare Power Toothbrush is easy.</li>
            <li> it was easy to set up.</li>
            <li> This setting can be easily turned on and off whenever you need (or don&#x27;t) it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to set up and easy to use</li>
            <li> My teeth are much more clean using this electric toothbrush vs an old-fashioned manual brush.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li> I just love the fact that it is easier to keep clean.    </li>
            <li> Love how it works, easy to clean, the quadpacer (a MANDATORY feature for my money)--</li>
            <li> im making there job to easy</li>
            <li> It is easy to plug and remove the brush head.</li>
            <li> It feels good, it works well, and it is a great improvement over the battery operated one I had had for a few months.</li>
            <li> Durable and easy to take care of.  </li>
            <li> Replacing a tooth can easily run $1000 for a crown, or $4000 for an implant.  </li>
            <li> Replacing a tooth can easily run $1000 for a crown, or $4000 for an implant.  </li>
            <li> I had an older Sonicare model which seemed to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend a Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The sonic cleaning of this toothbrush is like no other I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> I liked it until it died exactly 2 years to the day.</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m a very happy customer &amp; it came with a 2 year warranty &amp; from reading other reviews, they fully honor those warranties hassle free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine now, but it took a while.</li>
            <li> After using the Sonicare HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush for two weeks,&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be an excellent product, consistent with all recent Sonicare electric</li>
            <li> If price isnât an issue for you, this is a fine brush.</li>
            <li> The price was better than anywhere else including Walmart,  who usually has the best price.</li>
            <li> If anyone from Sonicare wishes to contact me with any other options, I would be more than happy to HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOOTHBRUSH!!!!!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has had his Sonicare Elite for several years, and it&#x27;s still going strong and working great.  </li>
            <li> So whether you get this model or an older one, I think you will be very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> But overall I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> It made a huge difference in my dental check ups.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in my dental health.</li>
            <li> The timer function is remarkably accurate, and</li>
            <li> It is powerful and does an outstanding job cleaning your teeth and gum line.</li>
            <li> felt like a light bulb exploded in my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably choose a more economical model.  </li>
            <li> The travel case for this one is fantastic.</li>
            <li> (no color chart available), but they feel noticeably cleaner than before --</li>
            <li> It is important to keep a light touch on the brush handle and just touch it against your teeth, rather than pushing it.</li>
            <li> It is important to keep a light touch on the brush handle and just touch it against your teeth, rather than pushing it.</li>
            <li> smooth surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Equally important, the design of the the unit and the way the brush head attaches eliminates the problem of gunk building up.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy how my teeth feel after using this machine.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt better and my smile has been noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> Using the Philips Sonicare R732 guarantees a better, brighter smile.</li>
            <li> It is sealed and cleaner to use and rinses clean easily.    </li>
            <li> My teeth stay build-up free longer.</li>
            <li> night I was brushing my teeth and as I tried to turn the brush to reach an area, I heard a \\&quot;bzzz\\&quot; sound.</li>
            <li> Overall happy with this model.</li>
            <li> its my primary toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a great sonic brush overall.</li>
            <li> The timer is great and it gives sonic pulse makes you feel like you just came back from the dentist.</li>
            <li> For years I was just using the free toothbrushes my dentist provided me after check-ups.  </li>
            <li> The whitening setting does help remove some light surface stains, and I have used this with whitening and non-whitening tooth paste as well.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean where the brush head attaches the unit.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t measure time properly and so results weren&#x27;t great -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy brushing with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Great battery life, white teeth</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> So far it is good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> before, this one is far superior to it.</li>
            <li> Thought I had a good toothbrush with the old one, this one is far superior.  </li>
            <li> This product is also good for me as I have mildly sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been keeping it on its charging stand, reasoning that the battery is more likely to give good service if kept fully charged.</li>
            <li> so i use it full cycle on top teeth then full cycle bottom teeth</li>
            <li> Now more than ever, practicing good dental hygiene, might save you a bundle in future dental bills.  </li>
            <li> Now more than ever, practicing good dental hygiene, might save you a bundle in future dental bills.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, not bad looking design</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. !!!!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!</li>
            <li> very powerful -- I can feel my teeth are cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth with a very fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> I also knew I wasn&#x27;t happy with OralB - because my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean, and I knew that it was definitely not getting into all the contours of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved my &#x27;Elite&#x27; &amp; I know I&#x27;m gonna love this new brush just as much</li>
            <li> My teeth felt really smooth, polished, and clean -</li>
            <li> The remaining two settings feel comfortable;  since my teeth feel clean at cycle&#x27;s end, I believe the Sonicare is doing a thorough job.  </li>
            <li> Instructions were easy to follow and quick to comprehend.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Sonicare from my dentist about three years ago, and I&#x27;ve always loved how it made my teeth feel so much cleaner than after a manual brushing.</li>
            <li> Also, while the three cleaning modes are a nice feature, I have found myself rarely using anything but the first one.</li>
            <li> But brushes are easy to purchase and very reasonable on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> This is such an amazing toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time for me to try a Phillips, and i must say: I love it&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you have used the Philips Sonicare Elite series before, you&#x27;re already familiar with this brush.</li>
            <li> It holds the charge for a long time which is great.  </li>
            <li> but I like it better than my first.  </li>
            <li> First time owner of an electric toothbrush &amp; I can&#x27;t believe I went these many years w/o one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend keeping it fully charged as there is a significant difference in power and effectiveness between &amp;#34;just charged&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;charged a couple weeks ago&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Sonicare for over a year and am as satisfied now as when it first arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the different cleaning modes and the Healthy &amp; White mode is awesome</li>
            <li> bought this originally for my wife, who did not like it.</li>
            <li> If you are a regular, healthy individual, this one works excellent -no</li>
            <li> I also liked the new design and whitening feature of this Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> it were nice as was the ability to get new ones.</li>
            <li> He loves how clean his teeth feel after using it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that they are whiter, but immediately after the brushing they look whiter, and feel dentist clean.  </li>
            <li> The one drawback is that if I choose to turn the toothbrush on to clean my tongue, after the brush has completed it&#x27;s rotation through my teeth, I must turn the brush off 3 times before it goes off.</li>
            <li> You get that clean, just-from-the-dentist feeling every time you brush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super smooth against my tongue and they do seem noticeably whiter.  </li>
            <li> my teeth havent been this clean in years.  </li>
            <li> feel clean again.  </li>
            <li> It gives you that &#x27;just got out of the dentist&#x27; clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Philips claims by using the \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; mode, you&#x27;re guaranteed to have your teeth two shades whiter in two weeks.</li>
            <li> Clean Feel:  </li>
            <li> , i.e. the surfaces of my teeth feel just as clean after the Oral B cleaning than after using the Sonicare.     </li>
            <li> clean.</li>
            <li> There would be two reasons to buy this toothbrush: to clean your teeth and/or to whiten them.  </li>
            <li> As for the cleaning, my teeth haven&#x27;t felt as clean after using this before anything aside from a dentist visit and it even come close to that.  </li>
            <li> My teeth had never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li> After using the tooth brush for the 2 minutes or so, I feel like my teeth are quite clean.</li>
            <li> I feel an all day clean from my teeth to my gums.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean afterward</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powered handle has three brushing modes, \\&quot;Clean\\&quot;, \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Not only is this new version every bit as good as the &#x27;Elite&#x27; brush, but it really is better!  </li>
            <li> I ordered the HealthyWhite after reading so many positive reviews about the cleanliness issue (the Elites get gunky around the connection).  </li>
            <li> am surprised more people have not had this experience!</li>
            <li> I have had many electric rotary toothbrushes but this sonic action is in a class of it&#x27;s own when it comes to really cleaning teeth to free them of all food particles.</li>
            <li> I have been using the full clean and whitening setting for over a week</li>
            <li> I like the small brush head, which I&#x27;d think would be ideal for children, the replacement brush heads are very reasonably priced and my teeth genuinely feel very clean</li>
            <li> If price is, youâll probably get just as good a clean from one of the lesser, cheaper models.</li>
            <li> They also clean better because this difference in mechanics allows the sonicare toothbrush heads to be shaped in a way that it&#x27;s much easier to reach the spaces between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Been two weeks of daily usage, teeth look and feel good.</li>
            <li> These were the old, rotating kind.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare is superb at cleaning gums, between teeth and removing the accumulated plaque and grunge that anyone who eats is forced to deal with.</li>
            <li> Since the whole system is called \\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li> and it is more gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full capacity.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> more than anything, this cleans your teeth really well.</li>
            <li> Much better brushing, easier to fit in the mouth, and the 30 second beep helps to distribute the time better and keeps the mind from wandering.</li>
            <li> For the month before I bought a replacement, I was using a hand-held brush, and thought I was doing a good job.  </li>
            <li> 3 years is not bad for something you use every day, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The design and handling is good to maneuver and slim enough for an adequate grip.</li>
            <li> Also, I liked being able to use a very small amount of toothpaste for effective brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I liked being able to use a very small amount of toothpaste for effective brushing.    </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great, I can&#x27;t compare it with other electric toothbrushes because I have never owned one before</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s due to the instrument or to the time I&#x27;m investing in the process, but the result makes me happy.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve favored those because I felt they did a better job cleaning an entire tooth, and not just part of it which I feel is what rectangular brush heads tend to do (i.e. either along the gum line or more on the other end).     </li>
            <li> This Phillips Sonicare is great at removing the stuff that builds up on my teeth, but I have to be very, very careful with it so as to not irritate my gums.  </li>
            <li> I found that my breath was fresh longer and my teeth felt clean all day.</li>
            <li> My mouth and teeth have never looked and felt so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> and he makes me use a toothbrush to clean all the dirt stains in the fun house as punishment.  </li>
            <li> Instead, the main charger comes apart so you can use a more compact version when traveling.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Sonicare Healthy White.  </li>
            <li> Seems too quick.</li>
            <li> Lucky me.</li>
            <li> It has a On the Go mode, which means it&#x27;s a quick version of the quadpacer timing for those times when you are in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> things I like better about this particular model though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it makes a tremendous difference in teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> Love this way more than the last version I had.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has made a tremendous difference in his dental care.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves your mouth feeling clean and your teeth much whiter.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use it on tooth whitening, mainly because I do drink a lot of coffee which takes it&#x27;s toll on my front teeth.</li>
            <li> fact that I&#x27;ve been loyal for 15 years?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Charging is quick.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that it beeps to get all 4 quadrants AND the extended setting included extra time for top front and bottom front teeth.</li>
            <li> Recharge time is quick, and the charging stand also has provisions for holding two brushes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a negative thing, just interesting.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a travel case and a deluxe travel charger like most other Sonicare toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I could feel a difference the very first time that I used it.  </li>
            <li> My very first Sonicare lasted 11 years</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and one full charge will last for many brushings.</li>
            <li> What could be worth that much money, when you get the old fashioned kind at the dentist office for free with every visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a wise investment in better dental care that will pay off with fewer Dentist visits.een to the Dentist after first couple uses, and then never go back to a normal toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already had the &#x27;Sonicare Elite&#x27; toothbrush for some time now, so I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect from the new &#x27;R732&#x27;</li>
            <li> This model is easier to hold with its slimmer handle, appears to have greater charge capacity and the new toothbrush design</li>
            <li> I am exceedingly impressed with the capability, quality and power of this particular model under review; it&#x27;s cleaning power far exceeds the prior model that I owned.  </li>
            <li> To me the Sonicare is a great example of new technology improving one&#x27;s daily life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The 30 second tone is a very handy way to ensure you get a complete clean within your recommended two minutes of brushing&lt;</li>
            <li> When I first started using a power toothbrush, I found it a bit strong at first.</li>
            <li> It feels very different from the Oral B, more of a vibrating, almost tickling sensation that actually feels quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> did find the packaging to be somewhat of an impediment to removing the&lt;br /&gt;unit from its protective plastic casing, but once out, the unit felt solid and well built; it was also very straightforward and easy to figure out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with that, but it should be more clearly advertised.</li>
            <li> Even when I do a careful check, I can&#x27;t find any remnants after a good brushing.  </li>
            <li> I had many fewer episodes of \\&quot;seeing stars\\&quot; when inadvertantly scraping across a sensitive tooth or patch of gum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the \\&quot;precision\\&quot; brush head that they include in the package - it seems a bit superfluous to me.    </li>
            <li> So is it worth the money?  </li>
            <li> As for the brush itself, it contains a few more nice bonuses.</li>
            <li> Initially I liked it a lot and convinced multiple family members to switch to these brushes.</li>
            <li> (My husbands toothbrush is still going strong after almost 6 years and is an older model)</li>
            <li> Yes, it is pricy, but it is worth spending money for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually fun to brush my teeth</li>
            <li> This is one powerful toothbrush and our teeth</li>
            <li> motor is powerful and works well in all cleaning modes.</li>
            <li> Once you use a good electric toothbrush, there is simply no going back to a manual brush.ee better results.   </li>
            <li> so for now, my conclusion is that this seemed to have worked on the capped tooth better than on my natural teeth.</li>
            <li> so well worth the 5 minutes doing so.</li>
            <li> Since I travel, I also liked the smaller design of the newer models.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush so far .... but did find it $40 cheaper at Walmart after I had opened and used it ....</li>
            <li> I was ashamed to smile my teeth were getting so stained.  </li>
            <li> Only one kind is offered.</li>
            <li> Product lives up to its description and features, though it wasnt clear how many brush heads came in the box.  </li>
            <li> My gum feels much better after using this model than my old one.</li>
            <li> but so far I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> While they both were solid items, they weren&#x27;t as nearly effective as the Philips Sonicare R732.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with this tooth brush and would recommend it to my friends that want a well made powered tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Nearly seven years later and the on off button wore out.</li>
            <li> Works the same as my old one, which is great.  </li>
            <li> But the final difference, and the most important, is that using the Sonicare leaves teeth feeling noticeably</li>
            <li> Had the toothbrush for 2-3 weeks now, and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The feel of the vibrating ultrasonic brushes is about the same, but having a choice is a nice option.  </li>
            <li> when I think of the money I have saved at the dentist, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The replacement was very easy and Philips sent the new model without much hassle.  </li>
            <li> This new head design is so much better than the older model because it is a lot easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> I have a really strong gag reflex and have issues using a normal toothbrush, I do not have any problems with this thing.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller brush head and the product itself is outstanding in helping me achieve clean teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends both as good and does not have a preference for one over the other.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this on sale because I thought the other functions would be good to use.</li>
            <li> so I know I&#x27;m doing the right amount.</li>
            <li> Sonicare method centers around getting you to spend the right amount of time on brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> It also makes my teeth feel very clean--nearly dentist clean with flossing.</li>
            <li> First, the travel case and smaller travel charger are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to keep clean also.</li>
            <li> The brushing action of this premium sonicare is fine, but not any better than the far cheaper single-mode version of this</li>
            <li> It would also sell more units, and better to sell at half the price and keep the customer.  </li>
            <li> Apparently there is a way to pause the unit, although I have not been able to master it&#x27;s function.</li>
            <li> As usual I am also happy with Amazon&#x27;s service and shipment of anything that I order from their website.  </li>
            <li> We had an old one that we had used for so many years that we could no longer buy brush replacements to fit, but we are not complaining because it really is old.</li>
            <li> First, the reviewers that stated your teeth feel fresh from the dentist are not kidding.  </li>
            <li> I made a long research before buying that particular brush and it seems i&#x27;ve made a good choice.</li>
            <li> The charge light is just right ( not annoying like my former brush. )</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing other than a longer timer!&lt;br /&gt;You could easily just start the quadrant timer all over again if you wanted more brushing time and stop it when you&#x27;ve had enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few more days went by, my teeth stayed with that smooth clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is easy on sensitive teeth as well.</li>
            <li> Let the brush do the work and after a week or so your gums will become acclimated to the more intense cleaning action.</li>
            <li> Let the brush do the work and after a week or so your gums will become acclimated to the more intense cleaning action.</li>
            <li> I love how much easier this one is to clean than the last one</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and not too loud.</li>
            <li> It makes your teeth feel super clean; has several different settings; and is EASY to clean and keep clean.  </li>
            <li> While the price on these seems high to me (about what a DVD player might be), it will probably - and I&#x27;m not being facetious here - save its cost in great dental check-ups, the prevention of cavities and the excruciating pain-in-the-butt of lengthy cleanings, as previous Sonicare toothbrushes have.  </li>
            <li> Kids may enjoy this due to the electronic aspect, beeps and tech feel, which in turn will promote better brushing habits.  </li>

            <li> so far, mine has worked just fine since AUG 2012.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m fairly happy with the unit, but I&#x27;m hoping that the battery does not crap out prematurely, as has happened with the previous Sonicares I have owned.  </li>

            <li> Whatever \\&quot;superior clean\\&quot; this gives is not worth the risk of damaging teeth!</li>
            <li> The bristles really move with \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; speed and give your teeth an intense power clean.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to knock the brush off of the stand and the extra wand really doesn&#x27;t want to stay put either.</li>
            <li> It comes in a hard case with space for the body of the brush and two brush heads, which is great for traveling.  </li>
            <li> addition, you get a hard case with the HX6732, which is great if you travel.  </li>
            <li> It claims to have a whitening technology by using a special brush vibration at the end of the normal teeth cleaning cycle</li>
            <li> Philips was very good about replacing the brush handle and told me they would send me a replacement handle under the warranty and that I should send back the old one in the same box with the UPS label provided.  </li>
            <li> I suggest the Healthy White.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush arrived timely and does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> first use with my Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My gums/teeth and mouth are overall getting better with each visit.</li>
            <li> My gums/teeth and mouth are overall getting better with each visit.</li>
            <li> For those who find it difficult to floss, as I do, it will come as welcome news that the Sonicare is quite good at acting as a \\&quot;super-flosser\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Maybe because it&#x27;s at a higher intensity.  </li>
            <li> It is my first electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> noticed it&#x27;s cleaning from the first 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> First of all, price.  </li>
            <li> When I spend $80.00 to $100.00 or $40.00 on a battery operated one I expect it to last more than one year.</li>
            <li> After all, if you&#x27;re going to spend this much money on a tooth brush, you don&#x27;t want it breaking in your suit case!    </li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare - I&#x27;ve been using a Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrush.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another consideration is that these are almost the most expensive electric toothbrushes on the market, but worth it if you value good dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Love the 30 second timer for each quadrant while brushing.</li>
            <li> My first week of usage I could feel the difference.</li>
            <li> if you have teeth that are stained from coffee, red wine, or tobacco, you will probably see better results.  </li>
            <li> one is recommended for the couple that smokes and/or drinks coffee, tea or red wine together, to make sure they stay together with white and healthy smiles.  </li>
            <li> I do think the extra attention is almost sure to result in whiter teeth.     </li>
            <li> I personally prefer that the brush does not auto-shut off, so I like the Oral B better here, but this is just a preference of mine...    </li>
            <li> But because I feel that the brush head of the Sonicare is overall doing a better job and is gentler, I am giving my vote to it.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey BUT very well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have now used this product, Sonicare Healthy White, for over one month.</li>
            <li> but I have yet to experience this first hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have been flakey in consistently using it.  </li>
            <li> this was our first porew toothbrush purchase.</li>
            <li> and they are aware of the problem</li>
            <li> This review is for my Philips Sonicare Healthy White.</li>
            <li> This is not my first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first one</li>
            <li> I had to wait for the gums to heal before I could use it again, but I knew better how to use it the 2nd time.  </li>
            <li> Solid build, long  battery charge and cleans great.</li>
            <li> am not a careless person.</li>
            <li> but with the very slightest contact of my front tooth onto the shaft, another \\&quot;bzzz\\&quot; and some of my tooth was clipped away!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This happened to me on one more occasion, bringing me a total of three chipped teeth in my mouth!</li>
            <li> And believe me, after the first time, I was hyper-cautious -</li>
            <li> Now, I was aware of this fact before using it-</li>
            <li> The first one sent to me was defective, but Amazon promptly sent a replacement.  </li>
            <li> The second time around, I am extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li> Even after the first brush, there was a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> My first experience with an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I do floss 6 out of 7 days a week but this electric brush will get better results) in addition to the overall cleaning of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (this is my logical theory)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I understood the value of the Sonicare system after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I finally purchased an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric tooth brush I have owned</li>
            <li> I have used a sonicare since they first came out</li>
            <li> This was an upgrade to my first electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I recommend reading the enclosed literature as you charge this for your first use.  </li>
            <li> it has definitely cleaned my teeth better and helping with the whitening</li>
            <li> I still want to push the brush back and forth :)</li>
            <li> I love the smaller size of this one!!!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because brushing my teeth properly using a normal toothbrush was not that effective for me.</li>
            <li> many of the reviews here state that the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; option differs only from the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; option in terms of length (with the whitening option adding an additional 30 seconds).  </li>
            <li> I really would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> The first time, the handle would just not turn on.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Phillips and they were aware of the problem and were willing to replace it if the brush fell under the two year warranty.  </li>
            <li> and I will give a higher rating</li>
            <li> It also stays charged for a lengthy period of time (more so that the Oral B one I had last).</li>
            <li> bought the Sonicare Healthy White R732 because it was $70 as a Deal of the Day, saving about $50.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After 16 months of use, the part on the top of the Healthywhite brush handle where the toothbrushes attach by sliding the toothbrush on broke (it wiggles back and forth)</li>
            <li> But given the durability I have found, I think I would still buy the basic model with the e-series brush until Sonicare comes up with a better way to attach the brushes on their newer models.  </li>
            <li> I specifically wanted to buy a Sonicare tooth brush because I started using my boyfriend&#x27;s Sonicare Elite a few months ago and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> This additional time will help clean coffee, tea, tobacco and other stains from your most visible teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean and White (Clean mode plus 30 seconds for whitening your front teeth)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Easy, simple, and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Much easier to clean because there&#x27;s no buildup like in the older designs.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean afterwards, i dont think i can go back to the regular kind after having this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Unless there&#x27;s been some kind of redesign recently that has affected my brush, I&#x27;m surprised so many people think they&#x27;re the same thing.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the brush heads are fairly inexpensive as compared to some of the other brands, (particularly the Ultreo) which is a real selling point and advantage to me.       </li>
            <li> I had to get a new one quick.  </li>
            <li> and it has a charger built into the stand&lt;br /&gt;- 3 Modes: Clean, Sensitive Teeth and</li>
            <li> This latest, however, is much better from a a number of factors, not the least of which is the cleanliness of toothbrush attachment to the handle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush, but the only whitening benefit you get from this is from running it an extra 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> so it fails in that; however as a power toothbrush, you can&#x27;t do better than a Philips Sonicare so on that point alone, it succeeds.  </li>
            <li> Once you use a good electric toothbrush, there is simply no going back to a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Overall, my initial impression of this product is good...</li>
            <li> Sadly, although a great power toothbrush that certainly does a better job of cleaning your teeth than a manual type or even a regular cheap battery toothbrush, I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in the color of my teeth after over two weeks&#x27; use.  </li>
            <li> (not sure how many \\&quot;shades\\&quot; worth) and left them feeling nice.</li>
            <li> so it is to long to be able to return it.  </li>
            <li> I have had electric toothbrushes before, but this one is pretty intense.  </li>
            <li> each, so you&#x27;d better to prepare a long term investment.</li>
            <li> So much better than a manual brush, and the charge lasts up to two weeks, depending on how long you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s why: first, it stays charged much longer.  </li>
            <li> To help in the acclimation process, the toothbrush has a built-in \\&quot;easy-start\\&quot; mode, which gradually increases intensity with repeated usage, until the full action is attained.</li>

            <li> You need to press the start button to turn the motor on, then press it two more times (Clean &gt; Sensitive &gt; Clean and White), and if you have toothpaste on the brush head, it WILL vibrate off instantly.</li>
            <li> You need to press the start button to turn the motor on, then press it two more times (Clean &gt; Sensitive &gt; Clean and White), and if you have toothpaste on the brush head, it WILL vibrate off instantly.</li>
            <li> I feel that it more thoroughly cleans my teeth, particularly at the gum line, then I could ever do with the traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> new Sonicare has a smaller diameter handle that feels very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> so you have a 30 second period of brushing for each quadrant of your mouth, cool!  </li>
            <li> The right toothpaste or a whitening chemical agent is really the main thing that can help whiten your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Along the same lines, another reviewer mentioned that it&#x27;s easy to knock the brush off the charger.</li>
            <li> I have a super sensitive mouth</li>
            <li> It is August year and a half after purchase and the brush doesn&#x27;t switch modes now, turns on and off on its own.</li>
            <li> Much better than my Oral B, although I keep both and alternate between them as they clean differently.  </li>
            <li> I often get complimented at the dentist by hygentist about how nice my teeth are (odd, I know).  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to swap out the different brush heads</li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush my dental health went up because it makes it so easy to properly brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> It seems to add a different sort of motion on top of the vibration of the clean option, or maybe it just moves faster, but in any case something different happens during the whitening option.  </li>
            <li> I started using it, it felt funny the first couple of days, but then it seemed perfectly normal.</li>
            <li> It comes with a travel box, which i guess is useful, but i must admit not for the kind of travels i usually go to.</li>
            <li> Given my positive experience with this toothbrush, I ordered the newer Healthywhite version, primarily because it looked like a more advanced model and used the new pro results toothbrushes which cost less than the e-series brushes (presumably because they do not have the plastic screw-on attachment head to the brush handle so 3 cost of these cost the same as 2 e-series</li>
            <li> brush has multiple settings, but I found the general cleaning setting most useful.  </li>
            <li> The heads need to be replaced every few months and are pretty affordable, I am happy I made the switch, now 1 year later, the novelty has not worn off, nor have the results.</li>
            <li> As stated in the product info, this new brush is for \\&quot;healthy whitening\\&quot;, and with myself being not only a smoker, but a coffee drinker</li>
            <li> Then the screw that holds the top piece that the tooth brush fits over vibrates itself loose and the toothbrush no longer works.</li>
            <li> so I recommend starting with the clean setting only to get used to the powerful brushing that you will inevitably get from this amazing toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that my teeth seem to retain the clean, fresh brushed feeling most of the day, something I never noticed with the other brushes.      </li>
            <li> This comes with a little travel thing, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the price of replacement brush heads can be quite high, the price of dental repair can be much higher, not to mention the \\&quot;cost\\&quot; of dental discomfort.</li>
            <li> While the price of replacement brush heads can be quite high, the price of dental repair can be much higher, not to mention the \\&quot;cost\\&quot; of dental discomfort.</li>
            <li> Switching from a regular toothbrush to this one made a huge difference, my gums are much healthier now.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for having my receipt so easily available to make this situation simple to rectify!</li>
            <li> it really deserves a 5 star.  </li>
            <li> My gums are much tighter as well.</li>
            <li> However, I prefer to charge my toothbrush once a week and keep the base/charger off the counter altogether, so this really isn&#x27;t an issue for me either.</li>
            <li> Really get a sense of cleanliness.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t really curse, but she stared at my teeth and said, \\&quot;That thing is f----- amazing!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> However, he has been using it for over 2 months with whitening tooth paste and haven&#x27;t really seen a difference.</li>
            <li> what to add that others didn&#x27;t say yet...not much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The whole family can share one handle and just buy heads.  </li>
            <li> Much, much nicer in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so haven&#x27;t seen too much difference, but it may take a bit longer to see a difference.  </li>
            <li> It breaks you in gently to the sonic cleaning experience</li>
            <li> This can come from applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li> This can come from applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li> While it is supposed to be a whitening toothbrush, I don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in that department.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to feel</li>
            <li> as I couldn&#x27;t imagine that there could&#x27;ve been that much of an improvement.  </li>
            <li> It really tickles on your teeth &amp; used to make me kinda nausious (not to say the brush will make everyone nausited</li>
            <li> This toothbrush makes a sound every 30 seconds to prompt you to move your toothbrush to a different quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> the brush heads arenât much cheaper</li>
            <li> Or, go with the Diamondclean which runs quieter, doesnât vibrate as much as this unit and just looks cooler.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed much change.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush</li>
            <li> I had used a competitor&#x27;s brush for a couple years and it really was not the same.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> My dentist measures my gum recession and says that my gums are much healthier now.</li>
            <li> I find that the Sonicare cleans my teeth much cleaner for this reason.</li>
            <li> I was not moving the brush in a swift or fast motion  when it happened, yet-</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Our teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> A fantastic purchase, don&#x27;t know how I ever used a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dentist cleanings are so fast, and no cavities since I have been brushing with Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re faithful in using this product, along with flossing &amp; mouthwash (i would recommend both) then you shouldn&#x27;t get cavities which can become root canals (more pain &amp; money) and the money spent for the head replacements should be cheaper than paying a dentist to fix any cavities.</li>
            <li> This sonicare works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a very quite brush.</li>
            <li> I called Philips and they were very helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been Real, Philips.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the memories.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who wants to have that \\&quot;Just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist\\</li>
            <li> Its made a real difference</li>
            <li> and I really like this style.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> Bacteria won&#x27;t build up much since you need to be changing the brush head</li>
            <li> After even a couple of days the Oral-B would start spinning slower, the timer would go much longer than 2 minutes, and it basically needed to stay on the charger at all times to be functional.  </li>
            <li> so the whole handle would need to be rinsed.  </li>
            <li> Our teeth feel so much cleaner and are already whiter.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush and to keep it short and sweet....</li>
            <li> I EVER SURPRISED!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty new experience for me</li>
            <li> My son said right away that he had tried it and his teeth are too sensitive for it</li>
            <li> had other sonic care, but really love this one, makes you feel like you have come straight from the dentist ever time you use it</li>
            <li> Also, there is a certain amount of vibration with this model vs the older ones I had.  </li>
            <li> The Philips rep told me they would only replace within the Warranty of the original toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and my teeth feel so fresh and so clean!  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for twenty years and can never get enough of the clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> and did not get the same clean feeling or whiteness as with the Sonicare series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, whitening mode an additional 30 seconds of cleaning of the front visible teeth after you&#x27;ve done the initial 2 minute Clean mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare toothbrush range utilises ultrasonic cleaning (as used in hospital sterile service units to clean the gunk off surgical instruments) in addition to the physical vibration of the bristles on the teeth.</li>
            <li> I use the clean and white mode because I want those whiter teeth it promises.    </li>
            <li> The Sonicare HW promises whiter teeth after two weeks of continuous use of the Clean &amp; White mode, which is what I did.</li>
            <li> Where they differ: The Sonicare HW stops brushing altogether after that time (or, in case of the Clean &amp; White mode, after two additional rounds of 15 seconds each for the front teeth), whereas the Oral B keeps going.</li>
            <li> It is a great size - not too big and not too small.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel extra clean and shiny after use.</li>
            <li> dentist recommended a Sonicare to help keep my gums clean and low</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the last one, though this one seems easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone, if asked, would say that they wanted their teeth clean but not white, which is what you get with one button</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean and look so white and shiny.</li>
            <li> clean teeth feeling every time I brushed.  </li>
            <li> If this is your first electric toothbrush beware that the vibrating sensation can be overwhelming the first day or two, but I promise after the initial shock of the new vibrating sensation it stops feeling strange at all.  </li>
            <li> The compact brush is more maneuverable, and better for getting at some hard to reach areas, like the back teeth.  </li>
            <li> so I am not sure if it is whitening my teeth yet, but the feel of the toothbrush is amazing.  </li>
            <li> had the old style with the larger head; the unit has worked fine for 5-6 years.</li>
            <li> The old model still worked fine after four years; my hope is that this one will have similar reliability.</li>
            <li> am giving the Philips quality control ZERO stars, Amazon - 5 stars, and the toothbrush - 5 stars (it cleans indeed better that anything I tried before), so, (0+5+5)/3&#x3D;3.3&lt;br /&gt;Rounding down to 3.</li>
            <li> I finally traded up to the new small design; it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> Have a saw handy, or some other super sharp object.</li>
            <li> I really like the new style of brush heads (\\&quot;Pro\\&quot; they&#x27;re calling them now)</li>
            <li> Better than previous sonicares.  </li>
            <li> All that said, I&#x27;ve used the toothbrush without charging for a week and a half, so I doubt most people will ever need to take the charger with them.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I decided to upgrade was because the replacement brush heads for the Elite series cost so much more than the newer model brush heads, so I figured I&#x27;d actually save money this way.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace an older model.</li>
            <li> The extra handle means both you and your partner can use it, charging it alternately in the charger, which makes it a better bargain.</li>
            <li> Your teeth will seriously never feel cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Considering you could spend (with insurance ) $100 for a simple filling, this is a worthy investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just replaced an older model Sonicaire toothbrush with this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> We had an older Sonicare brush and compared to this model it was clunky.</li>
            <li> Battery last at least 2 weeks without recharging making it great for travel.</li>
            <li> But: I believe that the Sonicare HW does a significantly better job with removing plaque and sometimes food particles (sorry, but this is just a fact of life :-))</li>
            <li> When my last one was slowly dying, I bought this model because it was on a great deal of the day sale.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one as a replacement to an older model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The older E series also collected a lot of gunk between the brush head and the electrical unit.</li>
            <li> Reading some of the reviews I was hesitant to purchase this particular model.  </li>
            <li> I had an older model and decided to update.  </li>
            <li> Based on my experience, if I were buying a Sonicare toothbrush now, I would buy the older model one that has the e-series toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Philips first thought it was a charger problem and sent me a new charger, but then the new charger didn&#x27;t charge the toothbrush so they have sent me a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought the new R732 sooner; light weight with the same power; just the right amount of options without overkill like the R900 series and not enough like the R710.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> etc - which in the long run proved to be not as good and more expensive and environmentally unfriendly as they eat up AA</li>
            <li> prior Sonicare was an older version of the more expensive HX6911, and I have to say that I think the HX6732 is far superior.  </li>
            <li> I will highly recommend this product to everybody.</li>
            <li> For those of you, who have never used a Sonicare toothbrush, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, and also bought units for my wife and daughters.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wanted one that had storage placement for two heads and that had high ratings.  </li>
            <li> But THE reason I paid the high price, instead of buying a cheaper option with disposable batteries, is RECHARGEABILITY.  </li>
            <li> (so much easier) and the prior versions were able to be used in the shower, and with this model I am not sure whether that still holds true.  </li>
            <li> But my teeth feel clean all day long - even when it&#x27;s time to brush again -</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve been using it every other night and the results are pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the two other settings, Sensitive (for the gumline) and CleanWhite for my bottom and top teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little more used to it now.</li>
            <li> An electric toothbrush takes a little more time and effort.  </li>
            <li> It claims to whiten two shades in two weeks, and I am expecting that it&#x27;s fairly accurate, especially if you are a nicotine addict or major coffee drinker etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve not used an electric toothbrush before, you&#x27;ll be surprised by how intense it can feel.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t guess as to how much whiter they are, but I can clearly see an improvement.</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference between this one and the old Oral B I had had for 10 years.</li>
            <li> The three modes are practical and useful when you might need that extra care.  </li>
            <li> Looking at it that way, I don&#x27;t know why anyone would use a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> just a few things I think could be better.</li>
            <li> I had one of these a few years ago and the battery went out after many years.</li>
            <li> As far as the healthy white aspect of it, it just brushes your front teeth for 30 extra seconds at the end, so</li>
            <li> overall good quality, slightly larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Normally.</li>
            <li> I always do an upgrade when replacing older models but this one blew my old Sonic toothbrush away!</li>
            <li> There are three cleaning modes, \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; which is the standard two minute brushing mode, \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; for people who have sensitive gums (this mode may also be useful if you&#x27;re new to electric toothbrushes and want to start out with a gentler cleaning cylce at first), and \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; which adds an extra thirty seconds to the standard \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode so you can focus on the front teeth.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare R732 generally does a decent job of cleaning, and really stimulates the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once charged, I use it essentially like an ordinary toothbrush but with far superior results.</li>
            <li> and if I and feeling too much pain from the normal setting, there is a soft pulsating sensitive teeth setting.  </li>
            <li> Purchased a new battery operated one.</li>
            <li> (There&#x27;s almost no difference that I can detect between the cleaning power of his tooth brush and my new one.)  </li>
            <li> But in spite of all that, I think this is my new electric toothbrush of choice - it works well and</li>
            <li> They immediately told me it was gone and no longer under warranty, so I could have 15% off a new brush from their website.</li>
            <li> With my new HealthyWhite model I get all of that plus a bonus whitening option and a \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; design.    </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve now had them for almost two years and they still work like new.  </li>
            <li> Well, not the new but refurbished one.</li>
            <li> Boy, did I ever need a new toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I received the new one, and tried it out, I was amazed at the improvement in the teeth cleaning process.  </li>
            <li> As a result, the new model is not my backup.....</li>
            <li> You will realize a new way of brushing and see and feel it in the results.  </li>
            <li> now I need to spend another $100 on a new one.  </li>
            <li> Replaced a new brush head on the handle but still not work.</li>
            <li> Granted it may have be slight change after each cleaning and maybe I should have taken before and after pictures to get a better idea of how much whiter they actually are.  </li>
            <li> It has a distinct vibrating feeling that can sometimes feel uncomfortable around the gumline, but definitely the most clean feeling I&#x27;ve had on my teeth at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is both subtle and effective.  </li>
            <li> You feel like you have been to the Dentist after first couple uses, and then never go back to a normal toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li> So far a few of my freinds also say the ORAL B works better and seems sturdier then this SONICARE.</li>
            <li> Like the last Sonicare that I owned, this toothbrush does a fantastic job cleaning my teeth, and it does it in only 3 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li> The first one I owned, which had screw-on e-series toothbrushes and the quadpacer feature (don&#x27;t know model number), was very durable and lasted so long</li>
            <li> This is kind of a clever idea, but not entirely successful, as all of the cord can be accommodated.  </li>
            <li> This is kind of a clever idea, but not entirely successful, as all of the cord can be accommodated.  </li>
            <li> My last cleaning was very intense at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My gums are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My old sonicare died, yea it was old!!  </li>
            <li> Might I also point out that I am only 22 years old, and do not suffer from weak or brittle teeth that can sometimes come from old age and make teeth more prone to chipping easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it is electric it requires a charging, but one overnight charge lasted me over a week of twice daily brushing, so the battery is pretty hardy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since it is electric it requires a charging, but one overnight charge lasted me over a week of twice daily brushing, so the battery is pretty hardy.      </li>
            <li> as a red wine drinker I&#x27;ll be interested to see if it does keep my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> As of this point (not sure about the battery life), the Philips is 110% better than the oral-B.  </li>
            <li> The small charging stand can have its cord wrapped inside to make it even more compact.</li>
            <li> The first difference I noticed was that the shape of the included brush heads was rectangular like a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Both systems have \\&quot;quadrant notifications\\&quot;, i.e. the system makes the user aware to switch to a different section (quadarant) of their mouth after 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> The damage left is something I now see every day and feel stressed about every day (the damage on the tooth supporting my bridge,</li>
            <li> No more mold buildup under cap as they redesigned the top and brush connection.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time she is moving from a regular brush to an electric one.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love the smaller handle of this brush over the larger one I had.  </li>
            <li> It can brush way better than what I could have done with a regular toothbrush in hard to reach places (in the right way).</li>
            <li> As to my love for the new \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; design, if you also have an older model, you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t have any use for the extra features (clean and white)</li>
            <li> With this model, I&#x27;m  reminded to give an extra 30 seconds attention to my visible front teeth when I select the optional clean and white mode.</li>
            <li> HealthyWhite toothbrush has a Clean and White mode, which adds two additional 15-second timer periods, during which you should give additional brushing time to your front teeth, upper and lower.</li>
            <li> handle has a light that indicates when the battery is running down, and needs to be charged.  </li>
            <li> - they&#x27;re a little bit slimmer over-all than the older style brush heads, but the bristle portion is actually bigger, so it covers more tooth area at a time.</li>
            <li> I was young, maybe 10 or 11, my parent&#x27;s received some advice from our family dentist that these new electric toothbrushes were the thing to use to protect your teeth.  </li>
            <li> A huge improvement over previous models I have owned.</li>
            <li> The general cleaning setting leave my mouth feeling fresh and tingly, similar to after a visit to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Smokers and coffee drinkers would have the most white to gain, and not the average user.  </li>
            <li> My gums (behind my top teeth) were a bit &amp;#34;ticklish&amp;#34; to it at first</li>
            <li> The price I paid for it on Amazon was only average, but OK.</li>
            <li> So I read up on all the Philips models (and a few non-Philips models, too, like Oral B and Water Pik) and chose the Healthy White mainly for the Sensitive cleaning option.  </li>
            <li> (There&#x27;s also the regular two-minute clean mode if you don&#x27;t have an extra 30 seconds to spare, and the sensitive option for those with sensitive teeth.)</li>
            <li> this just proves how dangerous this could be, and are most people really that cautious when they brush their teeth?!</li>
            <li> The second button was precisely positioned on the handle so that I always accidentally pushed it once or twice while brushing my teeth causing me to have to keep pushing it to rotate it through the various modes to get back to normal mode.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for extra whitening action and can give another 30 sec to your brushing routine, the R732 makes it easy for you.</li>
            <li> It is my first quality electric tooth brush, although I have had other very inexpensive models</li>
            <li> all with different pulses and locations to brush at certain intervals.  </li>
            <li> I had chipped a large corner of my upper canine tooth away!</li>
            <li> There are two prongs on the back of the charger for the brush heads, which are a little more sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I also chose the Healthy White because I didn&#x27;t care about the little UV cleaning things.  </li>
            <li> My Oral B toothbrush lasted significantly longer and cost less.</li>
            <li> I just purchased two of these at once - one was fine, the other one was dis-balanced - was vibrating so hard that literally jumped of hands, was making loud screeching noise, and had some dirt marks on it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon - just got a replacement, better, but when I put a good one from the original order and the replacement one next to each other and turn them on in the same operating mode with the same type of head attached - they make different noises, one is a way louder than the other one, and tone and strength of vibration are different too.&lt;br /&gt;Where is manufacturer&#x27;s quality control?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference in the health of your teeth and gums, in my humble opinion.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that is really anything but a gimmick, but I do like the sensitive versus regular option.  </li>
            <li> I assume that is what is making the loud noise.  </li>
            <li> was a dreaded time when it came to using my old standby manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is gentle on my gums and gets my teeth really white.</li>
            <li> With the Sonicare, it oscillates back and forth, mimicking real tooth brushing motion.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, when you brush your teeth, it feels like you&#x27;ve just had a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Overall this doesn&#x27;t seem any better than the basic Sonicare, but it&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
            <li> I really believe it is the only way I will brush my teeth for two minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> and she always waits until timer is complete.</li>
            <li> We have decided to replace our Sonicare every 3 years just so we don&#x27;t end up with a flaccid brushing experience like we did with the old one.</li>
            <li> I had an electric toothbrush (an old Philips sonicare)</li>
            <li> It seems in order to really tell one would need a color chart from the dentist and see if there is an actual change or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> direct comparisson to this one.</li>
            <li> I do not like the power button (a soft button).  </li>
            <li> There is also a sensitive mode, with a permanently reduced intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is also a sensitive mode, with a permanently reduced intensity.    </li>
            <li> I was used to it within a couple days with my old &#x27;Elite&#x27; &amp; didn&#x27;t have any problems at all with this</li>
            <li> My capped front tooth became quite sensitive so that I switched to using the Sensitive mode.</li>
            <li> I do attribute this to the Sonicare because this is not an old crown and I have not had any problems when using my Oral-B on it.</li>
            <li> Bought this product as a replacement for my old Sonicare...</li>
            <li> I used an old fashioned toothbrush and just did not feel that it did the job of my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Philips Sonicare for myself as well as one for my then 10 year old son.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Sonicare to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> I will never use an electric toothbrush again in my life, especially sonic, thanks to my experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an old one that was about 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> I knew that regular flossing wasn&#x27;t going to happen, no matter how much they cajoled me.  </li>
            <li> After a year, my dentist also said that my gum health was markedly improved (and stopped threatening me with horror stories of gingivitis and tooth decay).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The old sonicare had two buttons.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old unit, one of the oldest Sonicare models, with this unit.  </li>
            <li> or it might splash tooth paste on your clothes, something a Braun tooth brush never did as far as I recall.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery life is pretty long.</li>
            <li> So if you want to take the charger with you, you either need to take the whole thing, or take it apart, unwrap the cord and take just the smaller travel charger.  </li>
            <li> When my old brush wore out (after 15+ years), I decided to try this Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The whitening option vibrates in a different pattern from the cleaning option -- this is obvious from the different sound the two options make, as well as how the brush feels on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was beginning to find it difficult to locate good replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li> A timer is incorporated which issues an audible signal every 30 seconds, repeated four times to ensure upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right areas are cleaned</li>
            <li> Without the crevices and cavities of previous models, this design is always clean and fresh with no more effort than the simple rinse with hot water that you would normally give a manual brush after use.</li>
            <li> The charger is small and lets you easily wind up the cord and toss it in a toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> Though the UV lamp that comes in other other more expensive products seem attractive, I don&#x27;t think it is necessary.</li>
            <li> product is great for small mouths, hard to reach areas/crevices and for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you are a backpacker, the last thing you want to take with you is a bulky unnecessarily big plastic box which will take up a lot of space and in the same time not offer any special functionality.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff to clean my teeth but gentle enough to get into the gums w/o causing bleeding.</li>
            <li> While the Oral-B electric toothbrushes&#x27; round heads &#x27;shake&#x27; in relatively large, circular motions, the Sonicare toothbrushes &#x27;vibrate&#x27; at a much higher frequency.</li>
            <li> Only charge it when the light turns orange/red showing low power, this will save the rechargeable battery life by a long shot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to brush your back teeth than with a normal toothbrush, the timer even times you by beeping after every 30 seconds for each quadrant and an extra 30 seconds for whitening.</li>
            <li> It is not worth spending more than this as the ones above still have the Health White setting.</li>
            <li> You need to take dental hygiene more seriously.  </li>
            <li> This model is obviously not as well made as my older model so time will tell.</li>
            <li> I attribute this mainly to the shape of the brush head, which in addition to being rectangular is also raised in places, creating something like a \\&quot;wave\\&quot; pattern which enables the bristles to actually get in-between and do their job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model to replace an older Sonicare toothbrush that I had used for several years.</li>
            <li> Since I thought that it might be on its last leg, I decided to order this model, mainly as a backup.</li>
            <li> Very much worth it especially if it lasts as long.</li>
            <li> So the brush gets one stars for being a great toothbrush,  Phillips loses four stars for building a brush designed to break just past warranty.</li>
            <li> The first two last 2 minutes, and the third runs 30 seconds longer.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have commented, you have to push the button 3 times to put it into clean AND white mode.  </li>
            <li> It is the same high quality product I have come to expect from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I looked thru the different reviews for Sonicare and decided to go with this one instead of the high end</li>
            <li> No way I&#x27;m going back to a normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to move or agitate the brush: just hold it to the teeth upper, lower, left, right, inside, outside then rinse when finished.</li>
            <li> You open a chat, connect to a representative who asks you couple of question and send you the new brush, if you have a problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to order a new one than shipping it back.</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive teeth and have had to use sensitive tooth paste for several years consecutively.)  </li>
            <li> and I did experience some initial tenderness (especially near the back of the teeth and along the gumlines)</li>
            <li> It also comes with two different sized brushes, a large one for general cleaning and a smaller one for \\&quot;detail\\&quot; work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It suddenly became very loud and noisy.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating brush works well for general cleaning, while the rotary type is generally better for focusing on specific hard to reach area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are 3 settings, and if you are on the first setting,  you have to go through the other 2 settings</li>
            <li> All of these times, the toothbrush had just barely came into contact with the tooth - I can tell you the contact was almost feather-light!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; basically means this mode has 30 extra seconds, nothing significant...3 modes, simple use, no complicated fragile technology.</li>
            <li> I would like to suggest that the manufacturer include with purchase a little chart showing various shades of white, along with shades of stain, so the user can easily measure progress.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately both the handle and the brushes are pretty easy to tip over.  </li>
            <li> This one is smaller than my prior brushes but appears to work just like the last which cost me nearly twice as much.</li>
            <li> (However, this additional cleaning mode seemed somewhat of a gimmick to me, since it&#x27;s no more than a longer cycle to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> thing that I feel could be improved about the product is that you&#x27;re not able to start in the \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; mode.</li>
            <li> (However, this additional cleaning mode seemed somewhat of a gimmick to me, since it&#x27;s no more than a longer cycle to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> One thing that I feel could be improved about the product is that you&#x27;re not able to start in the \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; mode.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE of this I still keep an ordinary toothbrush to clean these areas in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new [to me] charging base is a definite improvement, very easy to keep everything clean.</li>
            <li> The travel case that came with it is compact and cute (hard case, not soft).</li>
            <li> This is a minor design fault, as mentioned by another reviewer, which quickly becomes obvious (and slightly irksome) to the new user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> General:  </li>
            <li> The brush heads have small plastic covers that protects the bristles and help keep them free of external dust and debris.</li>
            <li> I got this in October and as of December I have clear visual improvements.</li>
            <li> like that it has options for sensitive and regular or whitening.</li>
            <li> I am old enough to have gum issues and using Sonicare halted degeneration and, in some cases, improved it.  </li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s brush recently died as well at near the 2 year mark.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush offers the quality of a Sonicare with the added feature of whitening (which is just a different &#x27;pulse&#x27; of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used my old toothbrush last about 4 years using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> You can only switch between modes when the toothbrush is turned on, so if you want the Sensitive mode, you have to apply toothpaste and press the start button twice.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums, and it seems to me that the Sonicare overall was a lot gentler than the Oral B.</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that the charger is 110/240 volt as we travel internationally frequently.  </li>
            <li> This thing is *thorough* and will leave your teeth utterly and completely clean--one still needs to floss however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has modes for standard, sensitive, and whitening.  </li>
            <li> I wish and suggest that Phillips Sonicare offer an extra soft brush head for its electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> If you should choose to use one, you must be extremely careful to not touch the shaft to your teeth from any angle, and you must use the utmost care not to add much pressure to the brush as you move it along your teeth.</li>
            <li> I was starting to have issues with receding gums in my early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Recently I have developed \\&quot;carney elbow\\&quot; and needed some assistance in completing this task</li>
            <li> I used to own three oral-B sonic for eight years and two of them fail on me</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for extra whitening action and can give another 30 sec to your brushing routine, the R732 makes it easy for you.d slightly making the brush a little smaller and the brush head is easier to clean than the earlier screw-on brush heads.     </li>
            <li> Like little etches right into the surface of my enamel.</li>
            <li> so you have enough time in your brushing routine to brush your tongue and other areas of your teeth that may need a little more attention.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush has a few nice features that really set it apart from other rechargeable power toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> The first HealthyWhite died less than 1 year after purchase</li>
            <li> But I actually haven&#x27;t needed to use the Sensitive option at all; the regular brushing option (as well as the extra 30 seconds tagged on at the end to whiten teeth) hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive teeth at all.  </li>
            <li> had other makes of electric toothbrush in the past which use the word \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; in the product description but few actually employ genuine ultrasonic cleaning technology like these from Philips (the Oral B range also uses genuine ultrasonic cleaning).&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s so hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed when I went to the dentist for my cleaning, they did not have to work as hard to clean the teeth and gum area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever use the gentle mode or other modes.  </li>
            <li> (I should note that this Sonicare model does not have a audible sound for each thirty-second interval like other Sonicare models, but one gets used to the pauses in the motor in lieu of the typical</li>
            <li> I bought this model over the Elite because of the negative reviews regarding keeping the Elite clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this long enough to get used to the slightly awkward tilt of the brush&#x27;s angle - which (oddly) now seems more comfortable than a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Not only are they cheaper, but they also attach to the brush differently than the old ones, so you don&#x27;t get that buildup of gunk under the brush head</li>
            <li> The white booster time is really a hype because all you have to do is turn the thing on again to run for 30 sec.</li>
            <li> I was confused by how many different Sonicare there are.</li>
            <li> One cool feature is that the brush \\&quot;pauses\\&quot; if you press it too hard against your teeth or gums.</li>
            <li> It was easy to set up, but it was a little difficult for me to learn how to \\&quot;program\\&quot; the toothbrush to the \\&quot;clean and whiten\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li> Luckily this chip was only a small groove, but is still visible to family, friends and dentist -</li>
            <li> Then again, not so much that other people would necessarily notice.</li>
            <li> I find this much easier to manuever around the back of my mouth than the other ultrasonic toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used (another Sonicare, an Ultreo and an Oral B).</li>
            <li> The small brush is not as useful.</li>
            <li> The first 30 times I used it, it took me about 4 minutes to brush my teeth while they recommend 2 minutes, and it actually shuts down after 2 minutes with 30 second warnings so you can time your brushing.</li>
            <li> The other day I had to use a regular toothbrush and it felt like each individual bristle was so large.</li>
            <li> I wish they hadn&#x27;t tried to &#x27;simplify&#x27; the design - all they succeeded in doing is making this toothbrush more inconvenient to use than older models.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the need to bear down with too much pressure when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> It was ridiculous how clean my teeth felt, as if I just had them cleaned and polished at my dentist.</li>
            <li> I have also been using less toothpaste - it really foams it up.</li>
            <li> and apparently they now make them to last only 2 years.</li>
            <li> Then 3 of my friends, all in different social circles, who bought the Sonicare and raved about the difference.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that the pro results toothbrushes do not last as long as the old e-series ones.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, Bryan told me, the warranty was only good for the life of the original (2 years, and both toothbrushes failed within 2.5 years).  </li>
            <li> This is because the toothbrush must hit each cycle, i.e. normal, sensitive, and white before turning off--unless I&#x27;m missing something.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare works just fine, and I am using it diligently, maybe not happily.  </li>
            <li> Its first use left my gums raw in some places.  </li>
            <li> I also really appreciate the holder where I can park the toothbrush heads, the travel case, and the little caps that go over each brush head.  </li>
            <li> Power toothbrushes can be a bit large and often generic plastic travel covers do not fit over the heads, making them impractical to pack.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also this little feature on the toothbrush that really annoys the hell out of me - when you turn the toothbrush on, the program will only work in 2 minute cycles.</li>
            <li> The design of the brush head has also changed slightly making the brush a little smaller and the brush head is easier to clean than the earlier screw-on brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good cleaning but battery is so bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably quiet and it has a useful feature for people who are not used to with electrical toothbrushes - when you just start using it, it gradually adds power during 14 washing cycles until it slowly reaches to</li>
            <li> Other reviewers say it left their teeth/gums sensitive, but we&#x27;ve not had a problem with that.  </li>
            <li> instructions for use insist the toothbrushes should be kept on the charging base (a clever device which works well and only exposes sealed plastic to sealed plastic, so is effectively waterproof).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only other slightly less than stellar notes are cosmetic.  </li>
            <li> This one so far exceeds the other.  </li>
            <li> Trust me when I say that you&#x27;ll never use the other modes that this brush offers - skip this model and go with the cheaper one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (she said they&#x27;re a little high on some teeth..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, even though it is a little pricey -</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed because I&#x27;d heard such good reviews.</li>
            <li> It also comes with 2 brushes - a large and a small.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush for crying out loud!!  </li>
            <li> It felt like the brush really wasn&#x27;t getting into the small spaces between teeth the way my Sonicare does.</li>
            <li> (I found myself using the fast speed in the morning, a slower one later in the day, and I occasionally forget to change the speed until the toothpaste is on), but that&#x27;s not even a complaint.    </li>
            <li> My two weeks are up now, and honestly I am not sure that I notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> A real plus for this toothbrush is the small brush.  </li>
            <li> Only a couple of minor issues, which have nothing to do with the performance of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> battery really last a long time.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will last as long too.</li>
            <li> Once you try a Sonicare toothbrush, you won&#x27;t want to go back to a conventional toothbrush or a less capable power brush.</li>
            <li> Once you try a Sonicare toothbrush, you won&#x27;t want to go back to a conventional toothbrush or a less capable power brush.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; mode, but I honestly think it works.  </li>
            <li> The few weeks I was without my power toothbrush before the new one came is</li>
            <li> Only negative is I would like a straight on-off instead of having to go through all speeds to turn off.</li>
            <li> It maintains a charge and it doesn&#x27;t slow down the vibration even when the charge isn&#x27;t at full capacity.  </li>
            <li> heads are removable for transportation and may be changed or renewed regularly, and in our case there have been no issues with the head working loose as reported by a minority of reviewers here.</li>
            <li> I could feel slight tartar building behind my teeth and after using the Sonicare once, my teeth suddenly felt smooth, like after going to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare was difficult for me to get used to - the vibration is way more extreme than the Oral-B.</li>
            <li> The unit and replacement brushes are more expensive than my other toothbrush, the packaging was a one-time pain, and the vibration took a lot of getting used to.</li>
            <li> This brush is not only smaller than other brushes I&#x27;ve tried, but it comes with both plastic caps to snap over the brush head but a travel case to hold everything that is about the size of a glasses case.</li>
            <li> The other big advantage of the HealthyWhite is the extra 30 seconds of brushing time.  </li>
            <li> However, in the last two years, both the original and the replacement have failed.  </li>
            <li> This one is geared towards tooth whitening, particularly for teeth stained by the usual suspects like coffee and tobacco&lt;</li>
            <li> The sensitive cycle helped me acclimate a little.    </li>
            <li> But takes a little getting use to because the old one had just one.</li>
            <li> this time, my upper two front teeth must have closed down the very slightest little bit-</li>
            <li> Great customer service, I&#x27;ve had some bad experiences in the past with some sellers.</li>
            <li> Well I don&#x27;t really have anything negative to say about this.</li>
            <li> Brush replacement heads are expensive &amp; don&#x27;t get screwed into buying some cheap knockoff&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve heard people getting scammed</li>
            <li> I took a long time in deciding which toothbrush to buy and based on reviews</li>
            <li> One reason for this is that the Sonicare has a helpful feature that tells you how long to brush.  </li>
            <li> We will see how long this one lasts.  </li>
            <li> (And the charging cycle doesn&#x27;t take long at all.)  </li>
            <li> I have wanted a Sonicare for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare brushes since 1996, long before Philips took over and ruined the line.</li>
            <li> why did we wait so long?</li>
            <li> long before I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> or how ever long you choose to brush your front teeth again.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has a timer, you don&#x27;t have to think about how long to brush.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds strange</li>
            <li> but since I haven&#x27;t had it for long, I cannot determine its durability.  </li>
            <li> I had an Oral B for a long time, by my hygienist recommended a Sonicare for me.</li>
            <li> I use it between 2 and 3 times daily, and only have to charge it about every week and a half.</li>
            <li> In addition to the extra time, there&#x27;s also a slight change in motion for the final 30 seconds in that mode.</li>
            <li> so I was loyal, but after 2 failed toothbrushes I&#x27;m switching to a different brand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, I couldn&#x27;t change the past, so I went to the dentist and had to move on and live with the chip.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure the savings on the new toothbrushes are there either.  </li>
            <li> My previous model was very hard to keep clean</li>
            <li> This is due to the fact that I have only had it 1.4 years.  </li>
            <li> Nor do I have any basis for comparing it to other similar products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Theoretically, you could just brush with any other Philips toothbrush for extra 30 seconds for the whitening process.</li>
            <li> This model came with two brush heads, one even smaller than the other.  </li>
            <li> The HealthyWhite is not likely to make your teeth any whiter than any other Sonicare model.  </li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long as the Interplak!</li>
            <li> and you are washing the brush head with soap and water after brushing, and hopefully allowed to air dry</li>
            <li> I bought it because my gums were very inflamed, they bled often when I brushed them and were generally unhealthy.</li>
            <li> I have only used the smaller, round brush head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a similar brush through ORAL B but after only a few days my teeth are cleaner, smoother and whiter.</li>
            <li> Based on my limited experience, it appears as though the quality of their products has deteriorated.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cleaning power far supersedes the predecessors I have owned over the past eight years or so.</li>
            <li> The base of this charger is different from the old one, and it doesn&#x27;t hold the brush as securely in place.</li>
            <li> Sad, but true.</li>
            <li> And what&#x27;s worse, it was one of the supporting teeth for my bridge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the most expensive diamond clean, but saw it had bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> that I use currently, in which you get 2 handles and 3 brush heads (2 regular, one small).</li>
            <li> The R732 gives you only one handle and 1 regular and 1 small (for precision) brush head.</li>
            <li> All the previous models would build up a slime inside in the handle with use and needed regular cleaning.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything about long term results as I&#x27;ve only had it a few days.</li>
            <li> It has been a year now with no new cavities!</li>
            <li> pick your color of blue, grey or green now, as you will almost immediately lose the other color</li>
            <li> So I cannot notice any whiter effects, but a little bit on my back teeth, which makes sense.  </li>
            <li> I like the little vibration misses to tell you to go to the next quadrant for cleaning.</li>
            <li> About the only thing I wish is the heads were a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended an electric brush because I developed a weekness in my fingers and was having a hard time navagating a manual brush around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, my visits to the dentist have been less painful as the dentist doesnât have to work as hard to clean them (I can see where this would be a con though if you try to get your moneyâs worth out of your dentist).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned economically depressed money on phoney (spellcheck?), cheap knock-off, immitations or painful, damaging, whitening technics.  </li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long as my last one but not sure it will.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has obviously jumped on the lucrative \\&quot;whiter teeth\\&quot; bandwagon that is common with various kinds of toothpaste and whitening strips.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sonicare has obviously jumped on the lucrative \\&quot;whiter teeth\\&quot; bandwagon that is common with various kinds of toothpaste and whitening strips.)    </li>
            <li> Upon closer examination I discovered that the part that the brush attaches to became very loose.</li>
            <li> Oral B brush heads were rough and painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and notice not only are my teeth cleaner, but they are truly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and notice not only are my teeth cleaner, but they are truly whiter.    </li>
            <li> My teeth have definitely gotten a few shades whiter since I started using it 10 days ago.</li>
            <li> so \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; is really not something of concern.  </li>
            <li> However keeping both brushes on the charging base is simply not possible as no twin charger is available, so if you have two brushes then they have to be charged alternately.</li>
            <li> can not really verify the whitening claim or deny it either.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost redundant but it works and they are definitely cleaner and whiter than ever before.  </li>
            <li> But then a few weeks later, it happened again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i follow the directions carefully -</li>
            <li> Was expensive but very much worth the spend.</li>
            <li> Second, the Oral-B is messy.  </li>
            <li> I am partial to the Sonicare because I think its gentler</li>
            <li> In addition, the package was missing the compact brush head and the travel case accessories, which were listed as included on the outside of the package.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly sure the use for this as I would not travel with it, and have no use for the case at home, and it would be easier to bring a normal toothbrush... not to mention airport security, and the fact that it&#x27;s not exactly light.  </li>
            <li> I have to use an extra soft brush, like those for diabetics, to keep from irritating my gums.  </li>
            <li> Kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> I have some kind of fungus growing at the base of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and they are impossible to clean!</li>
            <li> I could make it down the front walkway to the hall of mirrors, but lately I have only made it half as far.</li>
            <li> The cost of the Sonicare or any other quality powered brush isn&#x27;t insignificant, but spending a few hundred now, could possibly save a few thousand later.</li>
            <li> package comes with two brush heads, one about 1\\&quot; long and the other about half that length.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Without white-level cards, it is difficult to verify the claim of making your teeth two shades whiter in two weeks, but I can see that the tea stains on and between my front teeth have become less intense after a couple weeks of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It vibrates, or oscillates, instead of rotates, so it is already easier on your poor brain than the older scrub-brushes.  </li>
            <li> There are less expensive models with fewer settings, these might be worth checking out.  </li>
            <li> I forget the brand, but they were a pain to use, and they never seemed to do anything other than rattle the teeth around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing to say other than that I wish I had bought one years ago.</li>
            <li> The vibrating was uncomfortable at first</li>
            <li> This toothbrush seems comparable to other Sonicare units I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> other Sonicare brushes I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Hard-side travel case is included with other extras.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have used the battery operated unit also chargable for 15 years and will no longer purchase these product due to quality control?</li>
            <li> However it seems it is not as durable, or water proof as the other one.</li>
            <li> other toothbrush I have tried is the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This allows the entire package to be carried in a jacket pocket or other small space, so there is no reason not to take it with you on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I never had problems with any other toothbrushes, but then again they were not made of rubber all around the handle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> and I always use extreme caution when caring for my teeth.</li>
            <li> I press the button, but finding the exact spot that will turn it off is difficult.  </li>
            <li> so I have nothing to compare it with other than manual teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li> so it improved my whitness probably faster then other who don&#x27;t do either on or both or those.&lt;br</li>
            <li> need to spend like $200 on the other models by Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to write this review so that people would know you have to be very careful with these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that what killed my HX6911 was the fact that I traveled with it not in a hard case, and the metal prong that the brush snaps over was pushed too far to one side, damaging the toothbrush</li>
            <li> The cost of the Sonicare or any other quality powered brush isn&#x27;t insignificant, but spending a few hundred now, could possibly save a few thousand later.for winding the power cord inside.  </li>
            <li> I had my old Sonicare Elite model for more than seven years, which is insane.</li>
            <li> We had not realized just how weak our old Sonicare (ca.</li>
            <li> You have to be a little careful changing speed, because you do that while it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> I like the clean, white color and the minimalist look of the base.</li>
            <li> At the time I had braces, so they were double hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model doesn&#x27;t have the big hole in the handle where the brush was inserted and which collected lime and slime that was hard to get out.</li>
            <li> Even with my complaint, I like the HealthyWhite enough to recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend it opposed to the icky whitening stickers.</li>
            <li> Consider the average person who isn&#x27;t as cautious as me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sonicare, I can actually say based on my dentists queries has saved my gums and teeth over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> I had an Interplak toothbrush for at least 20 years, and it finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.</li>
            <li> The charging base is interesting, and I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s charging.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-You can feel a noticeable and annoying vibration when gripping the unit while itâs on</li>
            <li> The base has a removable top, with a spool for winding the power cord inside.  </li>
            <li> next thing I have to point out is that you must be extremely careful not to press too hard when you brush with this device!</li>
            <li> And it all comes down to your commitment to work on preventative care as the result of your lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> to hold down the power button for about three seconds to pause the brush&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not like I threw caution to the wind to achieve the other two chips!</li>
            <li> A few years ago - in my quest to find an electric toothbrush per my dentist&#x27;s instructions led me to stand in front of the products meticulously comparing one vs. another, did it do this that and the other, price point, etc.</li>
            <li> If I were to say anything negative, it would be that the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; option is fairly meaningless -- it simply extends the normal brushing time about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this toothbrush is that the toothbrush heads are expensive compared to a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 was that the unit is difficult to pause while you are doing a final rinse.</li>
            <li> I read some previous comments before regarding the removal tooth brush</li>
            <li> In the end I give the R910 a slight edge over this one.</li>
            <li> In each cleaning mode, you are notified at thirty-second intervals by a slight pause in the motor when to switch areas, so thirty seconds are intended for each of the four quadrants of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Is this typical?</li>
            <li> The detachable toothbrush heads of Sonicare also have fewer moving parts, also because of how it works, and I feel this allows them to stay cleaner because there are less cracks and nooks for gunk/germs to get into.</li>
            <li> you have to change your angle and grip slightly.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, and price was roughly half of what you typically pay in a Walmart etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it about 6 months - and my dentist reports that my  plaque buildup is less than his</li>
            <li> But I miss the Braun I had previously.  </li>
            <li> And, I also feel less pain than I used to.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush in the box had less features than what I paid for and didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture on the package.  </li>
            <li> Unlike Oral B&#x27;s rotating brushes, there do not appear to be any less expensive generic alternatives, for the Sonicare brush heads, which run about ten bucks</li>
            <li> Unlike Oral B&#x27;s rotating brushes, there do not appear to be any less expensive generic alternatives, for the Sonicare brush heads, which run about ten bucks</li>
            <li> I am hoping that the electric it uses, the cost itself, and I guess the brush heads will pay for itself or at least in the long run be cheaper than going through all the manual tooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of tooth whitening procedures, since they usually just make me feel like I&#x27;m slowly sanding down my teeth to nubs.  </li>
            <li> The older handle just seemed too big and the base while solid just seemed too bulky for my small bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One sticking point could be the price of the replacement brush that will run you over five dollars per brush which is a little pricy for what is just half a tooth brush, one that is suggested you replace every three months.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the new toothbrushes that use the e-series heads (the Essence) don&#x27;t appear to have the quadpacer timer feature which I like</li>
            <li> Easy fix is to charge then just put the base and extras away.</li>
            <li> The HX6732 does not have this problem at all since it is missing the second button, and the single button has enough resistance so that it is very difficult to push</li>
            <li> Its not very comfortable to hold and when it gets wet your hand slowly slides up it and you must keep readjusting you grip and it will cramp your hand a bit.</li>
            <li> My gums bleed a little, but they always bleed when I floss them</li>
            <li> Travel case fits the product &amp; 2 brushes &amp; 1 little tube of paste.  </li>
            <li> The 2 with charges one was purchased used for a little over a year</li>
            <li> and I did lighten my pressure, and let the brush do the brushing - however, I began to notice that after using this brush for a while, little grooves were developing on the surface of my teeth.</li>
            <li> on some teeth - what appeared to be \\&quot;dents\\&quot;, little dot-like indents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> literature for the HX6732 is a little deceptive.  </li>
            <li> Ever since using this product, the hygienists are always saying how little work they have to do when cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My dentist was amazed how little plaque I had on my teeth at check-ups.  </li>
            <li> The shaft that connects to the brush became loose - a common problem with this unit.  </li>
            <li> In terms of clean, though, I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very meticulous about my teeth because I have had lots of dental problems over the years (tons of orthodontics, already one chipped tooth from the past, and I have a bridge [artificial tooth, attached to two other teeth] to take care of)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little hole in the brush head that you have to rinse out, and for some reason my hand would always wind up getting messy</li>
            <li> only complaint, it is really hard to turn off, when it is in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Besides, if you replace the brush head every 3  months like they recommend, you really aren&#x27;t going to get any dangerous germs or mold building up, anyway.    </li>
            <li> That was a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Oral B is almost dead - it&#x27;s been 2 years, the battery will hold for a couple of days, but not over a week like it used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a few months - went for my cleaning and my dental hygienist noticed my teeth/gums were improving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months - went for my cleaning and</li>
            <li> Have used Sonicare for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Wanted to help me trouble to repair.</li>
            <li> Not to say I&#x27;ve got a green, snaggly, rotten mouth, but I can see a difference.  </li>
            <li> The Oral B system features round brush heads</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 2012 and this electric brush costs few bucks to manufacture, so $120 is a bit steep for what it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use the compact, so it&#x27;s a waste.  </li>
            <li> his teeth are whiter in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After using it for 7 months it went dead.</li>
            <li> I like the travel case provided, it worked out well on the few occasions I needed to take it on a trip.</li>
            <li> Not  a happy camper these should last longer.</li>
            <li> There is such a heavy level of competition in the power toothbrush market, it becomes confusing and annoying trying to figure out which one would be right for you.  </li>
            <li> worst thing about this model of the sonicare lineup is that you either have to hold the button down (and toothbrush in your mouth) for an extra 2-3 seconds to shut it off (which feels longer than you think when trying to finish brushing quickly...)</li>
            <li> THAT is confusing), or consuming coffee, wine and other staining food and drink.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this unit because of the three cleaning modes, the nifty charging base that will hold two brush heads and because it included a travel case.</li>
            <li> I was brushing the chewing surface of my lower molars, was moving the brush slowly around to the other side...</li>
            <li> But they are very expensive, and you know what&#x27;s more expensive</li>
            <li> I usually feel that 2 minutes is about 1 minute too little for my needs</li>
            <li> I have taken this toothbrush on trips several times without the charging base and found that I could brush twice a day for at least five or six days without a recharge, so the battery life is certainly ample.</li>
            <li> However if you do have two brushes, an irritating minor issue will soon become evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One little fault - the On/Off button can be hard to push to turn it off, but it always works.  </li>
            <li> It is a problem for me as I have no safe place to put it without risk of it falling.  </li>
            <li> They will repair it, but I realized over the past years that the quaily of their products have changed.</li>
            <li> When I use the Sonicare toothbrush, I can feel that all the small pieces of materials are removed from mouth by the vibration technique and mouth is cleaner.</li>
            <li> It does feel like it penetrates well into the small crevices between the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> It does feel like it penetrates well into the small crevices between the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure my teeth are whiter</li>
            <li> It comes with a small charger for when you&#x27;re traveling, and a case for the toothbrush and heads&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> if not more.  </li>

            <li> the toothbrush head is waaaayyyyyyy too small.</li>
            <li> Not really sure, bought it as a Christmas gift but havent heard any negatives.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes that screwed on to the handle usually lasted me about 6 months before needing replacement.  </li>
            <li> This is a little ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> However I had grown tired of cleaning the gunk out of the handle of the old model, which had a design that was flawed in this regard.</li>
            <li> The first experience was a little brutal.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the second one has begun to fail (randomly vibrates in the middle of the night in a set pattern) and they base the warranty on my original purchase price and not on the replacement</li>
            <li> At first I did not receive the base I saw in the picture</li>
            <li> There are serious risks to careless brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, a tool such as the Philips Sonicare R732</li>
            <li> There are black spots very slowly growing on the rubber part</li>
            <li> Considering you will need to buy a new brush head at least every three months at $8 a pop, it seems to me that a proprietary refill requirement should bring the base investment down.  </li>
            <li> The packaging for this is near impossible to penetrate, no joke</li>
            <li> Previous units had the battery fail, that seemed to have taken a few years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Surprisingly, I didn&#x27;t have a hard choice with picking Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I am a compulsive brusher, and don&#x27;t smoke, hardly drink etc.</li>
            <li> Teeth are whiter and the brush gets to even the hard to reach spots well.</li>
            <li> The case for this one though is a hard plastic case that has spots for everything.</li>

            <li> This is common to all Sonicare</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s never too late to start.</li>
            <li> With this electric brush it does feel really weird because of the size and YOU have to be careful where you grab the brush so that you don&#x27;t accidentally start it up.</li>
            <li> would have given this a 3 star due to the blatant marketing ploy of the product.</li>
            <li> The 1 complaint I have is that the cord is really difficult and inconvenient to string along back in the little base compartment thing, so much so that I just leave it all dangling around...</li>
            <li> My dentist was concerned and wanted to do &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34; and other scary sounding stuff.</li>
            <li> While this is a slight investment at $119, it comes with a carrying case, the base comes apart for a smaller version and it comes with two brush heads.</li>
            <li> From what my dentist says and from what my family members&#x27; dentists say too, it&#x27;s really not worth getting an expensive electric tooth brush UNLESS you go with Sonicare.)     </li>
            <li> but it is a less expensive model</li>
            <li> I really wish i could turn off this feature, because it&#x27;s unnecessary and annoying.</li>
            <li> Previous models requires a tedious cleaning routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After each use, I feel like I just came back from the dentist w/o any disgusting taste or soreness of actually going to the dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I continue to buy replacements because they are less expensive than dental work and my family seems to need additional assistance with their dental care.</li>
            <li> Now the ONLY bad thing is..</li>
            <li> After some really bad experiences with short battery life, I had switched from Sonicare to Oral B.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at reading instructions.  </li>
            <li> Not a good value.</li>
            <li> The base can be stripped down to the travel size which provides a very small profile for a tight bathroom space.</li>
            <li> The negative part is that whatever you put the base on has to be a solid location.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was going to hurt myself trying to get it out of the tough plastic shell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t agree it&#x27;s all over, but my lips feel a little numb for about 10 minutes after I&#x27;m done brushing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Convert - Are you a little aghast at spending in excess of a hundred bucks on a toothbrush?  </li>
            <li> It gets at those difficult to reach spots between teeth that often have you shredding dental floss and getting their ragged threads stuck in hard to remove places.</li>
            <li> (I got this model because the replacement heads are the least expensive, not for the whitening feature).</li>
            <li> The travel charger fits neatly in the base of the regular charger for storage, so you just have to take it out when needed.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> There is room for two brush heads on the back of the base.      </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and it shows no sign of wear or decreased performance.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;case\\&quot; for the charger base can be removed for travel use, but the case also provides a way to tuck away the extra leftover cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips sonicare for over eight years, close as I can approximate.  </li>
            <li> this stand prevents all that gunky crap that builds up on those regular toothbrush holders/stands/etc.</li>

            <li> After a couple years of use (I&#x27;m a little late with this review), the pin that hold the brush head fell out of the base.  </li>
            <li> I want other customers to know that these toothbrushes can be very dangerous.</li>

            <li> Still it was uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> Had a difficult time choosing which sonic to purchase.  </li>

            <li> I contacted Philips again and told them that their replacement toothbrush has failed and asked if they could replace it.  </li>

            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> It might just be an awkward feeling.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it&#x27;s being returned and I will never buy from this seller again!  </li>
            <li> The worst is when you accidentally touch the hard plastic part (ie not the bristles) to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Merely plug it into the base and charge it up.</li>

            <li> Word of warning to gaggers, though - It may aggravate your gag reflex on bad days, but it&#x27;s not so bad if you can just work through it.  </li>
            <li> Well, I got sick of the dentist telling me that I was getting a receding gum line.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.  </li>

            <li> electric toothbrush that I ever used, I only gave it 3 stars.  This is due to the fact that I have only had it 1.4 years.  It suddenly became very loud and noisy.  No, I DID NOT drop it.  I don&#x27;t know what happened. Upon closer examination I discovered that the part that the brush attaches to became very loose. I assume that is what is making the loud noise.  At the same time, it does not seem to hold a charge as well as it used to. For the amount of $$$$ that it cost me, I would have thought it would have lasted for several years of use. Of course, I have had it for a year so it is to long to be able to return it.  I am just out 130.00. For this reason I would not recommend it.  If anyone from Sonicare wishes to contact me with any other options, I would be more than happy to HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOOTHBRUSH!!!!! it really deserves a 5 star.  It made a huge difference in my dental check ups.</li>
            <li> I have had my Sonic Care for a year now and just bought one for my wife and the Sonic Care For Kids for my .............. Kids. They found that it took a brushing or two to get used to the feel. I found that my breath was fresh longer and my teeth felt clean all day. My gums are much tighter as well. I suggest the Healthy White. It get the job done with out extra features I don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I had my old Sonicare Elite model for more than seven years, which is insane. The only reason I decided to upgrade was because the replacement brush heads for the Elite series cost so much more than the newer model brush heads, so I figured I&#x27;d actually save money this way. I also liked the new design and whitening feature of this Sonicare brush. So far I am very impressed by it. The new brush heads are great. Not only are they cheaper, but they also attach to the brush differently than the old ones, so you don&#x27;t get that buildup of gunk under the brush head that&#x27;s so hard to clean. Also, I think the whitening feature actually works, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not come with a separate travel charger as advertised. Instead, the main charger comes apart so you can use a more compact version when traveling. I don&#x27;t have a problem with that, but it should be more clearly advertised. Along the same lines, another reviewer mentioned that it&#x27;s easy to knock the brush off the charger. I agree with that statement. The base of this charger is different from the old one, and it doesn&#x27;t hold the brush as securely in place. However, I prefer to charge my toothbrush once a week and keep the base/charger off the counter altogether, so this really isn&#x27;t an issue for me either. This brush comes with two different size brush heads. The smaller one is supposed to be for cleaning your molars. However, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever realistically use the smaller brush head because I won&#x27;t want to keep changing the brushes back in forth. Some people might dig it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product. It is the same high quality product I have come to expect from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare power toothbrushes for years. I bought this one to replace an older model. So far it is good. I hope it lasts as long as my last one but not sure it will. This model is obviously not as well made as my older model so time will tell. The few weeks I was without my power toothbrush before the new one came is was a dreaded time when it came to using my old standby manual toothbrush. The power toothbrush does a much better job of cleaning my teeth and keeping my gums healthy. The price for this model on Amazon was the best I found online. Sams Club has Sonicare but it is a less expensive model and you have to buy 2 of them.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush arrived timely and does exactly as advertised.  It is powerful and does an outstanding job cleaning your teeth and gum line.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I have sensitive teeth and gums. This toothbrush is gentle on my gums and gets my teeth really white. I took a long time in deciding which toothbrush to buy and based on reviews I bought this one. I am very happy and recommended it to several people who also bought the toothbrush and are also very happy! I&#x27;m going to have my teeth cleaned in a couple of weeks and I&#x27;m expecting the hygenist to be pleased w/ my teeth.</li>
            <li> Been two weeks of daily usage, teeth look and feel good. Really get a sense of cleanliness. Like the timer.</li>
            <li> A few years ago - in my quest to find an electric toothbrush per my dentist&#x27;s instructions led me to stand in front of the products meticulously comparing one vs. another, did it do this that and the other, price point, etc. Oral B won for 1 reason, price and I had a coupon at Costco and their replacement heads were cheaper. That was a few years ago. I was under the impression that all electric toothbrushes were created equally. Although my teeth&#x27;s health improved, there are still issues. My last cleaning was very intense at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Oral B is almost dead - it&#x27;s been 2 years, the battery will hold for a couple of days, but not over a week like it used to. The search for the next toothbrush started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, I didn&#x27;t have a hard choice with picking Sonicare. I see the demo/advertising whatever at my dentist. I also knew I wasn&#x27;t happy with OralB - because my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean, and I knew that it was definitely not getting into all the contours of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use with my Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;I felt like a light bulb exploded in my head. It was ridiculous how clean my teeth felt, as if I just had them cleaned and polished at my dentist. How is that possible with only 1 session? Was my Oral B that bad? Maybe this was a fluke. A few more days went by, my teeth stayed with that smooth clean feeling. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s so different about it - the brush head for one. Oral B has a circular head, it spins with use. With the Sonicare, it oscillates back and forth, mimicking real tooth brushing motion. There are contours of the brush so it gets between the teeth. The bristles are stiff to clean my teeth but gentle enough to get into the gums w/o causing bleeding. Oral B brush heads were rough and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for small mouths, hard to reach areas/crevices and for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has options for sensitive and regular or whitening. I like that it&#x27;s timed so I know I&#x27;m doing the right amount. The toothbrush will shut itself off after 2 minutes. It&#x27;ll be good for kids too, so they&#x27;re not doing a swipe and say they&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, very glad I got it and can&#x27;t wait until my next dentist appointment. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and notice not only are my teeth cleaner, but they are truly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a few months - went for my cleaning and my dental hygienist noticed my teeth/gums were improving. She asked me what I did differently and told her I switched toothbrushes. HA!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE my toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/6/2010:&lt;br /&gt;Went for my cleaning yesterday - OMG! Can we say miracle? The dental hygienist was super happy to see my gums are getting healthier, when they do the measurements I&#x27;ve been getting mostly 4&#x27;s (1&#x27;s are ideal, 5&#x27;s are no good), but this time, they were at mostly 2&#x27;s with a couple of 3&#x27;s!! My gums/teeth and mouth are overall getting better with each visit. My dentist is happy with my progress - so am I!! the least amount of dental work, the happier I&#x27;ll be.t amount.

            <li> I know that it sounds cliche, even trite, to say that I&#x27;ve never used a toothbrush that is as good as this one, but it is nevertheless true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was young, maybe 10 or 11, my parent&#x27;s received some advice from our family dentist that these new electric toothbrushes were the thing to use to protect your teeth.  These were the old, rotating kind.  I forget the brand, but they were a pain to use, and they never seemed to do anything other than rattle the teeth around my mouth.  At the time I had braces, so they were double hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so the Phillips Sonicare R732 HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush(a heck of a name, isn&#x27;t it).  This brush is both subtle and effective.  It vibrates, or oscillates, instead of rotates, so it is already easier on your poor brain than the older scrub-brushes.  It also comes with two different sized brushes, a large one for general cleaning and a smaller one for \\&quot;detail\\&quot; work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has multiple settings, but I found the general cleaning setting most useful.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of tooth whitening procedures, since they usually just make me feel like I&#x27;m slowly sanding down my teeth to nubs.  The general cleaning setting leave my mouth feeling fresh and tingly, similar to after a visit to the dentist.  My gums bleed a little, but they always bleed when I floss them so I think that&#x27;s an issue with my gums and not the brush.  Although I don&#x27;t like the smaller \\&quot;detail\\&quot; brush, my wife has braces and finds that it is perfect for cleaning around her brackets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use a regular toothbrush I often have to brush a second time to get the small spots that my first brush through missed.  Not so with the Sonicare.  Even when I do a careful check, I can&#x27;t find any remnants after a good brushing.  One reason for this is that the Sonicare has a helpful feature that tells you how long to brush.  Ever 30 seconds it will vibrate, signaling you to move to another quadrant of your mouth.  After 2 minutes it shuts itself off automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is electric it requires a charging, but one overnight charge lasted me over a week of twice daily brushing, so the battery is pretty hardy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always hated electric toothbrushes, preferring the visceral feeling of a vigorous manual scrub.  The Sonicare has changed my mind, and I think I&#x27;ll be sticking with it for a while.y.

            <li> Using the Philips Sonicare Power Toothbrush is easy. Merely plug it into the base and charge it up. Once charged, I use it essentially like an ordinary toothbrush but with far superior results. The Sonicare is superb at cleaning gums, between teeth and removing the accumulated plaque and grunge that anyone who eats is forced to deal with. For those who find it difficult to floss, as I do, it will come as welcome news that the Sonicare is quite good at acting as a \\&quot;super-flosser\\&quot;. It gets at those difficult to reach spots between teeth that often have you shredding dental floss and getting their ragged threads stuck in hard to remove places. The Sonicare is easy on sensitive teeth as well. I had many fewer episodes of \\&quot;seeing stars\\&quot; when inadvertantly scraping across a sensitive tooth or patch of gum. Quite a nice power toothbrush that I find easy to recommend.</li>
            <li> I have zero experience with electric/electronic toothbrushes, so when I got this and unpacked it, I had no idea what to expect. Nor do I have any basis for comparing it to other similar products. Anyway, after charging it, I tried it out the next evening. The \\&quot;tickling\\&quot; sensation takes some getting used to, but I didn&#x27;t experience any discomfort whatsoever. One cool feature is that the brush \\&quot;pauses\\&quot; if you press it too hard against your teeth or gums. When I finished the standard 2-minute cycle, I went to ask my wife if she noticed a difference (here I should note that my teeth tend to look \\&quot;dingy\\&quot;) -- and she was shocked! She doesn&#x27;t really curse, but she stared at my teeth and said, \\&quot;That thing is f----- amazing!\\&quot; So, that&#x27;s about as solid as endorsement as you can get! Since then, I&#x27;ve been using it every other night and the results are pretty sweet. Definitely brightened up my teeth (not sure how many \\&quot;shades\\&quot; worth) and left them feeling nice.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. I have nothing to say other than that I wish I had bought one years ago.</li>
            <li> I got this one on Clearance for $64.98. I was very impressed after the first time use. You can tell it works. I bought it because of my dental hygienists recommendation. I am just glad that I did. It can brush way better than what I could have done with a regular toothbrush in hard to reach places (in the right way). I will highly recommend this product to everybody.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I have only been using it for a week so I am not sure if it is whitening my teeth yet, but the feel of the toothbrush is amazing.  I like it and I am glad I bought it.  Also, in shipment my toothbrush never made it to me and Amazon was great about sending another one.  No questions were asked they just sent it to me.  What great customer service!</li>
            <li> For those of you, who have never used a Sonicare toothbrush, I highly recommend it.  I am old enough to have gum issues and using Sonicare halted degeneration and, in some cases, improved it.  Aside from that, when you brush your teeth, it feels like you&#x27;ve just had a professional cleaning.  Terrific!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my husband.  He loves how clean his teeth feel after using it.  However, he has been using it for over 2 months with whitening tooth paste and haven&#x27;t really seen a difference. I&#x27;m considering getting one!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product about a month ago. Performing excellent. Battery life is superb, and the cleaning power is exceptional.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes since they first came out and have loved each one.  This latest, however, is much better from a a number of factors, not the least of which is the cleanliness of toothbrush attachment to the handle.  It takes no time at all to detach the brush head and wipe away the remaining toothpast (and germs), unlike prior models where I let the gunk build up--disgusting.  In addition, when using the whiteninng button, which gives one an additional 30 seconds of cleaning, my teeth actually feel and look cleaner and whiter.  I don&#x27;t know that they are whiter, but immediately after the brushing they look whiter, and feel dentist clean.  The one drawback is that if I choose to turn the toothbrush on to clean my tongue, after the brush has completed it&#x27;s rotation through my teeth, I must turn the brush off 3 times before it goes off. This is because the toothbrush must hit each cycle, i.e. normal, sensitive, and white before turning off--unless I&#x27;m missing something.  I&#x27;m not good at reading instructions.  I&#x27;m a plug and play gal.</li>
            <li> Sonicare R732. Great product, but nix the automatic shut off! We know when we&#x27;ve completed brushing.</li>
            <li> After a dental visit- I was told to get a Sonicare to help prevent further gum erosion from my brushing \\&quot;style\\&quot;.  Researched all &amp; settled on this one based on the reviews. Could not be happier unless I had bought the one with 2.  Charge lasts about 2 weeks.  Travel case fits the product &amp; 2 brushes &amp; 1 little tube of paste.  Would buy again if anything happened to this one.  Gum erosion has been arrested according to recent checkup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush, but the only whitening benefit you get from this is from running it an extra 30 seconds. This is achieved with a different setting that requires one to push the on switch 3 times to set it to \\&quot;whitening\\&quot;. Since the whole system is called \\&quot;Healthy White\\&quot;, it seems that it would make more sense for this to be the default setting. Overall this doesn&#x27;t seem any better than the basic Sonicare, but it&#x27;s more expensive. I would just stick with the basic one if I had it to do over again.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t have any use for the extra features (clean and white) I bought this model over the Elite because of the negative reviews regarding keeping the Elite clean. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and so far so good. It cleans my teeth better I can with a manual brush and it is more gentle on my gums. If the battery lasts like it should, I won&#x27;t have any complaints. It seems (to me) like a lot of money to spend on a toothbrush, but I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the toothbrush&#x27;s functionality - it works fast, charges quickly, does what it promises to do. It&#x27;s reasonably quiet and it has a useful feature for people who are not used to with electrical toothbrushes - when you just start using it, it gradually adds power during 14 washing cycles until it slowly reaches to it&#x27;s full capacity. It comes with a travel box, which i guess is useful, but i must admit not for the kind of travels i usually go to. When you are a backpacker, the last thing you want to take with you is a bulky unnecessarily big plastic box which will take up a lot of space and in the same time not offer any special functionality. There&#x27;s also this little feature on the toothbrush that really annoys the hell out of me - when you turn the toothbrush on, the program will only work in 2 minute cycles. 30 seconds per every section of the mouth. I usually feel that 2 minutes is about 1 minute too little for my needs and i have to restart the cycle manually once more, because as soon as 2 minutes are up, the toothbrush just stops working. I really wish i could turn off this feature, because it&#x27;s unnecessary and annoying. I don&#x27;t need a toothbrush to tell me when i should stop brushing.     Other than that i&#x27;m very happy. I made a long research before buying that particular brush and it seems i&#x27;ve made a good choice.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare R732 HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the old style with the larger head; the unit has worked fine for 5-6 years. I finally traded up to the new small design; it&#x27;s great.  I wish I had bought the new R732 sooner; light weight with the same power; just the right amount of options without overkill like the R900 series and not enough like the R710.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 5 star product[[ASIN:B0019ZGU1S Philips Sonicare R732 HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> Have used Sonicare for a few years.  Terrific product.  The brush head design on this one is a great improvement!  Much easier to clean because there&#x27;s no buildup like in the older designs.  I was a little skeptical of the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; mode, but I honestly think it works.  Maybe because it&#x27;s at a higher intensity.  (The \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; mode seems a bit useless though.)  As I thought I would be, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> We have had a Sonicare for over six years - another model.  We were quite happy with the first.  This one so far exceeds the other.  The triple function provides great choice.</li>
            <li> I have not used any others to compare with. I have no problems with the product. What more to you want?</li>
            <li> what to add that others didn&#x27;t say yet...not much. I was confused by how many different Sonicare there are. This one gives you all the cleaning power without the addons, so for me was best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest electric toothbrush I have ever owned! You get that clean, just-from-the-dentist feeling every time you brush. My teeth have definitely gotten a few shades whiter since I started using it 10 days ago. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 was that the unit is difficult to pause while you are doing a final rinse. If you don&#x27;t turn the unit off, it splashes water everywhere, but because there are 3 different cycles to choose from, you have to cycle through one or two to get to the off position. Apparently there is a way to pause the unit, although I have not been able to master it&#x27;s function. Perhaps that&#x27;s just something I need to get used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now. It is my first electronic toothbrush. I really believe it is the only way I will brush my teeth for two minutes at a time. It also makes my teeth feel very clean--nearly dentist clean with flossing. The vibrating was uncomfortable at first and I still don&#x27;t like it when I accidentally touch my teeth with the plastic head moving, but I think this will keep my teeth healthy. I have not tried the whitening setting yet (I got this model because the replacement heads are the least expensive, not for the whitening feature). I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist!  I love this toothbrush.  My teeth feel super smooth against my tongue and they do seem noticeably whiter.  I like that there is a beep every 30 seconds to help you time your brushing for your entire mouth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush seems comparable to other Sonicare units I&#x27;ve owned.  It claims to have a whitening technology by using a special brush vibration at the end of the normal teeth cleaning cycle but I don&#x27;t believe it make any difference at all.  If I had to do it again I&#x27;d probably choose a more economical model.  Otherwise, it works just well as other Sonicare brushes I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;ll continue buying these Sonicare brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> This model Sonicare was an upgrade for me.  I have used this product for twenty years and can never get enough of the clean feeling.  The three modes are practical and useful when you might need that extra care.  The design and handling is good to maneuver and slim enough for an adequate grip. Hard-side travel case is included with other extras.  Very good price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time for me to try a Phillips, and i must say: I love it&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed it&#x27;s cleaning from the first 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;great with three modes, and never hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> There is such a heavy level of competition in the power toothbrush market, it becomes confusing and annoying trying to figure out which one would be right for you.  There are also factors to consider when selecting something specific to \\&quot;whitening\\&quot;.  And it all comes down to your commitment to work on preventative care as the result of your lifestyle.  Be it smoking (why are people still smoking?... THAT is confusing), or consuming coffee, wine and other staining food and drink.  You need to take dental hygiene more seriously.  Your mouth is the cause to most sickness, and gum disease is a lot more than about losing teeth.  There are serious risks to careless brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, a tool such as the Philips Sonicare R732 HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush should be on the top of your list.  I would like to get the cons out of the way, and the reason for no fifth star.  First of all, price.  It just seems to me, in this growing market, that a list price of $139.00 is about twice the price it should be.  Considering you will need to buy a new brush head at least every three months at $8 a pop, it seems to me that a proprietary refill requirement should bring the base investment down.  It would also sell more units, and better to sell at half the price and keep the customer.  And if it&#x27;s a quality product, the customer will use it more than two years.  But, at this current price, it is in fact an investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other slightly less than stellar notes are cosmetic.  The charging base is interesting, and I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s charging.  You place the power brush unit onto a plastic prong on the base.  There are no metal parts exposed, and it&#x27;s unclear as to how the power is being delivered.  It&#x27;s not a negative thing, just interesting.  The negative part is that whatever you put the base on has to be a solid location.  i.e. if you bump the shelf or table it&#x27;s on, and it wobbles at all, there is nothing holding the brush on it&#x27;s base.  It is a problem for me as I have no safe place to put it without risk of it falling.  I wish there was a click in place and release to it.  There are two prongs on the back of the charger for the brush heads, which are a little more sturdy.  But, I have already knocked this over several times.  It&#x27;s a problem.  There&#x27;s a travel case thing that holds the tool and two brush heads.  But not the charger.  Not exactly sure the use for this as I would not travel with it, and have no use for the case at home, and it would be easier to bring a normal toothbrush... not to mention airport security, and the fact that it&#x27;s not exactly light.  And then there is the color code rings to put on the brush head... pick your color of blue, grey or green now, as you will almost immediately lose the other color rings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good... it does the job, well, and more than you would expect.  It literally gets you into a timed routine built into the brush tool.  Beeps to tell you when you are done cleaning, whitening, etc... all with different pulses and locations to brush at certain intervals.  This is actually taken a bit for granted.... your toothbrush is teaching you how to care for your teeth, and you don&#x27;t need to think.  So, if you cannot chew gum and talk at the same time, this is for you!  After a couple weeks of use, I definitely feel the difference and I&#x27;m actually confident my teeth and gums feel their best ever.  I am a compulsive brusher, and don&#x27;t smoke, hardly drink etc. so \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; is really not something of concern.  So I cannot notice any whiter effects, but a little bit on my back teeth, which makes sense.  It claims to whiten two shades in two weeks, and I am expecting that it&#x27;s fairly accurate, especially if you are a nicotine addict or major coffee drinker etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a good investment that should be under $100.  You will appreciate the brushing modes and routines, and feel confident it is doing quite a bit of work for you.  You feel like you have been to the Dentist after first couple uses, and then never go back to a normal toothbrush again.  The replacement brush heads come with head covers, in two sizes, and are about $8 each, which they recommend changing every 3 months.  Kids may enjoy this due to the electronic aspect, beeps and tech feel, which in turn will promote better brushing habits.  This package comes with one brush head of both sizes.  -- Speaking of the box and package, it took me about 10 minutes to get the thing out of the box. I&#x27;m not kidding.  A bit annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wise investment in better dental care that will pay off with fewer Dentist visits.een to the Dentist after first couple uses, and then never go back to a normal toothbrush again.

            <li> I have owned a Sonicare for almost a decade now, so I can attest to the product&#x27;s quality and effectiveness. I am on my third one now (I broke the second one---no fault of the manufacturer). The Sonicare is awesome: quiet, very effective and long-lasting. I hope to be a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Philips Sonicare for the last year [[ASIN:B000NSR69C Philips Sonicare Elite 9650 Power Toothbrush Custom Care System 2 Handles, 3 Brush Heads]] and have been very happy with it. This R732 is very similar to it except that it adds on an extra 30 seconds to the regular 2 minutes so that you can focus on the front teeth for extra whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theoretically, you could just brush with any other Philips toothbrush for extra 30 seconds for the whitening process. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in movement over the [[ASIN:B000NSR69C Philips Sonicare Elite 9650 Power Toothbrush Custom Care System 2 Handles, 3 Brush Heads]] that I use currently, in which you get 2 handles and 3 brush heads (2 regular, one small). The extra handle means both you and your partner can use it, charging it alternately in the charger, which makes it a better bargain. The R732 gives you only one handle and 1 regular and 1 small (for precision) brush head. It also comes with a travel case and a deluxe travel charger like most other Sonicare toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve not used an electric toothbrush before, you&#x27;ll be surprised by how intense it can feel. The bristles really move with \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; speed and give your teeth an intense power clean. You get cleaner teeth than ever before and no furry build up even after 18 hours. It&#x27;s so much easier to brush your back teeth than with a normal toothbrush, the timer even times you by beeping after every 30 seconds for each quadrant and an extra 30 seconds for whitening. I&#x27;ve used other brands like [[ASIN:B000V4O1UA Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush]] and did not get the same clean feeling or whiteness as with the Sonicare series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have used the Philips Sonicare Elite series before, you&#x27;re already familiar with this brush. The good thing about this one over the Elite series is that it works on 110V as well as 220V so you can use it for international trips, the elite series works only on 110V. The design of the brush head has also changed slightly making the brush a little smaller and the brush head is easier to clean than the earlier screw-on brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for extra whitening action and can give another 30 sec to your brushing routine, the R732 makes it easy for you.d slightly making the brush a little smaller and the brush head is easier to clean than the earlier screw-on brush heads.

            <li> I have used the battery operated unit also chargable for 15 years and will no longer purchase these product due to quality control? Charger does not last. Thats why I said keep your receipt. They will repair it, but I realized over the past years that the quaily of their products have changed. I purchased 5 toothbrushes in the last 3 years for family member. 2 chargeable and 2 battery operated they arent working properly. The battery operated should stay on for 2 minutes more, its more like 15 seconds and shuts off. The 2 with charges one was purchased used for a little over a year , So we replaced it with another on a year later that one isnt working. Purchased a new battery operated one. We will see how long this one lasts.  Finally called customer service and spoke with Thomas in Canada. I guess its my fault. I didnt keep my receipt. Wanted to help me trouble to repair. When I spend $80.00 to $100.00 or $40.00 on a battery operated one I expect it to last more than one year. Especially becaused earlier products did last.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Sonicare Healthy White.  (I ordered it about 2 months ago.)  I specifically wanted to buy a Sonicare tooth brush because I started using my boyfriend&#x27;s Sonicare Elite a few months ago and LOVED it.  My teeth felt really smooth, polished, and clean - just like after a trip to the dentist.  After that, my teeth just didn&#x27;t feel as clean when I used my own manual tooth brush.    So I read up on all the Philips models (and a few non-Philips models, too, like Oral B and Water Pik) and chose the Healthy White mainly for the Sensitive cleaning option.  (I have sensitive teeth and have had to use sensitive tooth paste for several years consecutively.)  But I actually haven&#x27;t needed to use the Sensitive option at all; the regular brushing option (as well as the extra 30 seconds tagged on at the end to whiten teeth) hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive teeth at all.  But it&#x27;s nice to know that I have the option if I start having sensitivity problems.    I also chose the Healthy White because I didn&#x27;t care about the little UV cleaning things.  In my opinion, their supposed function just does not justify the extra expense.  Besides, if you replace the brush head every 3  months like they recommend, you really aren&#x27;t going to get any dangerous germs or mold building up, anyway.    I really like the new style of brush heads (\\&quot;Pro\\&quot; they&#x27;re calling them now) - they&#x27;re a little bit slimmer over-all than the older style brush heads, but the bristle portion is actually bigger, so it covers more tooth area at a time. I&#x27;m not crazy about the \\&quot;precision\\&quot; brush head that they include in the package - it seems a bit superfluous to me.    Battery power is very good.  I use it between 2 and 3 times daily, and only have to charge it about every week and a half. (And the charging cycle doesn&#x27;t take long at all.)  It comes in a hard case with space for the body of the brush and two brush heads, which is great for traveling.  After all, if you&#x27;re going to spend this much money on a tooth brush, you don&#x27;t want it breaking in your suit case!    So is it worth the money?  I say YES, definitely.  And you don&#x27;t even have to get the newest, baddest version, either.  My boyfriend has had his Sonicare Elite for several years, and it&#x27;s still going strong and working great.  (There&#x27;s almost no difference that I can detect between the cleaning power of his tooth brush and my new one.)  So whether you get this model or an older one, I think you will be very satisfied.  (That is, if you stick with Sonicare.  From what my dentist says and from what my family members&#x27; dentists say too, it&#x27;s really not worth getting an expensive electric tooth brush UNLESS you go with Sonicare.)     So get one!  Your teeth will seriously never feel cleaner.  (Unless you want to go to the dentist twice a day.)</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare - I&#x27;ve been using a Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrush.     I thought I was going to hurt myself trying to get it out of the tough plastic shell. But once I got it open it was easy to set up. I like the clean, white color and the minimalist look of the base. The travel case is awesome to take on vacation. I took the charger with me, but didn&#x27;t need it even with two people using the toothbrush for 12 days.     The Sonicare was difficult for me to get used to - the vibration is way more extreme than the Oral-B. It had me jumping out of my skin with ticklishness. It&#x27;s fine now, but it took a while. The sensitive cycle helped me acclimate a little.    It does a wonderful job of cleaning - I got it right after a trip to the dentist and my teeth still feel dentist-clean. I don&#x27;t feel the need to bear down with too much pressure when it&#x27;s on. I have also been using less toothpaste - it really foams it up. The quad timer is a nice feature. It stops after two minutes, and I&#x27;d rather it continue until I stopped it, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.     The unit and replacement brushes are more expensive than my other toothbrush, the packaging was a one-time pain, and the vibration took a lot of getting used to. But in spite of all that, I think this is my new electric toothbrush of choice - it works well and as a red wine drinker I&#x27;ll be interested to see if it does keep my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> Back in Sept 2007 I got my hands on the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer. I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- two different size brushes depending on your mouth size&lt;br /&gt;- Timer to ensure you hit all 4 quadrants of your mouth in a 2 minute timeframe&lt;br /&gt;- additional travel charger&lt;br /&gt;- UV sanitizer to kill bacteria on the brush heads and it has a charger built into the stand&lt;br /&gt;- 3 Modes: Clean, Sensitive Teeth and Massage&lt;br /&gt;- 2 year warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product for under $150 now on Amazon. Considering you could spend (with insurance ) $100 for a simple filling, this is a worthy investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now 10 months later arrives the Philips Sonicare R732 HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is basically the same (2 brush heads, travel charger, etc.) . . .except . . . no UV Cleaner/charger and no Massage mode. Instead of Massage mode you get a \\&quot;whitening mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOWHERE in the product description or the documentation can I find what the extra \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; feature is or does. From what I can tell, whitening mode an additional 30 seconds of cleaning of the front visible teeth after you&#x27;ve done the initial 2 minute Clean mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing other than a longer timer!&lt;br /&gt;You could easily just start the quadrant timer all over again if you wanted more brushing time and stop it when you&#x27;ve had enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;Both of these are great toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want the UV Cleaner/Charger combo get the R732 model and save about $20. But for ONLY $20 more,you get the Flexcare, which in essence gives you two chargers. . .the one that sits on the counter with the UV cleaner and the travel charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both use the same brush head replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this a 3 star due to the blatant marketing ploy of the product. But because it is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever experienced, it gets bumped to a 4 star.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has a few nice features that really set it apart from other rechargeable power toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past. First, the travel case and smaller travel charger are a nice touch. Power toothbrushes can be a bit large and often generic plastic travel covers do not fit over the heads, making them impractical to pack. This brush is not only smaller than other brushes I&#x27;ve tried, but it comes with both plastic caps to snap over the brush head but a travel case to hold everything that is about the size of a glasses case. The charger is small and lets you easily wind up the cord and toss it in a toiletry bag. As for the brush itself, it contains a few more nice bonuses. I loved the setting that gradually increases the brush&#x27;s power over a period of 2 weeks to get you used to it. When I first started using a power toothbrush, I found it a bit strong at first. This setting can be easily turned on and off whenever you need (or don&#x27;t) it. I have already begun to notice a difference in the shades of my teeth. I won&#x27;t guess as to how much whiter they are, but I can clearly see an improvement.</li>
            <li> I love my original Philips Sonicare toothbrush so was looking forward to seeing what the \\&quot;Healthy White\\&quot; version would do for my teeth.  Sadly, although a great power toothbrush that certainly does a better job of cleaning your teeth than a manual type or even a regular cheap battery toothbrush, I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in the color of my teeth after over two weeks&#x27; use.  This toothbrush is advertised to actually improve the whiteness of one&#x27;s teeth so it fails in that; however as a power toothbrush, you can&#x27;t do better than a Philips Sonicare so on that point alone, it succeeds.  Just don&#x27;t purchase this and expect any miracles.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush.  Teeth feel very clean. The charge light is just right ( not annoying like my former brush. ) It is much easier to keep clean also.</li>
            <li> I used to own three oral-B sonic for eight years and two of them fail on me so I decided to give Philips a try. My kids still using one oral-B but it starts to fail. They need to press the button many times in order to get it work.  The design of Philips is much better than oral-B. For the oral-B, water always get between the removal tooth brush and the unit and damage one of the unit.  The Philips two-in-one design charger is also very good. I have to purchased a smaller traveler charger for my oral-B.  As of this point (not sure about the battery life), the Philips is 110% better than the oral-B.  I read some previous comments before regarding the removal tooth brush fell off the Philips when use. I will never see that happen on mine. I believe they didn&#x27;t push the tooth brush all the way in.</li>
            <li> Failed  after 2 years, i.e. 61 hours of use.  Seems too quick.</li>
            <li> I liked my sonicare toothbrush. Initially I liked it a lot and convinced multiple family members to switch to these brushes. I liked it until it died exactly 2 years to the day. I called customer support to find out if there was any way to troubleshoot the issue or if it had in fact died. They immediately told me it was gone and no longer under warranty, so I could have 15% off a new brush from their website. What!? These are expensive toothbrushes and apparently they now make them to last only 2 years. (My husbands toothbrush is still going strong after almost 6 years and is an older model) My sister&#x27;s brush recently died as well at near the 2 year mark. Based on my limited experience, it appears as though the quality of their products has deteriorated. The customer service person informed me that the battery in my brush should last 3-5 years, but mine just died earlier. Lucky me. I would think Phillips would treat their customers better if they wanted to develop any kind of brand loyalty. My Oral B toothbrush lasted significantly longer and cost less. Between the price of the unit and the replacement brushes coupled with the total lack of customer support- I would stay away from Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare toothbrush range utilises ultrasonic cleaning (as used in hospital sterile service units to clean the gunk off surgical instruments) in addition to the physical vibration of the bristles on the teeth. You don&#x27;t need to move or agitate the brush: just hold it to the teeth upper, lower, left, right, inside, outside then rinse when finished. A timer is incorporated which issues an audible signal every 30 seconds, repeated four times to ensure upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right areas are cleaned properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had other makes of electric toothbrush in the past which use the word \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; in the product description but few actually employ genuine ultrasonic cleaning technology like these from Philips (the Oral B range also uses genuine ultrasonic cleaning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are removable for transportation and may be changed or renewed regularly, and in our case there have been no issues with the head working loose as reported by a minority of reviewers here. If you have two toothbrushes in the bathroom, the handles come colour-coded so you don&#x27;t get mixed up. However if you do have two brushes, an irritating minor issue will soon become evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for use insist the toothbrushes should be kept on the charging base (a clever device which works well and only exposes sealed plastic to sealed plastic, so is effectively waterproof). However keeping both brushes on the charging base is simply not possible as no twin charger is available, so if you have two brushes then they have to be charged alternately. Almost no bathroom is fitted with more than one electric razor/toothbrush power socket, so buying two separate chargers will not solve this problem. This is a minor design fault, as mentioned by another reviewer, which quickly becomes obvious (and slightly irksome) to the new user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another consideration is that these are almost the most expensive electric toothbrushes on the market, but worth it if you value good dental hygiene. Again, in our case they have proved to be 100% reliable in service so over time the initial outlay evens out.dental hygiene.

            <li> This is the greatest toothbrush ever I found. Yes, it is pricy, but it is worth spending money for. I am a chemist working in a pharmaceutical lab. I mix solid materials in solution as part of my routine work. When the material does not dissolve, we use a device called sonicator. Sonicator vibrates the solution and its micro speed vibration helps solid materials to dissolve in solution. It is essentially the same principle as this toothbrush uses. When I use the Sonicare toothbrush, I can feel that all the small pieces of materials are removed from mouth by the vibration technique and mouth is cleaner. This technique is patented by Sonicare.</li>
            <li> To me the Sonicare is a great example of new technology improving one&#x27;s daily life. It&#x27;s actually fun to brush my teeth and they feel cleaner than ever. The other day I had to use a regular toothbrush and it felt like each individual bristle was so large. It felt like the brush really wasn&#x27;t getting into the small spaces between teeth the way my Sonicare does. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Sonicare products, though I did chuckle when I saw what seemed to be a somewhat unfortunate choice of name - \\&quot;Healthy (White Power) Toothbrush,\\&quot; obviously not what they intended!    I&#x27;ve used this long enough to get used to the slightly awkward tilt of the brush&#x27;s angle - which (oddly) now seems more comfortable than a normal toothbrush.  And while I&#x27;m a fervent changer of toothbrushes, the heads on this baby are kind of pricey, although they&#x27;re holding up pretty well after many uses.      This comes with a little travel thing, which is nice.  You have to be a little careful changing speed, because you do that while it&#x27;s on (I found myself using the fast speed in the morning, a slower one later in the day, and I occasionally forget to change the speed until the toothpaste is on), but that&#x27;s not even a complaint.    While the price on these seems high to me (about what a DVD player might be), it will probably - and I&#x27;m not being facetious here - save its cost in great dental check-ups, the prevention of cavities and the excruciating pain-in-the-butt of lengthy cleanings, as previous Sonicare toothbrushes have.  Looking at it that way, I don&#x27;t know why anyone would use a normal toothbrush.  My teeth feel great!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great, I can&#x27;t compare it with other electric toothbrushes because I have never owned one before but I love the Philips Sonicare R732/HX6732/02 HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush.  I bought it because my gums were very inflamed, they bled often when I brushed them and were generally unhealthy. Switching from a regular toothbrush to this one made a huge difference, my gums are much healthier now. The battery life is also great, I brought the toothbrush on a 10 day trip and didn&#x27;t have to charge it at all.   One thing I would say is that the multiple settings are not really necessary. I have a super sensitive mouth so I thought I would have use for the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting but actually I just use the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; setting every time.  There are less expensive models with fewer settings, these might be worth checking out.  In retrospect I would have bought one of those.  I have only used the smaller, round brush head so I can&#x27;t speak to the difference between the two.</li>
            <li> I just replaced an older model Sonicaire toothbrush with this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Love the 30 second timer for each quadrant while brushing. Bought a second one for my wife. Cleaning and whiteness are excellent.</li>
            <li> This brush is everything it promised. Teeth are whiter and the brush gets to even the hard to reach spots well. We had an older Sonicare brush and compared to this model it was clunky. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.  my teeth havent been this clean in years.  i considered teeth whitening but now it is not necessary.  luv the timer.  stays charged.  i bought one for my daughter, the junior version.  she doesnt complain about brushing at all and she always waits until timer is complete.</li>
            <li> We had not realized just how weak our old Sonicare (ca. 2004) was getting until it actually started intermittently cutting out during the 2-minute cycle.  We ordered this Sonicare to replace it and it feels SO GOOD.  My skull feels like it&#x27;s going to crack.  This is one powerful toothbrush and our teeth feel clean again.  We have decided to replace our Sonicare every 3 years just so we don&#x27;t end up with a flaccid brushing experience like we did with the old one.</li>
            <li> After reading favorable reviews ion the product, I ordered it. I&#x27;ve had it about a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great design, powerful, and my mouth feels GREAT afterwards!!  :)</li>
            <li> I had an electric toothbrush (an old Philips sonicare) before, this one is far superior to it. The 3 stages it has to clean, is great. But takes a little getting use to because the old one had just one. However it seems it is not as durable, or water proof as the other one. It gives you that &#x27;just got out of the dentist&#x27; clean feeling.</li>
            <li> My first week of usage I could feel the difference. I just felt like my teeth were cleaner and with the built in timer I know I was brushing longer.</li>
            <li> very powerful -- I can feel my teeth are cleaner.  Had a good check-up, too.  The whole family can share one handle and just buy heads.  The kids can use this one, too, and they like it.</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare is a trusted name in the industry.  This product continues to support this statement.  We are very pleased with its performance; it is a unique tool in our effort to achieve optimum dental care.</li>
            <li> I have now used two electric toothbrushes, both Philips Sonicaare models and have been very pleased with each on. This toothbrush offers the quality of a Sonicare with the added feature of whitening (which is just a different &#x27;pulse&#x27; of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not really verify the whitening claim or deny it either. It seems in order to really tell one would need a color chart from the dentist and see if there is an actual change or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other toothbrush I have tried is the [[ASIN:B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush without UV Sanitizer]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In direct comparisson to this one. I like the Sonicare R910 better. For a couple of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - It has a feature that you can select the cleaning mode before turing on the toothbrush. This takes away from guess work and pushing a button several times while trying to not spray toothpaste anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - It has a On the Go mode, which means it&#x27;s a quick version of the quadpacer timing for those times when you are in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I like better about this particular model though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - The inclusion of the two brusk heads, regular and compact. This allows the user to find out which works best for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - The travel case for this one is fantastic. The case for the R910 is a simple cloth pouch. The case for this one though is a hard plastic case that has spots for everything. Much, much nicer in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution though about this toothbrush. Have a saw handy, or some other super sharp object. The packaging for this is near impossible to penetrate, no joke I literally broke a scissors trying to get into it. Even my tin snips proved futile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good toothbrush, if they would have included a couple features from the R910 it would have been perfect. In the end I give the R910 a slight edge over this one. You can&#x27;t go wrong with either though.</li>
            <li> After using the Sonicare HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush for two weeks,&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be an excellent product, consistent with all recent Sonicare electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find the packaging to be somewhat of an impediment to removing the&lt;br /&gt;unit from its protective plastic casing, but once out, the unit felt solid and well built; it was also very straightforward and easy to figure out.  Instructions were easy to follow and quick to comprehend. The unit comes with two brush heads (one standard size and one compact size) which can be color-coded, making it convenient for couples to share. Also included in the box is a charger with a handy cord wrap for easy portability, a storage case for the brush heads (together with travel caps for brush head hygiene), and a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is powerful and works well in all cleaning modes. There are three cleaning modes, \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; which is the standard two minute brushing mode, \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; for people who have sensitive gums (this mode may also be useful if you&#x27;re new to electric toothbrushes and want to start out with a gentler cleaning cylce at first), and \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; which adds an extra thirty seconds to the standard \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode so you can focus on the front teeth. Philips claims by using the \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; mode, you&#x27;re guaranteed to have your teeth two shades whiter in two weeks. In each cleaning mode, you are notified at thirty-second intervals by a slight pause in the motor when to switch areas, so thirty seconds are intended for each of the four quadrants of your teeth.  (I should note that this Sonicare model does not have a audible sound for each thirty-second interval like other Sonicare models, but one gets used to the pauses in the motor in lieu of the typical sound.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of using the \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; mode, I did notice my teeth to be at best a shade whiter. My teeth are white to begin with, so if you have teeth that are stained from coffee, red wine, or tobacco, you will probably see better results.  (However, this additional cleaning mode seemed somewhat of a gimmick to me, since it&#x27;s no more than a longer cycle to clean your teeth.  Sonicare has obviously jumped on the lucrative \\&quot;whiter teeth\\&quot; bandwagon that is common with various kinds of toothpaste and whitening strips.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I particularly liked about the Sonicare Toothbrush is the shape of the brush head. It does feel like it penetrates well into the small crevices between the teeth and gums. Also, I liked being able to use a very small amount of toothpaste for effective brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I feel could be improved about the product is that you&#x27;re not able to start in the \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; mode. You need to press the start button to turn the motor on, then press it two more times (Clean &gt; Sensitive &gt; Clean and White), and if you have toothpaste on the brush head, it WILL vibrate off instantly. So you need to start with the unit off and the brush head in place in your mouth before you press the button three times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the Sonicare HealthyWhite Toothbrush is an excellent product. While I still think that the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush cleans a bit better and longer than the Sonicare products, all of the Sonicare products, including the HealthyWhite Toothbrush, are top notch.  Once you use a good electric toothbrush, there is simply no going back to a manual brush.ee better results.

            <li> I used one of the Elite series for several years, although not always for the recommended 2 minutes (but still got excellent reviews from my dental hygienist).  I ordered the HealthyWhite after reading so many positive reviews about the cleanliness issue (the Elites get gunky around the connection).  I have used the HealthyWhite regularly for about 6 weeks now, as instructed (2 1/2 minutes).  I&#x27;m not sure my teeth are whiter (no color chart available), but they feel noticeably cleaner than before -- I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s due to the instrument or to the time I&#x27;m investing in the process, but the result makes me happy.    I do not like the power button (a soft button).  I have to push it once to turn on the power and a second and third time to get to the whitening cycle (the second push puts it into the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; cycle, which I don&#x27;t want to use).  So ... I have to push the power button three times -- very frustrating since I find it rather hard to push even once at the angle it&#x27;s in with the brush in my mouth (the only way to not spray toothpaste and water everywhere).  With time, I may get better at it.    Even with my complaint, I like the HealthyWhite enough to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Used my old toothbrush last about 4 years using it twice a day.  This new one is a great replacement, love the Sonicare movement.  Battery last at least 2 weeks without recharging making it great for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the e-series Sonicare Toothbrush for more than a year and have been very pleased with it, so I was excited to try the newest Sonicare power toothbrush with a whitening feature.  It was easy to set up, but it was a little difficult for me to learn how to \\&quot;program\\&quot; the toothbrush to the \\&quot;clean and whiten\\&quot; setting.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week so haven&#x27;t seen too much difference, but it may take a bit longer to see a difference.  However, there is nothing that will get your mouth cleaner (except a visit to the dental hygienist) than a power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is similar to the [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]] in many ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It gives you \\&quot;dentist clean\\&quot; with every brushing&lt;br /&gt;2. It breaks you in gently to the sonic cleaning experience&lt;br /&gt;3.  You have a choice of two brushing heads with caps, and it uses the same brushes as the FlexCare.&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s easy to set up and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;5. There&#x27;s an indicator to tell you when it needs recharging&lt;br /&gt;6. It has a timer that lets you know when the recommended brushing time is up, with a thirty second indicator for switching your brushing zones&lt;br /&gt;7. It comes with a small charger for when you&#x27;re traveling, and a case for the toothbrush and heads&lt;br /&gt;8. The base of the charger has a groove where you can tuck away some of the power cord so it doesn&#x27;t dangle or tangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The differences are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This one is geared towards tooth whitening, particularly for teeth stained by the usual suspects like coffee and tobacco&lt;br /&gt;2. There are three brushing modes (The FlexCare has three modes and two routines)&lt;br /&gt;i. Clean&lt;br /&gt;ii. Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;iii. Clean and White (Clean mode plus 30 seconds for whitening your front teeth)&lt;br /&gt;3. You can only switch between modes when the toothbrush is turned on, so if you want the Sensitive mode, you have to apply toothpaste and press the start button twice.  It&#x27;s better to do this with the toothbrush in your mouth if you don&#x27;t want toothpaste all over the bathroom mirror and sink.&lt;br /&gt;4. The travel charger fits neatly in the base of the regular charger for storage, so you just have to take it out when needed.&lt;br /&gt;5. This model doesn&#x27;t have the UV Sanitizer (sold separately) but has places for brush heads for two users.  It comes with color rings for identification purposes.&lt;br /&gt;6. The travel case is made of sturdy white plastic with compartments for the brush and two heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is recommended for the couple that smokes and/or drinks coffee, tea or red wine together, to make sure they stay together with white and healthy smiles.  It&#x27;s also pretty good for smokin&#x27; singles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Richards, July 3, 2008ite and healthy smiles.  It&#x27;s also pretty good for smokin&#x27; singles.

            <li> I purchased my first Sonicare from my dentist about three years ago, and I&#x27;ve always loved how it made my teeth feel so much cleaner than after a manual brushing. I also liked that its timer reminded me to brush the full two minutes I know I should. With my new HealthyWhite model I get all of that plus a bonus whitening option and a \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; design.    With this model, I&#x27;m  reminded to give an extra 30 seconds attention to my visible front teeth when I select the optional clean and white mode. In addition to the extra time, there&#x27;s also a slight change in motion for the final 30 seconds in that mode. (There&#x27;s also the regular two-minute clean mode if you don&#x27;t have an extra 30 seconds to spare, and the sensitive option for those with sensitive teeth.) I use the clean and white mode because I want those whiter teeth it promises.    I can&#x27;t honestly say for sure that I now whiter teeth -- I just don&#x27;t know how I could measure that -- but I keep looking and I think I am seeing a difference. I would like to suggest that the manufacturer include with purchase a little chart showing various shades of white, along with shades of stain, so the user can easily measure progress. I do think the extra attention is almost sure to result in whiter teeth.     As to my love for the new \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; design, if you also have an older model, you know what I mean. My previous model was very hard to keep clean and I hated that. This model doesn&#x27;t have the big hole in the handle where the brush was inserted and which collected lime and slime that was hard to get out. Clean is the best word I can think of to describe this model&#x27;s design. Without the crevices and cavities of previous models, this design is always clean and fresh with no more effort than the simple rinse with hot water that you would normally give a manual brush after use.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare line of power toothbrushes is an excellent tool for maintenance of healthy teeth and gums and this latest example adds an element of portability that lets you take it on the road in a minimum of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare method centers around getting you to spend the right amount of time on brushing your teeth. A built-in timer gives you 2 minutes of brushing time. To ensure that all your teeth get proper attention, the timer has four 30-second sections, divided by a brief pause. The manual shows you how to divide your mouth into quadrants - upper outer, upper inner, lower outer and lower inner - and each quadrant should get 30 seconds of brushing. This is common to all Sonicare toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HealthyWhite toothbrush has a Clean and White mode, which adds two additional 15-second timer periods, during which you should give additional brushing time to your front teeth, upper and lower. This additional time will help clean coffee, tea, tobacco and other stains from your most visible teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush comes with a nice compact case that carries the handle and two brushes. The small charging stand can have its cord wrapped inside to make it even more compact. The brush heads have small plastic covers that protects the bristles and help keep them free of external dust and debris. This allows the entire package to be carried in a jacket pocket or other small space, so there is no reason not to take it with you on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package comes with two brush heads, one about 1\\&quot; long and the other about half that length. The brush heads are easier to attach and detach from the handle than earlier Sonicare versions and it is easier to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without white-level cards, it is difficult to verify the claim of making your teeth two shades whiter in two weeks, but I can see that the tea stains on and between my front teeth have become less intense after a couple weeks of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, this brush may cause some discomfort on your teeth and gums. This can come from applying too much pressure. It is important to keep a light touch on the brush handle and just touch it against your teeth, rather than pushing it. Let the brush do the work and after a week or so your gums will become acclimated to the more intense cleaning action. To help in the acclimation process, the toothbrush has a built-in \\&quot;easy-start\\&quot; mode, which gradually increases intensity with repeated usage, until the full action is attained. There is also a sensitive mode, with a permanently reduced intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the price of replacement brush heads can be quite high, the price of dental repair can be much higher, not to mention the \\&quot;cost\\&quot; of dental discomfort. Once you try a Sonicare toothbrush, you won&#x27;t want to go back to a conventional toothbrush or a less capable power brush. Try it and use it properly. Your teeth and gums will thank you!nd gums.

            <li> I have wanted a Sonicare for a long time.  This product is great, although not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a travel case and battery charge seems to last quite a while. While it is supposed to be a whitening toothbrush, I don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in that department. I don&#x27;t think it can deal with anything but the most superficial stains. Smokers and coffee drinkers would have the most white to gain, and not the average user.  That being said, my teeth have that just cleaned feeling and they feel cleaner for longer.  The front teeth especially have that shiny smooth surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included are 2 different brush heads (a regular sized one and a smaller one). While I like this, a bonus head would&#x27;ve been nice.  But note that it does have coupons in the box.  You&#x27;ll need it, the brush heads are expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure - I have had electric toothbrushes before, but this one is pretty intense.  I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to feel so jack-hammer like on my teeth. It&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable, but you do get used to it after a while. The worst is when you accidentally touch the hard plastic part (ie not the bristles) to your teeth.  OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like the on/off button.  There are 3 settings, and if you are on the first setting,  you have to go through the other 2 settings (ie, press the button 3 times) to get it to turn off.  Kind of annoying. So it is a good product,  just a few things I think could be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already had the &#x27;Sonicare Elite&#x27; toothbrush for some time now, so I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect from the new &#x27;R732&#x27; as I couldn&#x27;t imagine that there could&#x27;ve been that much of an improvement.  HOLY SMELLY SUBSTANCE IN A BURNING BAG WAS I EVER SURPRISED!!!  Not only is this new version every bit as good as the &#x27;Elite&#x27; brush, but it really is better!  As stated in the product info, this new brush is for \\&quot;healthy whitening\\&quot;, and with myself being not only a smoker, but a coffee drinker as well you could say I&#x27;m a good judge when it comes to whitening.  Not to say I&#x27;ve got a green, snaggly, rotten mouth, but I can see a difference.  The only thing people may have issue with is the vibration from the tooth brush while in use.  It really tickles on your teeth &amp; used to make me kinda nausious (not to say the brush will make everyone nausited, that happens to me with anything that vibrates, don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m just weird).  I was used to it within a couple days with my old &#x27;Elite&#x27; &amp; didn&#x27;t have any problems at all with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you&#x27;re a coffee drinker, a tobacco user or even just someone who likes a clean mouth, YOU NEED THIS BRUSH!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned economically depressed money on phoney (spellcheck?), cheap knock-off, immitations or painful, damaging, whitening technics.  Put your money on this product &amp; know you&#x27;re getting something of quality that&#x27;ll last.  I loved my &#x27;Elite&#x27; &amp; I know I&#x27;m gonna love this new brush just as much if not more.  You get what you pay for, &amp; trust me once you try yours you&#x27;ll wish you&#x27;d gotten one years ago.  Bite the bullet &amp; buy this brush, you&#x27;ll be glad you did &amp; your mouth will thank you almost immidiately after</li>
            <li> Having been a long-time user of the Oral B electrical toothbrush system,  I wanted to try the Sonicare to see and feel if there was any difference. Here are my observations:    General:  The first difference I noticed was that the shape of the included brush heads was rectangular like a traditional toothbrush. The Oral B system features round brush heads and I&#x27;ve favored those because I felt they did a better job cleaning an entire tooth, and not just part of it which I feel is what rectangular brush heads tend to do (i.e. either along the gum line or more on the other end).     Other than that, both systems have a similar feel, with the Sonicare HealthyWhite a bit lighter in weight.     Brush Heads:  What a difference when I actually began using the Sonicare! It feels very different from the Oral B, more of a vibrating, almost tickling sensation that actually feels quite pleasant. I have sensitive gums, and it seems to me that the Sonicare overall was a lot gentler than the Oral B. With the Oral B Triumph I actually had to use the extra-soft brush heads because the regular ones as well as the ones with the yellow plastic \\&quot;flaps\\&quot; (for lack of better word) irritated my gums to the point where it was uncomfortable. With the Sonicare HealthyWhite, I was able to use both brush heads it came with and have yet to experience any gum irritation - quite a plus in my eyes.    The Promise Of Whiter Teeth:  The Sonicare HW promises whiter teeth after two weeks of continuous use of the Clean &amp; White mode, which is what I did. My two weeks are up now, and honestly I am not sure that I notice much of a difference. Except a crowned front tooth seems to look a bit brighter than before, so for now, my conclusion is that this seemed to have worked on the capped tooth better than on my natural teeth. I am unsure whether this is a good thing because it makes the cap stand out more. Then again, not so much that other people would necessarily notice. So for now, I am reserving judgement on this. But I am inclined to say that this is more ad hype than anything else...    Clean Feel:  My teeth feel very clean after using the Sonicare. Moving my tongue across, I don&#x27;t think there is a difference between the two systems, i.e. the surfaces of my teeth feel just as clean after the Oral B cleaning than after using the Sonicare.     But: I believe that the Sonicare HW does a significantly better job with removing plaque and sometimes food particles (sorry, but this is just a fact of life :-)) from in-between the teeth. I attribute this mainly to the shape of the brush head, which in addition to being rectangular is also raised in places, creating something like a \\&quot;wave\\&quot; pattern which enables the bristles to actually get in-between and do their job. Flossing after using the Sonicare HW seems cleaner and also subjectively I think my floss moves easier now.     User Friendliness:  Both systems have \\&quot;quadrant notifications\\&quot;, i.e. the system makes the user aware to switch to a different section (quadarant) of their mouth after 30 seconds. Where they differ: The Sonicare HW stops brushing altogether after that time (or, in case of the Clean &amp; White mode, after two additional rounds of 15 seconds each for the front teeth), whereas the Oral B keeps going. I personally prefer that the brush does not auto-shut off, so I like the Oral B better here, but this is just a preference of mine...    Conclusion:  I honestly think I can go both ways - stay with my Oral B Triumph or continue using the Sonicare HW. Both systems seem to do a great job at keeping teeth clean and healthy. But because I feel that the brush head of the Sonicare is overall doing a better job and is gentler, I am giving my vote to it. If Oral B came out with such a head, I might re-evaluate, but at this point I am favoring the Sonicare HW.       Update:  Having now used the Sonicare HealthyWhite for about 2 1/2 months I would like to update my review. My capped front tooth became quite sensitive so that I switched to using the Sensitive mode. Still it was uncomfortable. I do attribute this to the Sonicare because this is not an old crown and I have not had any problems when using my Oral-B on it. So for now I have gone back to my Oral-B Triumph. It does not seem to aggravate the tooth like the Sonicare... Sad, but true.</li>
            <li> I love ultrasonic toothbrushes and this one is no exception.  A real plus for this toothbrush is the small brush.  I find this much easier to manuever around the back of my mouth than the other ultrasonic toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used (another Sonicare, an Ultreo and an Oral B). Additionally, the brush heads are fairly inexpensive as compared to some of the other brands, (particularly the Ultreo) which is a real selling point and advantage to me.       This toothbrush makes a sound every 30 seconds to prompt you to move your toothbrush to a different quadrant of your mouth.  It also has a feature that is supposed to whiten and brighten your teeth - and the manual says the toothbrush makes a different noise when in this mode.  However, I have bad hearing and I can&#x27;t tell you I can tell when the toothbrush is in this mode.  Maybe it&#x27;s my overactive imagination, but my teeth do appear brighter.  This model came with two brush heads, one even smaller than the other.  They also have 3 different colors of bands that you can snap into your brush head to help you distinguish your brush from the others if you share it.  There is room for two brush heads on the back of the base.      One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that my teeth seem to retain the clean, fresh brushed feeling most of the day, something I never noticed with the other brushes.      Of all the toothbrushes I&#x27;ve had, I would definitely recommend this one.  I like the small brush head, which I&#x27;d think would be ideal for children, the replacement brush heads are very reasonably priced and my teeth genuinely feel very clean (most ultrasound toothbrushes do this, I&#x27;ll add) - and remain so for most of the day.  So far, the best of the lot that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Well, not only does it whiten, it leaves you feeling tingly!  I can&#x27;t agree it&#x27;s all over, but my lips feel a little numb for about 10 minutes after I&#x27;m done brushing.  But my teeth feel clean all day long - even when it&#x27;s time to brush again - it&#x27;s almost redundant but it works and they are definitely cleaner and whiter than ever before.  Word of warning to gaggers, though - It may aggravate your gag reflex on bad days, but it&#x27;s not so bad if you can just work through it.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it opposed to the icky whitening stickers.</li>
            <li> After 1.5 years the body had to be replaced.  The shaft that connects to the brush became loose - a common problem with this unit.  You may get some extra warranty if you register the unit with Philips so well worth the 5 minutes doing so.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and I love the ease of use, the way it makes  my teeth feel and look.  A bit pricey BUT very well worth it.  My gums (behind my top teeth) were a bit &amp;#34;ticklish&amp;#34; to it at first but when I changed the setting to &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; that helped a lot.  I would recommend this product to everyone but especially smokers and coffee drinkers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model to replace an older Sonicare toothbrush that I had used for several years. The old model still worked fine after four years; my hope is that this one will have similar reliability. However I had grown tired of cleaning the gunk out of the handle of the old model, which had a design that was flawed in this regard. Since I travel, I also liked the smaller design of the newer models. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased. Performance is excellent and the unit is sleek. Equally important, the design of the the unit and the way the brush head attaches eliminates the problem of gunk building up. I have taken this toothbrush on trips several times without the charging base and found that I could brush twice a day for at least five or six days without a recharge, so the battery life is certainly ample. No complaints about this item at all. If I were to say anything negative, it would be that the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; option is fairly meaningless -- it simply extends the normal brushing time about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I will give the Sonicare HealthyWhite Toothbrush 5 stars because it is so great on the pearly whites.  One little fault - the On/Off button can be hard to push to turn it off, but it always works.  It is a great size - not too big and not too small.  It also comes with 2 brushes - a large and a small.  But brushes are easy to purchase and very reasonable on Amazon!  It is a best buy.  Go for it.</li>
            <li> I love how much easier this one is to clean than the last one and I like the brushes as well.  Really enjoy how my teeth feel after using this machine.</li>
            <li> I have now used this product, Sonicare Healthy White, for over one month. It is my first quality electric tooth brush, although I have had other very inexpensive models previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthy white took some getting used to. The first 30 times I used it, it took me about 4 minutes to brush my teeth while they recommend 2 minutes, and it actually shuts down after 2 minutes with 30 second warnings so you can time your brushing. Not a problem, just start it over and finish. Now I can almost always finish within the two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has exceeded my expectations. It is now easy to use, very useful and, most importantly, gets my teeth very clean. I think my dentist is going to be pleased with the results. The carrying case is a nice touch but I haven&#x27;t used it yet. The charger works well. It came with two different style brushes. Everything worked as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, and most importantly, does an excellent job cleaning my teeth. I have no complaints. It has been, after a month, almost as good as a visit to a dentist without the cost.</li>
            <li> Bought this product as a replacement for my old Sonicare... Thought I had a good toothbrush with the old one, this one is far superior.  Highly recommended.  I especially like the fact that the charger is 110/240 volt as we travel internationally frequently.  Looking forward to taking it with us on our next extended trip overseas.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush so far .... but did find it $40 cheaper at Walmart after I had opened and used it ....</li>
            <li> Well I don&#x27;t really have anything negative to say about this. I was having some issues, and my dentist recommended an electric. So I ordered this. Been going great ever since. Teeth feel awesome. I like the little vibration misses to tell you to go to the next quadrant for cleaning. About the only thing I wish is the heads were a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Incredible clean. My teeth have never felt better&lt;br /&gt;-The 30 second tone is a very handy way to ensure you get a complete clean within your recommended two minutes of brushing&lt;br /&gt;-Handy travel case was included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Loud&lt;br /&gt;-You can feel a noticeable and annoying vibration when gripping the unit while itâs on&lt;br /&gt;-Is pricey and the brush heads arenât much cheaper&lt;br /&gt;-Have to hold down the power button for about three seconds to pause the brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Switched to this brush from a Philips Sonicare Diamondclean that stopped working properly after being dropped on the floor. I originally bought this unit because of the three cleaning modes, the nifty charging base that will hold two brush heads and because it included a travel case. My only experience with electric brushes have been with these two models. In terms of clean, though, I have not been disappointed. My teeth have never felt better and my smile has been noticeably whiter. Additionally, my visits to the dentist have been less painful as the dentist doesnât have to work as hard to clean them (I can see where this would be a con though if you try to get your moneyâs worth out of your dentist). The battery life is also supposed to be pretty good but I have yet to experience this first hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, this unit is a bit pricey. The brush heads are expensive as well (about $8 a brush). Also, while the three cleaning modes are a nice feature, I have found myself rarely using anything but the first one. If price isnât an issue for you, this is a fine brush. Or, go with the Diamondclean which runs quieter, doesnât vibrate as much as this unit and just looks cooler. If price is, youâll probably get just as good a clean from one of the lesser, cheaper models.</li>
            <li> There would be two reasons to buy this toothbrush: to clean your teeth and/or to whiten them.  As for the cleaning, my teeth haven&#x27;t felt as clean after using this before anything aside from a dentist visit and it even come close to that.  As for the whitening, the box promises two weeks lighter in two weeks.   After almost three weeks of use I really haven&#x27;t noticed much change.  Granted it may have be slight change after each cleaning and maybe I should have taken before and after pictures to get a better idea of how much whiter they actually are.  This product is also good for me as I have mildly sensitive teeth and if I and feeling too much pain from the normal setting, there is a soft pulsating sensitive teeth setting.  All the setting are set to a timer that will tell you when you should move on to the next part of your mouth for optimal cleaning.  One sticking point could be the price of the replacement brush that will run you over five dollars per brush which is a little pricy for what is just half a tooth brush, one that is suggested you replace every three months.</li>
            <li> Using the Philips Sonicare R732 guarantees a better, brighter smile. This thing is *thorough* and will leave your teeth utterly and completely clean--one still needs to floss however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and one full charge will last for many brushings. The portable travel case is a nice touch. The best things in life are the simplest: the R732 is simple and effective.&lt;br /&gt;High recommendations.</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare for years and I have been flakey in consistently using it.  The older handle just seemed too big and the base while solid just seemed too bulky for my small bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Sonicare has a smaller diameter handle that feels very comfortable to hold.  I like the smaller brush size.  The base can be stripped down to the travel size which provides a very small profile for a tight bathroom space.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this toothbrush!  It is very light and I like the three brushing options.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was ashamed to smile my teeth were getting so stained.  This brush has truly helped.  Also, I noticed when I went to the dentist for my cleaning, they did not have to work as hard to clean the teeth and gum area.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this product that I bought one for my daughter and her family.  It makes a huge difference in the health of your teeth and gums, in my humble opinion.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush and I got a good deal on it so I can&#x27;t complain.  It holds the charge for a long time which is great.  It has modes for standard, sensitive, and whitening.  I just use the standard mode.  I like that it has the timer that tells you each 30 seconds so you can switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare brushes since 1996, long before Philips took over and ruined the line. The unit died 1 year to the day. Previous units had the battery fail, that seemed to have taken a few years. This one just stopped vibrating, it still buzzes. i replaced the brush head, no luck.&lt;br /&gt;I do not think anything cleans my teeth as well... By a mile! I had used a competitor&#x27;s brush for a couple years and it really was not the same.&lt;br /&gt;So I guess I am spending another 100 bucks</li>
            <li> this was our first porew toothbrush purchase. we use it 2 minutes each morning and 2 minutes at night. the built in timer is the key. why did we wait so long?</li>
            <li> this is like going to the dentist.. if you don&#x27;t have one,  you should.  it makes a tremendous difference in teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> Love this way more than the last version I had. This one stays clean and does a really good job cleaning my teeth. I feel like I went to the dentist each time. No way I&#x27;m going back to a normal tooth brush. I even got my kids their own as well.</li>
            <li> The worst toothbrush I have ever had! Easy to use, not bad looking design but if you don&#x27;t have a habit of proper cleaning and drying it every time you use it then forget it! Because of the moisture in the bathroom I have some kind of fungus growing at the base of the toothbrush. I never had problems with any other toothbrushes, but then again they were not made of rubber all around the handle. There are black spots very slowly growing on the rubber part and they are impossible to clean! They seem to grow inside that rubber. Discusting! I called customer service and they are aware of the problem but they say people don&#x27;tclean properly those toothbrushes. How about make it easy for a customer and make the handle from a better material??? This review is for my Philips Sonicare Healthy White.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare.  This is not my first but I like it better than my first.  I used an old fashioned toothbrush and just did not feel that it did the job of my Sonicare.  I had to get a new one quick.  I love this one!</li>
            <li> I bought a Philips Sonicare for myself as well as one for my then 10 year old son.  They work great; even my dentist noticed a difference!  My teeth are much more clean using this electric toothbrush vs an old-fashioned manual brush.  I appreciate the different settings as well as the fact that it turns off after two minutes.  My son, being a normal boy, isn&#x27;t the greatest fan of the mundane task of brushing his teeth and tended to not do a great job with the manual brush.  This toothbrush has made a tremendous difference in his dental care.  The battery is great, maintaining charge for 2+ weeks at a time (I haven&#x27;t tested it longer than that).  Other reviewers say it left their teeth/gums sensitive, but we&#x27;ve not had a problem with that.  We&#x27;ve now had them for almost two years and they still work like new.  I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Best thing about this is the timer - tells you when you need to move the toothbrush around your mouth!</li>
            <li> This is the first sonic toothbrush I have tried and it is great.  I had no problems adapting to it and can&#x27;t wait for my next checkup with the dentist.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  I have gotten A+ checkups and nary a scraping from the dentist after I started using this toothbrush.  After a couple years of use (I&#x27;m a little late with this review), the pin that hold the brush head fell out of the base.  I found a DIY to take it apart and put it back together, thankfully.</li>
            <li> The electronic toothbrush is great. But they are very expensive, and you know what&#x27;s more expensive, the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;$10 each, so you&#x27;d better to prepare a long term investment.</li>
            <li> The product is great. At first I did not receive the base I saw in the picture but they got back to me immediately and solved the problem. Great customer service, I&#x27;ve had some bad experiences in the past with some sellers. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Really simply.  Good speed and feels very effective.  It&#x27;s my first one so I trust that it&#x27;s gonna last a while</li>
            <li> Great at the beginning. Terrific battery life. After a year, though, the item stopped working. Is this typical? Not a good value.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on other reviews. It takes a bit to get used to because it is more vigorous than I would brush myself.  My dentist measures my gum recession and says that my gums are much healthier now. I use it twice a day and it shows no sign of wear or decreased performance. I highly recommend this, and also bought units for my wife and daughters.</li>
            <li> My gums are very sensitive.  I have to use an extra soft brush, like those for diabetics, to keep from irritating my gums.  My dentist recommended an electric brush because I developed a weekness in my fingers and was having a hard time navagating a manual brush around my mouth.  This Phillips Sonicare is great at removing the stuff that builds up on my teeth, but I have to be very, very careful with it so as to not irritate my gums.  Its first use left my gums raw in some places.  I had to wait for the gums to heal before I could use it again, but I knew better how to use it the 2nd time.  I wish and suggest that Phillips Sonicare offer an extra soft brush head for its electric toothbrushes.  Now you do not have a choice in the softness nor hardness of the brush heads.  Only one kind is offered.</li>
            <li> While the Oral-B electric toothbrushes&#x27; round heads &#x27;shake&#x27; in relatively large, circular motions, the Sonicare toothbrushes &#x27;vibrate&#x27; at a much higher frequency. I find that the Sonicare cleans my teeth much cleaner for this reason. They also clean better because this difference in mechanics allows the sonicare toothbrush heads to be shaped in a way that it&#x27;s much easier to reach the spaces between my teeth. The detachable toothbrush heads of Sonicare also have fewer moving parts, also because of how it works, and I feel this allows them to stay cleaner because there are less cracks and nooks for gunk/germs to get into.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Had a difficult time choosing which sonic to purchase.  Amazon is a 5 star company to do business with.</li>
            <li> I bought the Sonicare to replace my old one. Every check up I have, my Dentist always comments on the condition of my gums and teeth. I told him I use a Sonicare and he always tells me to keep doing what I am doing because the results are great .</li>
            <li> Very powerful toothbrush. Bought this for a teenager, who is actually using it. Only a couple of minor issues, which have nothing to do with the performance of the toothbrush. It is very easy to knock the brush off of the stand and the extra wand really doesn&#x27;t want to stay put either. Easy fix is to charge then just put the base and extras away. Bought this when it was on sale at Amazon and am happy with purchase. Anything to keep the kids brushing works for me !</li>
            <li> This is the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on tooth brushes! With the Sonicare HealthyWhite R732 I have noticed a big difference in the brightness of my teeth. The sonic has a timer built into it so you have a 30 second period of brushing for each quadrant of your mouth, cool!  I spend the full 2 minutes brushing plus the whitening feature gives another 30 seconds of brushing!!  Once you start using this in your daily brushing routine it seems the 2 1/2 minutes go by in a flash. I wish I had started using one of these many years ago but it&#x27;s never too late to start. My mouth and teeth have never looked and felt so clean and fresh. The price may seem a bit spendy but, it&#x27;s money you&#x27;ll never regret spending especially when you look into the mirror and see them pearly white teeth smiling back at you!!</li>
            <li> I could feel a difference the very first time that I used it.  I am only sorry that I waited&lt;br /&gt;so long before I purchased it.  I would suggest to everyone to purchase one.</li>
            <li> Good product! Teeth feel extra clean and shiny after use. Just don&#x27;t like how the toothpaste sprays when you turn it on. But overall I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> The first experience was a little brutal. I felt like the outer layer of my teeth and gums had been chiseled off. I&#x27;m a little more used to it now. My teeth feel and look way better. My gums are healthier and flossing is now a breeze. Does what it is advertised to do. Seems solid.</li>
            <li> I received a unit as part of the Vine program back in 2008. The review I posted was deleted, but I just wanted to say revisit this product. The HealthyWhite brush was a great sonic toothbrush that got my teeth quite clean. It was easy to use and maintain. The two interchangeable heads that came with it were nice as was the ability to get new ones. This allowed it to last quite a while. The innards finally conked out about a year ago after years of use so I am pretty happy with the way it performed and would get a Sonicare brush again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
            <li> I have owned all the generations of the Sonicare Toothbrush. All the previous models would build up a slime inside in the handle with use and needed regular cleaning. Previous models requires a tedious cleaning routine. This product addresses that issue in that it has no cavities to build up a slime. It is sealed and cleaner to use and rinses clean easily.    It does the best job cleaning ones teeth as well! The handle is the most comfortable yet! It just feels better in one&#x27;s hand. I just love the fact that it is easier to keep clean.    Highly recommended. !!!!</li>
            <li> I love this electric brush. Solid build, long  battery charge and cleans great. It was recommended by my dentist which caters for Sonicare brand. I get a lot of build-up on my teeth so I go 4 times a year for cleaning. I got this in October and as of December I have clear visual improvements. My teeth stay build-up free longer. I still have to floss but it certainly does a good job. Only reason not 5 stars is because of it&#x27;s price. It&#x27;s 2012 and this electric brush costs few bucks to manufacture, so $120 is a bit steep for what it is.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to write this review so that people would know you have to be very careful with these toothbrushes. This brush chipped multiple teeth of mine, and left me with grooves and dents on the surface of some of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrations that power the bristles are created by sonic waves. A lot of people may not realize, or believe, that the handle of the brush moves as well. (When I say handle, I am not referring to the part that you grip with your hand, but the shaft that contains the toothbrush head). It may not appear to move to the naked eye, but it is in fact \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; with vibrations. Just turn your brush on and feel the shaft of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a careless person. I am very meticulous about my teeth because I have had lots of dental problems over the years (tons of orthodontics, already one chipped tooth from the past, and I have a bridge [artificial tooth, attached to two other teeth] to take care of) and I always use extreme caution when caring for my teeth. I never rush when I brush my teeth, not even with a manual toothbrush. Might I also point out that I am only 22 years old, and do not suffer from weak or brittle teeth that can sometimes come from old age and make teeth more prone to chipping easily. How was I to know that the smallest bump from this toothbrush would cause chips in my teeth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night I was brushing my teeth and as I tried to turn the brush to reach an area, I heard a \\&quot;bzzz\\&quot; sound. I stopped the brush immediately... examined my teeth. I had chipped a large corner of my upper canine tooth away! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I was not moving the brush in a swift or fast motion  when it happened, yet- the shaft touched my tooth, and just as soon- a piece of my tooth was gone! And what&#x27;s worse, it was one of the supporting teeth for my bridge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I couldn&#x27;t change the past, so I went to the dentist and had to move on and live with the chip. But then a few weeks later, it happened again.I was brushing the chewing surface of my lower molars, was moving the brush slowly around to the other side... this time, my upper two front teeth must have closed down the very slightest little bit- but with the very slightest contact of my front tooth onto the shaft, another \\&quot;bzzz\\&quot; and some of my tooth was clipped away! Luckily this chip was only a small groove, but is still visible to family, friends and dentist - so not quite insignificant enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This happened to me on one more occasion, bringing me a total of three chipped teeth in my mouth! And believe me, after the first time, I was hyper-cautious - it&#x27;s not like I threw caution to the wind to achieve the other two chips! All of these times, the toothbrush had just barely came into contact with the tooth - I can tell you the contact was almost feather-light! this just proves how dangerous this could be, and are most people really that cautious when they brush their teeth?! Consider the average person who isn&#x27;t as cautious as me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I have to point out is that you must be extremely careful not to press too hard when you brush with this device! Now, I was aware of this fact before using it- and I did lighten my pressure, and let the brush do the brushing - however, I began to notice that after using this brush for a while, little grooves were developing on the surface of my teeth. Like little etches right into the surface of my enamel. My teeth have never appeared this way before, and as I looked at it from different angles and different lighting - I could see tons of etches into my teeth, and on some teeth - what appeared to be \\&quot;dents\\&quot;, little dot-like indents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the last straw for me. I will never use an electric toothbrush again in my life, especially sonic, thanks to my experience with this product. My teeth suffered irreversible damage and my self esteem took a hit, too. The damage left is something I now see every day and feel stressed about every day (the damage on the tooth supporting my bridge, especially).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised more people have not had this experience! Although - I suppose I am thankful for that! I want other customers to know that these toothbrushes can be very dangerous. If you should choose to use one, you must be extremely careful to not touch the shaft to your teeth from any angle, and you must use the utmost care not to add much pressure to the brush as you move it along your teeth. Whatever \\&quot;superior clean\\&quot; this gives is not worth the risk of damaging teeth!</li>
            <li> This Sonicare brush has all the features I need without the frills!  Love how it works, easy to clean, the quadpacer (a MANDATORY feature for my money)-- so far, mine has worked just fine since AUG 2012.  A great electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I had one of these a few years ago and the battery went out after many years. A year or two later the dentist is suggesting I use this toothbrush. He&#x27;ll be the Maytag repair guy (as in days gone by).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and my teeth feel so fresh and so clean!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Better than previous sonicares.  Brush head is improved.  No more mold buildup under cap as they redesigned the top and brush connection.  Does a good job at cleaning.  I use it much more than 2 minutes.(probably 12) per brushing.  The white booster time is really a hype because all you have to do is turn the thing on again to run for 30 sec. or how ever long you choose to brush your front teeth again.  They send a compact brush &amp; only 1 regular size which I don&#x27;t like.  I&#x27;ll never use the compact, so it&#x27;s a waste.  I should be able to choose the brushes I want.  Also, there is a certain amount of vibration with this model vs the older ones I had.  Doesn&#x27;t affect brushing your teeth except that to stop it you have to change your angle and grip slightly. Overall happy with this model.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Our teeth feel much cleaner. Our dentist also thought this is a good product. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing!!  My brother has been telling me for a year to get one.  One day when it was the GoldBox deal of the day, I could not resist.  The first one sent to me was defective, but Amazon promptly sent a replacement.  The second time around, I am extremely pleased.  Even after the first brush, there was a noticeable difference.  I could feel slight tartar building behind my teeth and after using the Sonicare once, my teeth suddenly felt smooth, like after going to the dentist.  A fantastic purchase, don&#x27;t know how I ever used a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Sonicare years ago because my gums were receding.  Have been through 3 of them now, and my gums are healthy again and my teeth are in great shape.  My dentist cleanings are so fast, and no cavities since I have been brushing with Sonicare.  When my last one was slowly dying, I bought this model because it was on a great deal of the day sale.  As far as the healthy white aspect of it, it just brushes your front teeth for 30 extra seconds at the end, so I don&#x27;t think that is really anything but a gimmick, but I do like the sensitive versus regular option.  And I love the way the head comes off so you can clean!  A huge improvement over previous models I have owned.</li>
            <li> My first experience with an electric toothbrush.  The Sonicare works just fine, and I am using it diligently, maybe not happily.  An electric toothbrush takes a little more time and effort.  I keep telling myself it&#x27;s best for my teeth!</li>
            <li> I think this tells you something about a product if you know company&#x27;s customer service too well. And the customer service is phenomenal! No yelling &amp;#34;Representative&amp;#34; into the phone after navigating the menu for 20 minutes and then listening to the crappy music for hours. You open a chat, connect to a representative who asks you couple of question and send you the new brush, if you have a problem. Well, not the new but refurbished one. Now to the question why would you need this great customer service: I bough the brush in March and it came with 1-year warranty. Around August it began to frantically switch modes, turn on and off and stopped charging. I contacted customer service and they have sent a replacement pronto. Then just a month before warranty expiration I stopped charging. Philips first thought it was a charger problem and sent me a new charger, but then the new charger didn&#x27;t charge the toothbrush so they have sent me a new toothbrush. It is August year and a half after purchase and the brush doesn&#x27;t switch modes now, turns on and off on its own. But now I can&#x27;t even replace it so I think I am saying &amp;#34;Bye Bye&amp;#34; to Philips. My wife has a Braun oral B and even though it is not an ultrasonic brush it works with no issues for 2.5 years. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> First time owner of an electric toothbrush &amp; I can&#x27;t believe I went these many years w/o one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each use, I feel like I just came back from the dentist w/o any disgusting taste or soreness of actually going to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended a Sonicare to help keep my gums clean and low (she said they&#x27;re a little high on some teeth.. I do floss 6 out of 7 days a week but this electric brush will get better results) in addition to the overall cleaning of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FLAW - Or maybe dislike... It might just be an awkward feeling. I&#x27;ve always brushed deep in my gums below the lines, tongue, cheeks and my roof. With this electric brush it does feel really weird because of the size and YOU have to be careful where you grab the brush so that you don&#x27;t accidentally start it up. BECAUSE of this I still keep an ordinary toothbrush to clean these areas in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second concern to those considering an electric brush (and not just a sonicare but any brand) Brush replacement heads are expensive &amp; don&#x27;t get screwed into buying some cheap knockoff&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve heard people getting scammed by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one argument for the price of the replacement toothbrush heads is... If you&#x27;re faithful in using this product, along with flossing &amp; mouthwash (i would recommend both) then you shouldn&#x27;t get cavities which can become root canals (more pain &amp; money) and the money spent for the head replacements should be cheaper than paying a dentist to fix any cavities. (this is my logical theory)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m a very happy customer &amp; it came with a 2 year warranty &amp; from reading other reviews, they fully honor those warranties hassle free. Just register the product once u get it, very simple &amp; quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the last one, though this one seems easier to clean. You are not offering the kind I had before, and I can not remember it&#x27;s name right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hand-full of higher-end electric toothbrushes in my day. I always do an upgrade when replacing older models but this one blew my old Sonic toothbrush away! It&#x27;s like a bunch of buzzing bees are cleaning my mouth....feels great and cleans thoroughly. I recommend keeping it fully charged as there is a significant difference in power and effectiveness between &amp;#34;just charged&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;charged a couple weeks ago&amp;#34;. Only negative is I would like a straight on-off instead of having to go through all speeds to turn off.</li>
            <li> I use it on a daily basis. Easy, simple, and well worth the money. The price I paid for it on Amazon was only average, but OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third Sonicare electric brush.  Wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.  This one is smaller than my prior brushes but appears to work just like the last which cost me nearly twice as much.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an old one that was about 10 years old.  What a difference in cleaning power.  Boy, did I ever need a new toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, it is really hard to turn off, when it is in your mouth.  I press the button, but finding the exact spot that will turn it off is difficult.  Of course, having arthritis in the thumb joints doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Convert - Are you a little aghast at spending in excess of a hundred bucks on a toothbrush?  It&#x27;s a toothbrush for crying out loud!!  What could be worth that much money, when you get the old fashioned kind at the dentist office for free with every visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Well, I got sick of the dentist telling me that I was getting a receding gum line.  I didn&#x27;t like the thought of gum disease and my teeth falling out.  And, okay, I am kind of a gadget guy.  I knew that regular flossing wasn&#x27;t going to happen, no matter how much they cajoled me.  And I heard that a water pick wasn&#x27;t really an effective alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Soooo.  I sprung for the Sonicare, and have been delighted with the choice.  I understood the value of the Sonicare system after the first use.  My teeth had never felt so clean.  They felt like I had just come out of the dentist office, but without the throbbing gums.  I had used a mechanical rotary toothbrush for years, but the results don&#x27;t even compare.  I am sold out on Sonicare, and will never go back.  I have been using my Sonicare for over a year and am as satisfied now as when it first arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Which model to choose?  I chose the HealthyWhite mostly because of the travel case.  The travel case is excellent and I am thankful to have it.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t take my Sonicare on travel with me without this case.  The other big advantage of the HealthyWhite is the extra 30 seconds of brushing time.  I use the regular intervals to brush the sides of my mouth and use the extra 30 seconds to brush my front teeth.  I didn&#x27;t need the fancy extras of the Diamond.  Get a model that uses the ProCare heads.  Beyond that, pay for the features you need.  I only ever use the whitening mode and only for the extra 30 seconds of brush time.  I don&#x27;t ever use the gentle mode or other modes.  So the whitening mode and the travel case were the selling points for me on the HealthyWhite model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The HealthyWhite is not likely to make your teeth any whiter than any other Sonicare model.  Brushing your teeth for an extra 30 seconds will only have results up to a point.  The right toothpaste or a whitening chemical agent is really the main thing that can help whiten your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would definitely recommend the Sonicare system.  Your teeth will never feel cleaner.  After a year, my dentist also said that my gum health was markedly improved (and stopped threatening me with horror stories of gingivitis and tooth decay).  I am very satisfied with the product and am very glad that I bit the bullet (no pun intended) and paid $100+ bucks for a silly toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The sonic cleaning of this toothbrush is like no other I have ever experienced. I have had many electric rotary toothbrushes but this sonic action is in a class of it&#x27;s own when it comes to really cleaning teeth to free them of all food particles. My dentist recommended it as a superior way to clean teeth and he was right. Amazon delivered it promptly after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> ...and my gums are happier, too.  Product lives up to its description and features, though it wasnt clear how many brush heads came in the box.  (There were 2).</li>
            <li> The brushing action of this premium sonicare is fine, but not any better than the far cheaper single-mode version of this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst thing about this model of the sonicare lineup is that you either have to hold the button down (and toothbrush in your mouth) for an extra 2-3 seconds to shut it off (which feels longer than you think when trying to finish brushing quickly...) OR you have to press the button 3 times to cycle through all the modes before you reach the &#x27;off&#x27; mode. In either case, it&#x27;s a pain in the butt. Trust me when I say that you&#x27;ll never use the other modes that this brush offers - skip this model and go with the cheaper one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old sonicare had two buttons. I wish they hadn&#x27;t tried to &#x27;simplify&#x27; the design - all they succeeded in doing is making this toothbrush more inconvenient to use than older models.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush. I bought this one as a replacement to an older model. My dental check ups have improved since I started using an electronic toothbrush over a manual one. I like that it has a timer, you don&#x27;t have to think about how long to brush. It reminds you with a brief pause when to switch to a different section in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush stopped holding a charge after like 10 months. I called Phillips customer service, they were very friendly and helpful. I had kept my Amazon invoice and was able to tell them when I bought it and since it was under warranty, they sent me a replacement toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves your mouth feeling clean and your teeth much whiter.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush.  Much better than my Oral B, although I keep both and alternate between them as they clean differently.  My dentist recommends both as good and does not have a preference for one over the other.  If I had to choose having only one though, I would choose the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> We love the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes.  This new head design is so much better than the older model because it is a lot easier to clean.  It is best to set it on the 2 Â½ minute setting so you have enough time in your brushing routine to brush your tongue and other areas of your teeth that may need a little more attention.  Great product!  If this is your first electric toothbrush beware that the vibrating sensation can be overwhelming the first day or two, but I promise after the initial shock of the new vibrating sensation it stops feeling strange at all.  I know it sounds strange but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old unit, one of the oldest Sonicare models, with this unit.  I was beginning to find it difficult to locate good replacement brush heads.  This model is quieter with various brushing mode.  My gum feels much better after using this model than my old one.</li>
            <li> The Phillip&#x27;s Sonicare was recommended to me by my dentist and love it! Makes a great gift for any occasion.</li>
            <li> I am glad I finally purchased an electric toothbrush. This sonicare works very well. It is easy to use and not too loud. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the first electric tooth brush I have owned so I have nothing to compare it with other than manual teeth cleaning.  My dental hygienist says I do a very good job manually.  This seems to me to do an even better job of cleaning my teeth.  It&#x27;s a pretty new experience for me but so far I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Every time i go in for cleaning dentist tells me how awesome my teeth are and that im making there job to easy</li>
            <li> My experience with electric tooth brushes is based mostly on lower end Braun Oral B, first the kind that took batteries then their entry level spin brush. While they both were solid items, they weren&#x27;t as nearly effective as the Philips Sonicare R732. While this is a slight investment at $119, it comes with a carrying case, the base comes apart for a smaller version and it comes with two brush heads. Make sure you turn it off while it&#x27;s still in your mouth or it might splash tooth paste on your clothes, something a Braun tooth brush never did as far as I recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The noise and vibration it makes in your mouth takes some adjustment. It growls a bit like Chewbacca when you switch it into Tooth Whitening. The three settings is a great option. I mostly use it on tooth whitening, mainly because I do drink a lot of coffee which takes it&#x27;s toll on my front teeth. After using the tooth brush for the 2 minutes or so, I feel like my teeth are quite clean. I&#x27;m quite happy with this tooth brush and would recommend it to my friends that want a well made powered tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Nearly seven years later and the on off button wore out. While it&#x27;s a shame that it failed quite suddenly, I can&#x27;t complain after so many year of regular use.</li>
            <li> overall good quality, slightly larger than I expected. The battery life is pretty long. there are a couple of functions but i haven&#x27;t fully explored it yet.</li>
            <li> I got this as I get about 1 or 2 cavities a year. It has been a year now with no new cavities! I purchased this on sale because I thought the other functions would be good to use. I don&#x27;t use anything besides standard...</li>
            <li> I have to say.. I&#x27;ve been using a similar brush through ORAL B but after only a few days my teeth are cleaner, smoother and whiter. I drink coffee and smoke cigarettes so it improved my whitness probably faster then other who don&#x27;t do either on or both or those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very quite brush. Faster then ORAL B&#x27;s brush.. Leaves your teeth super smooth!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I take care of my teeth and have for quite some time.  I often get complimented at the dentist by hygentist about how nice my teeth are (odd, I know).  However, I have always just stuck to using the whatever toothbrush was on sale method for the better part of my life; until now that is.  I used to brush my teeth in the morning and get that clammy, grungy feeling in my mouth by the afternoon.  Not anymore.  This toothbrush keeps my pearly whites nice and clean and smooth!  I have been using the full clean and whitening setting for over a week and I did experience some initial tenderness (especially near the back of the teeth and along the gumlines) so I recommend starting with the clean setting only to get used to the powerful brushing that you will inevitably get from this amazing toothbrush.  Me and my girlfriend share and it&#x27;s easy to swap out the different brush heads so that was a relief.  All in all, great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for over a decade. After using the brush which requires the E series and has a battery life of two brushings over time, I decided to upgrade when the Gold Box deal appeared. I&#x27;m very glad that I fell for the marketing scheme because my teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been cleaned by the dentist!! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the stronger battery power, better brushing motion or improved brush head, but this is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older E series also collected a lot of gunk between the brush head and the electrical unit. The newer Sonicares eliminates that problem. I also like that this one comes with a portable case. The \\&quot;case\\&quot; for the charger base can be removed for travel use, but the case also provides a way to tuck away the extra leftover cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But more than anything, this cleans your teeth really well. I wonder how it&#x27;d work with the Diamond head, but I&#x27;m very happy with the stock brush heads. Also, the brush heads are cheaper than the E series, so the upgrade would pay off itself in time, especially if you brush obsessively brush like me. Still, don&#x27;t skip flossing.</li>
            <li> the toothbrush head is waaaayyyyyyy too small. everything else is ok....</li>
            <li> I just purchased two of these at once - one was fine, the other one was dis-balanced - was vibrating so hard that literally jumped of hands, was making loud screeching noise, and had some dirt marks on it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon - just got a replacement, better, but when I put a good one from the original order and the replacement one next to each other and turn them on in the same operating mode with the same type of head attached - they make different noises, one is a way louder than the other one, and tone and strength of vibration are different too.&lt;br /&gt;Where is manufacturer&#x27;s quality control?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving the Philips quality control ZERO stars, Amazon - 5 stars, and the toothbrush - 5 stars (it cleans indeed better that anything I tried before), so, (0+5+5)/3&#x3D;3.3&lt;br /&gt;Rounding down to 3.</li>
            <li> Excellent product....have already seen improvement in only a week of use! I like the different cleaning modes and the Healthy &amp; White mode is awesome</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these July of 2012.  One of them had the rubber body separate at the side of the face control.  I called Philips and they were very helpful. Told me I had a 2 yr warranty which I wasn&#x27;t sure about.  I sent them the receipt that I pulled up on my Amazon account and they sent me a replacement.  So easy to deal with, amazing customer service from Philips.  I have used a sonicare since they first came out and this is the first problem I have experienced.  This just solidifies my loyalty to this company and their products.  Thanks Amazon for having my receipt so easily available to make this situation simple to rectify!</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  This is my second HealthyWhite toothbrush.  The first HealthyWhite died less than 1 year after purchase so I emailed Philips and they were happy to replace it.  Awesome, I thought!  Great customer service.  1.5 years later the REPLACEMENT toothbrush has died.  I contacted Philips again and told them that their replacement toothbrush has failed and asked if they could replace it.  Sorry, Bryan told me, the warranty was only good for the life of the original (2 years, and both toothbrushes failed within 2.5 years).  The Philips rep told me they would only replace within the Warranty of the original toothbrush.  I was so upset.  &amp;#34;What about the integrity of your product?&amp;#34; I asked.  &amp;#34;The fact that I&#x27;ve been loyal for 15 years?&amp;#34; He didn&#x27;t even offer a discount on a replacement (as offered in one of the above 1-star reviews).  The quality of Sonicare products has definitely deteriorated.... My very first Sonicare lasted 11 years so I was loyal, but after 2 failed toothbrushes I&#x27;m switching to a different brand.  It&#x27;s been Real, Philips.  Thanks for the memories.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips sonicare for over eight years, close as I can approximate.  I just recently purchased a Philips Sonicare R732 HealthyWhite Toothbrush.  I have owned two models prior to this one of which was the &#x27;essence&#x27;.  Reading some of the reviews I was hesitant to purchase this particular model.  I disregarded some of the reviews and I&#x27;m very happy that I upgraded to this particular model. Sonicare, I can actually say based on my dentists queries has saved my gums and teeth over the past few years.  I am exceedingly impressed with the capability, quality and power of this particular model under review; it&#x27;s cleaning power far exceeds the prior model that I owned.  This model is easier to hold with its slimmer handle, appears to have greater charge capacity and the new toothbrush design supersedes prior versions.  I am exceedingly happy and satisfied with this model.  As usual I am also happy with Amazon&#x27;s service and shipment of anything that I order from their website.  I will have to give Philips customer service a call because I am used to brushing my teeth in the shower (so much easier) and the prior versions were able to be used in the shower, and with this model I am not sure whether that still holds true.  In summation this is the best sonicare I&#x27;ve owned to date and it&#x27;s cleaning power far supersedes the predecessors I have owned over the past eight years or so.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing toothbrush! It gives you the feeling like you&#x27;ve just been to the dentists for a cleaning. So much better than a manual brush, and the charge lasts up to two weeks, depending on how long you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare I think is okay.&lt;br /&gt;I do think the ORAL B toothbrush has more bang and just seems like a better product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this originally for my wife, who did not like it. So I kept it and gave her my ORAL B. So far a few of my freinds also say the ORAL B works better and seems sturdier then this SONICARE.</li>
            <li> I had an older Sonicare model which seemed to be doing a good job. Since I thought that it might be on its last leg, I decided to order this model, mainly as a backup. When I received the new one, and tried it out, I was amazed at the improvement in the teeth cleaning process.  As a result, the new model is not my backup.....its my primary toothbrush. This is really a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  Arrived faster than expected,  and in perfect condition.  Charged quickly and worked flawlessly. Leaves your mouth with a very fresh feeling.  Your teeth and mouth feels just like you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist office.  The price was better than anywhere else including Walmart,  who usually has the best price. Would recommend to anyone who wants to have that \\&quot;Just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist\\&quot; feeling in thier mouth.</li>
            <li> Really great toothbrush! I bought this as a present for my son. Its made a real difference his teeth are whiter in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Must admit this is superior to the orignal by a factor of three. Much better brushing, easier to fit in the mouth, and the 30 second beep helps to distribute the time better and keeps the mind from wandering. Very much worth it especially if it lasts as long.</li>
            <li> This is a great sonic brush overall. A great value for the price. A couiple of things to remember, do not store it on the charger! Only charge it when the light turns orange/red showing low power, this will save the rechargeable battery life by a long shot. The timer is great and it gives sonic pulse makes you feel like you just came back from the dentist. Now the ONLY bad thing is.. Its not very comfortable to hold and when it gets wet your hand slowly slides up it and you must keep readjusting you grip and it will cramp your hand a bit. Over all I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife. This is the first time she is moving from a regular brush to an electric one. The performance is good. The small brush is not as useful. The design is good and she is happy with the cleaning capability of the device. It is easy to plug and remove the brush head. Charging is quick.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. My teeth feel so clean afterwards, i dont think i can go back to the regular kind after having this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This was an upgrade to my first electronic toothbrush. My dentist recommended Sonicare for me, Oral B for the kids. I have more of a plaque issue, so that may be why.  After reading reviews, this model is the one I chose. I LOVE that it beeps to get all 4 quadrants AND the extended setting included extra time for top front and bottom front teeth. Just the fact that it makes me brush for a specific amount of time and tells me when to switch locations is priceless in my book. The UV cleaning helps too. Mine is plugged in 24/7, so I can&#x27;t comment on battery life. Guess I&#x27;ll figure that out when I travel. Overall, very happy!</li>
            <li> good purchase. could be an overkill for what I needed/wanted, but definitely glad that I got this one</li>
            <li> I am a tooth brushing fan, twice a day, every day.  For years I was just using the free toothbrushes my dentist provided me after check-ups.  Then 3 of my friends, all in different social circles, who bought the Sonicare and raved about the difference.  Now, consider the fact I am someone who thought the idea of paying more than $7 for a toothbrush was madness, it took some time for me to warm up to the price tag...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now owned my Sonicare for about a year, and I understand the hype.  I recommend reading the enclosed literature as you charge this for your first use.  You will realize a new way of brushing and see and feel it in the results.  I feel an all day clean from my teeth to my gums.  The whitening setting does help remove some light surface stains, and I have used this with whitening and non-whitening tooth paste as well.  Overall a solid investment.  The heads need to be replaced every few months and are pretty affordable, I am happy I made the switch, now 1 year later, the novelty has not worn off, nor have the results.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare and I really like this style. I like the smaller brush head and the product itself is outstanding in helping me achieve clean teeth. The new [to me] charging base is a definite improvement, very easy to keep everything clean.</li>
            <li> Not really sure, bought it as a Christmas gift but havent heard any negatives. Same as the one I have had for six years, bought it on the dependabilty record.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I had an older model and decided to update.  I noticed a difference in the way my teeth look and feel with just one brushing.  I was going to buy the most expensive diamond clean, but saw it had bad reviews.  As of right now, I am more than happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought both my grown children one of these.  My son said right away that he had tried it and his teeth are too sensitive for it (but he has great teeth). My daughter said she had thought she&#x27;d like one so she was pleased.  She loves, loves hers.  I kept his and I love mine, too.  There are just no negatives.  It feels good, it works well, and it is a great improvement over the battery operated one I had had for a few months. Convenient, attractive, quiet, and so effective at what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0019ZGU1S Philips Sonicare HX6732/02 HealthyWhite R732 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]While I do like the way my teeth feel when I have finished brushing, I don&#x27;t like the way the Sonicare turns off while I am using it.  The On/Off button seems to be most anyplace on the unit and not just the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; circle intended.</li>
            <li> Overall, my initial impression of this product is good...but since I haven&#x27;t had it for long, I cannot determine its durability.  I wish that \\&quot;soft\\&quot; brushes could be obtained for it, and am alternating my use of the Sonicare with manual brushing until I can determine that the Sonicare brushes aren&#x27;t too abrasive for my gums.  Initially, I tried using its \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting--but I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the tickling sensation that resulted.  The remaining two settings feel comfortable;  since my teeth feel clean at cycle&#x27;s end, I believe the Sonicare is doing a thorough job.  I&#x27;ve been keeping it on its charging stand, reasoning that the battery is more likely to give good service if kept fully charged.</li>
            <li> My dentist never recommended a electronic toothbrush to me (the cleaners always said I just need to brush better and longer), but 1 day I asked about electronic toothbrushes and they all use them themselves.  I didn&#x27;t ask for brand.  So I got this one after doing just some star reviews and 2 months in I will never go back to a regular toothbrush.  It is convenient and although I haven&#x27;t had to replace the brush heads yet, I like how there are different color rings so you know which brush head belongs to you.  The 1 complaint I have is that the cord is really difficult and inconvenient to string along back in the little base compartment thing, so much so that I just leave it all dangling around...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it has definitely cleaned my teeth better and helping with the whitening (I got this 2 months before my wedding) - all according to the dentist.  I am hoping that the electric it uses, the cost itself, and I guess the brush heads will pay for itself or at least in the long run be cheaper than going through all the manual tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this stand prevents all that gunky crap that builds up on those regular toothbrush holders/stands/etc.</li>
            <li> Like the last Sonicare that I owned, this toothbrush does a fantastic job cleaning my teeth, and it does it in only 3 minutes or so.  I like the quad pacer feature that tells you when to switch brushing areas, but I always find that I restart the brush at the end to brush the tops of my molars.  As other reviewers have commented, you have to push the button 3 times to put it into clean AND white mode.  This is a little ridiculous.  I don&#x27;t think anyone, if asked, would say that they wanted their teeth clean but not white, which is what you get with one button push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My prior Sonicare was an older version of the more expensive HX6911, and I have to say that I think the HX6732 is far superior.  The HX6911 has two buttons on the handle which gives access to all kinds of features that I never used.  The second button was precisely positioned on the handle so that I always accidentally pushed it once or twice while brushing my teeth causing me to have to keep pushing it to rotate it through the various modes to get back to normal mode.  The HX6732 does not have this problem at all since it is missing the second button, and the single button has enough resistance so that it is very difficult to push accidentally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, you get a hard case with the HX6732, which is great if you travel.  I&#x27;m convinced that what killed my HX6911 was the fact that I traveled with it not in a hard case, and the metal prong that the brush snaps over was pushed too far to one side, damaging the toothbrush internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The literature for the HX6732 is a little deceptive.  It seems to claim that it comes with two chargers: a travel charger and a deluxe charger.  The reality is that it comes with one travel charger.  This travel charger snaps in to a larger enclosure that includes an internal cord wrap.  So if you want to take the charger with you, you either need to take the whole thing, or take it apart, unwrap the cord and take just the smaller travel charger.  All that said, I&#x27;ve used the toothbrush without charging for a week and a half, so I doubt most people will ever need to take the charger with them.  I never do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is the best toothbrush I have ever owned, and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW - if you want your teeth really white, floss them once a day (preferably at night).  The flossing makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I had an Interplak toothbrush for at least 20 years, and it finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. So I went online looking for reviews of electric toothbrushes and prices. I found good reviews of the Philips \\&quot;Healthy White\\&quot; so I bought it and love it. I look forward to what my hygienist says when I visit this week. I hope it lasts as long as the Interplak!</li>
            <li> I looked at electronic toothbrushes for over six months.  I wanted one that had storage placement for two heads and that had high ratings.  My dentist recommended this one.  We have used it for a month now.  I can really tell a difference between this one and the old Oral B I had had for 10 years.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush. I did find that I manually brush longer than the timer allows for each quadrant of my mouth. It does a good job. It just takes some getting used to. I still want to push the brush back and forth :)</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, and price was roughly half of what you typically pay in a Walmart etc. Shipped fast--no problems!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months now, bought it after my dentist recommended buying electronic/automated toothbrush. I looked thru the different reviews for Sonicare and decided to go with this one instead of the high end, most expensive models sold by Sonicare. Though the UV lamp that comes in other other more expensive products seem attractive, I don&#x27;t think it is necessary. Bacteria won&#x27;t build up much since you need to be changing the brush head every 3 mo or so anyway and you are washing the brush head with soap and water after brushing, and hopefully allowed to air dry --this already prevents enough bacteria from growing. The charger is compact, and the stand can retract the cord for traveling. The travel case that came with it is compact and cute (hard case, not soft). It is easy to clean where the brush head attaches the unit. If you are a regular, healthy individual, this one works excellent -no need to spend like $200 on the other models by Sonicare. The \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; basically means this mode has 30 extra seconds, nothing significant...3 modes, simple use, no complicated fragile technology.</li>
            <li> We love our Philips Sonicare HX6732/02 Rechargable Electric Toothbrush. We had an old one that we had used for so many years that we could no longer buy brush replacements to fit, but we are not complaining because it really is old. Anyway, we bought another just as near to it that we could find and it is great.</li>
            <li> I love this electric toothbrush!  It makes your teeth feel super clean; has several different settings; and is EASY to clean and keep clean.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I purchased this toothbrush.  I had a Rotodent, and it was getting to the end of its battery life, so I took advantage of the gold box offer on this toothbrush.  First, the reviewers that stated your teeth feel fresh from the dentist are not kidding.  Second, I think my teeth are getting whiter.  I had brown stains between my teeth, and they are shrinking.  My teeth appear to be whiter too.  I cannot get enough of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush and to keep it short and sweet....I love it!  My teeth feel so clean and look so white and shiny.</li>
            <li> never had a toothbrush like this before  -  had been using cheaper ones like crest, oral b.. etc - which in the long run proved to be not as good and more expensive and environmentally unfriendly as they eat up AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it about 6 months - and my dentist reports that my  plaque buildup is less than his - would definitely recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i follow the directions carefully - so i use it full cycle on top teeth then full cycle bottom teeth and that&#x27;s what makes the difference - the others i&#x27;d been using (battery operated) i didn&#x27;t measure time properly and so results weren&#x27;t great -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this one i look forward to using - always leaves my mouth tasting great - which i didn&#x27;t expect</li>
            <li> had other sonic care, but really love this one, makes you feel like you have come straight from the dentist ever time you use it</li>
            <li> After using it for 7 months it went dead. I am out of the country that is why I can&#x27;t return it for warranty. It&#x27;s easier to order a new one than shipping it back. I will try another one. Good cleaning but battery is so bad.</li>
            <li> Great.  There are a lot in this range.  It is not worth spending more than this as the ones above still have the Health White setting.</li>
            <li> battery really last a long time. Price was good.</li>
            <li> My old sonicare died, yea it was old!!  Plus it was the larger one too.  I didn&#x27;t even realize there was a smaller handled one till I ordered this sonicare toothbrush.  I love the smaller size of this one!!!  Works the same as my old one, which is great.  This one also has a &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; setting.  It runs through the 4 - 30 second timer.... so you brush all sides of your teeth.  Then it has an extra timer that lets you just brush your front teeth to shine them up some.  You can set it to use that or not.  Overall, I love the smaller handle of this brush over the larger one I had.  This works great, just like my old one.  Hopefully it will last as long too.</li>
            <li> When my old brush wore out (after 15+ years), I decided to try this Sonicare.  But I miss the Braun I had previously.  This one does not do as good a job of cleaning and I don&#x27;t like to be told when I should be through brushing.  So I have to run it for a second cycle.  Quite disappointed because I&#x27;d heard such good reviews.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because brushing my teeth properly using a normal toothbrush was not that effective for me. I brushed my teeth twice a day but my dentist still wasn&#x27;t happy. After using this toothbrush my dental health went up because it makes it so easy to properly brush your teeth. My only complaint about this toothbrush is that the toothbrush heads are expensive compared to a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like the way this brush works. I like the travel case provided, it worked out well on the few occasions I needed to take it on a trip.</li>
            <li> This product did work well for 2.5 years.  But THE reason I paid the high price, instead of buying a cheaper option with disposable batteries, is RECHARGEABILITY.  And this week, the toothbrush died because the recharging system isn&#x27;t working anymore.  (It&#x27;s a sealed system, so there&#x27;s no way for an end user to repair it.)  Perhaps my experience is an outlier, but if you were me, would you buy this again?  No way.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. It&#x27;s the best I have ever used. My teeth feel cleaner and seem to have gotten whiter with use. I have a really strong gag reflex and have issues using a normal toothbrush, I do not have any problems with this thing.</li>
            <li> I enjoy brushing with this toothbrush.  It is a joy.  My teeth are whiter. When you push button a second time it whitens the teeth.</li>
            <li> Impulse buy, but one I am very happy with.  Great battery life, white teeth (I&#x27;d post a picture,  but you&#x27;ll just have to take my word on it).  All good :-)</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever bought and couldn&#x27;t imagine changing it.  Was expensive but very much worth the spend. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This does an excellent job cleaning all our teeth (family of 4). They last between 1-2 years. Then the screw that holds the top piece that the tooth brush fits over vibrates itself loose and the toothbrush no longer works. I continue to buy replacements because they are less expensive than dental work and my family seems to need additional assistance with their dental care. I wish Philips would fix this design flaw though.</li>
            <li> I have used an Oral-B brush for about a year, and this product is superior.  Here&#x27;s why: first, it stays charged much longer.  After even a couple of days the Oral-B would start spinning slower, the timer would go much longer than 2 minutes, and it basically needed to stay on the charger at all times to be functional.  This toothbrush doesn&#x27;t do that.  It maintains a charge and it doesn&#x27;t slow down the vibration even when the charge isn&#x27;t at full capacity.  Second, the Oral-B is messy.  There&#x27;s a little hole in the brush head that you have to rinse out, and for some reason my hand would always wind up getting messy so the whole handle would need to be rinsed.  The Sonicare doesn&#x27;t have either of these issues.  The brush head is completely sealed and the handle never gets wet when you use the brush.  I also really appreciate the holder where I can park the toothbrush heads, the travel case, and the little caps that go over each brush head.  But the final difference, and the most important, is that using the Sonicare leaves teeth feeling noticeably cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note: many of the reviews here state that the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; option differs only from the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; option in terms of length (with the whitening option adding an additional 30 seconds).  This is not the case.  The whitening option vibrates in a different pattern from the cleaning option -- this is obvious from the different sound the two options make, as well as how the brush feels on your teeth.  It seems to add a different sort of motion on top of the vibration of the clean option, or maybe it just moves faster, but in any case something different happens during the whitening option.  Unless there&#x27;s been some kind of redesign recently that has affected my brush, I&#x27;m surprised so many people think they&#x27;re the same thing.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend a Sonicare toothbrush.  Our teeth feel so much cleaner and are already whiter.  Absolutely love my Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Durable and easy to take care of.  Does a fantastic job.  No cavities yet!  This model doesn&#x27;t collect gunk like some of the cheaper models are prone to do.  I have used it daily for well over a year.</li>
            <li> Worked great for two years and one month then it died one month beyond the warranty now I need to spend another $100 on a new one.  Not  a happy camper these should last longer.</li>
            <li> Had the toothbrush for 2-3 weeks now, and it is worth every penny. I really would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Ever since using this product, the hygienists are always saying how little work they have to do when cleaning my teeth.  However, in the last two years, both the original and the replacement have failed.  The first time, the handle would just not turn on.  The replacement was very easy and Philips sent the new model without much hassle.  Unfortunately, the second one has begun to fail (randomly vibrates in the middle of the night in a set pattern) and they base the warranty on my original purchase price and not on the replacement date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, my girlfriends Oral-B/Braun works just as well.  I am partial to the Sonicare because I think its gentler but it doesnt make sense to spend $100+ every 2 years if a more reliable alternative exists.</li>
            <li> I had a sonicare for about 3 years and it finally died, so I replaced it with this identical one. 3 years is not bad for something you use every day, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could do a commercial for Sonicare, I would. I was starting to have issues with receding gums in my early 40&#x27;s. My dentist was concerned and wanted to do &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34; and other scary sounding stuff. So, I bought the Sonicare, and used it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using it, it felt funny the first couple of days, but then it seemed perfectly normal. My teeth feel clean afterward and I never experience discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 6 months, I went back to the dentist, and my receding gum numbers actually improved! I&#x27;ve been using it regularly about 3 1/2 years, and I always stay the same. It has made a huge difference in my dental health. And, I also feel less pain than I used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m inspired to brush as often as possible by the tingly, dentist-fresh feeling after using my Sonicare.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush two years and two months ago.  It worked great, and gave me a just from the dentist clean teeth feeling every time I brushed.  My dentist was amazed how little plaque I had on my teeth at check-ups.  It was a great toothbrush.  But it broke after two years and two months.  The brush head no longer stays attached to the base.  I contacted Phillips and they were aware of the problem and were willing to replace it if the brush fell under the two year warranty.  I was two months over warranty.  I feel like if I invest over $150 dollars in a toothbrush  it should last longer than two years.  So the brush gets one stars for being a great toothbrush,  Phillips loses four stars for building a brush designed to break just past warranty.</li>
            <li> still going over 2 years later. happy customers</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean. Definitely happy I made this purchase. Can&#x27;t say anything about long term results as I&#x27;ve only had it a few days.</li>
            <li> the sonicare handle does not vibrate at all after 4~5 days use and fully recharged battery. Replaced a new brush head on the handle but still not work. the recharge battery LED is solid ON that indicate battery is fully charged. So I think it&#x27;s the quality issue. How can I do replace from seller?</li>
            <li> Greetings fellow amazonians I get in touble with my boss every once and again and he makes me use a toothbrush to clean all the dirt stains in the fun house as punishment.  Recently I have developed \\&quot;carney elbow\\&quot; and needed some assistance in completing this task so I went out and bought the sonicare toothbrush to help me. I was very disappointed at the lack of battery life that I get from the brush. Normally. I could make it down the front walkway to the hall of mirrors, but lately I have only made it half as far. Please upgrade the batteries and I will give a higher rating</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  Leaves my teeth feeling as if I just left the dentist.  It also stays charged for a lengthy period of time (more so that the Oral B one I had last).</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush. I had an Oral B for a long time, by my hygienist recommended a Sonicare for me. It has a distinct vibrating feeling that can sometimes feel uncomfortable around the gumline, but definitely the most clean feeling I&#x27;ve had on my teeth at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the two other settings, Sensitive (for the gumline) and CleanWhite for my bottom and top teeth. They both seem to work as claimed.</li>
            <li> What a BIG disappointment!!!!  After receiving my shipment yesterday, I opened the box to find that what was inside was completely different than what was featured on the box as well as the product literature that came in the box.  The toothbrush in the box had less features than what I paid for and didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture on the package.  In addition, the package was missing the compact brush head and the travel case accessories, which were listed as included on the outside of the package.  I should note that the package was sealed in plastic to make it look \\&quot;official\\&quot;.  Needless to say, it&#x27;s being returned and I will never buy from this seller again!  Be warned!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I wish I&#x27;d bought it ten years ago.  I feel that it more thoroughly cleans my teeth, particularly at the gum line, then I could ever do with the traditional toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to several family members and friends.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush manufacturers won&#x27;t agree with this statement, but there is probably no \\&quot;ideal\\&quot; design for a powered toothbrush.  I have used vibrating ultrasonic types like Sonicare, and the rotary type brushes like those by Oral B, and they each have good points, as well as shortcomings.  The vibrating brush works well for general cleaning, while the rotary type is generally better for focusing on specific hard to reach area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Sonicare Healthy White R732 because it was $70 as a Deal of the Day, saving about $50.  After some really bad experiences with short battery life, I had switched from Sonicare to Oral B.  However after several unfavorable checkups, I decided to give Sonicare another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powered handle has three brushing modes, \\&quot;Clean\\&quot;, \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot;.  Pushing the power button, cycles through the three modes.  The first two last 2 minutes, and the third runs 30 seconds longer.  The modes vibrate at different frequencies, but they basically feel the same to me.  It is recommended that you spend 30 seconds brushing each quadrant in your mouth, and the brush beeps every 30 seconds, to let you know when to move on the next quadrant.  The timer function is remarkably accurate, and consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with two types of toothbrushes, the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; and the smaller \\&quot;compact\\&quot;.  The feel of the vibrating ultrasonic brushes is about the same, but having a choice is a nice option.  The compact brush is more maneuverable, and better for getting at some hard to reach areas, like the back teeth.  The Sonicare R732 generally does a decent job of cleaning, and really stimulates the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a light that indicates when the battery is running down, and needs to be charged.  Recharge time is quick, and the charging stand also has provisions for holding two brushes.  Unfortunately both the handle and the brushes are pretty easy to tip over.  The base has a removable top, with a spool for winding the power cord inside.  This is kind of a clever idea, but not entirely successful, as all of the cord can be accommodated.  Also included is a handy plastic travel case for the handle and brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare&#x27;s claim that this brush will whiten your teeth \\&quot;two shades whiter\\&quot; is probably an overstatement.  The brush does a fairly good job of cleaning, but of course supplementary cleaning, like flossing is still required.  Overall, I&#x27;m fairly happy with the unit, but I&#x27;m hoping that the battery does not crap out prematurely, as has happened with the previous Sonicares I have owned.  Unlike Oral B&#x27;s rotating brushes, there do not appear to be any less expensive generic alternatives, for the Sonicare brush heads, which run about ten bucks each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results of modern dentistry can be impressive, but the costs of the newer dental technologies can get quite high.  Referrals to specialists for procedures like root canals, implants, and bridges, can also add to your costs.  Replacing a tooth can easily run $1000 for a crown, or $4000 for an implant.  Now more than ever, practicing good dental hygiene, might save you a bundle in future dental bills.  The cost of the Sonicare or any other quality powered brush isn&#x27;t insignificant, but spending a few hundred now, could possibly save a few thousand later.for winding the power cord inside.

            <li> I ordered 2 of these and they are great! I like the different settings. Also, I lost a cap and needed one from Philips and they wre more than happy to send me one. Outstanding service!</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Sonicare power toothbrushes and think they are the best toothbrushes you can buy.  The first one I owned, which had screw-on e-series toothbrushes and the quadpacer feature (don&#x27;t know model number), was very durable and lasted so long I can&#x27;t remember the purchase date (but I would guess lasted between 5 to 10 years) before it broke.  The toothbrushes that screwed on to the handle usually lasted me about 6 months before needing replacement.  Given my positive experience with this toothbrush, I ordered the newer Healthywhite version, primarily because it looked like a more advanced model and used the new pro results toothbrushes which cost less than the e-series brushes (presumably because they do not have the plastic screw-on attachment head to the brush handle so 3 cost of these cost the same as 2 e-series heads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 16 months of use, the part on the top of the Healthywhite brush handle where the toothbrushes attach by sliding the toothbrush on broke (it wiggles back and forth) so that the toothbrush will not vibrate properly. I called Amazon who gave me the number for Philips Sonicare since the unit was still under the 2 year warranty.  Philips was very good about replacing the brush handle and told me they would send me a replacement handle under the warranty and that I should send back the old one in the same box with the UPS label provided.  I&#x27;m waiting for the replacement to arrive now.  So I&#x27;m sure this will resolve favorably.  But as I told Philips, I don&#x27;t think this newer design where you have to push the toothbrush onto the handle and pull it off to replace it is as durable as the screw-on mount for the e-series toothbrush since it has to withstand that force over time where there is no such force on the handle when screwing on the e-series toothbrushes.  Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that the pro results toothbrushes do not last as long as the old e-series ones.  So I&#x27;m not sure the savings on the new toothbrushes are there either.  Based on my experience, if I were buying a Sonicare toothbrush now, I would buy the older model one that has the e-series toothbrushes.  Unfortunately the new toothbrushes that use the e-series heads (the Essence) don&#x27;t appear to have the quadpacer timer feature which I like so you have to trade that off.  But given the durability I have found, I think I would still buy the basic model with the e-series brush until Sonicare comes up with a better way to attach the brushes on their newer models.  Don&#x27;t know what others have experienced with durability, but that is mine.  I rated this toothbrush 3 stars because Sonicare is still the best toothbrush out there, but downgraded it because of the durability issues mentioned here.</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare for years, ever since my dentist recommended one.  The one I had for almost 3 years just died (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars).  For the month before I bought a replacement, I was using a hand-held brush, and thought I was doing a good job.  When this one arrived, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my teeth after just one brushing.  I highly recommend this, even though it is a little pricey - when I think of the money I have saved at the dentist, it is worth every penny.</li>
