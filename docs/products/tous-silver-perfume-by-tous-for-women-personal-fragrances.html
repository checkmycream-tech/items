            <li> Tous: Finally I found a Perfume that last all day. Sweet Soft scent! Shipping was fast: Product was sealed in original box.</li>
            <li> When I received this item, it was defective.   Pump is not working.  I have a picture but I couldn&#x27;t upload.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too strong for me. The scent is very common. I&#x27;ll give to my sister as a gift. Cute bottle though.</li>
            <li> I was in Spain over the holidays and received the lotion in this scent. When I got back to the states I knew I wanted the perfume. I love this! I wear it almost every day. It&#x27;s nice and light- so never overpowering. Definitely. recommended.</li>
