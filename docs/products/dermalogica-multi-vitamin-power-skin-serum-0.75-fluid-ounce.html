            <li>I would like to see dermalogica bring back the best product that they made ,multivitamin capsules.</li>
            <li>Love the product..</li>
            <li>&amp; my skin is showing it!  :-)</li>
            <li>Smells nice, goes on smooth, but no visible difference.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I bought it at my massage spa and it was $20 more...</li>
            <li>I love the feel</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I called dermalogica looking for an excellent product called multivitamin power firm capsules that they sold for years that was amazing and always worked well on my skin.</li>
            <li>incredibly good, even for day use... feels oily but doesnt really look like,</li>
            <li>And Did reduce fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Cheaper than the stores and same great quality</li>
            <li>my skin feels smooth after apply it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth feel and</li>
            <li>and i see a significant difference in my appearance and</li>
            <li>, I LOVE me some Target!) &amp; exfoliating with St Ives facial scrub!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dead of winter up here in MN, but my skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Saw a difference in my skin with my first use.</li>
            <li>Love that they now make this in a larger tube</li>
            <li>I love this product because it really gives my skin regime that extra kick and makes my skin just glow.  </li>
            <li>But it feels great - and costs much less than from individual suppliers.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for two years, and I feel it really makes a difference in the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it erased lines any more that any other serum</li>
            <li>It goes on great and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Maybe it would work better if I used their other products.</li>
            <li>This product gives my skin the extra boost it needs in vitamins, as well as leaving the skin super hydrated.</li>
            <li>I can clearly see a difference...</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen any change since starting this about 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>One tub can not last you much</li>
            <li>It made my skin sooo soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I have completely noticed a difference in the texture, tonality, firmness &amp; moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li>In combination with my Age Smart daily exfoliate cleanser, toning mist, Serum &amp; SPF 30 daily moisturizer &amp; Thermo exfoliate 2x per week,  </li>
            <li>Not only did this product not live up to the multivitamin capsules but this product I found to be very drying to the skin and completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>To discontinue an amazing product to replace with a useless product.</li>
            <li>It put elasticity back in my 44 year old Florida tanned skin.  </li>

            <li> I gave this to my sister, because it was too greasy and didn&#x27;t soak into my skin like I felt it should have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dermalogica  products for for about 25 years and love them.. They may be pricey but they keep your skin moist and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I also get facials once a month with dermalogica products.  Sometimes I look in the mirror and can&#x27;t believe my age.</li>
            <li> This little tube is like dynamite. It leaves your skin soft and smooth. I love my dermalogica products, these products are some of the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen any change since starting this about 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I called dermalogica looking for an excellent product called multivitamin power firm capsules that they sold for years that was amazing and always worked well on my skin.They said that the product had been discontinued and that this product took was the replacement.Well ,I am completely disappointed.Not only did this product not live up to the multivitamin capsules but this product I found to be very drying to the skin and completely ineffective.Dermalogica really got it wrong this time.To discontinue an amazing product to replace with a useless product.I would not purchase again.I would like to see dermalogica bring back the best product that they made ,multivitamin capsules.</li>
            <li> Love the product.. I have used Dermalogica products for years...</li>
            <li> Saw a difference in my skin with my first use. Skin was smoother &amp; softer.  Love this!</li>
            <li> This product is good but too small and expensive too. One tub can not last you much so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you want to spend money.</li>
            <li> Who knows whether it is making a difference?  But it feels great - and costs much less than from individual suppliers.</li>
            <li> I loved this serum. It made my skin sooo soft to the touch. Don&#x27;t think it erased lines any more that any other serum but it sure feels luxurious!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dermalogica for years this is a great product- it goes on so smooth, love it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product gives my skin the extra boost it needs in vitamins, as well as leaving the skin super hydrated.</li>
            <li> I photographed my face before starting this using this and then again after a month and i see a significant difference in my appearance and my pores are smaller.  I am so satisfied!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a brand snob- unless it comes to Dermalogica.  I love this product because it really gives my skin regime that extra kick and makes my skin just glow.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone as well as any other Dermalogica product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product on the recommendation of my aesthetician.  A little goes a long way.  Love the way this product makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> Love this! In combination with my Age Smart daily exfoliate cleanser, toning mist, Serum &amp; SPF 30 daily moisturizer &amp; Thermo exfoliate 2x per week,  I have completely noticed a difference in the texture, tonality, firmness &amp; moisture in my skin. It&#x27;s dead of winter up here in MN, but my skin looks amazing! Several months ago I was just washing my face with a Target brand face wash (no offense Target, I LOVE me some Target!) &amp; exfoliating with St Ives facial scrub! I&#x27;ve come along way &amp; my skin is showing it!  :-) A very Happy &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; product user! FYI....check prices on here before buying them at a salon or spa, I&#x27;m noticing cheaper prices on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Quality is very good.That I like.I would recommend to my friends.I trust the amazon</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the stores and same great quality</li>
            <li> Dermalogica is an amazing skin care line... You will see results if you use it faithfully!  It put elasticity back in my 44 year old Florida tanned skin.  And Did reduce fine lines.  Been using line about a month and a half... I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, goes on smooth, but no visible difference. Would also prefer a product that doesn&#x27;t require the application of a moisturizer following treatment. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month and I can&#x27;t discern any difference in my face.  It goes on great and a little goes a long way but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  Maybe it would work better if I used their other products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I bought it at my massage spa and it was $20 more...I love the feel</li>
            <li> Love that they now make this in a larger tube</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years, and I feel it really makes a difference in the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Great product. the best serum I ever had. my skin feels smooth after apply it.</li>
            <li> If you read a negative review by M.M. Lindquist, DISREGARD.  I was responding to another of my orders that took forever to arrive.</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s smooth feel and the glow I get after use. I typically use it at night after cleansing my face and the next day I can clearly see a difference... Although this takes a continuous use for best results.</li>
