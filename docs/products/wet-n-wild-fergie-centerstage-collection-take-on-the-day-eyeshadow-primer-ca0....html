            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>the amount of smudged product is greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li>Still, this is a great primer</li>
            <li>Great eye primer for the money.</li>
            <li>Bought this at CVS for about 5 bucks just to try it out, and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Its works great once</li>
            <li>This is amazing!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just that good</li>
            <li>This stuff is good.</li>
            <li>If you had told me years ago that I needed an eyeshadow primer, I would have laughed and walked away.</li>
            <li>OMG I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously in love!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>This has amazing staying power.  </li>
            <li>but not anymore because this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing beyond words.</li>
            <li>Stays put all day and eye shadows stay on nicely</li>
            <li>Lasts around 6-8 hours, which is plenty of time to look good :)</li>
            <li>And I am so happy I have found the right one.</li>
            <li>Under lighting and camera focus, it is perfect since no reflection or over shine, instead in brings out the colors more vividly.</li>
            <li>but I get much better color out of my eye shadows with a primer and longer wear even on the cheap eyeshadows I own.</li>
            <li>I have very oily eyelids and have always experienced my eyeshadow creasing after at most 2 hours.</li>
            <li>, I would rather spend more and get a better quality primer.</li>
            <li>This one is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use the Color Tattoo Leather eye shadow from Maybelline (it&#x27;s the matte, taupe/nude color)</li>
            <li>but when I use a shimmer powder I can tell the color looks a lot better.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s my favorite at the drugstore as well.</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT put the primer after the eyeliner, always before, and never add more primer after the liner is placed.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it enhances the look, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>This has simply been one of the best, even over brands you may find at the sephora/ulta stores.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love and will re-buy.</li>
            <li>After reading many good reviews here, I decided to give it a try because it is very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The first day I tried it out, I wore it to the fair on top of my sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Careful application is in your best interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works so perfectly and performs better than most other higher end brands.. love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It does come off easily.</li>
            <li>It smoothes the area where I applied it and the eyeshadow easily sits on it without a smudge.</li>
            <li>Still, for the price, it is pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>before, I couldn&#x27;t make it four hours without a huge smudge crease from my eyeliner and shadow.  </li>
            <li>and so cheap.  </li>
            <li>primer is so cheap at around $5 in stores.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s cruelty free and inexpensive compared to Sephora brands, and works as designed.  </li>
            <li>I tried using my finger to put it on at first, but  I found I have more control as to were</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy, applies smoothly, and sets quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bought it after seeing it recommended all over r/makeupaddiction, and boy were they right!</li>
            <li>The next day not so good.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and had no problems at all with NYX creasing even after a full 12+ hours in atlanta heat.</li>
            <li>I mainly apply it all over my top lid and up to my eyebrow.</li>
            <li>I apply Fergie&#x27;s primer around 6:30am and by 10pm, it&#x27;s still fresh.  </li>
            <li>It also holds the makeup in place and keeps it fresh.</li>
            <li>It keeps my eye shadow and liner fresh as if it had just been put on.</li>
            <li>It dries more clear than UD&#x27;s primer and works in pretty well.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love that it&#x27;s in a tube, although I do have to be careful about squeezing it out because it is easy for too much to be released.  </li>
            <li>I only recently got into makeup and learned what eye primer is, and in all fairness this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried, but the difference is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li>This works better than my Nars and Urban Decay shadow primers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>My only advice (considering how much more tacky this primer is than UD) is to apply a neutral shadow to help blending.  </li>
            <li>Well when that ran out I decided to try this brand as I liked their other makeup products, and I was not wrong.</li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly, dries fast, looks natural, and makes my eyeliner stay put all day.</li>
            <li>that when I finally have to take it off at the end of the night, I actually feel like I&#x27;m wasting good makeup bc</li>
            <li>now my black liquid eyeliner stays so perfect and dark all day</li>
            <li>Bought this eyeshadow primer based upon the positive reviews of others.</li>
            <li>This is just as good if not better than any of them.</li>
            <li>I also notice that my eyeliner doesn&#x27;t migrate as easily to the inner corners of my eyes and get goopy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have noticed that blending shadows is a little trickier, but I&#x27;ve found that if you apply light layers, and use good brushes, the learning curve is minimal.</li>
            <li>whoa...bargain product that rivals the high end shadow primers!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t go on smoothly, was entirely too &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; and settled into my eyelid crease almost immediately!</li>
            <li>It works really well for my oily lids.</li>
            <li>I have very oily eye lid</li>
            <li>Another thing I like is that I can correct any mistakes I&#x27;ve made with my eyeliner before it really sets (</li>
            <li>It really brings out lower lid lines.</li>
            <li>Tends to gloop around my creases but besides that this works very well.</li>
            <li>But BEWARE of how much you use...</li>
            <li>It went on smooth, dried quickly and invisibly.</li>
            <li>It comes in a squeeze tube so for the first several days, every time I removed the lid I had to hurry and get a dab then slam the lid back in place because it oozed out all on its own, but since a big air bubble escaped the flow is controllable.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is not only fabulous from an aesthetic point of view, it saves me from the mega-annoying burning and blurring that attacks my eyes near the end of a work day in a humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement for some of the more expensive primers I&#x27;ve been using--the latest one was $20 for .37</li>
            <li>Primer a must for older women.  </li>
            <li>I wore a particular eyeshadow out for Halloween and it was creased and almost gone when I got home.</li>
            <li>previously I was using a nude cream matte eye shadow as a primer as I hadn&#x27;t had very good luck with eye primers in the past, which worked acceptable well.</li>
            <li>Beats the high end versions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I am a single mom who is up early, works on her feet all day as a hairdresser, runs my kids to after school activities, and then off to the gym to workout and run, so it is important to have something that really works.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite eyeshadow primer ever, &amp; I&#x27;ve tried several high end brands too, including Too Faced, Urban Decay Primer Potion, &amp; Nars.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and since my toddler broke my first AND second tube of NYX in the exact same way....</li>
            <li>Keeps eye makeup looking fresh all day long!</li>
            <li>So ANYWAY - this stuff isn&#x27;t just by far the best eyelid base I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I was so surprised how well</li>
            <li>it creases do not waste your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>wild is what I arrive on?  </li>
            <li>&#x27;n&#x27; Wild...</li>
            <li>The only time I have ever had to reapply is when the weather is really, really humid.</li>
            <li>ie; Steals it from counter, runs as far away as he can cackling and eventually drops it on tile floor.</li>
            <li>Primer makes a difference with the look more edgy and gives impact.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would prevent me from buying this is if, after trying the highly rated one from Hard Candy, I like that one better, because it&#x27;s also around that price</li>
            <li>I put the exact same shadow on over this primer and it lasted all that day, through sleeping and until I took it off the next night.</li>
            <li>the last primer I used was like concrete).</li>
            <li>I was hot and sweaty, and even got wet from some water rides</li>
            <li>so the color payoff isn&#x27;t as intense (which isn&#x27;t to be expected for matte colors)</li>
            <li>If it were colorless like Bare Minerals eye primer this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  </li>
            <li>Applying this stuff to my eyelid, especially along the lash line, where you&#x27;d put the eyeliner, has completely eliminated the problem.</li>
            <li>This inexpensive little tube does the job very well!  </li>
            <li>and I have tried E.L.F, Hard Candy and many other drugstore brand and none of them works.</li>
            <li>can (actually, I find my shadows easier to blend over this vs. bare skin).</li>
            <li>and I would suggest not using for under the eye, due to the high illuminating component.</li>
            <li>It is a bit &amp;#34;tackier&amp;#34; than Urban Decay and NARS brand eye primer, so blending on it bare is more difficult.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a way tiny price for a product that truly performs, I&#x27;d say that Wet n Wild Fergie Centerstage primer is an absolutel MUST BUY, and I guarantee that you will not regret buying it!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the really expensive primers, I&#x27;m a little too frugal for that, but I think this is a really good product.  </li>

            <li> It really brings out lower lid lines.</li>
            <li> Tends to gloop around my creases but besides that this works very well.</li>
            <li> But BEWARE of how much you use...</li>
            <li> It went on smooth, dried quickly and invisibly.</li>
            <li> It comes in a squeeze tube so for the first several days, every time I removed the lid I had to hurry and get a dab then slam the lid back in place because it oozed out all on its own, but since a big air bubble escaped the flow is controllable.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is not only fabulous from an aesthetic point of view, it saves me from the mega-annoying burning and blurring that attacks my eyes near the end of a work day in a humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for some of the more expensive primers I&#x27;ve been using--the latest one was $20 for .37</li>
            <li> Primer a must for older women.  </li>
            <li> I wore a particular eyeshadow out for Halloween and it was creased and almost gone when I got home.</li>
            <li> previously I was using a nude cream matte eye shadow as a primer as I hadn&#x27;t had very good luck with eye primers in the past, which worked acceptable well.</li>
            <li> Beats the high end versions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am a single mom who is up early, works on her feet all day as a hairdresser, runs my kids to after school activities, and then off to the gym to workout and run, so it is important to have something that really works.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite eyeshadow primer ever, &amp; I&#x27;ve tried several high end brands too, including Too Faced, Urban Decay Primer Potion, &amp; Nars.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and since my toddler broke my first AND second tube of NYX in the exact same way....</li>
            <li> Keeps eye makeup looking fresh all day long!</li>
            <li> So ANYWAY - this stuff isn&#x27;t just by far the best eyelid base I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I was so surprised how well</li>
            <li> it creases do not waste your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> wild is what I arrive on?  </li>
            <li> &#x27;n&#x27; Wild...</li>
            <li> The only time I have ever had to reapply is when the weather is really, really humid.</li>
            <li> ie; Steals it from counter, runs as far away as he can cackling and eventually drops it on tile floor.</li>
            <li> Primer makes a difference with the look more edgy and gives impact.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would prevent me from buying this is if, after trying the highly rated one from Hard Candy, I like that one better, because it&#x27;s also around that price</li>
            <li> I put the exact same shadow on over this primer and it lasted all that day, through sleeping and until I took it off the next night.</li>
            <li> the last primer I used was like concrete).</li>
            <li> I was hot and sweaty, and even got wet from some water rides</li>
            <li> so the color payoff isn&#x27;t as intense (which isn&#x27;t to be expected for matte colors)</li>
            <li> If it were colorless like Bare Minerals eye primer this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  </li>
            <li> Applying this stuff to my eyelid, especially along the lash line, where you&#x27;d put the eyeliner, has completely eliminated the problem.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive little tube does the job very well!  </li>
            <li> and I have tried E.L.F, Hard Candy and many other drugstore brand and none of them works.</li>
            <li> can (actually, I find my shadows easier to blend over this vs. bare skin).</li>
            <li> and I would suggest not using for under the eye, due to the high illuminating component.</li>
            <li> It is a bit &amp;#34;tackier&amp;#34; than Urban Decay and NARS brand eye primer, so blending on it bare is more difficult.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a way tiny price for a product that truly performs, I&#x27;d say that Wet n Wild Fergie Centerstage primer is an absolutel MUST BUY, and I guarantee that you will not regret buying it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the really expensive primers, I&#x27;m a little too frugal for that, but I think this is a really good product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few eye shadow primers, all which have been high end</li>
            <li> 34 years and several department store brand tries later - and wet</li>
            <li> have noticed it makes my lids feel a bit dry, but I&#x27;m chalking that up to inexperience at this point.</li>
            <li> Not only my eye shadow powder is vibrant when I put on, but the stayput power is ALL DAY for at least 14 hrs, even with sweating from workout!</li>
            <li> Only minor complaint is that it is sheer and does not cover discoloration but that is not a deal breaker for me, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can get a little funky if it doesn&#x27;t get blended enough where it meets primers intended for the rest of your face, leaving light streaks that are difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> On a night of somewhat sloppy makeup removal (I did my face better than my eyes, it was late</li>
            <li> I have to 2nd the previous reviewer on Fergie&#x27;s eye primer.  </li>
            <li> but DAMN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to be a little greasy lidded, so my eyeliner tends to wander a little over the course of the day, right into the crease a little black ring.  </li>
            <li> ON TOP of the fact that all the others are just that bad.  </li>
            <li> Well I went to the store and the clerk advise to use Fergie&#x27;s primer from Wet</li>
            <li> Another scam by the cosmetic companies, to make you think you need something where no real need exists.</li>
            <li> and is roughly $4.99 at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> The look that you worked so hard to achieve in the early morning will not be flaking off, running down, or clumping into an unattractive blob in the crease of your lids.</li>
            <li> Does not emphasize lines or creepiness but be careful to only apply a small amount.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little also goes a long way</li>
            <li> This does a fantastic job of really making my makeup stay in place, without being terribly viable itself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it daily for the past couple of weeks and it does keep my shadow in place all day with no creasing and little fading.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the cost</li>

            <li> Great primer for oily eyelids. Keep my shadows perfect for &amp;#62;10 hours. Does not emphasize lines or creepiness but be careful to only apply a small amount. It is a bit tacky so it is perfect for glittery or powdery shadows. Only minor complaint is that it is sheer and does not cover discoloration but that is not a deal breaker for me, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised how well this works! Keeps my shadow looking great all day.</li>
            <li> Best eye primer ever. It lasts all day and even throughout the night, if i am too lazy to wash it off. A little goes a long way. The color is beautiful. I have semi oily lids, and this still lasts all day.</li>
            <li> previously I was using a nude cream matte eye shadow as a primer as I hadn&#x27;t had very good luck with eye primers in the past, which worked acceptable well. Well when that ran out I decided to try this brand as I liked their other makeup products, and I was not wrong. I have only used 3 days but I get much better color out of my eye shadows with a primer and longer wear even on the cheap eyeshadows I own. I would definitely recommend! Only reason I give 4 of 5 is that I haven&#x27;t used for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I have very oily eyelids and have always experienced my eyeshadow creasing after at most 2 hours. I only recently got into makeup and learned what eye primer is, and in all fairness this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried, but the difference is AMAZING! Shadow stays 12+ hours without even the slightest hint of sliding or creasing. Even if there were a more expensive brand I would not switch over since this does the job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed it makes my lids feel a bit dry, but I&#x27;m chalking that up to inexperience at this point. I love this product and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> it creases do not waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;It creases and does not last . the color is poor and it does not pop the color of the eyeshadow. the worst primer ...it feels like cracking glue ......</li>
            <li> wow.  34 years and several department store brand tries later - and wet n wild is what I arrive on?  I found out about this on one of those make up blogger YouTubes where they tell you what they love and hate - I worked really hard to find one that was not endorsing products bc they&#x27;re paid to - which I think I did.  So ANYWAY - this stuff isn&#x27;t just by far the best eyelid base I&#x27;ve ever used, it&#x27;s literally the only one that&#x27;s ever worked for me.  before, I couldn&#x27;t make it four hours without a huge smudge crease from my eyeliner and shadow.  now my black liquid eyeliner stays so perfect and dark all day that when I finally have to take it off at the end of the night, I actually feel like I&#x27;m wasting good makeup bc it still looks like I just left the house.  I know - it&#x27;s just make up - I don&#x27;t mean to go on and on but it&#x27;s just that good ON TOP of the fact that all the others are just that bad.  you gotta try it.  it&#x27;s a miracle.  and so cheap.  it&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> Beats the high end versions I&#x27;ve tried. And there&#x27;s a lot in that little tube..</li>
            <li> I have to 2nd the previous reviewer on Fergie&#x27;s eye primer.  I was recently informed to buy an eye primer since I just started applying shadows...going through a life reinvention lol.  Well I went to the store and the clerk advise to use Fergie&#x27;s primer from Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild...OMG I am so glad I did!  I have used this product everyday.  I apply Fergie&#x27;s primer around 6:30am and by 10pm, it&#x27;s still fresh.  No creases or runny eyeliner making my eyes burn.  It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.  This is a must have in my make up collection.  The price range is around $5 at your local drugstore too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the really expensive primers, I&#x27;m a little too frugal for that, but I think this is a really good product.  It comes in a squeeze tube so for the first several days, every time I removed the lid I had to hurry and get a dab then slam the lid back in place because it oozed out all on its own, but since a big air bubble escaped the flow is controllable.  I&#x27;ve used it daily for the past couple of weeks and it does keep my shadow in place all day with no creasing and little fading.  I have noticed that blending shadows is a little trickier, but I&#x27;ve found that if you apply light layers, and use good brushes, the learning curve is minimal.</li>
            <li> whoa...bargain product that rivals the high end shadow primers! This works better than my Nars and Urban Decay shadow primers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t crease or wear off.... shadow lasts ALL day and night!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was great! The next day not so good. I will keep using it to see how well it works.</li>
            <li> This product works just as well as UD shadow insurance. No need to spend $21.</li>
            <li> Bought this eyeshadow primer based upon the positive reviews of others. Completely worthless. Does not extend the life of eyeshadow at all.</li>
            <li> I did not like this primer at all! It didn&#x27;t go on smoothly, was entirely too &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; and settled into my eyelid crease almost immediately! Terrible. The color is nearly white, which I get is to make your shadow pop, but this looked horrible. Not worth the cost, I would rather spend more and get a better quality primer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good. No, it&#x27;s really, really, really GOOD! If you had told me years ago that I needed an eyeshadow primer, I would have laughed and walked away. Another scam by the cosmetic companies, to make you think you need something where no real need exists. WRONG! This stuff is not only fabulous from an aesthetic point of view, it saves me from the mega-annoying burning and blurring that attacks my eyes near the end of a work day in a humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product actually keeps your eye shadow from slowly sliding down into your eyes. The look that you worked so hard to achieve in the early morning will not be flaking off, running down, or clumping into an unattractive blob in the crease of your lids. Who knew? I thought there was no way around such discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a way tiny price for a product that truly performs, I&#x27;d say that Wet n Wild Fergie Centerstage primer is an absolutel MUST BUY, and I guarantee that you will not regret buying it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got oily eyelids and although I don&#x27;t usually have a problem with eye shadow disappearing from them (that I thought anyway) I did have issue with eyeliner on my lower lid smudging throughout the day.  I used to use the $1 E.L.F. primer but I just didn&#x27;t care for it.  This one is so much better.  First of all, I love that it&#x27;s in a tube, although I do have to be careful about squeezing it out because it is easy for too much to be released.  It&#x27;s creamy, applies smoothly, and sets quickly.  I mostly use the Color Tattoo Leather eye shadow from Maybelline (it&#x27;s the matte, taupe/nude color) so the color payoff isn&#x27;t as intense (which isn&#x27;t to be expected for matte colors) but when I use a shimmer powder I can tell the color looks a lot better.  This has amazing staying power.  My lower lid eye liner stays put all day and even though I still have a little smudge in my outer corners (I guess that can&#x27;t be helped because they get a little watery) the amount of smudged product is greatly reduced.  I also notice that my eyeliner doesn&#x27;t migrate as easily to the inner corners of my eyes and get goopy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This primer is so cheap at around $5 in stores.  The only thing that would prevent me from buying this is if, after trying the highly rated one from Hard Candy, I like that one better, because it&#x27;s also around that price but you get 1 fl oz as opposed to the .34 oz from Wet N Wild.  Still, this is a great primer and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed after trying it.</li>
            <li> I used to buy expensive eye primer. but not anymore because this stuff is amazing.  It is a bit &amp;#34;tackier&amp;#34; than Urban Decay and NARS brand eye primer, so blending on it bare is more difficult.  Still, for the price, it is pretty amazing.  It dries more clear than UD&#x27;s primer and works in pretty well. My only advice (considering how much more tacky this primer is than UD) is to apply a neutral shadow to help blending.  Despite oily lids, my eyeshadow lasts over 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Great eye primer for the money. Stays put all day and eye shadows stay on nicely</li>
            <li> It works really well for my oily lids. My eye makeup lasts all day after applying this primer.</li>
            <li> This product works great! Keeps eye makeup looking fresh all day long!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST primer I have ever tried!! I have very oily eye lid and I have tried E.L.F, Hard Candy and many other drugstore brand and none of them works. My eye shadow was all creased and disappear after 4 hours. After reading many good reviews here, I decided to give it a try because it is very reasonable price. And I am so happy I have found the right one. Not only my eye shadow powder is vibrant when I put on, but the stayput power is ALL DAY for at least 14 hrs, even with sweating from workout! I highly recommended to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite eyeshadow primer ever, &amp; I&#x27;ve tried several high end brands too, including Too Faced, Urban Decay Primer Potion, &amp; Nars. This is just as good if not better than any of them. And it&#x27;s my favorite at the drugstore as well. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make shadows difficult to blend like some primers can (actually, I find my shadows easier to blend over this vs. bare skin). Lasts all day, and all night-in fact, I&#x27;ve taken it to the 24 hr mark &amp; still had no fading, no creasing. Shadow holds up perfectly in heat &amp; humidity as well. Definitely a must have!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I always had a problem with my eyeshadow staying on all day. With this product my eyeshadow stays on all day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Best primer I&#x27;ve ever used including Benefits, Milani, Elf. It literally lasts ALL day. I get out of my house at 8am and I don&#x27;t come back till 10pm. This primer makes my eye makeup stay matte during all that time. I&#x27;m seriously in love! I got it at my local Walmart for $5 and I think you can find it at Walmart.com as well in case you don&#x27;t have one nearby.</li>
            <li> Works so perfectly and performs better than most other higher end brands.. love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for some of the more expensive primers I&#x27;ve been using--the latest one was $20 for .37 fl oz.  This product is .34 fl oz and is roughly $4.99 at Walmart.  I was pretty skeptical at first, but I have to say this stuff is the BOMB--it goes on smoothly, dries fast, looks natural, and makes my eyeliner stay put all day. The only time I have ever had to reapply is when the weather is really, really humid. I am a single mom who is up early, works on her feet all day as a hairdresser, runs my kids to after school activities, and then off to the gym to workout and run, so it is important to have something that really works.  Another thing I like is that I can correct any mistakes I&#x27;ve made with my eyeliner before it really sets (the last primer I used was like concrete). I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product works GREAT!! I have oily eye lids and never wore eye make up just because it would practically be a waste of time. My make up tends to fade or disappear within an hour after applying. Bought this at CVS for about 5 bucks just to try it out, and it worked great. Doesn&#x27;t last all day for me. Lasts around 6-8 hours, which is plenty of time to look good :)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and since my toddler broke my first AND second tube of NYX in the exact same way.... ie; Steals it from counter, runs as far away as he can cackling and eventually drops it on tile floor. Somehow the tube cracks around the top/threading... Sigh....I wanted to try something that wasn&#x27;t in a hard plastic tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, so I decided to try the wet n wild fergie blah blah blah. I wore it for approximately 6 hours in the afternoon to the early evening. It went on smooth, dried quickly and invisibly. It however DID NOT LAST AT ALL. I cannot stress this enough. After 6 hours my eyeshadow was 3/4 gone and creased to all hell. I have oily skin and had no problems at all with NYX creasing even after a full 12+ hours in atlanta heat. I am stuck having paid 10$ for a utterly useless product.</li>
            <li> I brought this because of the reviews.  This stuff is like glue for your eye makeup .  I tried using my finger to put it on at first, but  I found I have more control as to were I put it if I use an eye shadow applicator to apply it. The only con I have found is that it has color to it, like a base.  You have to put it only were you are going to put your eye makeup, or else you&#x27;ll see the primer where you haven&#x27;t applied eye shadow.  If it were colorless like Bare Minerals eye primer this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  But overall it&#x27;s awesome.  I fell asleep with my eye makeup on and when I woke up the next day all of my eye makeup was still in place, including my eye liner. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong when I say it&#x27;s like glue for eye makeup,  It does come off easily.</li>
            <li> Primer makes a difference with the look more edgy and gives impact. It also holds the makeup in place and keeps it fresh. I used it with the centerstage compact palette and the eyeliner. DO NOT put the primer after the eyeliner, always before, and never add more primer after the liner is placed. You will have a mess and fixing it will be hair pulling. The primer comes out watery if you do not shake it prior to opening. A little also goes a long way and I would suggest not using for under the eye, due to the high illuminating component. It really brings out lower lid lines. I mainly apply it all over my top lid and up to my eyebrow. I use it since it also gives the lightened appearance I apply it as an arch enhancer (light/shadow play). I also fan it out from the outer corner of my eye to the edge of the eyebrow end, for shaping and outlining purposes. Its works great once, you (again) shake prior to application. It smoothes the area where I applied it and the eyeshadow easily sits on it without a smudge. I did not witness any common cracks common with makeup. It keeps my eye shadow and liner fresh as if it had just been put on. I also love the fact that it enhances the look, which is always a plus. Under lighting and camera focus, it is perfect since no reflection or over shine, instead in brings out the colors more vividly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different eye primers over the years. This has simply been one of the best, even over brands you may find at the sephora/ulta stores.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing beyond words. I forgot to take eye makeup off before shower and it was still there when I got out. It didn&#x27;t look perfect but it was still there!</li>
            <li> This does a fantastic job of really making my makeup stay in place, without being terribly viable itself.  On a night of somewhat sloppy makeup removal (I did my face better than my eyes, it was late and I was lazy) I woke up in the morning with a lot of my eyeliner still in it&#x27;s proper place!  I was shocked.  This is by no means an endorsement of leaving makeup on over night but DAMN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to be a little greasy lidded, so my eyeliner tends to wander a little over the course of the day, right into the crease a little black ring.  No more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can get a little funky if it doesn&#x27;t get blended enough where it meets primers intended for the rest of your face, leaving light streaks that are difficult to remove.  Careful application is in your best interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fairly pale, so if it is streaking at all anywhere else, its not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cruelty free and inexpensive compared to Sephora brands, and works as designed.  I have no complaints!  Get some!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. A friend who is obsessed with makeup recommended this to me because I was constantly dealing with my eyeliner leaving a line at the crease of my eye just from opening and closing my eyes all day. I was constantly licking my finger and trying to inconspicuously wipe it off. Applying this stuff to my eyelid, especially along the lash line, where you&#x27;d put the eyeliner, has completely eliminated the problem. Would recommend it to any of my friends with the same eyeliner problems.</li>
            <li> Primer a must for older women.  This inexpensive little tube does the job very well!  Why spend big bucks when you don&#x27;t have to!</li>
            <li> How have I lived my life without this product? I bought it after seeing it recommended all over r/makeupaddiction, and boy were they right! Just a dab to each eye in the morning, and no eye shadow creases/my liquid eyeliner wings stay PERFECT all day. The first day I tried it out, I wore it to the fair on top of my sunscreen. I was hot and sweaty, and even got wet from some water rides but my eyes still looked flawless! This will be a product for life for me!</li>
            <li> Tends to gloop around my creases but besides that this works very well.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! But BEWARE of how much you use...because it WILL. STAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, quite awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few eye shadow primers, all which have been high end (lorac, urban decay, smashbox) and this puts them to shame. I wore a particular eyeshadow out for Halloween and it was creased and almost gone when I got home. I put the exact same shadow on over this primer and it lasted all that day, through sleeping and until I took it off the next night. Kept the shadow pigmented and matte without any creasing. Best part is, it&#x27;s so affordable. Love and will re-buy.</li>
