            <li>I absolutely LOVE these!</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I bought these!</li>
            <li>Great eye brow shaper easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use an offer me great control in shapeing my brows.</li>
            <li>Great for quick touch ups!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>There may be something better out there, but these are good for now.</li>
            <li>they are the perfect size and they really do their job without any pain.</li>
            <li>and I liked the price</li>
            <li>My oldest daughters have even complimented on how nice they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice size product.  </li>
            <li>Work nicely for keeping the hair along my neck nice and even after a haircut.</li>
            <li>The ridges on the blades are a nice safety feature.</li>
            <li>I still pluck but these are so handy</li>
            <li>these kind of do feel like I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>But that was my own fault and not the reason I&#x27;m giving 1 star.  </li>
            <li>a guy trimming your own eyebrows, you&#x27;ll need to google how to do it or something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten these from the dollar store before, and really liked them.</li>
            <li>so I could use it and gave one to my sister for a sanity check, her feedback mirrored my own.</li>
            <li>I got these shapers to help clean up the fine hairs along my brow line, and they serve that purpose wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Also perfect for those super fine hairs that won&#x27;t come out with tweezing or waxing.</li>
            <li>The razor section is nice and compact, so it is very easy to use with out worrying about lopping off an eyebrow.</li>
            <li>These are very good, I&#x27;m still on my first one after a couple months of use.  </li>
            <li>great product easy to use i love the size of these.</li>
            <li>I love these, they are perfect for on the go, for touch ups or to cover large areas of the face.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t ever purchase another brand, this is by far the best - nice, close &#x27;shave&#x27; to the brow area</li>
            <li>Does what it needs to do, so that makes me  super happy.</li>
            <li>These are great for quick touchups when getting to the salon or waxing my eyebrows at home isn&#x27;t an option either because of time or not wanting to have to wait for the redness and puffiness from waxing to go away.</li>
            <li>Use it the day I received it,is very easy and my brows looks like I had them waxed,</li>
            <li>That means that it&#x27;s very easy to cut yourself.  </li>
            <li>these mini razors are a very easy way to get the eye brows you want.  </li>
            <li>I found it very easy to accidentally whisk away a portion of my eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>These are the best by far to shape eyebrows!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect on those spots that are too sensitive for waxing or shaving.</li>
            <li>I bought these after reading they were useful to shape brows and am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It was nice to be able to order them.</li>
            <li>Super handy and surprisingly well made.</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing invention, LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>These are so easy to use and work so well!</li>
            <li>Very handy and useful for us quilters.</li>
            <li>But this is an amazing product for such a great price!</li>
            <li>I cut myself too many times with this one-not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li>They do the job but the top of the razor isn&#x27;t protected by the plastic sheath which makes it VERY easy to cut off parts of your eyebrow that you don&#x27;t want to cut.</li>
            <li>I use them to groom the top of my eyebrows for a cleaner look and they&#x27;re very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Plus, a set of three helps prevent me from not having one in case one should break, The price is also pretty great.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, last forever and just perfect.</li>
            <li>I have used so many eyebrow shaper, and I love this kind of shape the best since it is more convenient to trim my eyebrows in various ways.</li>
            <li>Love these shapers.</li>
            <li>Great price fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>Walmart has since quit carrying them in their stores and I am glad that I found them here.</li>
            <li>I found this product also by chance at Walmart but can no longer find it anywhere, so I am glad I can order it here.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I love them have been using them for years</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I also am glad they come in a packet of three</li>
            <li>They should be able to take off hair but not make you bleed.</li>
            <li>I got Noxema and they worked magic.</li>
            <li>Many people here are complaining how to use it since the pack doesn&#x27;t have any directions.</li>
            <li>You will give them longer life :)</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;~ SkyLee :)</li>

            <li>I love this product!!!It</li>
            <li>is excellent to remove any facial hair.</li>
            <li>Better off using a twin-blade razor or just tweezing.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find them in &amp;#34;Family Dollar&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE.  </li>
            <li>So glad I discovered these.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great packaging.</li>
            <li>I can be controlled and safe as I shape my  brows.</li>
            <li>Its perfect for shaping eyebrows and even trimming the upper lip area.</li>
            <li>I shared with my mom and bought two more packages for myself.</li>
            <li>so you can get a better look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gets the areas that need it most.</li>
            <li>they make these. :)</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I think they work much better than these.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Love that they have cap too to avoid accidents.</li>
            <li>Better than tweezing</li>
            <li>Awesome the only thing I use...</li>
            <li>I dont think they are safe and will not buy them again..</li>
            <li>and I will finda way to make them work better.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to see amazon had them.</li>
            <li>I stock pile theses because both of my daughters also love to use these shavers.</li>
            <li>I love these shavers.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done and it does it well :)</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found these</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the size compared to competitors.</li>
            <li>Not the best blade (incomparison to a regular razor)  </li>
            <li>but it can get under the eyebrow better.</li>
            <li>Would have cost more to return than I paid for them.  </li>
            <li>I love these shapers.  </li>
            <li>I love the lil blades more convenient then the wider blades.</li>
            <li>Also there have been so many times that I&#x27;ve taken off more hair than I wanted because my finger slipped.</li>
            <li>I LOVE them</li>
            <li>it was okay</li>
            <li>will have to find a better shaper</li>
            <li>buy some more someday soon.</li>
            <li>It does a better job if you apply a lubricant (moisturizer, oil etc) over area that you want to use this on.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere else</li>
            <li>tip, may not work for everyone: I find these work better when I hold them vertically and go *with* the direction of the hair growth, not against it.</li>
            <li>No matter how I angled the blade, they didn&#x27;t do anything more than scrape the skin.</li>
            <li>Love these and couldn&#x27;t find them in stores.</li>
            <li>I love that they come in a multi-pack</li>
            <li>They do what they supposed to do, and are a much better quality than generics.</li>

            <li>I will be purchasing more when I use up my pack.</li>
            <li>but I did it myself :)</li>
            <li>(The review box says I must add more words.)</li>
            <li>They tug and pull more hair than it shaves off.</li>
            <li>I love these and recommend them to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Bought three more packs</li>
            <li>These seem to be better quality than what I had</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>The Noxzema Eyebrow Razors are the best eyebrow razor ever, I&#x27;ve tried them all and all the other ones cut you, Noxzema are amazing.</li>
            <li>Thank you so Much!!!!</li>

            <li>I love these for quick and easy brow cleanup!</li>
            <li>For some reason, they&#x27;re not as easily available in most box chains &amp; brick &amp; mortars.</li>
            <li>I am so glad these are still available</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Good size and very convenient.</li>
            <li>When styles change, I should have more of my original brows than those who pluck everything off.  </li>
            <li>But other than that, great for the price!</li>

            <li>Also, make sure you keep them clean.</li>

            <li>It it precise and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work well for fine hairs but for coarser hairs I switched to tweezers anyway.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t remove the fine hairs</li>
            <li>Straight portion is easy and handy.</li>
            <li>These are excellent tools for getting the little hairs around the brows.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my purse, and those little hairs that seem to grow out of nowhere.</li>
            <li>However, they are a huge improvement over the others I have used.</li>
            <li>But this product, serves the purpose and was definitely worth the purchase :)</li>
            <li>These things are amazing and they save so much time.</li>
            <li>Was open when it arrived but the product is great.</li>
            <li>Leaving the existing hair.&lt;br /&gt;Using it lightly.  </li>
            <li>now, the longer version of this product is readily available just about everywhere.</li>
            <li>Oh my god, its really fantastic.</li>
            <li>These are such a great alternative to tweezers.</li>
            <li>Great for also sculpting goatee&#x27;s and lining up facial hair.</li>
            <li>was light with this</li>
            <li>so I put them in my cart to receive free shipping</li>
            <li>(I wanted free shipping and didn&#x27;t want to spend money on something I wouldn&#x27;t use).</li>
            <li>These tiny shavers are great.</li>
            <li>Great for touch-ups in between waxing, but sufficient for regular use.</li>
            <li>I hope these are always available.</li>
            <li>sound like an ad</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and handle and gets the job done like getting rid of peach fuzz and getting a clean edge.</li>
            <li>It does the job, however it does not keep the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>They are CHEAP compared to getting waxes.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>its also smooth to work around</li>
            <li>did use a fresh one on my eyebrows to see what angles the blade cuts at, it worked okay there.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d always have a sneezing fit.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to keep my eyebrows polished on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Noxzema Eyebrow Shaper, 3-pack is very useful.</li>
            <li>quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to create the shape I want instead of hoping that plucking this clump of hair doesn&#x27;t leave me looking jacked.</li>
            <li>First time I satisfied after looking my eyebrows shape, into mirror.</li>
            <li>So when I found them here I was excited..</li>
            <li>She was so nervous, but once I started she got so excited</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>the skin around my brows for a super smooth appearance, just like waxing.</li>
            <li>Leave the area feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li>I can even get my boyfriend to let me clean up his eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I recommend wiping clean with a sponge applicator and maybe a dab of alcohol rather than using water to clean.</li>
            <li>works when you need to clean up in a pinch</li>
            <li>I just kept it clean with alcohol</li>
            <li>Works as described and as pictured :) Very sharp and nice for my eyebrows!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>However, I will warn that although it claims it won&#x27;t cut you, it might if you don&#x27;t use it right!</li>
            <li>It was pretty easy to clean my eyebrows up.  </li>
            <li>Those were surely  weeks of embarrassment when I had no shape and too much hair.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something to do my ebrows at home, and this product is a good product for a low cost.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say my skin has not been this clear in many,many years.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t seem to cut close enough to give a good shave to the eyebrows and leave stubble.</li>
            <li>A great way to &amp;#34;tweeze&amp;#34; at home quickly, but CAREFUL</li>
            <li>Anyway, the first time I used it I was amazed by how easy it was...</li>
            <li>Sharp n great.</li>
            <li>But other than the nicks and cuts it is a great</li>
            <li>Sharp, works great as brow shaper.</li>
            <li>Really great for when I&#x27;m being super lazy and don&#x27;t feel like plucking before shaping, also SUPER great for those upper lip hairs, even those that you can&#x27;t see in the mirror.</li>
            <li>I bought these to grab those fair hairs that are under the eyebrows that are kind of hard to see and tweeze.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use these because they work very well and are very cost effective.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to spend 10 minutes picking out a million hairs when I can quickly shave it off if I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t do much brow shaving with this shaper - I understand the protect were supposed to be protective, but they are really kind of getting in the way...</li>
            <li>a quick use of this will nip them off.</li>
            <li>I CAN GROOM MY EYEBROWS QUICKLY IN THE MORNING.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually only been able to find them at Walmart but was glad to find them here when they ran out.</li>
            <li>For the price I feel they are both a good value and worth trying to find your personal preference.</li>
            <li>I think the reason it&#x27;s better than most is because it is smaller...</li>
            <li>I have went through several different brands of shavers and these work the best.</li>
            <li>Blade guards wear off quickly</li>
            <li>I use these to shape my eyebrows and they get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick &amp; painless.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, and easy to store because each one comes with its own little plastic head cover.</li>
            <li>These are easy to work with in small areas and are a great bargain.</li>
            <li>These are great little tools for clean up shaping.</li>
            <li>Might be better for someone with normal skin.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this since the appearance of my eyebrows and eye area is so important to me.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t really do</li>
            <li>I am sure glad that I finally discovered these as trying to pluck each and every tiny fine hair with tweezers was getting overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It works great if you need something to help you keep between the eyebrows clean and clear of extra hair.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>The first time I try, but I didn&#x27;t hurt myself!</li>
            <li>so when I saw them on Amazon I got pretty excited.</li>
            <li>Really recommend if you don&#x27;t want the hassle of plucking and aren&#x27;t a &#x27;wax&#x27; person!!</li>
            <li>But with practice, I quickly learned to be careful and was able to space out my salon eyebrow waxing by a few weeks, saving myself a great amount of $$!</li>
            <li>Nosema made something when they made these just plain easy to use..feels good in your hands..</li>
            <li>This works great to get rid of these little hairs that start popping out on your face and chin making you look like a cat fish if you don&#x27;t pluck or pull them.</li>
            <li>These little razors are great.</li>
            <li>These are great for getting little stray hairs where a razor is not ideal/practical.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little blade.</li>
            <li>Since I want a more natural look, I don&#x27;t wax my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Although the diferent colors ae fun they obvously don&#x27;t make a difference in their functioning.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Smile.</li>
            <li>Love these these are very convenient to do touches up on your face or bikini line always have to have a couple ready for me</li>
            <li>These are the only product of this kind worth using.</li>
            <li>Very handy little razors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and small and can for under your brow or in between much easier than mkt razors if it&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li>These are not that sharp, but they work good.  </li>
            <li>It is just the right size to do the job.</li>
            <li>boys\\&quot; if you are doing it right</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t test it on your face right away unless you want to.</li>
            <li>As long as you are careful when you deal with this rather sharper blade, it would give you excellent results.</li>
            <li>Great little tool!</li>
            <li>I keep a supply of these on hand all the time because they are a great little tool!  </li>
            <li>super good little razors for my eye brows.</li>
            <li>These are so easy to use even my tweens feel comfortable trimming their eyebrows and facial hair!  </li>
            <li>Great for removing hair in small places.</li>
            <li>Its good for a person who cant handle the pain of tweezing them, but I think Ill stick to my tweezers because they are much more precise.</li>
            <li>A handy tool for you cosmetic bag as long as you kerp the lid on it.</li>
            <li>Love, love these little eyebrow razors.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think shapers like this are 100% effective at getting rid of thicker hair (wax or tweezers are the way to go for that), and the hair does grow back quickly, but this is still a handy little tool for your beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li>I love these handy little beauty tools!!</li>
            <li>Is great to shave off facial hair and or hairs on the body that need outside grooming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally pulled them out today to use before a series of business trips, and I can&#x27;t get over how easy and painless it was to clean up and sculpt my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>have a lot of dark facial hair, but my problem is that most of it is very fine and can&#x27;t be removed easily with tweezers.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re small but VERY effective.</li>
            <li>Oh,and they are a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fast and painless.</li>
            <li>The size and shape makes for a much more precise shave than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I personally think it is good to be sharper because it would be worn out someday more quickly if it is less sharper than this.</li>
            <li>This is a good little product.</li>
            <li>A quick and easy way to touch up those eyebrows and the occasional chin hair...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty neat</li>
            <li>I got exactly the shape</li>
            <li>Always try to figure what exactly your shape is.</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought them is because I have not been able to find these at the dollar stores anymore and its quite the bummer.</li>
            <li>When I went to buy more later, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.</li>
            <li>On first use, I got a cut on my brow.  </li>
            <li>Meaning that sometimes the hair doesn&#x27;t come off the first time through.</li>
            <li>and Im still using the first blade shaper.</li>
            <li>rated these razors as 4 stars because they don&#x27;t have a safety like the others do, so they&#x27;re a bit easier to cut yourself if you&#x27;re in a hurry or don&#x27;t have a super steady hand.</li>
            <li>And these can definitely take off more hair than you want to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of plucking and this is so much easier than going to get my brows waxed or threaded!</li>
            <li>Last time I used razors they performed better than tweezers</li>
            <li>Thanks NOXEMA!</li>
            <li>I lost one the first day.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>They have wire guards so not to remove the whole ear, MEN!</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t understand exactly how to use this.</li>
            <li>They do not sell this exact brand in any stores around here anymore</li>
            <li>Anyways, I really like these!</li>
            <li>I mostly use to help &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; my eyebrows (get rid of the scragglers above and then between my eyebrows).</li>
            <li>Came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Love these...will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this I felt the slightest sting on my skin once I was done</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>(just be sure you use the shaper at the proper angle).</li>
            <li>and I have been trying to find these exact ones in beauty stores and only been able to find the square off ones.</li>
            <li>My first time using these on my brows</li>
            <li>I purchased these a few years ago at a dollar store and loved them.</li>
            <li>I love how little the blade is, so mistakes are not as easy to make unlike waxing.  </li>
            <li>Be careful though because it is very easy to get cut while using them.</li>
            <li>Love that these get the blonde hairs along with the other stragglers and give a smooth, clean look to your brows.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews, they were positive which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li>I like the angled ones better but these work great and were less expensive than the angled ones I was able to find.</li>
            <li>The heads are very small which makes them easier to use; you can see what you&#x27;re doing better and have more control over where you are using the blade.</li>
            <li>These brow shapers are great if you are looking for a one-time thing for your brows or other facial hair.</li>
            <li>It is smaller than regular size so it can shaper my eyebrow more precisely</li>
            <li>; on my first try I managed to hamfist the whole thing and gave myself a scrape on the side of my face.  </li>
            <li>Vertical is trickier as you have to be careful not to get too close to your eyes on the bottom or too close to the top of your brows when you&#x27;re shaving above them, but once you get the hang of things, it should all be pretty quick and clean.</li>
            <li>Its a good lil blade but to small.</li>
            <li>I like the small blade size which is great for getting around the brow area, but I have to say that the blade dulls quite easily.  </li>
            <li>I bought these because I get pesky little blonde hairs around my eyebrows, and they work beautifully.</li>
            <li>and then when it grows back it&#x27;s &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; so I can easily identify which hairs to pluck easier.</li>
            <li>These are the only brand that are easy to hold, control, and shave without scratching your skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and simple.</li>
            <li>but I certainly wont be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very fine eyebrows that are so blonde they are almost clear.</li>
            <li>Sharp and easy to use!</li>
            <li>the one that was fine only worked on one try.</li>
            <li>Nice little tool.</li>
            <li>Great deal as an &#x27;add on&#x27; - tough to find in stores</li>
            <li>These little razors are great for the eyebrows and sometimes I use them to trim up my hairline or above my lip.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Noxzema.</li>
            <li>These work very well although they don&#x27;t have instructions.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to order very often.  </li>
            <li>I wanted ie an arch with no cuts and no too much hair gone.</li>
            <li>Now, I am ready to use these razors in those days when I am not in a mood to shape my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>So much faster and</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>so you can really get in and shape eyebrows.</li>
            <li>so I could do my eyebrows because I much prefer to shave them</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and they really make a difference.</li>
            <li>Need to be gentle or you could cut yourself</li>
            <li>Now, not so much.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;ridges&amp;#34; on the blades I received also seem to be some sort of bent plastic and don&#x27;t really look like the photo at all.</li>
            <li>and they do not cut off too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Noxzema eyebrow shaper.</li>
            <li>It really gets the hair with no pain</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t go all the time as much as I want to keep my eyebrows done, these helps me maintain the look.</li>
            <li>With these I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot over and over to remove the hair which leads to smooth skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li>It performed better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really make too much of an appearance for me to be upset about.</li>
            <li>These really don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>The Nieva is so much cheaper purchasing them through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Because the price was much lower, this time I bought them from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re are very efficient.</li>
            <li>There only seem to be cheap knockoffs and pricier electric versions, both of which either don&#x27;t work or slice their faces up because there are no blade guards like there are on the Noxzema ones.  </li>
            <li>that road before and found that I removed too much and it looked&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>If you are fast at tweezing and don&#x27;t mind I would still try this as a comparison.</li>
            <li>so the whole family can share them.</li>
            <li>Grooms eyebrows very well.</li>
            <li>It shaves really well and doesn&#x27;t cut you.</li>
            <li>For stray hairs anywhere or to groom your whole brow.</li>
            <li>It is basically a straight razor</li>
            <li>Thanks, J</li>
            <li>So much easier than plucking or waxing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Gives a nice exfoliation and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back coarse.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just sharp enough to clean around the brows and the small size is perfect</li>
            <li>Very very useful for instant fixing of eyebrows</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re small and I can fit them in my make-up bag for easy travel.</li>
            <li>When I first got them I like that they were not large and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>easy and lasts long</li>
            <li>Not only does it save time, but it cleans up in a smooth extra clean way.</li>
            <li>THese are the best little ryr brow shavers and are becoming difficult to even find.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product and do not like them and the main reason is that if you use them at a certain angle they cut like a knife .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t figure out if I got a defective product or if these shapers are just like this, but the top edges of mine are sharp angles instead of rounded ones.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, safe, inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>the eyebrow shaper is sharp but safe to use.</li>
            <li>The past 2 years I haven&#x27;t been able to find these in the stores!  </li>
            <li>They are sharp for sure but isn&#x27;t that kinda the point?</li>
            <li>Only eyebrow razor worth using!  </li>
            <li>These babies are SHARP and do the job mostly painless.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited I&#x27;ll probably stock up big time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every other one I could think to buy and with these the hair comes right off and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>Always clean them after you are done using and place the cap properly.</li>
            <li>clean, deep, cuts.  </li>
            <li>Precise and lasts really long.</li>
            <li>but they aren&#x27;t they are way smaller - it does come with this eyebrow curve which is cool</li>
            <li>Absolutely live them!</li>
            <li>i really like it , its new and its just what i want  </li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t careful, you can easily cut yourself.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use these as my main grooming tool for my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I had some issues with forgetting to not add the bill because this was a birthday present and upon contacting the seller they were quick to respond and not include the bill as requested.  </li>
            <li>Maybe there was a goof-up in my particular batch.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to my battery powered trimmer (which I HIGHLY suggest over this.)</li>
            <li>I love these little razors.</li>
            <li>I love these little devices.  </li>
            <li>Love these for little touch ups~  </li>
            <li>They are sharp, so easy does it when shaping brows etc.</li>
            <li>They take the fine hairs right off with little effort, and the protectant on the razors actually does protect the skin pretty well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much painless to use these, they&#x27;re gentle on your skin and your hair grows back thinner and much slower.</li>
            <li>I found these at Wal Mart a few years ago and love them.</li>
            <li>that tweezers normally can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>These little guys are sharp, and effective!</li>
            <li>They work great to sculpt in tight little spaces around your brows.</li>
            <li>This is my second time buying this i love it unlike other ones this one is gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>Got these for my Wife but As a male I like to keep my eyebrows clean and these are simple and fast to use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re small enough to be able to see where youre going and not accidentally chop off your eyebrow, though be careful because its pretty easy to do.</li>
            <li>With this I have a very clean look everyday</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>I am new to the US, and I was worried, how I am going to manage my bushy eyebrows.    </li>
            <li>And brand new.</li>
            <li>Love these little guys!</li>
            <li>, it is very easy to nick your delicate skin, as there is no razor guard on these teeny eyebrow shapers.</li>
            <li>I use for my eye brows as im very sensitive to waxing and do not like threading..</li>
            <li>I originally found this product at a local discount store and loved them, I went back to get more a few times until they didnt have them any more and have been using the same dull blades now ever since (at least a year--maybe 2)...</li>
            <li>Have been looking for eyebrow shaper for long finally found it,it so easy to use,but u have to be careful,so that it doesn&#x27;t cut it,other than that</li>
            <li>the blades are strong, portable, and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>This is my first eyebrow razor experience and I&#x27;m left with the &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love the small size of these.</li>
            <li>I have used Noxzema&#x27;s small bikini razors for years and love them, so I thought I would give these a try.</li>
            <li>I have been using these for 7 years and my local Family Dollar store stopped carrying this exact brand.</li>
            <li>no more plucking for me :)</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it should, helps with upkeep of eyebrows without having to pluck hairs individually.</li>
            <li>easy to maneuver and do a little trimming at a time.</li>
            <li>Be super careful.</li>
            <li>The blades are very cheap and dull.  </li>
            <li>Simple, quick and painless for those necessary unexpected touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other razor-tipped eyebrow shapers in the past with good results, but found these to be a pain.</li>
            <li>These are great little razors except for the fact that they don&#x27;t stay sharp very long.</li>
            <li>I purchased many other brands, trying to find one that measured up to noxema but they all seemed dull the very first time I took them out of the pack and used them.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure to wet your skin and wet the razor.  </li>
            <li>I took too much hair from my left eyebrow and got blood off when I used that.</li>
            <li>Snagged my hairs and the sensitive skin on my face.</li>
            <li>go wild with it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; break out with creams,bleaches &amp; tweezing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, and took off a bit too much on one brow.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to even those of you who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And it wont get all the hair off completely.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t give a very close shave and left me with stubble around my eye brows.</li>
            <li>Hairs grow back in twice as fast.</li>
            <li>They are cheap, but it is still a waste of your money.</li>
            <li>If I had to find something negative about it would be that you need to do this more often than tweezing.</li>
            <li>So I converted and this is so much easier than trying to pluck when your short sighted like I am.</li>
            <li>I started using these after I was put on a medicine that caused my skin to be more delicate.</li>
            <li>Good thing they werent expensive.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those who hate to pluck.</li>
            <li>It is a cool way to get rid of those small eyebrow/upperlip hairs without pain.&lt;br /&gt;Although the removal doesn&#x27;t last long since it takes the upper layer only, its good when you need to get rid of those hair in short time.</li>
            <li>Small, precise, sharp and get the job done quickly and neat</li>
            <li>Very sharp, small in size, perfect for brows and small areas.</li>
            <li>Mainly because I think the product itself was too big.</li>
            <li>Great little product, use the big ones for on top of the eyebrow or other weird stray hairs.</li>
            <li>Gurl, Im a male who like to have his brows to be high definition.</li>
            <li>They are small enough to put into a purse and the handle on it is long enough for you to get a good grip</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands, but none are as sharp have the precision like these do!</li>
            <li>This makes them very hard to pluck both because you can&#x27;t see them and because they are so fine that tweezers can&#x27;t really grip them, so I generally stick to eyebrow razors.</li>
            <li>Handy little product to have, even I use them to trim my sideburns and other unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>They get dull faster, but I also don&#x27;t cut off my eyebrows so easily.</li>
            <li>They are much easier to maneuver than a standard razor and because of that they don&#x27;t leave your skin red and irritated where you use them.</li>
            <li>they are not sharp enuf and seem to almost &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They are okay, but not a smooth razor and don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Im not sure how long they last, as I have only used mine a handful of times but they do work nicely and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li>Most people mess up their eyebrows because they try to have arch when their natural shape is round.</li>
            <li>I have looked high and low for these shavers in my local stores, however I can&#x27;t find them anywhere!</li>
            <li>However, I went to another dollar general a couple towns over and bought a stock pile.</li>
            <li>It does not drag or scrape over you skin.  </li>
            <li>They barely remove hair but cause my skin to flake in the process.</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s you get individual or stray hairs without shaving vital hairs you do not want to remove.</li>
            <li>and I accidentally make tiny cuts on my face, but that&#x27;s completely my fault.</li>
            <li>baby hairs that you can barely see or pull with a tweezer.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful that you do not put too much pressure as you can cut yourself.</li>
            <li>Once I bought these, because I was tired of getting cut, I was pleased.</li>
            <li>Worth the few bucks I paid.</li>
            <li>Not very sharp.</li>
            <li>I had trouble getting the right angle.  </li>
            <li>I did slightly cut my skin below my eyebrow when I first tried this out</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found these are much easier to hold and control than the off-brand ones at Family Dollar and other places.</li>
            <li>I call them my lil helpers, their sharp but gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing for me other than giving me a rash.</li>
            <li>The blade is sharp and cuts away hair very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted the razors inside these products are always straight &amp; you need to be careful, it&#x27;s the curved casing that makes the difference- especially for eyebrow shaping!!!</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but the last 2 packs I purchased of these left me marked for life.  </li>
            <li>If they were a little smaller and a little safer they would be a better product.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy for clipping stray hairs as well as little clusters.</li>
            <li>Has safety wires on the blade so you don&#x27;t cut your face but that also makes it a little harder to use and get a clean shape</li>
            <li>It had been discontinued at my local dollar general which is why I bought it</li>
            <li>My eyebrows grow back very fast, so sometimes I have to use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t leave the skin red like plucking does, and are sharp enough to really cut the hairs.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and they shape eyebrows very well.</li>
            <li>Anyways, these are small and get into the right places.  </li>
            <li>to all: do not apply pressure with this razor, your thought of removing, single hairs, clear hairs,&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Small and doesn&#x27;t dull super fast!</li>
            <li>I am very upset, considering that I paid for a pack of three, and only received a half open pack of one!</li>
            <li>Really like these little trimmers.  </li>

            <li> They are easy to use an offer me great control in shapeing my brows.</li>
            <li> Great for quick touch ups!</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>

            <li> they are the perfect size and they really do their job without any pain.</li>
            <li> and I liked the price</li>
            <li> My oldest daughters have even complimented on how nice they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice size product.  </li>
            <li> Work nicely for keeping the hair along my neck nice and even after a haircut.</li>
            <li> The ridges on the blades are a nice safety feature.</li>
            <li> I still pluck but these are so handy</li>
            <li> these kind of do feel like I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> nice</li>
            <li> But that was my own fault and not the reason I&#x27;m giving 1 star.  </li>
            <li> a guy trimming your own eyebrows, you&#x27;ll need to google how to do it or something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten these from the dollar store before, and really liked them.</li>
            <li> so I could use it and gave one to my sister for a sanity check, her feedback mirrored my own.</li>
            <li> I got these shapers to help clean up the fine hairs along my brow line, and they serve that purpose wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Also perfect for those super fine hairs that won&#x27;t come out with tweezing or waxing.</li>
            <li> The razor section is nice and compact, so it is very easy to use with out worrying about lopping off an eyebrow.</li>
            <li> These are very good, I&#x27;m still on my first one after a couple months of use.  </li>
            <li> great product easy to use i love the size of these.</li>
            <li> I love these, they are perfect for on the go, for touch ups or to cover large areas of the face.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t ever purchase another brand, this is by far the best - nice, close &#x27;shave&#x27; to the brow area</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to do, so that makes me  super happy.</li>
            <li> These are great for quick touchups when getting to the salon or waxing my eyebrows at home isn&#x27;t an option either because of time or not wanting to have to wait for the redness and puffiness from waxing to go away.</li>
            <li> Use it the day I received it,is very easy and my brows looks like I had them waxed,</li>
            <li> That means that it&#x27;s very easy to cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> these mini razors are a very easy way to get the eye brows you want.  </li>
            <li> I found it very easy to accidentally whisk away a portion of my eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> These are the best by far to shape eyebrows!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect on those spots that are too sensitive for waxing or shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading they were useful to shape brows and am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It was nice to be able to order them.</li>
            <li> Super handy and surprisingly well made.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing invention, LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use and work so well!</li>
            <li> Very handy and useful for us quilters.</li>
            <li> But this is an amazing product for such a great price!</li>
            <li> I cut myself too many times with this one-not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> They do the job but the top of the razor isn&#x27;t protected by the plastic sheath which makes it VERY easy to cut off parts of your eyebrow that you don&#x27;t want to cut.</li>
            <li> I use them to groom the top of my eyebrows for a cleaner look and they&#x27;re very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Plus, a set of three helps prevent me from not having one in case one should break, The price is also pretty great.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, last forever and just perfect.</li>
            <li> I have used so many eyebrow shaper, and I love this kind of shape the best since it is more convenient to trim my eyebrows in various ways.</li>
            <li> Love these shapers.</li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> Walmart has since quit carrying them in their stores and I am glad that I found them here.</li>
            <li> I found this product also by chance at Walmart but can no longer find it anywhere, so I am glad I can order it here.</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> I love them have been using them for years</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I also am glad they come in a packet of three</li>
            <li> They should be able to take off hair but not make you bleed.</li>
            <li> I got Noxema and they worked magic.</li>
            <li> Many people here are complaining how to use it since the pack doesn&#x27;t have any directions.</li>
            <li> You will give them longer life :)</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;~ SkyLee :)</li>

            <li> is excellent to remove any facial hair.</li>
            <li> Better off using a twin-blade razor or just tweezing.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find them in &amp;#34;Family Dollar&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE.  </li>
            <li> So glad I discovered these.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great packaging.</li>
            <li> I can be controlled and safe as I shape my  brows.</li>
            <li> Its perfect for shaping eyebrows and even trimming the upper lip area.</li>
            <li> I shared with my mom and bought two more packages for myself.</li>
            <li> so you can get a better look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This gets the areas that need it most.</li>
            <li> they make these. :)</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> I think they work much better than these.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Love that they have cap too to avoid accidents.</li>
            <li> Better than tweezing</li>
            <li> Awesome the only thing I use...</li>
            <li> I dont think they are safe and will not buy them again..</li>
            <li> and I will finda way to make them work better.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> so I was glad to see amazon had them.</li>
            <li> I stock pile theses because both of my daughters also love to use these shavers.</li>
            <li> I love these shavers.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and it does it well :)</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found these</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the size compared to competitors.</li>
            <li> Not the best blade (incomparison to a regular razor)  </li>
            <li> but it can get under the eyebrow better.</li>
            <li> Would have cost more to return than I paid for them.  </li>
            <li> I love these shapers.  </li>
            <li> I love the lil blades more convenient then the wider blades.</li>
            <li> Also there have been so many times that I&#x27;ve taken off more hair than I wanted because my finger slipped.</li>
            <li> I LOVE them</li>
            <li> it was okay</li>
            <li> will have to find a better shaper</li>
            <li> buy some more someday soon.</li>
            <li> It does a better job if you apply a lubricant (moisturizer, oil etc) over area that you want to use this on.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere else</li>
            <li> tip, may not work for everyone: I find these work better when I hold them vertically and go *with* the direction of the hair growth, not against it.</li>
            <li> No matter how I angled the blade, they didn&#x27;t do anything more than scrape the skin.</li>
            <li> Love these and couldn&#x27;t find them in stores.</li>
            <li> I love that they come in a multi-pack</li>
            <li> They do what they supposed to do, and are a much better quality than generics.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTLY LOVE</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more when I use up my pack.</li>
            <li> but I did it myself :)</li>
            <li> (The review box says I must add more words.)</li>
            <li> They tug and pull more hair than it shaves off.</li>
            <li> I love these and recommend them to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Bought three more packs</li>
            <li> These seem to be better quality than what I had</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> The Noxzema Eyebrow Razors are the best eyebrow razor ever, I&#x27;ve tried them all and all the other ones cut you, Noxzema are amazing.</li>
            <li> Thank you so Much!!!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a learning curve with these, but I find they take off the eyebrow hair very cleanly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to handle and are very precise.</li>

            <li> Worked great, a little too great.</li>
            <li> I love these for quick and easy brow cleanup!</li>
            <li> For some reason, they&#x27;re not as easily available in most box chains &amp; brick &amp; mortars.</li>
            <li> I am so glad these are still available</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Good size and very convenient.</li>
            <li> When styles change, I should have more of my original brows than those who pluck everything off.  </li>
            <li> But other than that, great for the price!</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow razor I&#x27;ve purchased, I&#x27;ve tried other brands from the drugstore</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> and I was able to clean up my eyebrow area before my party</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure you keep them clean.</li>
            <li> The little mini-razors are perfect for me and are very easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> makes shaping easy and the strays disappear quickly!</li>
            <li> Perfect for eyebrows and other places, i use it to trim side burns and etc too!</li>
            <li> It it precise and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work well for fine hairs but for coarser hairs I switched to tweezers anyway.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove the fine hairs</li>
            <li> Straight portion is easy and handy.</li>
            <li> These are excellent tools for getting the little hairs around the brows.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my purse, and those little hairs that seem to grow out of nowhere.</li>
            <li> However, they are a huge improvement over the others I have used.</li>
            <li> But this product, serves the purpose and was definitely worth the purchase :)</li>
            <li> These things are amazing and they save so much time.</li>
            <li> Was open when it arrived but the product is great.</li>
            <li> Leaving the existing hair.&lt;br /&gt;Using it lightly.  </li>
            <li> now, the longer version of this product is readily available just about everywhere.</li>
            <li> Oh my god, its really fantastic.</li>
            <li> These are such a great alternative to tweezers.</li>
            <li> Great for also sculpting goatee&#x27;s and lining up facial hair.</li>
            <li> was light with this</li>
            <li> so I put them in my cart to receive free shipping</li>
            <li> (I wanted free shipping and didn&#x27;t want to spend money on something I wouldn&#x27;t use).</li>
            <li> These tiny shavers are great.</li>
            <li> Great for touch-ups in between waxing, but sufficient for regular use.</li>
            <li> I hope these are always available.</li>
            <li> sound like an ad</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and handle and gets the job done like getting rid of peach fuzz and getting a clean edge.</li>
            <li> It does the job, however it does not keep the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> They are CHEAP compared to getting waxes.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> its also smooth to work around</li>
            <li> did use a fresh one on my eyebrows to see what angles the blade cuts at, it worked okay there.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d always have a sneezing fit.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to keep my eyebrows polished on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Noxzema Eyebrow Shaper, 3-pack is very useful.</li>
            <li> quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to create the shape I want instead of hoping that plucking this clump of hair doesn&#x27;t leave me looking jacked.</li>
            <li> First time I satisfied after looking my eyebrows shape, into mirror.</li>
            <li> So when I found them here I was excited..</li>
            <li> She was so nervous, but once I started she got so excited</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> the skin around my brows for a super smooth appearance, just like waxing.</li>
            <li> Leave the area feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li> I can even get my boyfriend to let me clean up his eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I recommend wiping clean with a sponge applicator and maybe a dab of alcohol rather than using water to clean.</li>
            <li> works when you need to clean up in a pinch</li>
            <li> I just kept it clean with alcohol</li>
            <li> Works as described and as pictured :) Very sharp and nice for my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> However, I will warn that although it claims it won&#x27;t cut you, it might if you don&#x27;t use it right!</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy to clean my eyebrows up.  </li>
            <li> Those were surely  weeks of embarrassment when I had no shape and too much hair.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to do my ebrows at home, and this product is a good product for a low cost.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say my skin has not been this clear in many,many years.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t seem to cut close enough to give a good shave to the eyebrows and leave stubble.</li>
            <li> A great way to &amp;#34;tweeze&amp;#34; at home quickly, but CAREFUL</li>
            <li> Anyway, the first time I used it I was amazed by how easy it was...</li>
            <li> Sharp n great.</li>
            <li> But other than the nicks and cuts it is a great</li>
            <li> Sharp, works great as brow shaper.</li>
            <li> Really great for when I&#x27;m being super lazy and don&#x27;t feel like plucking before shaping, also SUPER great for those upper lip hairs, even those that you can&#x27;t see in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I bought these to grab those fair hairs that are under the eyebrows that are kind of hard to see and tweeze.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use these because they work very well and are very cost effective.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to spend 10 minutes picking out a million hairs when I can quickly shave it off if I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t do much brow shaving with this shaper - I understand the protect were supposed to be protective, but they are really kind of getting in the way...</li>
            <li> a quick use of this will nip them off.</li>
            <li> I CAN GROOM MY EYEBROWS QUICKLY IN THE MORNING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually only been able to find them at Walmart but was glad to find them here when they ran out.</li>
            <li> For the price I feel they are both a good value and worth trying to find your personal preference.</li>
            <li> I think the reason it&#x27;s better than most is because it is smaller...</li>
            <li> I have went through several different brands of shavers and these work the best.</li>
            <li> Blade guards wear off quickly</li>
            <li> I use these to shape my eyebrows and they get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick &amp; painless.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, and easy to store because each one comes with its own little plastic head cover.</li>
            <li> These are easy to work with in small areas and are a great bargain.</li>
            <li> These are great little tools for clean up shaping.</li>
            <li> Might be better for someone with normal skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this since the appearance of my eyebrows and eye area is so important to me.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t really do</li>
            <li> I am sure glad that I finally discovered these as trying to pluck each and every tiny fine hair with tweezers was getting overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It works great if you need something to help you keep between the eyebrows clean and clear of extra hair.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> The first time I try, but I didn&#x27;t hurt myself!</li>
            <li> so when I saw them on Amazon I got pretty excited.</li>
            <li> Really recommend if you don&#x27;t want the hassle of plucking and aren&#x27;t a &#x27;wax&#x27; person!!</li>
            <li> But with practice, I quickly learned to be careful and was able to space out my salon eyebrow waxing by a few weeks, saving myself a great amount of $$!</li>
            <li> Nosema made something when they made these just plain easy to use..feels good in your hands..</li>
            <li> This works great to get rid of these little hairs that start popping out on your face and chin making you look like a cat fish if you don&#x27;t pluck or pull them.</li>
            <li> These little razors are great.</li>
            <li> These are great for getting little stray hairs where a razor is not ideal/practical.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little blade.</li>
            <li> Since I want a more natural look, I don&#x27;t wax my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Although the diferent colors ae fun they obvously don&#x27;t make a difference in their functioning.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Smile.</li>
            <li> Love these these are very convenient to do touches up on your face or bikini line always have to have a couple ready for me</li>
            <li> These are the only product of this kind worth using.</li>
            <li> Very handy little razors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and small and can for under your brow or in between much easier than mkt razors if it&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li> These are not that sharp, but they work good.  </li>
            <li> It is just the right size to do the job.</li>
            <li> boys\\&quot; if you are doing it right</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t test it on your face right away unless you want to.</li>
            <li> As long as you are careful when you deal with this rather sharper blade, it would give you excellent results.</li>
            <li> Great little tool!</li>
            <li> I keep a supply of these on hand all the time because they are a great little tool!  </li>
            <li> super good little razors for my eye brows.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use even my tweens feel comfortable trimming their eyebrows and facial hair!  </li>
            <li> Great for removing hair in small places.</li>
            <li> Its good for a person who cant handle the pain of tweezing them, but I think Ill stick to my tweezers because they are much more precise.</li>
            <li> A handy tool for you cosmetic bag as long as you kerp the lid on it.</li>
            <li> Love, love these little eyebrow razors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think shapers like this are 100% effective at getting rid of thicker hair (wax or tweezers are the way to go for that), and the hair does grow back quickly, but this is still a handy little tool for your beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> I love these handy little beauty tools!!</li>
            <li> Is great to shave off facial hair and or hairs on the body that need outside grooming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally pulled them out today to use before a series of business trips, and I can&#x27;t get over how easy and painless it was to clean up and sculpt my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> have a lot of dark facial hair, but my problem is that most of it is very fine and can&#x27;t be removed easily with tweezers.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small but VERY effective.</li>
            <li> Oh,and they are a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fast and painless.</li>
            <li> The size and shape makes for a much more precise shave than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I personally think it is good to be sharper because it would be worn out someday more quickly if it is less sharper than this.</li>
            <li> This is a good little product.</li>
            <li> A quick and easy way to touch up those eyebrows and the occasional chin hair...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty neat</li>
            <li> I got exactly the shape</li>
            <li> Always try to figure what exactly your shape is.</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought them is because I have not been able to find these at the dollar stores anymore and its quite the bummer.</li>
            <li> When I went to buy more later, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.</li>
            <li> On first use, I got a cut on my brow.  </li>
            <li> Meaning that sometimes the hair doesn&#x27;t come off the first time through.</li>
            <li> and Im still using the first blade shaper.</li>
            <li> rated these razors as 4 stars because they don&#x27;t have a safety like the others do, so they&#x27;re a bit easier to cut yourself if you&#x27;re in a hurry or don&#x27;t have a super steady hand.</li>
            <li> And these can definitely take off more hair than you want to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of plucking and this is so much easier than going to get my brows waxed or threaded!</li>
            <li> Last time I used razors they performed better than tweezers</li>
            <li> Thanks NOXEMA!</li>
            <li> I lost one the first day.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> They have wire guards so not to remove the whole ear, MEN!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t understand exactly how to use this.</li>
            <li> They do not sell this exact brand in any stores around here anymore</li>
            <li> Anyways, I really like these!</li>
            <li> I mostly use to help &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; my eyebrows (get rid of the scragglers above and then between my eyebrows).</li>
            <li> Came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Love these...will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this I felt the slightest sting on my skin once I was done</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> (just be sure you use the shaper at the proper angle).</li>
            <li> and I have been trying to find these exact ones in beauty stores and only been able to find the square off ones.</li>
            <li> My first time using these on my brows</li>
            <li> I purchased these a few years ago at a dollar store and loved them.</li>
            <li> I love how little the blade is, so mistakes are not as easy to make unlike waxing.  </li>
            <li> Be careful though because it is very easy to get cut while using them.</li>
            <li> Love that these get the blonde hairs along with the other stragglers and give a smooth, clean look to your brows.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, they were positive which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> I like the angled ones better but these work great and were less expensive than the angled ones I was able to find.</li>
            <li> The heads are very small which makes them easier to use; you can see what you&#x27;re doing better and have more control over where you are using the blade.</li>
            <li> These brow shapers are great if you are looking for a one-time thing for your brows or other facial hair.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than regular size so it can shaper my eyebrow more precisely</li>
            <li> ; on my first try I managed to hamfist the whole thing and gave myself a scrape on the side of my face.  </li>
            <li> Vertical is trickier as you have to be careful not to get too close to your eyes on the bottom or too close to the top of your brows when you&#x27;re shaving above them, but once you get the hang of things, it should all be pretty quick and clean.</li>
            <li> Its a good lil blade but to small.</li>
            <li> I like the small blade size which is great for getting around the brow area, but I have to say that the blade dulls quite easily.  </li>
            <li> I bought these because I get pesky little blonde hairs around my eyebrows, and they work beautifully.</li>
            <li> and then when it grows back it&#x27;s &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; so I can easily identify which hairs to pluck easier.</li>
            <li> These are the only brand that are easy to hold, control, and shave without scratching your skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and simple.</li>
            <li> but I certainly wont be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very fine eyebrows that are so blonde they are almost clear.</li>
            <li> Sharp and easy to use!</li>
            <li> the one that was fine only worked on one try.</li>
            <li> Nice little tool.</li>
            <li> Great deal as an &#x27;add on&#x27; - tough to find in stores</li>
            <li> These little razors are great for the eyebrows and sometimes I use them to trim up my hairline or above my lip.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Noxzema.</li>
            <li> These work very well although they don&#x27;t have instructions.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to order very often.  </li>
            <li> I wanted ie an arch with no cuts and no too much hair gone.</li>
            <li> Now, I am ready to use these razors in those days when I am not in a mood to shape my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> So much faster and</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> so you can really get in and shape eyebrows.</li>
            <li> so I could do my eyebrows because I much prefer to shave them</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and they really make a difference.</li>
            <li> Need to be gentle or you could cut yourself</li>
            <li> Now, not so much.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;ridges&amp;#34; on the blades I received also seem to be some sort of bent plastic and don&#x27;t really look like the photo at all.</li>
            <li> and they do not cut off too much.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Noxzema eyebrow shaper.</li>
            <li> It really gets the hair with no pain</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go all the time as much as I want to keep my eyebrows done, these helps me maintain the look.</li>
            <li> With these I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot over and over to remove the hair which leads to smooth skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li> It performed better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really make too much of an appearance for me to be upset about.</li>
            <li> These really don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> The Nieva is so much cheaper purchasing them through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Because the price was much lower, this time I bought them from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re are very efficient.</li>
            <li> There only seem to be cheap knockoffs and pricier electric versions, both of which either don&#x27;t work or slice their faces up because there are no blade guards like there are on the Noxzema ones.  </li>
            <li> that road before and found that I removed too much and it looked&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> If you are fast at tweezing and don&#x27;t mind I would still try this as a comparison.</li>
            <li> so the whole family can share them.</li>
            <li> Grooms eyebrows very well.</li>
            <li> It shaves really well and doesn&#x27;t cut you.</li>
            <li> For stray hairs anywhere or to groom your whole brow.</li>
            <li> It is basically a straight razor</li>
            <li> Thanks, J</li>
            <li> So much easier than plucking or waxing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Gives a nice exfoliation and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back coarse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just sharp enough to clean around the brows and the small size is perfect</li>
            <li> Very very useful for instant fixing of eyebrows</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small and I can fit them in my make-up bag for easy travel.</li>
            <li> When I first got them I like that they were not large and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> easy and lasts long</li>
            <li> Not only does it save time, but it cleans up in a smooth extra clean way.</li>
            <li> THese are the best little ryr brow shavers and are becoming difficult to even find.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product and do not like them and the main reason is that if you use them at a certain angle they cut like a knife .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out if I got a defective product or if these shapers are just like this, but the top edges of mine are sharp angles instead of rounded ones.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, safe, inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> the eyebrow shaper is sharp but safe to use.</li>
            <li> The past 2 years I haven&#x27;t been able to find these in the stores!  </li>
            <li> They are sharp for sure but isn&#x27;t that kinda the point?</li>
            <li> Only eyebrow razor worth using!  </li>
            <li> These babies are SHARP and do the job mostly painless.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited I&#x27;ll probably stock up big time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every other one I could think to buy and with these the hair comes right off and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Always clean them after you are done using and place the cap properly.</li>
            <li> clean, deep, cuts.  </li>
            <li> Precise and lasts really long.</li>
            <li> but they aren&#x27;t they are way smaller - it does come with this eyebrow curve which is cool</li>
            <li> Absolutely live them!</li>
            <li> i really like it , its new and its just what i want  </li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t careful, you can easily cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these as my main grooming tool for my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I had some issues with forgetting to not add the bill because this was a birthday present and upon contacting the seller they were quick to respond and not include the bill as requested.  </li>
            <li> Maybe there was a goof-up in my particular batch.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my battery powered trimmer (which I HIGHLY suggest over this.)</li>
            <li> I love these little razors.</li>
            <li> I love these little devices.  </li>
            <li> Love these for little touch ups~  </li>
            <li> They are sharp, so easy does it when shaping brows etc.</li>
            <li> They take the fine hairs right off with little effort, and the protectant on the razors actually does protect the skin pretty well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much painless to use these, they&#x27;re gentle on your skin and your hair grows back thinner and much slower.</li>
            <li> I found these at Wal Mart a few years ago and love them.</li>
            <li> that tweezers normally can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> These little guys are sharp, and effective!</li>
            <li> They work great to sculpt in tight little spaces around your brows.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this i love it unlike other ones this one is gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> Got these for my Wife but As a male I like to keep my eyebrows clean and these are simple and fast to use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small enough to be able to see where youre going and not accidentally chop off your eyebrow, though be careful because its pretty easy to do.</li>
            <li> With this I have a very clean look everyday</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> I am new to the US, and I was worried, how I am going to manage my bushy eyebrows.    </li>
            <li> And brand new.</li>
            <li> Love these little guys!</li>
            <li> , it is very easy to nick your delicate skin, as there is no razor guard on these teeny eyebrow shapers.</li>
            <li> I use for my eye brows as im very sensitive to waxing and do not like threading..</li>
            <li> I originally found this product at a local discount store and loved them, I went back to get more a few times until they didnt have them any more and have been using the same dull blades now ever since (at least a year--maybe 2)...</li>
            <li> Have been looking for eyebrow shaper for long finally found it,it so easy to use,but u have to be careful,so that it doesn&#x27;t cut it,other than that</li>
            <li> the blades are strong, portable, and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> This is my first eyebrow razor experience and I&#x27;m left with the &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love the small size of these.</li>
            <li> I have used Noxzema&#x27;s small bikini razors for years and love them, so I thought I would give these a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for 7 years and my local Family Dollar store stopped carrying this exact brand.</li>
            <li> no more plucking for me :)</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should, helps with upkeep of eyebrows without having to pluck hairs individually.</li>
            <li> easy to maneuver and do a little trimming at a time.</li>
            <li> Be super careful.</li>
            <li> The blades are very cheap and dull.  </li>
            <li> Simple, quick and painless for those necessary unexpected touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other razor-tipped eyebrow shapers in the past with good results, but found these to be a pain.</li>
            <li> These are great little razors except for the fact that they don&#x27;t stay sharp very long.</li>
            <li> I purchased many other brands, trying to find one that measured up to noxema but they all seemed dull the very first time I took them out of the pack and used them.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure to wet your skin and wet the razor.  </li>
            <li> I took too much hair from my left eyebrow and got blood off when I used that.</li>
            <li> Snagged my hairs and the sensitive skin on my face.</li>
            <li> go wild with it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; break out with creams,bleaches &amp; tweezing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, and took off a bit too much on one brow.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to even those of you who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And it wont get all the hair off completely.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t give a very close shave and left me with stubble around my eye brows.</li>
            <li> Hairs grow back in twice as fast.</li>
            <li> They are cheap, but it is still a waste of your money.</li>
            <li> If I had to find something negative about it would be that you need to do this more often than tweezing.</li>
            <li> So I converted and this is so much easier than trying to pluck when your short sighted like I am.</li>
            <li> I started using these after I was put on a medicine that caused my skin to be more delicate.</li>
            <li> Good thing they werent expensive.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those who hate to pluck.</li>
            <li> It is a cool way to get rid of those small eyebrow/upperlip hairs without pain.&lt;br /&gt;Although the removal doesn&#x27;t last long since it takes the upper layer only, its good when you need to get rid of those hair in short time.</li>
            <li> Small, precise, sharp and get the job done quickly and neat</li>
            <li> Very sharp, small in size, perfect for brows and small areas.</li>
            <li> Mainly because I think the product itself was too big.</li>
            <li> Great little product, use the big ones for on top of the eyebrow or other weird stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Gurl, Im a male who like to have his brows to be high definition.</li>
            <li> They are small enough to put into a purse and the handle on it is long enough for you to get a good grip</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands, but none are as sharp have the precision like these do!</li>
            <li> This makes them very hard to pluck both because you can&#x27;t see them and because they are so fine that tweezers can&#x27;t really grip them, so I generally stick to eyebrow razors.</li>
            <li> Handy little product to have, even I use them to trim my sideburns and other unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> They get dull faster, but I also don&#x27;t cut off my eyebrows so easily.</li>
            <li> They are much easier to maneuver than a standard razor and because of that they don&#x27;t leave your skin red and irritated where you use them.</li>
            <li> they are not sharp enuf and seem to almost &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They are okay, but not a smooth razor and don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Im not sure how long they last, as I have only used mine a handful of times but they do work nicely and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Most people mess up their eyebrows because they try to have arch when their natural shape is round.</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for these shavers in my local stores, however I can&#x27;t find them anywhere!</li>
            <li> However, I went to another dollar general a couple towns over and bought a stock pile.</li>
            <li> It does not drag or scrape over you skin.  </li>
            <li> They barely remove hair but cause my skin to flake in the process.</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s you get individual or stray hairs without shaving vital hairs you do not want to remove.</li>
            <li> and I accidentally make tiny cuts on my face, but that&#x27;s completely my fault.</li>
            <li> baby hairs that you can barely see or pull with a tweezer.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful that you do not put too much pressure as you can cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Once I bought these, because I was tired of getting cut, I was pleased.</li>
            <li> Worth the few bucks I paid.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp.</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting the right angle.  </li>
            <li> I did slightly cut my skin below my eyebrow when I first tried this out</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found these are much easier to hold and control than the off-brand ones at Family Dollar and other places.</li>
            <li> I call them my lil helpers, their sharp but gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for me other than giving me a rash.</li>
            <li> The blade is sharp and cuts away hair very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted the razors inside these products are always straight &amp; you need to be careful, it&#x27;s the curved casing that makes the difference- especially for eyebrow shaping!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but the last 2 packs I purchased of these left me marked for life.  </li>
            <li> If they were a little smaller and a little safer they would be a better product.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy for clipping stray hairs as well as little clusters.</li>
            <li> Has safety wires on the blade so you don&#x27;t cut your face but that also makes it a little harder to use and get a clean shape</li>
            <li> It had been discontinued at my local dollar general which is why I bought it</li>
            <li> My eyebrows grow back very fast, so sometimes I have to use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t leave the skin red like plucking does, and are sharp enough to really cut the hairs.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and they shape eyebrows very well.</li>
            <li> Anyways, these are small and get into the right places.  </li>
            <li> to all: do not apply pressure with this razor, your thought of removing, single hairs, clear hairs,&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Small and doesn&#x27;t dull super fast!</li>
            <li> I am very upset, considering that I paid for a pack of three, and only received a half open pack of one!</li>
            <li> Really like these little trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some off-brand eyebrow shapers and they were dull and never worked right.</li>
            <li> The small razor allowed me to carefully shape my eye brows and quickly without having to use a tweezer.</li>
            <li> It is sharp so you have to be careful not to cut yourself, but you really wouldn&#x27;t want it to be dull, right?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small size and light handle, but I think the blade became dull much faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> The stores where I live used to carry them, but for some odd reason not one store does anymore.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp enough to get the job done, but not sharp enough to cut your eyebrow off.</li>
            <li> The blade is so small that I never have a problem shaving too much or not enough.</li>
            <li> Other brands I could reuse the razors at least once without significant dulling.</li>
            <li> it also doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Long lasting sharpness.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin as some reviewers said it did, but it flat out</li>
            <li> Others are too long or are just teeny tiny razor shaped.</li>
            <li> But when I got them, I was disappointed to find that they were not as good as I remembered them.</li>
            <li> Sharp means they won&#x27;t dull so quickly.</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult for me to do the right one since I am right handed.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get dull fast, one of them will last about 2-3 months of use.</li>
            <li> If you keep them dry they will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Wash your face after, you&#x27;ll have dry skin and hair left on you afterwards.</li>
            <li> I normally use a small personal trimmer that is battery powered and it works well without any razor burn and gets the hair off.</li>
            <li> I thought these would work well for those hard to reach places since they&#x27;re small and look easy to maneuver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are much easier, less painful, and more reliable.  </li>
            <li> This razor is quite sharp and I can use it on both my eyebrows and above my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Only downfall is be prepared to either shave every other day or use your tweezers shortly after each time you use this product.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure I shouldn&#x27;t have to saw this because it sounds absolutely crazy</li>
            <li> I went out on a limb and spent the two extra dollars</li>
            <li> Been using eyebrow razors for a long time.</li>
            <li> three packs can be used in a long time period.</li>
            <li> In design they are both not too long and the end is sufficiently curved</li>
            <li> As long a amazon keeps selling</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of peach fuzz to get rid of, these would take too long to go over it all.</li>
            <li> Wal-mart stopped selling these a long time ago</li>
            <li> , there are no clear instructions.</li>
            <li> I purchased these back in Nov 28, 2014 but only just got down to writing a review.</li>
            <li> I typically use these style (but a different brand, Fromm) of razors for dermaplaning and 2 of the 3 in this package were so dull I could feel it dragging on my skin on the first stroke.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp or last as long as the Tinkle brand.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the smaller size and they are plenty sharp for me.</li>
            <li> I use these to shape up my eyebrows and get any little extra hairs on my upper lip or chin that may appear (cmon ladies, we all have it).  </li>
            <li> I tried other brands of razors but they were all too big or did not work as well as these do.</li>
            <li> I also like the blade coverings because they actually stay on, unlike other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Only one of the razors was usable because the other two had the wires on the blade all scrambled and messed up and</li>
            <li> It left little red bumps that look like pimples around my eyebrow..</li>
            <li> but they just aren&#x27;t sharp enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> This means that unlike other similar products they don&#x27;t pinch and yank the hair or scratch and irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They worked so well, that i accidently cut myself above my brow, so be careful!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other razor eyebrow shapers before, but they were too big &amp; didn&#x27;t have that curved</li>
            <li> These are sharp so caution needs to be used when trimming any facial hair.</li>
            <li> On top of getting a bootleg product, what I got had a blade so dull, it couldn&#x27;t cut through air.</li>
            <li> Works decently,  but not for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> They changed the shape and they don&#x27;t seem to trim the brow nearly as well as they had in the past.</li>
            <li> I normally do not get my eyebrows wax and shape them myself with these.</li>
            <li> The blade is awkward and thick and does all most nothing as far as unwanted hair goes.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this brand name products to be honest.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to press too hard, and try to keep a steady hand.  </li>
            <li> I actually ended up cutting my skin right above my brows where I was trimming.</li>
            <li> It is very harsh on the skin (pulls) and this surprised me.</li>
            <li> They are really sharp compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Stay sharp for a long time.  </li>
            <li> They stay sharp a really long time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never cut myself, and the blade stays sharp for a long time before dulling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Uses: Women, Eyebrows, the little hairs that sprout from your upper lip, jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Wish they were a little smaller though for precision on the arch of my brow.</li>
            <li> for the little white hairs under my brows.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little larger than I&#x27;d prefer.  </li>
            <li> I still tweeze regularly, but in a pinch when I have little time and need to touch up my brows, I use these and they do they job well.</li>
            <li> The ones I use to use where a little bigger and not angled</li>
            <li> Takes a little longer than a regular razor, sometimes repeated swipes</li>
            <li> They service the purpose but don&#x27;t stay sharp for very long.</li>
            <li> It dulled after one use and left me with little scratches and red patches from trying so hard to get rid of my facial hairs.</li>
            <li> Be careful because you can cut yourself easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These razors aren&#x27;t something to write home about, but maybe I need to try a few different brands to get a feel of what eyebrow razors are supposed to be like.</li>
            <li> so you still have to be careful despite the guards.</li>
            <li> This product is a total waste.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a few packages of these and they are lasting awhile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I&#x27;m not as careful as I should be</li>
            <li> as expected.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> so be careful not to lose them.</li>
            <li> The blades WILL cut you if you aren&#x27;t careful with it</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t careful it will take a bit to get used to the way this product works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in myself, thinking about how much money was unnecessarily spent.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say about these shapers.</li>
            <li> I used these when I spent a year in South Korea and could not find anywhere to get my eyebrows waxed in fact</li>
            <li> Just be careful.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to over do it though only go over the skin a few times otherwise</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, no sensitive for the skin.</li>
            <li> a few other friends found out the same thing.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, I ordered a razor which was way too sharp and was almost like a shaving razor but smaller in size.</li>
            <li> Saves minutes from me plucking every single eyebrow!!</li>
            <li> They do the trick, but they are sharp so be careful.</li>
            <li> These were very sharp and a little harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried other eyebrow shapers in the past and the blades on those were too large and dull for my liking.</li>
            <li> I just recommend starting off really slow because these tiny little blades are sharp as heck.</li>
            <li> and i prefer them over other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands but nothing compares to these.</li>
            <li> The blade is extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> it not as sharp as I would like it</li>
            <li> Quite sharp</li>
            <li> Cleaning up those brows is a breeze and, of course, you can use the product for other areas of the body as well.</li>
            <li> These are sharp and serve their purpose well.</li>
            <li> I also shave other parts of my face when needed.</li>
            <li> Other ones I have don&#x27;t seem to shave my eyebrows</li>
            <li> but not as sharp as the flamingo brand.</li>
            <li> They are quite sharp though as she nicked herself a bit.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fairly sharp, but they also cut my skin quite often.  </li>
            <li> But My GOD are they sharp.</li>
            <li> They dont keep sharp and give you razor burns..</li>
            <li> These are really sharp.</li>
            <li> They are always sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And especially what distinguishes them is that the guard strips over the blade have a slick plastic coating.</li>
            <li> And can be use for any other parts of your face</li>
            <li> I forgot how sharp they are though</li>
            <li> Very weird and cheap product, not what you want on your skin folks.</li>
            <li> I use them every other day to shave/shape my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> These work extremely well as seam rippers.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive, sharp and disposable.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d only use them for their intended purposes - eyebrows and other small areas.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get carried away, because these babies are sharp</li>
            <li> and they are sharp.</li>
            <li> Too sharp cut my self</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cut you, yet sharp &amp; precise!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but I felt it was not smooth enough for me and was a bit little for me</li>
            <li> Be Very VERY VERY careful with these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve nicked myself twice with these, even using them very carefully.</li>
            <li> Be careful very sharp.</li>
            <li> Hoping no fast growth I have thin eye brows naturally and never did anything but threading</li>
            <li> but honestly, you won&#x27;t need to press down hard with these \\&quot;bad</li>
            <li> But the razor is sharp enough that you don&#x27;t have to press hard against your skin (</li>
            <li> Eyebrow razors should be sharp yet not too sharp!</li>
            <li> Shapes not very clean.</li>
            <li> find that the head is large and obstructs my eyebrows and makes it difficult to see where I am shaving.</li>
            <li> One note: they are sharp and can cut easily if not used carefully.</li>
            <li> not worth it-</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really work, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m covered in a thick layer of foundation to hide the welt-like cuts it left.  </li>
            <li> These are the most worthless piece of junk ever.  </li>
            <li> and I hate paying someone to wax and pluck them even more.</li>
            <li> I even tried SANDING the tip of one down</li>
            <li> &quot; the razor down</li>
            <li> Once you get it down</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all actually sharp and usable!</li>
            <li> (usually...I have nicked myself once or twice because these razors are so sharp!) .</li>
            <li> I have started shaping my &amp;#34;tween&amp;#34; daughter&#x27;s eyebrows this year with other brands of little shapers...</li>
            <li> Like it but a little way too sharp.</li>
            <li> I already have 2 cuts on my eyebrows something that never happened with the other brand I was using which I could never find anymore!</li>
            <li> A little too sharp and sometimes cut me</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand!</li>
            <li> keep an eye on them and throw them away when they start to get dull or the little white strips on the side start to peel away, because it can cut your face and snag on the hairs.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp.</li>
            <li> These are VERY sharp.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and make my life easier, but I think I will stick with the crappy Walmart ones I have been buying for years.</li>
            <li> Quite sharp and one blade lasts for a few weeks before needing to switch.</li>
            <li> Blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> VERY sharp, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews on here about these cutting skin and they only break your skin if you apply to much pressure, just like any other razor would.  </li>
            <li> When removing slight hairs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do about 95% less tweezing with this and might never have to get wax again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different angles, thinking I was doing it wrong, with the same results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for years and at first I was afraid I might shave off my eyebrow</li>
            <li> you would personalty prefer something less sharp where you can press down hard and still have no results then use another brand.</li>
            <li> The angle of the blade is awkward and seems to get dull quickly.</li>
            <li> One swipe with my little eyebrow shaper and it is gone.</li>
            <li> This little razor is a dynamo.</li>
            <li> They work well though a little too razor like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used small razors from other brands as well as other small sized razors from Noxzema.  </li>
            <li> I did a little tweezing before pulling one of these out, but I dont&#x27; think I&#x27;ll need to every again.    </li>
            <li> Just remember to swab eyebrows with a little alcohol before you get started to prevent infection in case you get a cut.</li>
            <li> Brand does make a difference with these little razors.</li>
            <li> I had never seen or heard of these before, so I was honestly a little reluctant to try them.</li>
            <li> gave me very hard hair like men facial hair .</li>
            <li> The plastic guard was very hard to remove (I actually sliced my finger!)</li>
            <li> They are sharp though so dont press down too hard.</li>
            <li> You are NOT gonna have arch when you have round eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Trouble product ,do not buy wasted of money</li>
            <li> I wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> I have a few of these on standby.</li>
            <li> My poor daughter has her Italian fathers bushy eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and over for a few weeks without a problem.  </li>
            <li> One tiny false move, and you could have an eyebrow crisis on your hands.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> you can do your eyebrows painlessly in less than one minute and don&#x27;t experience the redness that tweezers bring if you don&#x27;t press down hard.</li>
            <li> Less risk of shaving off what you want to keep!</li>
            <li> Not too sharp, not too dull.</li>
            <li> not handy.. not easy to use... must be very careful...</li>
            <li> Not easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long eyebrows.</li>
            <li> (And no, I don&#x27;t press down hard with these.)</li>
            <li> There will be a slight redness if you press too hard like I did.</li>
            <li> Before, I had used little scissors for eliminating her unibrow but these work like a charm!</li>
            <li> :S That&#x27;s not good and other brands I&#x27;ve used have not caused that.</li>
            <li> These shapers are very small and the blades are very sharp and no matter what angle you use to shape your brow, you end up with nicking the skin.</li>
            <li> The blades are extremely dull and uneven.  </li>
            <li> Some of the bad review on here mention getting a blank package with dull razors, that is a problem to take up with the seller since they didn&#x27;t receive the actual item they are reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the small size which makes it easier to use.  </li>
            <li> Quite small</li>
            <li> Small and compact</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small tip</li>
            <li> No more paying waxing.</li>
            <li> I like that they are small</li>
            <li> I usually just use tweezers, but I prefer using these now.</li>
            <li> it can be difficult to get under the eyebrow above the eye, but, with some maneuvering it can be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are small</li>
            <li> Like I said these are small, and it&#x27;s 1 (3) pack.</li>
            <li> I will just have to get the ones I usually get and throw these away.</li>
            <li> I used to use those ordinary shapers from the 99 cent store.</li>
            <li> This product was bought for a friend of mine, but I have used these in the past.  </li>
            <li> It is small, lightweight and has protective covers for when not in use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, unless you have the hands of a surgeon, I think it would be crazy to put these anywhere near your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Not excellent but work well enough for the price.</li>
            <li> NO more need for time-consuming tweezing.  </li>
            <li> For the past 2 or so years, I&#x27;ve been buying eyebrow shapers from Sephora, which are $15 for a pack of two...  </li>
            <li> Very few stores period.</li>
            <li> The blade is too short, so it is difficult to use, it feels like a dull blade.</li>
            <li> ( in Parlour, I use to look my both eye brows and feels some where minor wrong is there).</li>
            <li> Keep away from small children and clumsy husbands...</li>
            <li> The tips of these razors are SO ridiculous sharp that if you twist it slightly the wrong way you will undoubtedly leave a blood trail.  </li>
            <li> I still nicked myself a tad when I pressed too hard</li>
            <li> This eyebrow shaper was a tad bit hard to use.</li>
            <li> and if the blade isn&#x27;t dull.</li>
            <li> Razors were dull..</li>
            <li> Watch how hard you \\&quot;drag\\</li>
            <li> Also can be used for a couple times at least before tossing.</li>
            <li> I like that the heads are smaller than the Twinkle brand ones, so it makes it easier to get close without being as afraid of mistakes.</li>
            <li> Try it somewhere else like on your leg or arm hair that way if you accidentally cut yourself at least it won&#x27;t be on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a clumsy though</li>
            <li> (and I don&#x27;t think I have particularly thick hair).</li>
            <li> I mean it does what it says</li>
            <li> no more plucking or waxing!</li>
            <li> Small, with a sturdy cap for on the go and safer cut!</li>
            <li> These work just as well, if not better!  </li>
            <li> Expect a very small shaper.</li>
            <li> have tried several others after I stopped seeing these in my local stores and all were miserable.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really serious.</li>
            <li> These were not good quality.</li>
            <li> Not a good way to shape brows or do anything else.  </li>
            <li> the tip is not good for generate curved lines.</li>
            <li> They are sharp without cutting your skin or hurting.</li>
            <li> I thought she was being a little over dramatic until I tried them!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands which are bad about being dull edged and leaving scrape marks on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t be dumb like I was and try to shave off some chin hair, you will cut yourself.</li>
            <li> This product is DUMB.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at tweezing my eyebrows and even worse at threading.</li>
            <li> Also their very hard to find, Im</li>
            <li> Very dull blades.  </li>
            <li> The blade doesn&#x27;t feel like a blade as it is very dull and has ridges.</li>
            <li> The blade was very dull, &amp;#34;skipped&amp;#34; on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very hard to trim the browse</li>
            <li> when I brush it against my brows, it cuts the hair in a very uneven random way, if at all.</li>
            <li> head too wide, too long, scrapes terribly.</li>
            <li> I have very thick eyebrows</li>
            <li> In search of a eyebrow shaper because I was tired of spending 15 to 20 dollars to be in excruciating pain while getting them waxed...</li>
            <li> It tears skin and leaves hair behind.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> I was sooooo tired of plucking.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll be irritating and might scrape.</li>
            <li> These are a game changer.</li>
            <li> No more trace hairs and no worries of cutting her.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like leaving negative reviews but these razors were truly disappointing.</li>
            <li> So... not ideal</li>
            <li> Or worse yet, an eyelash crisis, if you move your hand the wrong way.  </li>
            <li> No more painful plucking.</li>
            <li> I have used others but they either cut you or are shaped so that they are difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Just be careful---applied at the wrong angle</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m unfortunately having to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels expensive with the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Seems silly to get them shipped.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut hair and when it did it was random and not close.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Careful if you dont know what you are doing as one wrong move and you might be wearing your angry eyebrows for a minute.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re a bit expensive for the amount of usage per razor.</li>
            <li> , I had a horrible experience with an eyebrow shaper of a different brand ended up cutting my eyelid..</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> If they get dirty, I just use a nail brush on them.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting my eyeball area or getting tangled with my lashes.</li>
            <li> the women thought it was crazy to pluck or wax.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was just one bad blade</li>
            <li> She would always complain how bad it hurts and never wanted to keep them shaped because of it.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be bad at this too</li>
            <li> It is so painful to me.  </li>
            <li> These seem like dangerous and worthless shapers.</li>
            <li> Now my eyebrows are ugly.</li>
            <li> Also gave me shave bumps on my face :(</li>
            <li> ,  Walmart stopped carrying :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used it for cleaning up brows :(</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate using the plucker.    </li>
            <li> and I hate threading and waxing.</li>
            <li> I hate plucking my eyebrows</li>
            <li> awful product :(  </li>
            <li> Thought this would be the solution but disappointed!</li>
            <li> Did not work, terrible at removing hair and irritated my skin</li>
            <li> worst idea ever.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> I bought these to maintain the shape of my brows and they are horrible to use!</li>
            <li> Leaves awful scrape marks everywhere you use it.  </li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!!  </li>
            <li> I hate plucking my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> These are the worst blades ever!</li>
            <li> These things are dreadful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Easy to use.  Don&#x27;t take up much space.  Will reorder</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all actually sharp and usable! Excellent</li>
            <li> Love these shapers. Great price fast shipping.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great. A bit smaller (the blade part) than what I was expecting and what I was used to but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I order the eyebrow  shaper and I got premium pivot twin blades shavers instead .  Wth!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just perfect for the face and i prefer them over other brands. Great quality shapers 5***** all the way.</li>
            <li> These little guys are sharp, and effective! The razor section is nice and compact, so it is very easy to use with out worrying about lopping off an eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Works great for what I need. I prefer the smaller size and they are plenty sharp for me. Also can be used for a couple times at least before tossing. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> These are great little tools for clean up shaping. I like that the heads are smaller than the Twinkle brand ones, so it makes it easier to get close without being as afraid of mistakes. I&#x27;m glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> These are great!  I bought then in December 09, and have not had to pay to have my eyebrows shaped since!  They work well,and the great thing about them is unlike with waxing, there is no pain or swelling.  I have been recommending them to my friends.</li>
            <li> Its a good lil blade but to small. Once your done you just hade no Idea that you had cut yourself a few other friends found out the same thing.</li>
            <li> I love these! I use these if I&#x27;m in a pinch and don&#x27;t want to tweeze and make my skin red. Also perfect for those super fine hairs that won&#x27;t come out with tweezing or waxing. The blade is so small that I never have a problem shaving too much or not enough. These are perfect!</li>
            <li> These work once you learn how to use it. Be careful because you can cut yourself easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the head is large and obstructs my eyebrows and makes it difficult to see where I am shaving.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of waxing at all.  It is so painful to me.  I saw a makeup guru on youtube use this to do her eyebrows so I thought I would buy some.  When I first got them I like that they were not large and easy to handle.  You have to make sure to wet your skin and wet the razor.  Don&#x27;t rush when you use it.  It was pretty easy to clean my eyebrows up.  It was a little difficult for me to do the right one since I am right handed.  I had trouble getting the right angle.  I will continue to use these because they work very well and are very cost effective.</li>
            <li> I bought these to grab those fair hairs that are under the eyebrows that are kind of hard to see and tweeze. For my first experience trying something for the fair hairs, I feel like it works pretty good. There may be something better out there, but these are good for now.</li>
            <li> Never used anything like this before but it&#x27;s pretty neat</li>
            <li> I use these to shape up my eyebrows and get any little extra hairs on my upper lip or chin that may appear (cmon ladies, we all have it).  they are the perfect size and they really do their job without any pain.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these at Wal-Mart and I noticed they stopped selling them and couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere! I tried other brands of razors but they were all too big or did not work as well as these do. I did a search online and found these! I hope Noxzema never stops making them because they are the perfect size and shape for eyebrows! Definetly the best eyebrow razor I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I found these at Wal Mart a few years ago and love them. Walmart has since quit carrying them in their stores and I am glad that I found them here. I have used others but they either cut you or are shaped so that they are difficult to use. These are the best by far to shape eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very fine eyebrows that are so blonde they are almost clear. This makes them very hard to pluck both because you can&#x27;t see them and because they are so fine that tweezers can&#x27;t really grip them, so I generally stick to eyebrow razors. These are great because they take care of stray hairs with no pulling or irritation of the skin. The heads are very small which makes them easier to use; you can see what you&#x27;re doing better and have more control over where you are using the blade. I also like the blade coverings because they actually stay on, unlike other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great deal as an &#x27;add on&#x27; - tough to find in stores so this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It does not drag or scrape over you skin.  I have tried other brands which are bad about being dull edged and leaving scrape marks on your skin.  I can no longer wax areas on my face without it leaving areas looking burned. This works great, you can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> It does the job. I could use a bit longer razor, as it is a pretty small head. It&#x27;s also a lot sharper than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Love that these get the blonde hairs along with the other stragglers and give a smooth, clean look to your brows.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000GCLRF4 Noxzema Eyebrow Shaper - 3 Packs]]  I found this product also by chance at Walmart but can no longer find it anywhere, so I am glad I can order it here. I will order also for my daughters and granddaughter for stocking stuffers. I love these little razors. At my age I discovered that occasionally I sprout some nose hair YUCK! One swipe with my little eyebrow shaper and it is gone. No more painful plucking. I also use one to rid my husband of hair in his ears. They are WONDERFUL and serve many purposes. Thanks to Noxzema.</li>
            <li> It was ok. Does the job, the blade came off after 2nd use.</li>
            <li> I love them have been using them for years</li>
            <li> These work very well although they don&#x27;t have instructions. Be careful though because it is very easy to get cut while using them.</li>
            <li> Since I want a more natural look, I don&#x27;t wax my eyebrows. I find the brow razor the perfect solution. It is just the right size to do the job. I love it. When I could no longer find them in my local drug store I was at a loss of what to do.  So I was delighted to find them on line.  I also am glad they come in a packet of three so I don&#x27;t have to order very often.  Although the diferent colors ae fun they obvously don&#x27;t make a difference in their functioning. Oh,and they are a very reasonable price. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Eyebrow razors should be sharp yet not too sharp! They should be able to take off hair but not make you bleed. A few weeks ago, I ordered a razor which was way too sharp and was almost like a shaving razor but smaller in size. I took too much hair from my left eyebrow and got blood off when I used that. I was so hurt. I used castor oil to grew my eyebrows back. Those were surely  weeks of embarrassment when I had no shape and too much hair. I got Noxema and they worked magic. I got exactly the shape I wanted ie an arch with no cuts and no too much hair gone. I am so happy. So so happy! :D They are the perfect thing for my beauty box! Now, I am ready to use these razors in those days when I am not in a mood to shape my eyebrows. They are so perfect.  Advice: Many people here are complaining how to use it since the pack doesn&#x27;t have any directions. REMEMBER! Always try to figure what exactly your shape is. Most people mess up their eyebrows because they try to have arch when their natural shape is round. You are NOT gonna have arch when you have round eyebrow. Just take the razor and take off your extras and shape your eyebrows. Always clean them after you are done using and place the cap properly. You will give them longer life :)</li>
            <li> These things are handy! I use them all over my face, but especially to keep my brows in check! LOVE!</li>
            <li> I am new to the US, and I was worried, how I am going to manage my bushy eyebrows.    I hate using the plucker.    But this product, serves the purpose and was definitely worth the purchase :)</li>
            <li> These things are amazing and they save so much time. I&#x27;ve tried other brands but nothing compares to these.</li>
            <li> These shapers are very small and the blades are very sharp and no matter what angle you use to shape your brow, you end up with nicking the skin. I like the larger blades, they are easier to use and I never get nicks. I have to wear my glasses and a magnifying mirror in order to do anything to my eyes, the larger shapers are easier to control.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d buy these again. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I liked the price and they work in a pinch for clients. HOWEVER they nicked the heck out of my brows. :S That&#x27;s not good and other brands I&#x27;ve used have not caused that. So... not ideal</li>
            <li> Did not work, terrible at removing hair and irritated my skin</li>
            <li> These are awesome! I use these instead of plucking my eyebrows and they work great! So much faster and the best part is it&#x27;s pain free! I&#x27;ve been using them for years and at first I was afraid I might shave off my eyebrow it&#x27;s never happened and I doubt it ever will. They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love these. They work well. Just don&#x27;t be dumb like I was and try to shave off some chin hair, you will cut yourself. They aren&#x27;t made for curvy surfaces.</li>
            <li> This is my first eyebrow razor experience and I&#x27;m left with the &amp;#34;...meh...&amp;#34; feeling. These razors aren&#x27;t something to write home about, but maybe I need to try a few different brands to get a feel of what eyebrow razors are supposed to be like. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing again until I try out some others.</li>
            <li> i really like it , its new and its just what i want  the price is fair  . i like it thanks</li>
            <li> I mean it does what it says, I like it because I pluck additionally with this shaper, so I shave a chunk off and then when it grows back it&#x27;s &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; so I can easily identify which hairs to pluck easier. Now I don&#x27;t have to spend 10 minutes picking out a million hairs when I can quickly shave it off if I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li> Great price, great purchase.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing invention, LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Trouble product ,do not buy wasted of money</li>
            <li> These are super awesome and the price is great!</li>
            <li> Works great. Sharp n great. Deff purchase!</li>
            <li> These Noxzema Eyebrow Shapers work in a pinch when you don&#x27;t have time to go in for a brow wax. My oldest daughters have even complimented on how nice they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;~ SkyLee :)</li>
            <li> Snagged my hairs and the sensitive skin on my face. Tinkle are much better.</li>
            <li> I love these for shaping my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This product is life-changing! I use it on my eyebrows, upper lip, stomach, and arms. It&#x27;s perfect on those spots that are too sensitive for waxing or shaving. However, I will warn that although it claims it won&#x27;t cut you, it might if you don&#x27;t use it right! It is still a blade and if used in a sawing motion, it might cut you! But this is an amazing product for such a great price!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to do my ebrows at home, and this product is a good product for a low cost.  I love how little the blade is, so mistakes are not as easy to make unlike waxing.  This is a good little product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Nice size product.  Head isn&#x27;t so big so you can really get in and shape eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Easy to use</li>
            <li> not worth it- they are not sharp enuf and seem to almost &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Package was flimsy so they all fell out in the box but none were damaged. Work nicely for keeping the hair along my neck nice and even after a haircut.</li>
            <li> Love this product. .i keep buying them. I use for my eye brows as im very sensitive to waxing and do not like threading..</li>
            <li> Was open when it arrived but the product is great.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t do much brow shaving with this shaper - I understand the protect were supposed to be protective, but they are really kind of getting in the way... I ended up just getting another regular shaper eventually</li>
            <li> Very handy little razors. They work great to sculpt in tight little spaces around your brows. They have plastic guards spaced along the edge of the razor to help prevent cuts. I still nicked myself a tad when I pressed too hard so you still have to be careful despite the guards. These are excellent tools for getting the little hairs around the brows.</li>
            <li> This little razor is a dynamo. It it precise and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t go wild with it. The blade is extremely sharp. It has a guard on it, but still.&lt;br /&gt;Do not underestimate it. The head of the blade is just over 2 centimeters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses: Women, Eyebrows, the little hairs that sprout from your upper lip, jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;Note to all: do not apply pressure with this razor, your thought of removing, single hairs, clear hairs,&lt;br /&gt;If you apply pressure you will remove skin. It is very sharp. When removing slight hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For both Men and Women. Is great to shave off facial hair and or hairs on the body that need outside grooming.&lt;br /&gt;The course curly hairs that sprout .. a quick use of this will nip them off. Leaving the existing hair.&lt;br /&gt;Using it lightly.  It is a awesome grooming tool.</li>
            <li> I purchased these back in Nov 28, 2014 but only just got down to writing a review. These were not good quality. The only reason I bought them is because I have not been able to find these at the dollar stores anymore and its quite the bummer. I went out on a limb and spent the two extra dollars so I could do my eyebrows because I much prefer to shave them but I regret making the purchase. Only one of the razors was usable because the other two had the wires on the blade all scrambled and messed up and the one that was fine only worked on one try. I don&#x27;t like leaving negative reviews but these razors were truly disappointing.</li>
            <li> Noxzema Eyebrow Shaper. The blade is too short, so it is difficult to use, it feels like a dull blade.</li>
            <li> I purchased these a few years ago at a dollar store and loved them. When I went to buy more later, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere. I purchased many other brands, trying to find one that measured up to noxema but they all seemed dull the very first time I took them out of the pack and used them. I was elated to find these eyebrow shapers online. But when I got them, I was disappointed to find that they were not as good as I remembered them. However, they are a huge improvement over the others I have used.</li>
            <li> Perfect for eyebrows and other places, i use it to trim side burns and etc too!</li>
            <li> Fits better in my brow area that the ones I buy in the store.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!It is excellent to remove any facial hair.I have sensitive skin &amp; break out with creams,bleaches &amp; tweezing.I can honestly say my skin has not been this clear in many,many years.</li>
            <li> Never again.  On first use, I got a cut on my brow.  Better off using a twin-blade razor or just tweezing.</li>
            <li> They service the purpose but don&#x27;t stay sharp for very long. I can&#x27;t complain about that, with the price. Thanks</li>
            <li> I originally found this product at a local discount store and loved them, I went back to get more a few times until they didnt have them any more and have been using the same dull blades now ever since (at least a year--maybe 2)...so yeah, I&#x27;m happy to have found these and ordered two packages of them. They&#x27;re small enough to be able to see where youre going and not accidentally chop off your eyebrow, though be careful because its pretty easy to do. I tweeze my eyebrows but use these to get the extras, around the brows and in between them and they really make a difference. Ive also used them to trim some stray nose hairs (ew!)</li>
            <li> I love these for quick and easy brow cleanup!</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to do, so that makes me  super happy. That is all that needs to be said</li>
            <li> Love these!  I like the small size which makes it easier to use.  Ordering 5 packs because I don&#x27;t ever want to be without them.</li>
            <li> Very Fast Shipping, Great seller!!!! The Noxzema Eyebrow Razors are the best eyebrow razor ever, I&#x27;ve tried them all and all the other ones cut you, Noxzema are amazing. Also their very hard to find, Im so happy i found where to get them at a great price!!! Thank you so Much!!!!</li>
            <li> Will not order again.  The blades are extremely dull and uneven.  They scratched the skin on my face. I thought maybe it was just one bad blade so I tossed it and tried another one from the package and it did the same thing.  I will not purchase these again and would not recommend anyone else to do so.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, no need to explain</li>
            <li> Great to use for touch ups between wax appointments. Just be careful---applied at the wrong angle and you&#x27;ll see blood. It is a razor, after all.</li>
            <li> Love it! quick and easy. Need to be gentle or you could cut yourself</li>
            <li> Use it the day I received it,is very easy and my brows looks like I had them waxed, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This works great to get rid of these little hairs that start popping out on your face and chin making you look like a cat fish if you don&#x27;t pluck or pull them.</li>
            <li> I love these little devices.  I prefer to shave my eyebrows than to pluck or wax.  When styles change, I should have more of my original brows than those who pluck everything off.  These are easy to work with in small areas and are a great bargain.</li>
            <li> As there are no instructions with this package, it&#x27;s a bit tricky to figure out how to use it.  I&#x27;ve only used it once, and took off a bit too much on one brow.  It probably works, but it would help to have some written instructions.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, small in size, perfect for brows and small areas. I used to buy Twinkle brand at a local beauty store. These ones are sharper than the Twinkle ones and seem to last longer, though they are smaller.</li>
            <li> great product easy to use i love the size of these. I use these for my eyebrows I&#x27;m not a pro by any means but I had no issues using these</li>
            <li> Love these for little touch ups~  Gotta have &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> it not as sharp as I would like it</li>
            <li> Do their job. Quite small but you can easily handle and maneuver. Quite sharp but I&#x27;ve never cut myself. Easily fits in your makeup bag for travel and multipurpose usage.</li>
            <li> These little razors are great. I just love them! Always have. For some reason, they&#x27;re not as easily available in most box chains &amp; brick &amp; mortars. Very few stores period. I used to be able to find them in &amp;#34;Family Dollar&amp;#34;. Now, not so much. This is the perfect size for arching &amp; sculpting eyebrows. now, the longer version of this product is readily available just about everywhere. Including beauty supply stores. I totally prefer this size for my personal needs.</li>
            <li> These are great for getting little stray hairs where a razor is not ideal/practical.  Cleaning up those brows is a breeze and, of course, you can use the product for other areas of the body as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out if I got a defective product or if these shapers are just like this, but the top edges of mine are sharp angles instead of rounded ones.  That means that it&#x27;s very easy to cut yourself.  I&#x27;m covered in a thick layer of foundation to hide the welt-like cuts it left.  I didn&#x27;t know I had cut myself until five minutes later, when they all started swelling and bleeding.  The &amp;#34;ridges&amp;#34; on the blades I received also seem to be some sort of bent plastic and don&#x27;t really look like the photo at all.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow shaper was a tad bit hard to use. Meaning that sometimes the hair doesn&#x27;t come off the first time through. But other than that, great for the price!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE.  I CAN GROOM MY EYEBROWS QUICKLY IN THE MORNING.</li>
            <li> Good price.  The ridges on the blades are a nice safety feature.</li>
            <li> Great razors at a very fair price.</li>
            <li> So glad I discovered these. Amazing. Wish they were a little smaller though for precision on the arch of my brow.</li>
            <li> These shapers really do a great job.  Very sharp and easy for clipping stray hairs as well as little clusters.</li>
            <li> I am sure glad that I finally discovered these as trying to pluck each and every tiny fine hair with tweezers was getting overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Fast shipping and great packaging. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks now and Im still using the first blade shaper. Gurl, Im a male who like to have his brows to be high definition. This is a must product, no more plucking or waxing! YAY! So easy to use and flexible to shave off brow hair.</li>
            <li> Great for removing hair in small places. Makes shaping eyebrows a snap!</li>
            <li> I am so glad i found these eyebrow shapers!  I have been using wax strips (which i found on Amazon too!) for the little white hairs under my brows.  These are much easier, less painful, and more reliable.  Don&#x27;t worry about hurting yourself - just take your time and they work wonderful.</li>
            <li> I can be controlled and safe as I shape my  brows.</li>
            <li> This product is a total waste.  Not a good way to shape brows or do anything else.  Mine are in the trash!</li>
            <li> Nice little tool. It shapes well and &amp;#34;defuzzes&amp;#34; the skin around my brows for a super smooth appearance, just like waxing. I do about 95% less tweezing with this and might never have to get wax again.</li>
            <li> Good product. Arrived on time!</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, they were positive which is why I bought it. Its perfect for shaping eyebrows and even trimming the upper lip area.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these for years but they stopped selling them in Walmart so I found them here. They are great if you do your own eyebrows. Small and compact and they do not cut off too much. I would recommend</li>
            <li> these work so that you do not cut your eyelashes off while trimming your eyebrows. Great little product, use the big ones for on top of the eyebrow or other weird stray hairs.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really work, unfortunately. I wasted money on this. They&#x27;re very cute, though. They just don&#x27;t shave at all!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Noxzema eyebrow shaper. Let me tell about my eyebrows. I have very thick and long eyebrows. But, I didn&#x27;t have any experience of threading or waxing the eyebrows. So, every month twice i am going to eye brows threading and its like almost 15$ every month. So, I thought to give a try of this item. Oh my god, its really fantastic. I myself shaped my eyebrows very perfectly. First time I satisfied after looking my eyebrows shape, into mirror. ( in Parlour, I use to look my both eye brows and feels some where minor wrong is there). Here I did perfect eye brow shape.&lt;br /&gt;Hurrayyyyyyyyyyyy...</li>
            <li> These brow shapers are great if you are looking for a one-time thing for your brows or other facial hair. I use it on my cheeks and upper lip and the hair is just gone!</li>
            <li> Got these for my Wife but As a male I like to keep my eyebrows clean and these are simple and fast to use.</li>
            <li> I love these! I can&#x27;t seem to find them in any stores around here (Not even Walmart has them anymore) and for the price? Can&#x27;t beat it. I keep them on my wishlist so I can add them to my cart whenever they start getting dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found these are much easier to hold and control than the off-brand ones at Family Dollar and other places. They last quite a while, too. I do my eyebrows about twice a week and one shaper will last about a month. My boyfriend has since discovered these, and uses them too, so they would probably last even longer than that but I&#x27;m unfortunately having to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep an eye on them and throw them away when they start to get dull or the little white strips on the side start to peel away, because it can cut your face and snag on the hairs.</li>
            <li> These are great for touch ups!</li>
            <li> Love em!! Work perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product to shape your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Great!!!!! I bought it again!</li>
            <li> Love the small size of these. They do a great job shaping the eyebrows. The size is great to get all angles of each brow.</li>
            <li> Stay sharp for a long time.  Great to keep eyebrows looking waxed.</li>
            <li> These are such a great alternative to tweezers. I bought these after reading they were useful to shape brows and am so happy with my purchase. I shared with my mom and bought two more packages for myself. One note: they are sharp and can cut easily if not used carefully. I&#x27;ve cut myself twice.</li>
            <li> The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is ... the tip is not good for generate curved lines. Straight portion is easy and handy.</li>
            <li> These eyebrow shapers are just like others I&#x27;ve purchased in stores. I&#x27;ve actually only been able to find them at Walmart but was glad to find them here when they ran out. These are sharp and serve their purpose well. Uploading a photo so you can get a better look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a lot of reviews and trying others, I&#x27;ve since switched to these, [[ASIN:B001EJIMRO Noxzema Bikini Plus Shave and Trim Disposable Shavers, 3 Count]]  I prefer them for the shae butter and the ability to use them both as a trimmer or as a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated these razors as 4 stars because they don&#x27;t have a safety like the others do, so they&#x27;re a bit easier to cut yourself if you&#x27;re in a hurry or don&#x27;t have a super steady hand. For the price I feel they are both a good value and worth trying to find your personal preference. Smile. Hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> Works decently,  but not for thick hair.  Also gave me shave bumps on my face :(</li>
            <li> I have used Noxzema&#x27;s small bikini razors for years and love them, so I thought I would give these a try. What a disappointment. They barely remove hair but cause my skin to flake in the process. The angle of the blade is awkward and seems to get dull quickly. I will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> Does what you would expect. I use mine on unwanted chin hair. It feels expensive with the shipping cost. I buy a couple sets at a time. I wish I could buy them at the local Target. Seems silly to get them shipped.</li>
            <li> This gets the areas that need it most. I would recommend this to even those of you who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A quick and easy way to touch up those eyebrows and the occasional chin hair...</li>
            <li> They changed the shape and they don&#x27;t seem to trim the brow nearly as well as they had in the past.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Better than any others out there!  Can&#x27;t find anywhere but here now,  Walmart stopped carrying :(</li>
            <li> These are VERY sharp. A double edged sword here, pun intended. They do the job but the top of the razor isn&#x27;t protected by the plastic sheath which makes it VERY easy to cut off parts of your eyebrow that you don&#x27;t want to cut. There just isn&#x27;t very good control with this design. They are very sharp and make my life easier, but I think I will stick with the crappy Walmart ones I have been buying for years. They get dull faster, but I also don&#x27;t cut off my eyebrows so easily.</li>
            <li> These are very good, I&#x27;m still on my first one after a couple months of use.  Wish I&#x27;d known sooner they make these. :)</li>
            <li> These razors are great for sculpting the eyebrow. It&#x27;s small tip let&#x27;s you get individual or stray hairs without shaving vital hairs you do not want to remove. Great for also sculpting goatee&#x27;s and lining up facial hair.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use and work so well! I have missed out on this simple way to keep my eyebrows shaped! Great little tool!</li>
            <li> For the price work well</li>
            <li> Leave the area feeling super smooth. I&#x27;ve used these for years! Really great for when I&#x27;m being super lazy and don&#x27;t feel like plucking before shaping, also SUPER great for those upper lip hairs, even those that you can&#x27;t see in the mirror.</li>
            <li> These were very sharp and a little harsh on my sensitive skin. Might be better for someone with normal skin.</li>
            <li> It left little red bumps that look like pimples around my eyebrow.. And it wont get all the hair off completely. Its good for a person who cant handle the pain of tweezing them, but I think Ill stick to my tweezers because they are much more precise. And these can definitely take off more hair than you want to.</li>
            <li> This got me a cut on my forehead, do not buy! They are very sharp, no sensitive for the skin.</li>
            <li> Sharp, safe, inexpensive.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> It works great for my eyebrow. No more paying waxing. It also works for upper lip</li>
            <li> These are awesome for cleaning up brows. I also shave other parts of my face when needed. Even above me lip. I can even get my boyfriend to let me clean up his eyebrows. I still pluck but these are so handy</li>
            <li> I didnt like it at all this thing gave me very hard hair like men facial hair .</li>
            <li> Love these.  It&#x27;s been a year and I just broke out the last one.  I use them for facial fuzz and eyebrow trimming.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Been using eyebrow razors for a long time. These work well and are easy to use. I&#x27;ve not had any problems with nicking myself when using them. I like that they are small so it is easy to shape your brow.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this since the appearance of my eyebrows and eye area is so important to me.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t really do as well as I thought and they don&#x27;t remove a lot of hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;I was light with this and it made me bleed on both eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to give it a try go ahead, it may work on someone who&#x27;s eyebrows are softer than mine.</li>
            <li> I love these handy little beauty tools!! Small, precise, sharp and get the job done quickly and neat (usually...I have nicked myself once or twice because these razors are so sharp!) . I ordered a few packages of these and they are lasting awhile.</li>
            <li> I found these simple to use once I got the hang of it! I usually just use tweezers, but I prefer using these now. It really gets the hair with no pain</li>
            <li> I thought these sounded like a good idea so I put them in my cart to receive free shipping (I wanted free shipping and didn&#x27;t want to spend money on something I wouldn&#x27;t use). I just got them in the mail and decided to give them a try.....worst idea ever. They irritated my skin and made me bleed. They didn&#x27;t give a very close shave and left me with stubble around my eye brows. Definitely will not buy these again and would not recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these shapers every where and no one seems to carry them anymore. So when I found them here I was excited..</li>
            <li> These seem like dangerous and worthless shapers. Maybe others got the hang of it. I did not. Not easy to use.</li>
            <li> These tiny shavers are great. Im not sure how long they last, as I have only used mine a handful of times but they do work nicely and I would recommend them. Cant go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> Do not work! Very dull blades.  They came three to pack and all the same. Thought this would be the solution but disappointed!</li>
            <li> I like the angled ones better but these work great and were less expensive than the angled ones I was able to find.</li>
            <li> Works as described and as pictured :) Very sharp and nice for my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> They work well though a little too razor like. Other ones I have don&#x27;t seem to shave my eyebrows these kind of do feel like I&#x27;m shaving. Hoping no fast growth I have thin eye brows naturally and never did anything but threading so I hope I didn&#x27;t ruin it for myself now</li>
            <li> but not as sharp as the flamingo brand. it also doesn&#x27;t last as long. however, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These work great for my eyebrows. I&#x27;m not a fan of plucking and this is so much easier than going to get my brows waxed or threaded! They&#x27;re easy to handle and are very precise.</li>
            <li> BEST eyebrow shapers out there!  I&#x27;ve tried several brands but when I saw this by Noxzema, I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. . .glad I did!  Won&#x27;t ever purchase another brand, this is by far the best - nice, close &#x27;shave&#x27; to the brow area makes shaping easy and the strays disappear quickly!</li>
            <li> Precise and lasts really long.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of dark facial hair, but my problem is that most of it is very fine and can&#x27;t be removed easily with tweezers. The little mini-razors are perfect for me and are very easy and quick to use. I use them on my eyebrows and upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I&#x27;m not as careful as I should be and I accidentally make tiny cuts on my face, but that&#x27;s completely my fault. The blades are sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter for Christmas as a stocking stuffer. She loves them. They are quite sharp though as she nicked herself a bit.</li>
            <li> these mini razors are a very easy way to get the eye brows you want.  the blades are strong, portable, and long lasting.  i have never cut myself on these.</li>
            <li> Not working for me. Don&#x27;t west  money.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t order these again. I typically use these style (but a different brand, Fromm) of razors for dermaplaning and 2 of the 3 in this package were so dull I could feel it dragging on my skin on the first stroke. Other brands I could reuse the razors at least once without significant dulling. It was horrible.</li>
            <li> this doesnt even deserve 1 star i ordered 2 items and only receive 1 thats BS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these forever. It was nice to be able to order them. Perfect for my purse, and those little hairs that seem to grow out of nowhere.</li>
            <li> I always buy these at the store so buying them from here saved me time. Great product</li>
            <li> Simple, quick and painless for those necessary unexpected touch-ups.  Does well for prepping brows and skin for various treatments too.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these and they are just so so. I prefer the Tinkle brand eyebrow shapers. I think they work much better than these. I will not be purchasing again.[[ASIN:B000BIUGFK Tinkle Eyebrow Shaper, 3pk]]</li>
            <li> I bought these to maintain the shape of my brows and they are horrible to use! The blade doesn&#x27;t feel like a blade as it is very dull and has ridges. I actually ended up cutting my skin right above my brows where I was trimming. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used small razors from other brands as well as other small sized razors from Noxzema.  They&#x27;re fairly sharp, but they also cut my skin quite often.  They&#x27;re a little larger than I&#x27;d prefer.  If they were a little smaller and a little safer they would be a better product.</li>
            <li> After finding a package of these by accident, they sat in my cabinet for the longest time.  Finally pulled them out today to use before a series of business trips, and I can&#x27;t get over how easy and painless it was to clean up and sculpt my eyebrows.  I did a little tweezing before pulling one of these out, but I dont&#x27; think I&#x27;ll need to every again.    The safety part of the razor makes it difficult to cut yourself unless you find the exact angle with the exact pressure.  But the razor is sharp enough that you don&#x27;t have to press hard against your skin (so no worries about razor burn).    Great product!</li>
            <li> as expected. cheaper than tinkle. works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I thought it is time to switch from tweezers to razors. Last time I used razors they performed better than tweezers so I think I would give another try. Those were just too blunt, left a LOT of stubs that I could only pluck them out when they grow longer. Now my eyebrows are ugly.</li>
            <li> I love these, they are perfect for shaping up unruley eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Love these. Easy to use and work well - must be the shape, but these are the only shapers I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li> I use this to remove nose and ear hair. Works great.</li>
            <li> I bought some of these years ago at Walmart, and used them up until my recent purchase. they are great if you don&#x27;t have time or don&#x27;t want to pluck your eyebrows. they don&#x27;t leave the skin red like plucking does, and are sharp enough to really cut the hairs. it can be difficult to get under the eyebrow above the eye, but, with some maneuvering it can be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go all the time as much as I want to keep my eyebrows done, these helps me maintain the look. I call them my lil helpers, their sharp but gentle on my skin. Love that they have cap too to avoid accidents.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow razor I&#x27;ve purchased, I&#x27;ve tried other brands from the drugstore but they just aren&#x27;t sharp enough to get the job done. This razor is quite sharp and I can use it on both my eyebrows and above my upper lip. I have not seen it in stores, but will continue to purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter to use and they work great. easy to maneuver and do a little trimming at a time.</li>
            <li> It is a cool way to get rid of those small eyebrow/upperlip hairs without pain.&lt;br /&gt;Although the removal doesn&#x27;t last long since it takes the upper layer only, its good when you need to get rid of those hair in short time.And the razors are reusable</li>
            <li> Be Very VERY VERY careful with these. You will get the smoothest and shapeliest brows But My GOD are they sharp. They can and will cut you so be careful. Sigh beauty over pain. But other than the nicks and cuts it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure I shouldn&#x27;t have to saw this because it sounds absolutely crazy but- NEVER use this while in motion- even if you are not the one driving- it&#x27;ll take your eyes out. Be warned</li>
            <li> These are great for quick touchups when getting to the salon or waxing my eyebrows at home isn&#x27;t an option either because of time or not wanting to have to wait for the redness and puffiness from waxing to go away.</li>
            <li> Great product to help shape your eyebrows and get hairs that tweezers normally can&#x27;t. Only downfall is be prepared to either shave every other day or use your tweezers shortly after each time you use this product. Hairs grow back in twice as fast.</li>
            <li> Packaged just as pictured.  Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Better than tweezing but its takes practice to learn and perfect this type of thing. Great Purchase. Definitely Recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these, they are perfect for on the go, for touch ups or to cover large areas of the face. Quite sharp and one blade lasts for a few weeks before needing to switch.</li>
            <li> Expect a very small shaper. I was thinking that it would be like the ones that I purchase at Wal-Mart but they aren&#x27;t they are way smaller - it does come with this eyebrow curve which is cool but I certainly wont be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> She has used one twice now and has not been cut or experienced bumps! She has asked that I buy more before they are out of stock!</li>
            <li> I bought these to try them out but they don&#x27;t seem to cut close enough to give a good shave to the eyebrows and leave stubble. Another thing they leave is irritation and red spots. Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love these eyebrow shapers! Great for touch-ups in between waxing, but sufficient for regular use. I recommend wiping clean with a sponge applicator and maybe a dab of alcohol rather than using water to clean. This will prevent rust and increase the life of your shaver. Also, do not store in the bathroom. The moisture will cause them to rust faster as well. If you keep them dry they will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have started shaping my &amp;#34;tween&amp;#34; daughter&#x27;s eyebrows this year with other brands of little shapers...UGH! She would always complain how bad it hurts and never wanted to keep them shaped because of it. I thought she was being a little over dramatic until I tried them! OUCH! So I went to amazon for options and found these. AWSOME! She was so nervous, but once I started she got so excited and I could even feel the difference! Now I don&#x27;t have to force her or wait to have her unshaped &amp;#34;cotton ball&amp;#34; eyebrows begging for attention! Thanks NOXEMA! Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> These are the best eyebrow shapers that you will find anywhere. I&#x27;ve purchased several from Walmart and target but none come close to the precision and sharpness of the blade. With these I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot over and over to remove the hair which leads to smooth skin with no irritation. Works great and I always purchased these on amazon because I can&#x27;t find them in any stores. But they work amazingly and I will purchase these again and again!</li>
            <li> Great precision product.  I use these in lieu of plucking</li>
            <li> These are sharper than they appear, and I nicked myself trying to trim up my eyebrows!  Be careful not to press too hard, and try to keep a steady hand.  They work well for fine hairs but for coarser hairs I switched to tweezers anyway.</li>
            <li> These worked great. They are small so be careful not to lose them. I lost one the first day. Would definitely purchase these again</li>
            <li> Awesome the only thing I use...I hope these are always available. Nosema made something when they made these just plain easy to use..feels good in your hands..</li>
            <li> I bought this product and do not like them and the main reason is that if you use them at a certain angle they cut like a knife . I dont think they are safe and will not buy them again.. They dont keep sharp and give you razor burns.. I will buy a differnet product next time.. Please use caution when using this product..</li>
            <li> It performed better than I expected.  The product did not scratch, scrape or harm my brows in any way.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The ones I received were labeled bikini trimmers and the package was different, but they look the same. There was no instruction whatsoever on how to use them for bikini or face. I had to go find videos online about eyebrow trimming to figure out what to do. But in the end I think I did a good job trimming my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> the eyebrow shaper is sharp but safe to use. three packs can be used in a long time period. nice</li>
            <li> These are great! They&#x27;re small but VERY effective. Does not hurt your skin and removes the hair well. You can use these anywhere on your face. Like I said these are small, and it&#x27;s 1 (3) pack. I would definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for me other than giving me a rash. The blade is awkward and thick and does all most nothing as far as unwanted hair goes. It dulled after one use and left me with little scratches and red patches from trying so hard to get rid of my facial hairs. I would not use it again nor recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The blades WILL cut you if you aren&#x27;t careful with it but honestly, you won&#x27;t need to press down hard with these \\&quot;bad boys\\&quot; if you are doing it right and if the blade isn&#x27;t dull. They say they are for eyebrows AND bikini line.. Lets just say, they work WONDERFULLY with both. I did slightly cut my skin below my eyebrow when I first tried this out but it didn&#x27;t really make too much of an appearance for me to be upset about. They are small enough to put into a purse and the handle on it is long enough for you to get a good grip (though, personally I think the handle could be a bit shorter.). Though, I will say before you test this product out I wouldn&#x27;t test it on your face right away unless you want to. If you aren&#x27;t careful it will take a bit to get used to the way this product works. Try it somewhere else like on your leg or arm hair that way if you accidentally cut yourself at least it won&#x27;t be on your face.</li>
            <li> In search of a eyebrow shaper because I was tired of spending 15 to 20 dollars to be in excruciating pain while getting them waxed... And so, I found the Noxzema Eyebrow Shaper. Now, mind you, I had a horrible experience with an eyebrow shaper of a different brand ended up cutting my eyelid.. Mainly because I think the product itself was too big. Anyway, the first time I used it I was amazed by how easy it was... I think the reason it&#x27;s better than most is because it is smaller... It&#x27;s so easy to use... I just recommend starting off really slow because these tiny little blades are sharp as heck. The eyebrow shaper gives you a lot of control.. Just remember to swab eyebrows with a little alcohol before you get started to prevent infection in case you get a cut.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this brand name products to be honest.It is very harsh on the skin (pulls) and this surprised me.Good size though and I will finda way to make them work better.</li>
            <li> Great quality razors. I use it to shape up my beard. Keeps it&#x27;s sharpness for quite some time. I have a few of these on standby.</li>
            <li> Does not rust. Long lasting sharpness.</li>
            <li> Really like these little trimmers.  Great for shaping and removing unwanted hair around the brows and uni.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt, give knicks nor burns.</li>
            <li> Razors were dull.. Didn&#x27;t remove the fine hairs I thought it would.. I used it for cleaning up brows :(</li>
            <li> Leaves awful scrape marks everywhere you use it.  The blades are very cheap and dull.  It tears skin and leaves hair behind.</li>
            <li> I love these.They are really sharp compared to other similar products. They stopped selling these in the stores in my area so I was glad to see amazon had them. I stock pile theses because both of my daughters also love to use these shavers. easy and lasts long</li>
            <li> Love these these are very convenient to do touches up on your face or bikini line always have to have a couple ready for me</li>
            <li> These are really sharp. I would not try on my eyebrows. But do use for the pesky hairs that appear on my upper lip sometimes.</li>
            <li> I love these shavers. I will continue to buy them because they work with ease.</li>
            <li> Works great. Removes facial hair.</li>
            <li> Horrible! The plastic guard was very hard to remove (I actually sliced my finger!) But that was my own fault and not the reason I&#x27;m giving 1 star.  The blade was very dull, &amp;#34;skipped&amp;#34; on my skin. Didn&#x27;t cut hair and when it did it was random and not close. Very disappointed!!!!  Thankfully it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin as some reviewers said it did, but it flat out didn&#x27;t work.  Will NEVER purchase again.</li>
            <li> awful product :(  just want a tiny razor to &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; the brow area. this just does not do it. head too wide, too long, scrapes terribly.</li>
            <li> Good. And it works. And brand new.</li>
            <li> These are the only product of this kind worth using. They are always sharp. In design they are both not too long and the end is sufficiently curved so you don&#x27;t stab yourself and bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And especially what distinguishes them is that the guard strips over the blade have a slick plastic coating. This means that unlike other similar products they don&#x27;t pinch and yank the hair or scratch and irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several others after I stopped seeing these in my local stores and all were miserable. I am so glad these are still available online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sound like an ad but I&#x27;m really serious.</li>
            <li> Not great. Doesn&#x27;t work well to get strays hairs or shape.</li>
            <li> These really don&#x27;t work very well. I use them to shape my eyebrows and they pull on my skin. I will just have to get the ones I usually get and throw these away.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for 7 years and my local Family Dollar store stopped carrying this exact brand. These are the only brand that are easy to hold, control, and shave without scratching your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a excellent product that works well. I have went through several different brands of shavers and these work the best.</li>
            <li> Only one shaper was in the package I received. I am very upset, considering that I paid for a pack of three, and only received a half open pack of one! Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are great. I&#x27;ll certainly buy more when I run out. They&#x27;re small and I can fit them in my make-up bag for easy travel. They&#x27;re sharp enough to get the job done, but not sharp enough to cut your eyebrow off. A+</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and they shape eyebrows very well.</li>
            <li> VERY nice. Sharp, works great as brow shaper.</li>
            <li> I loved both products! The Nieva is so much cheaper purchasing them through Amazon. I love Noxzema Eyebrow Shaper! I can&#x27;t even find them in the stores anymore!</li>
            <li> These are AWESOME!!!  My poor daughter has her Italian fathers bushy eyebrows. Before, I had used little scissors for eliminating her unibrow but these work like a charm! No more trace hairs and no worries of cutting her.</li>
            <li> Worked great, a little too great. I cut myself too many times with this one-not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> I have very thick eyebrows and I hate threading and waxing. With this I have a very clean look everyday and it&#x27;s so easy to use, I&#x27;ve yet to screw it up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these as my main grooming tool for my eyebrows.  I still tweeze regularly, but in a pinch when I have little time and need to touch up my brows, I use these and they do they job well.</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for these shavers in my local stores, however I can&#x27;t find them anywhere! As long a amazon keeps selling I will keep ordering these. They are easy to use and give a good close shave, best eyebrow shaver/shaper I&#x27;ve found so far, especially for a DIY kind of gal like me.</li>
            <li> THese are the best little ryr brow shavers and are becoming difficult to even find.  Arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Love, love these little eyebrow razors. I have been using them for years and used to purchase them at my drugstore. Because the price was much lower, this time I bought them from Amazon. They arrived the next day and I was able to clean up my eyebrow area before my party that night.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend  these to anyone that has bushy eyebrows and hates to spend time plucking with tweezers.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I just got it, and they&#x27;re  stylish, and works perfect!!! I love it also I reccomment this seller and this product with confidence! ðŸ’—</li>
            <li> These can also be used to trim ear hair from men. They have wire guards so not to remove the whole ear, MEN!</li>
            <li> A great way to &amp;#34;tweeze&amp;#34; at home quickly, but CAREFUL, it is very easy to nick your delicate skin, as there is no razor guard on these teeny eyebrow shapers. But with practice, I quickly learned to be careful and was able to space out my salon eyebrow waxing by a few weeks, saving myself a great amount of $$!</li>
            <li> These things are a joke. They don&#x27;t work at all. Good thing they werent expensive.</li>
            <li> Great eye brow shaper easy to use. Does not cut my skin will totally recommend. And can be use for any other parts of your face</li>
            <li> Like it but a little way too sharp. I already have 2 cuts on my eyebrows something that never happened with the other brand I was using which I could never find anymore!</li>
            <li> Love these little guys!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I use it for eyebrows and to get rid of hair above my lips since I use to get teased about it. It gets the job done and it does it well :)</li>
            <li> I have used a eyebrow shaper since I was a teenager.  The past 2 years I haven&#x27;t been able to find these in the stores!  The ones I use to use where a little bigger and not angled, I like these ones much much better!  I am so glad I found these I was sooooo tired of plucking.</li>
            <li> This is a great little blade. On the cheaper side compared to others on the market. It works well!! Gives a nice exfoliation and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back coarse. Great to keep in your travel bag. Be careful not to over do it though only go over the skin a few times otherwise it&#x27;ll be irritating and might scrape. My favorite part is the size compared to competitors. It&#x27;s nice and small and can for under your brow or in between much easier than mkt razors if it&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li> these guys are tiny !</li>
            <li> I hate plucking my eyebrows! These noxema eyebrow shapers worked great! The small razor allowed me to carefully shape my eye brows and quickly without having to use a tweezer. They worked so well, that i accidently cut myself above my brow, so be careful!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done.I keep one in the bathroom, one in the car and one in my luggage makeup bag. Super handy and surprisingly well made.</li>
            <li> not handy.. not easy to use... must be very careful...</li>
            <li> Work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a guy trimming your own eyebrows, you&#x27;ll need to google how to do it or something. These work SO well that if you make a mistake, it&#x27;s noticeable.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re are very efficient. I use them to groom the top of my eyebrows for a cleaner look and they&#x27;re very easy to use. The blade is sharp and cuts away hair very well. It is easy to hold and handle and gets the job done like getting rid of peach fuzz and getting a clean edge.</li>
            <li> I used to use those ordinary shapers from the 99 cent store. Once I bought these, because I was tired of getting cut, I was pleased. It&#x27;s much painless to use these, they&#x27;re gentle on your skin and your hair grows back thinner and much slower.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these! I forgot how sharp they are though but I guess that&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li> This product is DUMB. Because it was an add-on, I thought I would throw it in my cart. WRONG. They actually made me bleed when I tried to use them. Very weird and cheap product, not what you want on your skin folks.</li>
            <li> Not the best blade (incomparison to a regular razor)  but it gets the job done if you work at it. Takes a little longer than a regular razor, sometimes repeated swipes but it can get under the eyebrow better. Less risk of shaving off what you want to keep!</li>
            <li> These razors are the perfect size for eyebrow shaping!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other razor eyebrow shapers before, but they were too big &amp; didn&#x27;t have that curved casing.&lt;br /&gt;Granted the razors inside these products are always straight &amp; you need to be careful, it&#x27;s the curved casing that makes the difference- especially for eyebrow shaping!!!</li>
            <li> Very sharp! does what it is intended to do. Keep away from small children and clumsy husbands...</li>
            <li> These are the most worthless piece of junk ever.  They are supposed to be razors, but do not begin to shave even one eyebrow hair.  I bought three packs and threw them out.  Would have cost more to return than I paid for them.  They are cheap, but it is still a waste of your money.</li>
            <li> so when i did, i bought two! And my eyebrows look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Careful if you dont know what you are doing as one wrong move and you might be wearing your angry eyebrows for a minute.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me as an alternative to waxing, threading. It does the job, however it does not keep the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Blade guards wear off quickly</li>
            <li> I love these shapers.  They are easy to use an offer me great control in shapeing my brows.</li>
            <li> the best ones yet everyone must buy</li>
            <li> I love the lil blades more convenient then the wider blades. Blades are very sharp. Recommend this item. Thank you!</li>
            <li> super good little razors for my eye brows. no more plucking for me :)</li>
            <li> The first time I try, but I didn&#x27;t hurt myself!</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other razor-tipped eyebrow shapers in the past with good results, but found these to be a pain. Literally! I&#x27;ve nicked myself twice with these, even using them very carefully. Even when I don&#x27;t nick myself, my skin feels like it&#x27;s been scraped. (And no, I don&#x27;t press down hard with these.) I&#x27;ve never had the same problem with the Sally Hansen brand of shapers.</li>
            <li> I like it&#x27;s small size and light handle, but I think the blade became dull much faster than I expected. That&#x27;s my reason for the 2 stars. It does the job with my brows, but I wish the blade was tougher/sharper.</li>
            <li> This is good for when you are running out the door and realize your eye brows are untamed. But not the best for precision. Also there have been so many times that I&#x27;ve taken off more hair than I wanted because my finger slipped.</li>
            <li> It works great if you need something to help you keep between the eyebrows clean and clear of extra hair.</li>
            <li> These work quite well. They are sharp for sure but isn&#x27;t that kinda the point? I use them every other day to shave/shape my eyebrows. I will definitely be purchasing these again</li>
            <li> when I brush it against my brows, it cuts the hair in a very uneven random way, if at all. i don&#x27;t understand exactly how to use this., there are no clear instructions.</li>
            <li> Only eyebrow razor worth using!  Small and doesn&#x27;t dull super fast! It had been discontinued at my local dollar general which is why I bought it o here. However, I went to another dollar general a couple towns over and bought a stock pile. They were only $2.55 there.</li>
            <li> I love these shapers! I hate plucking my eyebrows and I hate paying someone to wax and pluck them even more. These babies are SHARP and do the job mostly painless. It&#x27;s super easy to create the shape I want instead of hoping that plucking this clump of hair doesn&#x27;t leave me looking jacked. They are CHEAP compared to getting waxes. Just buy them!</li>
            <li> They are sharp, so easy does it when shaping brows etc. A handy tool for you cosmetic bag as long as you kerp the lid on it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Easy to clean. Last a while.</li>
            <li> This product was bought for a friend of mine, but I have used these in the past.  I LOVE them and so did he.  They do not sell this exact brand in any stores around here anymore and it is great to know that I can get them online and from a prompt seller.  I had some issues with forgetting to not add the bill because this was a birthday present and upon contacting the seller they were quick to respond and not include the bill as requested.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Small, with a sturdy cap for on the go and safer cut!</li>
            <li> A little too sharp and sometimes cut me</li>
            <li> my wife likes this type the best something about the shape being better</li>
            <li> These work extremely well as seam rippers.  Inexpensive, sharp and disposable.  Very handy and useful for us quilters.</li>
            <li> Noxzema Eyebrow Shaper, 3-pack is very useful.It is smaller than regular size so it can shaper my eyebrow more precisely</li>
            <li> Have been looking for eyebrow shaper for long finally found it,it so easy to use,but u have to be careful,so that it doesn&#x27;t cut it,other than that its a great product</li>
            <li> I like the small blade size which is great for getting around the brow area, but I have to say that the blade dulls quite easily.  After 2-3 uses, I can feel the blade tugging on the skin</li>
            <li> These work great but I&#x27;d only use them for their intended purposes - eyebrows and other small areas. I use it for eyebrow touchups. If you have a lot of peach fuzz to get rid of, these would take too long to go over it all.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I get pesky little blonde hairs around my eyebrows, and they work beautifully. I&#x27;ve tried some off-brand eyebrow shapers and they were dull and never worked right. These are a game changer. They work on even the shortest of hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten these from the dollar store before, and really liked them. They stay sharp a really long time. If they get dirty, I just use a nail brush on them. If you aren&#x27;t careful, you can easily cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but the last 2 packs I purchased of these left me marked for life.  The tips of these razors are SO ridiculous sharp that if you twist it slightly the wrong way you will undoubtedly leave a blood trail.  I even tried SANDING the tip of one down so I could use it and gave one to my sister for a sanity check, her feedback mirrored my own.</li>
            <li> Brand does make a difference with these little razors. I bouth some in the store and they gave me red marks on my skin. These do not so I will buy only this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife and daughter who use these to trim their eyebrows and such. We&#x27;ve looked EVERYWHERE in stores and can&#x27;t seem to find them anymore. There only seem to be cheap knockoffs and pricier electric versions, both of which either don&#x27;t work or slice their faces up because there are no blade guards like there are on the Noxzema ones.  Handy little product to have, even I use them to trim my sideburns and other unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I use it but it seem like it wasn&#x27;t  doing anything...  I&#x27;m going to buy myself a razor blade and forget about this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave the hairs off my face anymore! These work much better!</li>
            <li> This works just as I hoped.  It is small, lightweight and has protective covers for when not in use.  It is sharp so you have to be careful not to cut yourself, but you really wouldn&#x27;t want it to be dull, right?</li>
            <li> Noxzema Eyebrow Shaper, 3-pack it was okay but I felt it was not smooth enough for me and was a bit little for me will have to find a better shaper</li>
            <li> works when you need to clean up in a pinch</li>
            <li> These are tiny razors with guards to protect your skin from getting sliced open.&lt;br /&gt;They work perfectly, but I warn you to pay attention to where the blade is going&lt;br /&gt;as I found it very easy to accidentally whisk away a portion of my eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;Then I felt lopsided, but resisted the urge to even my brows out.  I have been&lt;br /&gt;down that road before and found that I removed too much and it looked&lt;br /&gt;ridiculous!  Anyways, these are small and get into the right places.  I used one&lt;br /&gt;over and over for a few weeks without a problem.  I just kept it clean with alcohol&lt;br /&gt;in between uses.  They have a blade guard to protect them when not in use.  I&lt;br /&gt;will buy some more someday soon.</li>
            <li> I tried these after reading about people using them to remove peach fuzz on the cheeks/jawline.  Don&#x27;t get carried away, because these babies are sharp; on my first try I managed to hamfist the whole thing and gave myself a scrape on the side of my face.  Since then, I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, unless you have the hands of a surgeon, I think it would be crazy to put these anywhere near your eyebrows.  One tiny false move, and you could have an eyebrow crisis on your hands.  Or worse yet, an eyelash crisis, if you move your hand the wrong way.  These are like tiny samurai swords......they&#x27;ll slice through anything with almost zero effort....so proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> Worth the few bucks I paid. Not excellent but work well enough for the price.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for those days when I don&#x27;t have time to either wax or thread my eyebrows. Does a great job of getting all the extras out. It does a better job if you apply a lubricant (moisturizer, oil etc) over area that you want to use this on. Love it and always have it handy!</li>
            <li> these razors changed my life!  NO more need for time-consuming tweezing.  It only takes minutes to groom my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Perfect!!! Wal-mart stopped selling these a long time ago and I haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere else so when I saw them on Amazon I got pretty excited. They were just as good as  I remember and I&#x27;m so excited I&#x27;ll probably stock up big time! AMAZE-BALLS</li>
            <li> For the past 2 or so years, I&#x27;ve been buying eyebrow shapers from Sephora, which are $15 for a pack of two...  These work just as well, if not better!  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in myself, thinking about how much money was unnecessarily spent.  Anyways, I really like these!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a learning curve with these, but I find they take off the eyebrow hair very cleanly. Watch how hard you \\&quot;drag\\&quot; the razor down or you may get abrasions. If it were a tiny bit gentler, I&#x27;d probably give it 5 stars. I just reordered these. I am getting about 4 uses out of each razor, using them twice a week, so about 6 weeks with one package at $2.99...not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tip, may not work for everyone: I find these work better when I hold them vertically and go *with* the direction of the hair growth, not against it. Vertical is trickier as you have to be careful not to get too close to your eyes on the bottom or too close to the top of your brows when you&#x27;re shaving above them, but once you get the hang of things, it should all be pretty quick and clean.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this i love it unlike other ones this one is gentle on the skin it doesnt leave that roughness that you would get with others ...its also smooth to work around so u dont have to keep going over it.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should, helps with upkeep of eyebrows without having to pluck hairs individually. I mostly use to help &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; my eyebrows (get rid of the scragglers above and then between my eyebrows). Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> It is a good product, it&#x27;s very confortable for to use, It is the I expectec and excellent cost, I recomended this product.</li>
            <li> I thought these would work well for those hard to reach places since they&#x27;re small and look easy to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;They couldn&#x27;t cut anything though (and I don&#x27;t think I have particularly thick hair). No matter how I angled the blade, they didn&#x27;t do anything more than scrape the skin. I tried using them in conjunction with shaving cream too, just as useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use a fresh one on my eyebrows to see what angles the blade cuts at, it worked okay there.</li>
            <li> These are the best eyebrow razors on the market. The stores where I live used to carry them, but for some odd reason not one store does anymore.  The heads are smaller so you can maneuver them easier and they are sharp.</li>
            <li> I can not remember the brand, but I used to like these.  Yesterday, it left cuts all over my eyebrow area. clean, deep, cuts.  Maybe there was a goof-up in my particular batch.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Cuts well and price is good.  Thanks</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp or last as long as the Tinkle brand.  They are okay, but not a smooth razor and don&#x27;t last long. the only benefit is that they are smaller so depending on what your trying to use them for this may or may not be a benefit.</li>
            <li> These are a must have. Great for quick touch ups!</li>
            <li> Came exactly as described. Arrived quickly and nothing wrong with it. Would purchase from seller again.</li>
            <li> Has safety wires on the blade so you don&#x27;t cut your face but that also makes it a little harder to use and get a clean shape</li>
            <li> They do the trick, but they are sharp so be careful. Don&#x27;t push it against your skin, just glide it along your skin. Wash your face after, you&#x27;ll have dry skin and hair left on you afterwards. Also, make sure you keep them clean. Wipe them off after every use.</li>
            <li> it does what it is supposed to</li>
            <li> These are the worst blades ever!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and simple. I use these to shape my eyebrows and they get the job done quickly. Since they&#x27;re razors, the hair does grow faster than plucking.</li>
            <li> Love these...will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Too sharp cut my self</li>
            <li> I have always like the shaper. I order them often.</li>
            <li> I purchased these based on the good reviews and I am really happy I did. I&#x27;m not good at tweezing my eyebrows and even worse at threading. I thought I would be bad at this too but I can finally shape my eyebrow the way I want. It&#x27;s very fast and painless. If I had to find something negative about it would be that you need to do this more often than tweezing. But I&#x27;ll take it. If you are fast at tweezing and don&#x27;t mind I would still try this as a comparison. The first time I tried this I felt the slightest sting on my skin once I was done but it went away. Now I find it works best to use the shaper right after a shower. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I used to thread and tweeze my eyebrows and I&#x27;d always have a sneezing fit. Not to mention the irritation and blood.  This is a great alternative for people with sensitive skin.  I like how there are covers so I can always keep one in my purse.</li>
            <li> Great tool for shaping brows. VERY sharp, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Very very useful for instant fixing of eyebrows</li>
            <li> Love these and couldn&#x27;t find them in stores. Price is great. I just these for my eyebrows in the shower.  Very easy to use, last forever and just perfect.</li>
            <li> Very hard to trim the browse</li>
            <li> What I received wasn&#x27;t what is pictured. On top of getting a bootleg product, what I got had a blade so dull, it couldn&#x27;t cut through air.</li>
            <li> I keep a supply of these on hand all the time because they are a great little tool!  I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand!</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use even my tweens feel comfortable trimming their eyebrows and facial hair!  They work great for most but the smallest areas. I love that they come in a multi-pack so the whole family can share them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these! This is a MUST buy! I will never tweeze my eyebrows again. Not only does it save time, but it cleans up in a smooth extra clean way. Meaning, it catches all the hairs including &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; baby hairs that you can barely see or pull with a tweezer. This is a great way to keep my eyebrows polished on a daily basis. It&#x27;s just sharp enough to clean around the brows and the small size is perfect so I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting my eyeball area or getting tangled with my lashes. Will definitely be re-buying these. Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for eyebrow shaping and cleaning up.</li>
            <li> Grooms eyebrows very well.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these shapers. They do what they supposed to do, and are a much better quality than generics.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTLY LOVE THESE.. THEY ARE THE BEST for Eyebrows and Snatch shape ups. ;)  I&#x27;ve tried every other one I could think to buy and with these the hair comes right off and smooth afterwards. I will never buy anything else ever.</li>
            <li> These are great little razors except for the fact that they don&#x27;t stay sharp very long. The size makes them optimal for use which is why I purchased them. I think they&#x27;re a bit expensive for the amount of usage per razor. That&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Nevertheless, I still buy them.</li>
            <li> These are great eyebrow trimmers.  I&#x27;ve been using these for years and I&#x27;ve never cut myself, and the blade stays sharp for a long time before dulling.</li>
            <li> I got these shapers to help clean up the fine hairs along my brow line, and they serve that purpose wonderfully. They take the fine hairs right off with little effort, and the protectant on the razors actually does protect the skin pretty well (just be sure you use the shaper at the proper angle). I don&#x27;t think shapers like this are 100% effective at getting rid of thicker hair (wax or tweezers are the way to go for that), and the hair does grow back quickly, but this is still a handy little tool for your beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> I have tried other eyebrow shapers in the past and the blades on those were too large and dull for my liking. These shapers are great and trim my eyebrow hair with no problem. These are sharp so caution needs to be used when trimming any facial hair. I will be purchasing more when I use up my pack.</li>
            <li> Not too sharp, not too dull. The size and shape makes for a much more precise shave than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. Perfect for those who hate to pluck.</li>
            <li> It shaves really well and doesn&#x27;t cut you.</li>
            <li> Saves minutes from me plucking every single eyebrow!! Works great!</li>
            <li> Only eyebrow shaver that works for me. My eyebrows grow back very fast, so sometimes I have to use it almost everyday. I normally do not get my eyebrows wax and shape them myself with these. I had a co-worker recently who thought I got them done but I did it myself :)</li>
            <li> I used these for my eyebrows and I have been trying to find these exact ones in beauty stores and only been able to find the square off ones.</li>
            <li> These are just wonderful!! For stray hairs anywhere or to groom your whole brow. I won&#x27;t be without a pack of these &amp; have them on Sub &amp; save! Perfect size &amp; shape. Others are too long or are just teeny tiny razor shaped. These are perfect to shape your brows, stray hairs on the face, body, lip, sideburns, whatever you need these will do it. They don&#x27;t cut you, yet sharp &amp; precise!&lt;br /&gt;This is the lowest price too! Amazon is great-&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend !!&lt;br /&gt;JENN~</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands, but none are as sharp have the precision like these do! None of the stores; where I am now living; carry these, so I have to order them online. Really recommend if you don&#x27;t want the hassle of plucking and aren&#x27;t a &#x27;wax&#x27; person!!</li>
            <li> Friggin&#x27; cut myself a couple of times with these. Be super careful.</li>
            <li> I used these when I spent a year in South Korea and could not find anywhere to get my eyebrows waxed in fact the women thought it was crazy to pluck or wax. So I converted and this is so much easier than trying to pluck when your short sighted like I am.</li>
            <li> I started using these after I was put on a medicine that caused my skin to be more delicate. Just be careful. It is basically a straight razor and I managed to cut myself. I&#x27;m a clumsy though so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I have issues plucking my eyebrows. I&#x27;m a big baby, I guess. These are a really great alternative.  (The review box says I must add more words.)</li>
            <li> Contour brow with ease and not pull them. Thanks, J</li>
            <li> After hearing this from everyone in the beauty community, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I normally use a small personal trimmer that is battery powered and it works well without any razor burn and gets the hair off. That works perfectly but these do not. They tug and pull more hair than it shaves off. I&#x27;ve tried different angles, thinking I was doing it wrong, with the same results. I&#x27;ll stick to my battery powered trimmer (which I HIGHLY suggest over this.)</li>
            <li> Some of the bad review on here mention getting a blank package with dull razors, that is a problem to take up with the seller since they didn&#x27;t receive the actual item they are reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great!! They are sharp so the are perfect for easily getting hairs. Sharp means they won&#x27;t dull so quickly. You have to be careful that you do not put too much pressure as you can cut yourself. My first time using these on my brows I saw blood after I was done and realized I nicked myself. There will be a slight redness if you press too hard like I did. I love these and recommend them to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would personalty prefer something less sharp where you can press down hard and still have no results then use another brand.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase these at family dollar. That was the only place I could find them. Family dollar stopped carrying them so I had to find them online. They are sharp without cutting your skin or hurting. Shapes my eyebrows perfectly every time. Absolutely live them!</li>
            <li> Work great. Be careful very sharp. I use on my eyebrows in lieu of plucking. Love them. Bought three more packs</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for when my eyebrow shaper that came with a grooming kit broke. These seem to be better quality than what I had and I doubt the razor will slide out any time soon. Plus, a set of three helps prevent me from not having one in case one should break, The price is also pretty great.</li>
            <li> Good price, does work.</li>
            <li> I had never seen or heard of these before, so I was honestly a little reluctant to try them. I am SO glad I bought these! They work so well! It&#x27;s quick &amp; painless. So much easier than plucking or waxing my eyebrows. I will definitely keep buying these as needed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them to shape my eyebrows but use them for any unwanted facial hair. They are much easier to maneuver than a standard razor and because of that they don&#x27;t leave your skin red and irritated where you use them.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp. Shapes not very clean.</li>
            <li> These little razors are great for the eyebrows and sometimes I use them to trim up my hairline or above my lip. They are sharp though so dont press down too hard. Easy to clean, and easy to store because each one comes with its own little plastic head cover. Instead of buying one at the store for this price, I can get three for this price. Great value, and great item. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else now. These have totally spoiled me. I love them.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews on here about these cutting skin and they only break your skin if you apply to much pressure, just like any other razor would.  I&#x27;ve recently relocated 5 hours from where I used to purchase and there are no stores that carry this product so I was so happy to find these on Amazon!  You won&#x27;t be sorry!  I keep myself stocked up on these and have every girl in my family hooked. haha Once you get it down pat you can do your eyebrows painlessly in less than one minute and don&#x27;t experience the redness that tweezers bring if you don&#x27;t press down hard. Goodbye Tweezers!!!</li>
            <li> Sharp and easy to use!</li>
            <li> These things are dreadful. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson: you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ll stick with Sally Hansen from now on.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for those who canâ€™t handle the pain from plucking. I use these once awhile (not too often because the hair grows a lot faster back if used). Good size and very convenient. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> As long as you are careful when you deal with this rather sharper blade, it would give you excellent results. I have used so many eyebrow shaper, and I love this kind of shape the best since it is more convenient to trim my eyebrows in various ways. I personally think it is good to be sharper because it would be worn out someday more quickly if it is less sharper than this. Satisfy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for doing what it says it does which is shape eyebrows. Just small enough to get a well shaped arch and no weird bumps or irritation afterward.</li>
            <li> These are not that sharp, but they work good.  They don&#x27;t get dull fast, one of them will last about 2-3 months of use.</li>
            <li> Awesome razors. They definitely do what they are supposed to.</li>
