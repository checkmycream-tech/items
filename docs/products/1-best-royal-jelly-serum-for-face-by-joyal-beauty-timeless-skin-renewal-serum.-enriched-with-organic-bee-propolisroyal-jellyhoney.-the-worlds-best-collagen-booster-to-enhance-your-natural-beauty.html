            <li>and there&#x27;s no bad chemicals.</li>
            <li>The serum has a pleasant smell and is a little sticky which most serums are.</li>
            <li>I had to edit my review since the serum felt good and soothing at first, but the royal jelly/propolis which is one of the most important ingridient  in this serum is listed on the 12th out of 15 ingredients as one of the other reviewer mentioned.&lt;br</li>

            <li>face serum smells great and left my face feeling silky smooth and soft,...</li>
            <li>During these very, very hot and humid days of summer, this serum does not clog up my pores and does not feel sticky.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and is very soothing !</li>
            <li>From the very first application, the crust started to flake and he pulled it off.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think i can live without this serum :)</li>
            <li>I love that this is made with natural products!</li>
            <li>so I was pretty excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>Also, I love that it is all natural and organic!</li>

            <li>I love the natural ingredients and lack of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>but so far I am pleased with the order described.  </li>
            <li>I use it day and night- the best part is that it dries and absorbs completely- after putting it on and letting it dry, your skin feels totally normal-  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t an effect you will see right away of course, this is something you will need to work towards.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>the way the company even emailed me after my order to insure I had the right way to use my product</li>
            <li>It seeps right into the skin with no greasy after effects.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good new serum to try, definitely pick this one up.</li>
            <li>I tried this for couple of weeks, it felt very moisture and absorbed in quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is almost clear, glides on smoothly, just a tiny bit is easy to distribute across my face, and it soaks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really lightweight and absorbs really quickly</li>
            <li>Any type of skin would be okay to use this since it&#x27;s melts right into your skin with just a sheer amount, leaving no oiliness what so ever yet leaves your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and soothing and therapeutic.</li>
            <li>Smooth, clean and non sticky, this honey product works super well on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Adding some type of serum to your skin care regimen can help to hold in some of your skin’s natural moisture, prevent or reduce drying and help keep fine line and wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li>I really like it!  </li>
            <li>I recently received an interesting serum to review from Joyal Beauty.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, it is anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral so it may also help kill some of the bacteria on your skin that can cause acne in the first place.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and I just like the thought that it has the antibiotic agents in it to take care of any pesky bacteria hanging around.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>They are placing their customer&#x27;s well being first over sales.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>So, if someone is reading my review, they know exactly what and how I am using the Joyal Beauty products together.  </li>
            <li>So, 3 weeks ago, when I first start using Joyal Beauty products, I did just that.</li>
            <li>But, just short 3 weeks trying this product improved my skin this much, I am very confident this products help improve my skin tone to where it should be in near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about Customer Services and their support?  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying Joyal Beauty Timeless Renewal Serum.</li>
            <li>then my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen first hand the healing effects of this &amp;#34;Joyful (Joyal) serum.  </li>
            <li>At first thought I saw signs that it was clearing up my blackheads then</li>
            <li>Most serums seem to be just the same</li>
            <li>, Joyal has printed clearly on their label, they are free of these three classes of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I did not believe her review at the first time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>It is also anti-inflammatory, so if you are like me and have easily flushed, red skin, this will help calm, soothe, and moisturize all in one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin was very sensitive and acne prone, glad to find out this natural organic product line to try.</li>
            <li>have combination skin (my forehead, nose being oily while the cheeks are more on the dry side).&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product, I used to have some breakouts time to time depending on the food I ate or my condition of that day; plus no matter what products I used, my skin always had some redness right below my nose and the area in between my brows.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for about two days</li>
            <li>This may sound like a typical scratch healing, but on newly derma-rolled delicate facial skin, the effects of this wonderful healing serum is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Being fair skinned and having lived in Southern California my entire life, my skin has received it&#x27;s share of abuse.</li>
            <li>Being fair skinned and having lived in Southern California my entire life, my skin has received it&#x27;s share of abuse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels good but after using up the whole bottle my skin didn&#x27;t feel moisturized or youthful and the serum itself is a bit plain like</li>
            <li>All positive effects.</li>
            <li>They package them correctly (brown bottle to diminish effects of sunlight exposure and pump which keeps out air as oxidation renders the ingredients less effective over time).  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t dry me out like most..</li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum vs  hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum-</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum-</li>
            <li>It is one of my new favorite serums to use daily!</li>
            <li>I don’t feel comfortable going out in public without some make up on my face.  </li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty Customer Service amazes me as much as their product line.  </li>
            <li>They are very reliable.  </li>
            <li>Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.  </li>

            <li>Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>So when I read about the Joyal Renewal Serum I really thought it help me address some of my problems.</li>
            <li>So to get started I like that the serum comes in a pump so much easier to dispense.</li>
            <li>I received this serum to review and really like it.</li>
            <li>It has really cleared up my face</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast and as promised.</li>
            <li>Just over a two week period of time my crows feet have almost completely gone &amp; so have my laugh lines.  </li>
            <li>Even I spend lots of time to get rid of them, it was not work very well.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>Liked this serum, but only lasted about a month using twice daily.</li>
            <li>(my pre-skin test is I apply new serum/creams on my neck first and if my skin doesn’t break out, I start using it)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different than other serums that I&#x27;ve tested before and that&#x27;s definitely a good thing.</li>
            <li>I have used other Joyal Beauty products and have been pleased with all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an organic/natural skincare nut because most over-the-counter and high-end salons are loaded with synthesized chemicals which are foreign to the body and, therefore, toxic.</li>
            <li>bottle is a larger than most size, with a pump instead of the usual dropped top application.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from these major ingredients, there are many other powerful compounds added that are known for optimal skin health and beauty.</li>
            <li>After doing a derma-rolling session, I accidentally scratched my face with my own nail and because my face was newly rolled, the scratch was really deep and very red.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised and happy when my product arrived broken  in pieces of glass.</li>
            <li>On the flip side the serum is also a collagen booster that will help with my fine lines &amp; dry skin.</li>
            <li>Also, I was interested in looking into serums (it&#x27;s never to early to start)</li>
            <li>The first one is 98% natural 5% HA+5% vitamin c+other anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The first one is 98% natural 5% HA+5% vitamin c+other anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It is a thick serum that is very easy to pump out exactly the amount you need.</li>
            <li>My daughter has tried many other acne treatments with the ultimate outcome being just as much acne on top of dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li>, I noticed that my skin has more glow and evener tone than before, plus the biggest thing I realized was that I had less breakouts or whiteheads with this on.</li>
            <li>my face is softer, more even and less oily than before.</li>
            <li>Is a slight scent..not overwhelming at all</li>
            <li>My jowls look less pronounced and my face looks better.</li>
            <li>Royal Jelly has anti-bacterial potency which stops bacterial growth which is the main causes of acne.  </li>
            <li>particular serum has Vitamin E and C -</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are 98% Natural and 72% Organic and there isn&#x27;t any Parabens, Sulfates, Phthalates or Petrochemicals!!  </li>
            <li>Stop all my skin care items (which it did little to help anyway, but better than not using any).  </li>
            <li>Beauty&#x27;s Timeless Skin Renewal Serum comes into a very convenient pump bottle which makes it extremely easy to use without any mess.</li>
            <li>Moisturizer - Tiaki 100% natural day cream and Absolute Organic night cream for day and night&lt;</li>
            <li>, I look forward to seeing the results after using for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>, I look forward to seeing the results after using for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>Left by itself to dry, my skin feels just a wee bit like it&#x27;s got a mask on it, so I apply a layer of a Moroccan oil (which is a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil) (this from another organic skincare line) on top of this.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from dry skin (blame it on living in the coal regions of Pennsylvania and for working in a factory full time for 2+ years)</li>
            <li>This Timeless Skin Renewal Serum that Joyal Beauty sent me to review for them is a product that is totally new to me</li>
            <li>I am new to honey bee products in a skin care system and new to Joyal products.</li>
            <li>It dried fast and it felt light on my face.</li>
            <li>It dried fast and it felt light on my face.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin, I feel a little tightness at first</li>
            <li>Honey is very natural it adds moisture to my skin</li>
            <li>The dark brown coloring helps keep light out and preserve the quality of the serum.</li>
            <li>it is still too soon to say, but i like what i am seeing so far!</li>
            <li>After moving across the country to a much more dry and polluted area, my skin started breaking out and getting very dry.</li>
            <li>After all these years, I still get facial skin breakouts following stressful situations and after very hot, sweaty days of yard work.  </li>
            <li>I also wrote another review here for other 3 items (Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum ,  Retinol Correcting Serum,  Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But one I used most of it, it is hard to get the bottom serum out which is a huge waste.</li>
            <li>I recommend using it on clean, slightly damp skin followed by the Hyaluronic Acid serum and a moisturizer to finish.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, this serum helped clear up my skin</li>
            <li>You can also tell how natural it is by the smell.</li>
            <li>When I used this every morning my skin felt so soft and all the moisture felt locked in.</li>
            <li>and she has shown marked improvements with her bouts of acne.  </li>
            <li>So far, I like the serum.  </li>
            <li>Toxins age the skin and body which completely undermines any &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; ingredients that are in them.  </li>
            <li>They ship them well and early.  </li>
            <li>have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am amazed just short time, my skin tone improved so much.  </li>
            <li>Royal jelly and propolis preserve and restore proteins and enzymes for anti-aging action.</li>
            <li>It’s gentle enough to use it around eye</li>

            <li>skin is soft and never tired-looking.  </li>
            <li>Within 2 days, I could no longer see the scratch, and with in a week it was completely healed.  </li>
            <li>I like natural product and this is one I do prefer over some I have used before.</li>
            <li>wow that</li>
            <li>This would work well under makeup since it absorbs completely into your skin without leaving any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But stopped using the all purpose cream and the bumps never went away until I stopped using this completely.  </li>

            <li>Now they are soft.</li>
            <li>stopped everything from above all together for two weeks, I had to use wet, cool towel on my face two times a day for a week, I used only sweet almond oil mixed with tea tree oil during night, and sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li>I had no idea that Royal Jelly is such a powerful facial serum.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy raw honey and honey products from a local beekeeper and some of the top selling products she sold besides the honey itself, was Royal Jelly and Bee Propolis,</li>

            <li>I purchased a second bottle for my husband and me to use but passed that one on to my older daughter when she came home.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to all of my female readers.</li>
            <li>It seemed to calm down my face.</li>
            <li>I was sent out a new bottle at no extra charge or hesitation.</li>
            <li>I try new products, I stop using everything I used prior to new skin care, so I know the results that I am getting is what I am using currently.  </li>
            <li>My skin breakout easily, but heals slowly.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using other serum and creams made with more concentrated manuka honey and propolis from other brands and they do deliver anti-aging effects and I finally stopped using this serum.</li>
            <li>These are common chemical classes the cosmetic industry can use without specifically calling out on an ingredient line, or they do call out the chemical and because the classes are so huge</li>
            <li>The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients.</li>
            <li>The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients.</li>
            <li>If pimples breaks out, there are more than 10 pimples on my chins but very small or there are only one or two pimples on my cheeks but very big and hurt when I touch it.</li>
            <li>I am usually put some kind of make up to cover uneven skin, even if it is just short distance to the store to pick up something.  </li>
            <li>the third day, my face started to itchy again, red, swollen and then pilling all over again, I had to stop everything again for about two weeks to let my face calm down.</li>
            <li>My daughter has acne problems which we have searched high and low for different treatments that won&#x27;t over dry her skin.</li>

            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> but since I purchased it with more of a revitalization effect that included moisture (around the eye area), I found this product to be too drying.  </li>

            <li> They sent me the serum for free for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> I followed up with a light moisturizer.</li>

            <li> Many thanks!</li>

            <li> Excellent product makes a big different in skin tone and decrease appearance of fine wrinkles .</li>
            <li> I really loved the results of using those serums, I wanted to go back to my regime, so I decided to try one by one, I started with the Royal Jelly, followed by moisturizer,</li>
            <li> It’s refreshing to know company who develop and sells product is ready to help you.  </li>
            <li> The serum goes on cool like a jelly, then absorbs into the skin within seconds.  </li>
            <li> Also, it would be nice to have a moisturizer made by you guys to complete the process.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> The serum has a pleasant smell and is a little sticky which most serums are.</li>
            <li> I had to edit my review since the serum felt good and soothing at first, but the royal jelly/propolis which is one of the most important ingridient  in this serum is listed on the 12th out of 15 ingredients as one of the other reviewer mentioned.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Numerous vitamins and minerals such as B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, acetyl-choline and zinc can be found in royal jelly which are excellent for skin</li>
            <li> It also dries rather quickly</li>
            <li> This face serum smells great and left my face feeling silky smooth and soft,...</li>
            <li> face serum smells great and left my face feeling silky smooth and soft,...</li>
            <li> During these very, very hot and humid days of summer, this serum does not clog up my pores and does not feel sticky.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and is very soothing !</li>
            <li> From the very first application, the crust started to flake and he pulled it off.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think i can live without this serum :)</li>
            <li> I love that this is made with natural products!</li>
            <li> so I was pretty excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li> Also, I love that it is all natural and organic!</li>
            <li> This product is natural which was a very important reason I wanted my daughter to try the serum out.  </li>
            <li> I use my Fresh rosewater toner, then this, followed by lotions and creams.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had hit or miss success.  </li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients and lack of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients and lack of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> but so far I am pleased with the order described.  </li>
            <li> I use it day and night- the best part is that it dries and absorbs completely- after putting it on and letting it dry, your skin feels totally normal-  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t an effect you will see right away of course, this is something you will need to work towards.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> the way the company even emailed me after my order to insure I had the right way to use my product</li>
            <li> It seeps right into the skin with no greasy after effects.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good new serum to try, definitely pick this one up.</li>
            <li> I tried this for couple of weeks, it felt very moisture and absorbed in quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is almost clear, glides on smoothly, just a tiny bit is easy to distribute across my face, and it soaks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really lightweight and absorbs really quickly</li>
            <li> Any type of skin would be okay to use this since it&#x27;s melts right into your skin with just a sheer amount, leaving no oiliness what so ever yet leaves your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and soothing and therapeutic.</li>
            <li> Smooth, clean and non sticky, this honey product works super well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Adding some type of serum to your skin care regimen can help to hold in some of your skin’s natural moisture, prevent or reduce drying and help keep fine line and wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> I really like it!  </li>
            <li> I recently received an interesting serum to review from Joyal Beauty.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, it is anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral so it may also help kill some of the bacteria on your skin that can cause acne in the first place.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and I just like the thought that it has the antibiotic agents in it to take care of any pesky bacteria hanging around.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> They are placing their customer&#x27;s well being first over sales.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> So, if someone is reading my review, they know exactly what and how I am using the Joyal Beauty products together.  </li>
            <li> So, 3 weeks ago, when I first start using Joyal Beauty products, I did just that.</li>
            <li> But, just short 3 weeks trying this product improved my skin this much, I am very confident this products help improve my skin tone to where it should be in near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about Customer Services and their support?  </li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Joyal Beauty Timeless Renewal Serum.</li>
            <li> then my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen first hand the healing effects of this &amp;#34;Joyful (Joyal) serum.  </li>
            <li> At first thought I saw signs that it was clearing up my blackheads then</li>
            <li> Most serums seem to be just the same</li>
            <li> , Joyal has printed clearly on their label, they are free of these three classes of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I did not believe her review at the first time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It is also anti-inflammatory, so if you are like me and have easily flushed, red skin, this will help calm, soothe, and moisturize all in one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin was very sensitive and acne prone, glad to find out this natural organic product line to try.</li>
            <li> have combination skin (my forehead, nose being oily while the cheeks are more on the dry side).&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product, I used to have some breakouts time to time depending on the food I ate or my condition of that day; plus no matter what products I used, my skin always had some redness right below my nose and the area in between my brows.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for about two days</li>
            <li> This may sound like a typical scratch healing, but on newly derma-rolled delicate facial skin, the effects of this wonderful healing serum is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Being fair skinned and having lived in Southern California my entire life, my skin has received it&#x27;s share of abuse.</li>
            <li> Being fair skinned and having lived in Southern California my entire life, my skin has received it&#x27;s share of abuse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels good but after using up the whole bottle my skin didn&#x27;t feel moisturized or youthful and the serum itself is a bit plain like</li>
            <li> All positive effects.</li>
            <li> They package them correctly (brown bottle to diminish effects of sunlight exposure and pump which keeps out air as oxidation renders the ingredients less effective over time).  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry me out like most..</li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum vs  hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum-</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum-</li>
            <li> It is one of my new favorite serums to use daily!</li>
            <li> I don’t feel comfortable going out in public without some make up on my face.  </li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty Customer Service amazes me as much as their product line.  </li>
            <li> They are very reliable.  </li>
            <li> Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.  </li>

            <li> So when I read about the Joyal Renewal Serum I really thought it help me address some of my problems.</li>
            <li> So to get started I like that the serum comes in a pump so much easier to dispense.</li>
            <li> I received this serum to review and really like it.</li>
            <li> It has really cleared up my face</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast and as promised.</li>
            <li> Just over a two week period of time my crows feet have almost completely gone &amp; so have my laugh lines.  </li>
            <li> Even I spend lots of time to get rid of them, it was not work very well.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Liked this serum, but only lasted about a month using twice daily.</li>
            <li> (my pre-skin test is I apply new serum/creams on my neck first and if my skin doesn’t break out, I start using it)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different than other serums that I&#x27;ve tested before and that&#x27;s definitely a good thing.</li>
            <li> I have used other Joyal Beauty products and have been pleased with all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an organic/natural skincare nut because most over-the-counter and high-end salons are loaded with synthesized chemicals which are foreign to the body and, therefore, toxic.</li>
            <li> bottle is a larger than most size, with a pump instead of the usual dropped top application.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from these major ingredients, there are many other powerful compounds added that are known for optimal skin health and beauty.</li>
            <li> After doing a derma-rolling session, I accidentally scratched my face with my own nail and because my face was newly rolled, the scratch was really deep and very red.  </li>
            <li> Very surprised and happy when my product arrived broken  in pieces of glass.</li>
            <li> On the flip side the serum is also a collagen booster that will help with my fine lines &amp; dry skin.</li>
            <li> Also, I was interested in looking into serums (it&#x27;s never to early to start)</li>
            <li> The first one is 98% natural 5% HA+5% vitamin c+other anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The first one is 98% natural 5% HA+5% vitamin c+other anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It is a thick serum that is very easy to pump out exactly the amount you need.</li>
            <li> My daughter has tried many other acne treatments with the ultimate outcome being just as much acne on top of dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> , I noticed that my skin has more glow and evener tone than before, plus the biggest thing I realized was that I had less breakouts or whiteheads with this on.</li>
            <li> my face is softer, more even and less oily than before.</li>
            <li> Is a slight scent..not overwhelming at all</li>
            <li> My jowls look less pronounced and my face looks better.</li>
            <li> Royal Jelly has anti-bacterial potency which stops bacterial growth which is the main causes of acne.  </li>
            <li> particular serum has Vitamin E and C -</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are 98% Natural and 72% Organic and there isn&#x27;t any Parabens, Sulfates, Phthalates or Petrochemicals!!  </li>
            <li> Stop all my skin care items (which it did little to help anyway, but better than not using any).  </li>
            <li> Beauty&#x27;s Timeless Skin Renewal Serum comes into a very convenient pump bottle which makes it extremely easy to use without any mess.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer - Tiaki 100% natural day cream and Absolute Organic night cream for day and night&lt;</li>
            <li> , I look forward to seeing the results after using for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> , I look forward to seeing the results after using for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Left by itself to dry, my skin feels just a wee bit like it&#x27;s got a mask on it, so I apply a layer of a Moroccan oil (which is a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil) (this from another organic skincare line) on top of this.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin (blame it on living in the coal regions of Pennsylvania and for working in a factory full time for 2+ years)</li>
            <li> This Timeless Skin Renewal Serum that Joyal Beauty sent me to review for them is a product that is totally new to me</li>
            <li> I am new to honey bee products in a skin care system and new to Joyal products.</li>
            <li> It dried fast and it felt light on my face.</li>
            <li> It dried fast and it felt light on my face.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into my skin, I feel a little tightness at first</li>
            <li> Honey is very natural it adds moisture to my skin</li>
            <li> The dark brown coloring helps keep light out and preserve the quality of the serum.</li>
            <li> it is still too soon to say, but i like what i am seeing so far!</li>
            <li> After moving across the country to a much more dry and polluted area, my skin started breaking out and getting very dry.</li>
            <li> After all these years, I still get facial skin breakouts following stressful situations and after very hot, sweaty days of yard work.  </li>
            <li> I also wrote another review here for other 3 items (Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum ,  Retinol Correcting Serum,  Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But one I used most of it, it is hard to get the bottom serum out which is a huge waste.</li>
            <li> I recommend using it on clean, slightly damp skin followed by the Hyaluronic Acid serum and a moisturizer to finish.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, this serum helped clear up my skin</li>
            <li> You can also tell how natural it is by the smell.</li>
            <li> When I used this every morning my skin felt so soft and all the moisture felt locked in.</li>
            <li> and she has shown marked improvements with her bouts of acne.  </li>
            <li> So far, I like the serum.  </li>
            <li> Toxins age the skin and body which completely undermines any &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; ingredients that are in them.  </li>
            <li> They ship them well and early.  </li>
            <li> have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am amazed just short time, my skin tone improved so much.  </li>
            <li> Royal jelly and propolis preserve and restore proteins and enzymes for anti-aging action.</li>
            <li> It’s gentle enough to use it around eye</li>

            <li> It’s gentle enough to use it around eye</li>
            <li> skin is soft and never tired-looking.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 days, I could no longer see the scratch, and with in a week it was completely healed.  </li>
            <li> I like natural product and this is one I do prefer over some I have used before.</li>
            <li> wow that</li>
            <li> This would work well under makeup since it absorbs completely into your skin without leaving any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But stopped using the all purpose cream and the bumps never went away until I stopped using this completely.  </li>
            <li> This would work well under makeup since it absorbs completely into your skin without leaving any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I want to give my skin a nourshing and natural break from actives, I use this.</li>
            <li> suits the sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> Now they are soft.</li>
            <li> stopped everything from above all together for two weeks, I had to use wet, cool towel on my face two times a day for a week, I used only sweet almond oil mixed with tea tree oil during night, and sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that Royal Jelly is such a powerful facial serum.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy raw honey and honey products from a local beekeeper and some of the top selling products she sold besides the honey itself, was Royal Jelly and Bee Propolis,</li>

            <li> I purchased a second bottle for my husband and me to use but passed that one on to my older daughter when she came home.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to all of my female readers.</li>
            <li> It seemed to calm down my face.</li>
            <li> I was sent out a new bottle at no extra charge or hesitation.</li>
            <li> I try new products, I stop using everything I used prior to new skin care, so I know the results that I am getting is what I am using currently.  </li>
            <li> My skin breakout easily, but heals slowly.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other serum and creams made with more concentrated manuka honey and propolis from other brands and they do deliver anti-aging effects and I finally stopped using this serum.</li>
            <li> These are common chemical classes the cosmetic industry can use without specifically calling out on an ingredient line, or they do call out the chemical and because the classes are so huge</li>
            <li> The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients.</li>
            <li> The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients.</li>
            <li> If pimples breaks out, there are more than 10 pimples on my chins but very small or there are only one or two pimples on my cheeks but very big and hurt when I touch it.</li>
            <li> I am usually put some kind of make up to cover uneven skin, even if it is just short distance to the store to pick up something.  </li>
            <li> the third day, my face started to itchy again, red, swollen and then pilling all over again, I had to stop everything again for about two weeks to let my face calm down.</li>
            <li> My daughter has acne problems which we have searched high and low for different treatments that won&#x27;t over dry her skin.</li>
            <li> although as I&#x27;m getting older I&#x27;m noticing my skin is getting a little dryer.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to wait long before moving to the next step of your routine.  </li>
            <li> It is a little hard to describe, but it feels like it leaves a smooth glaze finish on my face.  </li>
            <li> I usually put this under my eyes, so I decided to apply this serum directly to the deep, red scratch.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I question is its long term effects - I mean does it really have a long term impact on it, or its just a temporary feeling it gives.</li>
            <li> water and witch hazel made my sensitive skin somewhat tight and dry.</li>
            <li> As I simplify my skin care routine and get rid of excess, I know this will be one I will keep as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> Dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> not greasy, sticky, or dry.</li>
            <li> Since I have somewhat dry skin</li>
            <li> Since I have somewhat dry skin</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a serum that isn&#x27;t like other serums!</li>
            <li> The little tiny lines around my eyes appear to be reducing in size.  </li>
            <li> Because of this problem, I have to be careful what I am putting on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely not greasy or heavy or cloying.  </li>
            <li> In the few short weeks I have been using Joyal Beauty Timeless Skin Renewal Serum</li>
            <li> and I will buy again after this serum empty.</li>
            <li> Apply small amount of serum to your face twice daily after cleansing and toning.</li>
            <li> It goes away but it smells weird when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount of the serum to use on your face.  </li>
            <li> The serum itself is thicker than other serums I have used.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t go over all the included ingredients since other reviewers have already mentioned them</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t go over all the included ingredients since other reviewers have already mentioned them</li>
            <li> I use it around my eyes and on my forehead as I don&#x27;t like the greasiness of some other serums.</li>
            <li> The company called me a couple of hours after I placed my order to confirm my address - extremely efficient and polite woman.</li>
            <li> This serum is definitely active-</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s elbows had a hard white crust on them for at least ten years.</li>
            <li> If you are in your late twenties and above.</li>
            <li> This serum is a little thicker than other serums I have used.  </li>
            <li> It says on the bottle, anti-bacterial, maybe that&#x27;s why I got way less</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found this to help a lot with razor burn; I have a lot less rash around my neck.</li>
            <li> I like this serum, makes my skin feel tight and radiant after I put it on.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my skin but it does leave my skin feeling a little tight</li>
            <li> The redness that comes with these little friends has toned downed a lot as well.  </li>
            <li> Been using for a little over a week</li>
            <li> bottle arrived sealed with a green label and contained 1 oz/ 30 ml.</li>
            <li> She has been using the serum for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> They have a few products that I didn’t know the difference and how to use it all together.  </li>
            <li> She said, she did not get any trouble on her face at all</li>
            <li> and I got some trouble on my faces.</li>
            <li> this time, I used the serum during the period, and there is only one pimple broke out on my cheek and very very small and it removed in two days!</li>
            <li> My skin tone is very uneven (Patches of discoloration) from previous breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I’ve tried countless bottles of expensive creams/serums recommended by doctors, but it ended up just waste of money, effort and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’ve used ½ oz creams/serums that cost over $200.00 in the past and it did very little to help my skin.  </li>

            <li> Not a winning combination if you ask me.  </li>
            <li> In a month, I&#x27;ve had one small blemish dare to show up, and it never &amp;#34;blossomed&amp;#34; and was gone in two days.  </li>
            <li> I have heard in the past about the benefits of Royal Jelly</li>
            <li> so I was anxious to try for myself.</li>
            <li> started getting small bumps all over my face.  </li>
            <li> There are not many skin care products I try and see immediate results, but it happened with this serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because usually during the period, my skin was got lots of troubles like pimples breaks out on my cheeks, chins and forehead.</li>
            <li> this is the only thing that is helping it against those harsh cold winds</li>
            <li> I noticed that my face feels softer and not so dull looking.  </li>
            <li> she had a hard time keeping it in stock.</li>
            <li> she had a hard time keeping it in stock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Timeless Skin Renewal Serum for a month now--in the morning after I&#x27;ve washed my face and applied my witch hazel toner, and again in late afternoon when the day&#x27;s work is done.  </li>
            <li> There is a complex mixture of herb and plant extracts in this serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin and decided was too expensive to buy monthly on my tight budget.</li>
            <li> This cold weather has my face a wreck.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> Disappointed to need to use a moisturizer, after its use.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> Great consistency! I love this product and I love the ingredients... Super nice people to give my business to! I can feel a definite difference..</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s affordable yet makes my skin softer, more hydrated! I recommended this to my sister because I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin (my forehead, nose being oily while the cheeks are more on the dry side).&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product, I used to have some breakouts time to time depending on the food I ate or my condition of that day; plus no matter what products I used, my skin always had some redness right below my nose and the area in between my brows.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for about two days, I noticed that my skin has more glow and evener tone than before, plus the biggest thing I realized was that I had less breakouts or whiteheads with this on. It says on the bottle, anti-bacterial, maybe that&#x27;s why I got way less breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone. Any type of skin would be okay to use this since it&#x27;s melts right into your skin with just a sheer amount, leaving no oiliness what so ever yet leaves your skin hydrated. I use my Fresh rosewater toner, then this, followed by lotions and creams.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think i can live without this serum :)</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 bottles of Joyal Beautiful products around Christmas time of 2014, 2 bottles of HA serum, 1 vitamin C serum and 1 Royal Jelly serum. For the first two month, I used vitamin C serum and HA serum, I was really happy with the results, you can see my reviews for vitamin C and HA serums. I started using the Royal Jelly serum around beginning of March when my vitamin C bottle was finished. Within a week, my face started to itchy, red, swollen (especially around my eyes), then my skin was pilling...At the time I didn&#x27;t know which product caused the problem, here is my daily regime:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cleaning - Dr. Bronners magic soap&lt;br /&gt;2. Toner - Thayers Alcohol-Free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner&lt;br /&gt;3. HA serum - Joyal Beauty&lt;br /&gt;4. Royal Jelly serum - Joyal Beauty&lt;br /&gt;5. Moisturizer - Tiaki 100% natural day cream and Absolute Organic night cream for day and night&lt;br /&gt;I stopped everything from above all together for two weeks, I had to use wet, cool towel on my face two times a day for a week, I used only sweet almond oil mixed with tea tree oil during night, and sunscreen during the day. It seemed to calm down my face. I really loved the results of using those serums, I wanted to go back to my regime, so I decided to try one by one, I started with the Royal Jelly, followed by moisturizer, the third day, my face started to itchy again, red, swollen and then pilling all over again, I had to stop everything again for about two weeks to let my face calm down. By now I realized that it must be the Royal Jelly serum caused my problem, I really love its ingredients, it&#x27;s too bad my skin couldn&#x27;t tolerate and couldn&#x27;t benefit from it.</li>
            <li> my pore size def. seems smaller</li>
            <li> I have already noticed a difference in my skin since I have started using this serum.  It goes on easy and a little goes a long way.  Based on what I am seeing now, I will be a repeat buyer</li>
            <li> This is great! I love that I&#x27;m familiar with all of the ingredients and there&#x27;s no bad chemicals. You can also tell how natural it is by the smell. It didn&#x27;t smell chemically or processed at all. I am happy that I was able to try this for review.</li>
            <li> This serum is a little thicker than other serums I have used.  I really like it!  It is a little hard to describe, but it feels like it leaves a smooth glaze finish on my face.  It makes for a very smooth foundation for applying make up.  Since receiving this product for review, I have used it morning and evening.  I use it after my toner.  I have used other Joyal Beauty products and have been pleased with all.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Arrived on time.  Will be ordering again.  I noticed this is in my husbands name.</li>
            <li> I recently received an interesting serum to review from Joyal Beauty. I have tried numerous serums, but never a serum made with bee products! Joyal Beauty Timeless Skin Renewal Serum is made with Royal Jelly Honey and Bee Propolis.&lt;br /&gt;These ingredients are perfect for cell and skin renewal. When I used this every morning my skin felt so soft and all the moisture felt locked in. I love that this is made with natural products! It is one of my new favorite serums to use daily! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a serum that isn&#x27;t like other serums!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It has a jelly consistency but it&#x27;s not the slightest but sticky. It soaks into your skin very, very quickly. I use 3-4 pumps for my face. It feels good.</li>
            <li> I recently added Joyal Beauty - Timeless Skin Renewal Serum into my beauty regimen. I suffer from dry skin (blame it on living in the coal regions of Pennsylvania and for working in a factory full time for 2+ years) so I was extremely excited for the opportunity to try this product. Also, I was interested in looking into serums (it&#x27;s never to early to start) since my 30th birthday is next month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Beauty&#x27;s Timeless Skin Renewal Serum comes into a very convenient pump bottle which makes it extremely easy to use without any mess. The directions are very easy to follow as well: Apply small amount of serum to your face twice daily after cleansing and toning. Then follow with moisturizer. It does not leave any residue on your face and almost immediately after applying you can&#x27;t even feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to all of my female readers. The ingredients are 98% Natural and 72% Organic and there isn&#x27;t any Parabens, Sulfates, Phthalates or Petrochemicals!!  And this product was NOT tested on animals!!</li>
            <li> It is very effective at keeping my skin moist this dry winter season. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell. It goes away but it smells weird when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> AMAZING I FEEL MY FACE IS MORE FRESH AND HEALTHY</li>
            <li> This is a really nice serum for anti-aging and for skin renewal. It feels nice on the skin, it&#x27;s light and absorbs well. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this serum because I have heard a lot about Royal Jelly before, but never in Skincare! If you aren&#x27;t familiar with Royal Jelly, it is what bees produce to feed larvae that may someday become their Queen Bee. Fascinating stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this serum is the #1 best seller for a Royal Jelly product for the face. The way they extract it is cruelty free and what they use in the serum is 72% organic. Even though it is called a jelly, it is not the consistency of a gel and it will not clog your pores. It is non-comedogenic. As a matter of fact, it is anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral so it may also help kill some of the bacteria on your skin that can cause acne in the first place. It is also anti-inflammatory, so if you are like me and have easily flushed, red skin, this will help calm, soothe, and moisturize all in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a great toner and helps tighten skin that is beginning to sag, like around the jowls or jaw line. This isn&#x27;t an effect you will see right away of course, this is something you will need to work towards. But it will provide a nice smooth canvas before you apply make up to help you get that flawless finish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle arrived sealed with a green label and contained 1 oz/ 30 ml. The dark brown coloring helps keep light out and preserve the quality of the serum. It contains no parabens or sulfates.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly and I&#x27;m really noticing my skin loops more Dewey and hydrated</li>
            <li> I had no idea that Royal Jelly is such a powerful facial serum.  My daughter has acne problems which we have searched high and low for different treatments that won&#x27;t over dry her skin. Royal Jelly has anti-bacterial potency which stops bacterial growth which is the main causes of acne.  This product is natural which was a very important reason I wanted my daughter to try the serum out.  She has been using the serum for a few weeks now and she has shown marked improvements with her bouts of acne.  The redness that comes with these little friends has toned downed a lot as well.  Another wonderful bonus of using this product to treat acne is that it hasn&#x27;t caused the facial skin to become flaky. My daughter has tried many other acne treatments with the ultimate outcome being just as much acne on top of dry flaky skin.  Not a winning combination if you ask me.  I would defiantly recommend this product to friends and family.  Joyal is a great company that makes quality products right here in the USA and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> This Timeless Skin Renewal Serum that Joyal Beauty sent me to review for them is a product that is totally new to me so I was pretty excited to try it out.  Plus, I have already tried their Hyaluronic Acid Serum and loved that!&lt;br /&gt;I apply this serum in the morning to my face, neck &amp; decollete. It&#x27;s really lightweight and absorbs really quickly so it&#x27;s prefect to wear under makeup.  You can even follow it up with your favorite moisturizer if needed.  It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and I just like the thought that it has the antibiotic agents in it to take care of any pesky bacteria hanging around.&lt;br /&gt;This is one product that I am going to be adding to my Must Have list because I had great results with it and it tackles so many skin issues all at once!</li>
            <li> This cold weather has my face a wreck. this is the only thing that is helping it against those harsh cold winds</li>
            <li> Great quality product! Will definitely purchase again from this seller.</li>
            <li> This is great product.  its smell is very refreshing.  However, it&#x27;s not for everyone, especially if you have oily, acne prone, and clog prone skin. As such, one star off.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It feels great on the face and seems to be helping with fine lines</li>
            <li> So far, I like the serum.  The customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li> The best serum I have ever used- EVER! Leaves face like baby bottom. Diminishes fine lines. holds your make up  all day long/ Loving it so much. Leaves your face brighter, cleaner, &amp; younger!</li>
            <li> Very easy to put on and quickly absorbed. Most product will leave my skin look shinning, but not this one. I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of weeks. So I can&#x27;t say it has given me significant results, but I love how it feels on my skin and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Dry out the skin. Doesn&#x27;t blend with the moisturizer or the treatment oil. I was mislead by the ratings and the reviews.</li>
            <li> Been using for a little over a week and I love the way my face feels.  Its smooth and my acne is clearing up. Update best product I own for my face. Almost clears it up overnight.</li>
            <li> REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company has done a fine job of letting people who are allergic to bees not to use this product.  They are placing their customer&#x27;s well being first over sales.  Bravo to the company.  I noticed that my face feels softer and not so dull looking.  The little tiny lines around my eyes appear to be reducing in size.  It only takes a small amount of the serum to use on your face.  My face has a silkiness to it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s taking away some of that aging that we all go through.  Wonderful  product.  Wonderful company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample bottle of TIMELESS SKIN RENEWAL SERUM from Joyal Beauty for my view of the product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Even my husband tried it and loves it. Very surprised and happy when my product arrived broken  in pieces of glass. I was sent out a new bottle at no extra charge or hesitation. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE pure hive products, and this is no exception.  It is the third layer of my skincare routine.  Left by itself to dry, my skin feels just a wee bit like it&#x27;s got a mask on it, so I apply a layer of a Moroccan oil (which is a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil) (this from another organic skincare line) on top of this.  My skin loves these products.  I haven&#x27;t been this hydrated in years, and it&#x27;s all good ingredients.  I&#x27;m an organic/natural skincare nut because most over-the-counter and high-end salons are loaded with synthesized chemicals which are foreign to the body and, therefore, toxic. Toxins age the skin and body which completely undermines any &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; ingredients that are in them.  Not so with this company.  They provide detailed instructions upon purchase so you know how to make the most out of their products.  They package them correctly (brown bottle to diminish effects of sunlight exposure and pump which keeps out air as oxidation renders the ingredients less effective over time).  They ship them well and early.  I&#x27;ve been doing the synthesized-chemical-free search for some years now.  I&#x27;ve had hit or miss success.  However, I am quite sold on these products and have been a repeat customer for some months now with no end in sight.</li>
            <li> Excellent product makes a big different in skin tone and decrease appearance of fine wrinkles . It&#x27;s my second bottle and recommend this product to everyone. Nice texture doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily at all.</li>
            <li> Skin actually smiles and shines after each usage.Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I am writing this review on 3 Joyal Beauty products. (Kojic acid, royal jelly serum, hyaluronic acid 3% )  Since I am using these products together, I feel this review should be posted on all items that I am using.  So, if someone is reading my review, they know exactly what and how I am using the Joyal Beauty products together.  I also wrote another review here for other 3 items (Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum ,  Retinol Correcting Serum,  Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin and I can’t just pick up facial products and start using it without pre-skin test.  My skin breakout easily, but heals slowly.  Because of this problem, I have to be careful what I am putting on my face.  My skin tone is very uneven (Patches of discoloration) from previous breakouts.  I have multiple visits to Skin care clinics run by dermatologist.  I’ve tried countless bottles of expensive creams/serums recommended by doctors, but it ended up just waste of money, effort and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I want to share my experience using Joyal Beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I try new products, I stop using everything I used prior to new skin care, so I know the results that I am getting is what I am using currently.  So, 3 weeks ago, when I first start using Joyal Beauty products, I did just that. Stop all my skin care items (which it did little to help anyway, but better than not using any).  Then, I did my pre-skin test on Joyal Beauty Products. (my pre-skin test is I apply new serum/creams on my neck first and if my skin doesn’t break out, I start using it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, does Joyal Beauty help my skin as advertised?  Yes, it sure did!  I am usually put some kind of make up to cover uneven skin, even if it is just short distance to the store to pick up something.  I don’t feel comfortable going out in public without some make up on my face.  This is 3rd weeks using Joyal Beauty products.  I am amazed just short time, my skin tone improved so much.  It improved my skin tone so much in such a short period of time, I actually went out shopping without putting any makeup.  I wish I had taken pictures before I started on Joyal products.  I still have spots of discoloration, but it is fading.  These scares/bruises didn’t get there overnight, so I don’t expect it to be disappeared overnight.  But, just short 3 weeks trying this product improved my skin this much, I am very confident this products help improve my skin tone to where it should be in near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about Customer Services and their support?  Joyal Beauty Customer Service amazes me as much as their product line.  It’s refreshing to know company who develop and sells product is ready to help you.  They are very reliable.  So, if you have any questions at all, I am sure you’ll get answers from them without the delay.  They have a few products that I didn’t know the difference and how to use it all together.  So, I sent email and I got my answers right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I asked and their reply to my questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My questions:  Please let me know the difference between these products.&lt;br /&gt;1) Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum vs  Kojic acid&lt;br /&gt;2) Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum. vs  royal jelly serum&lt;br /&gt;3) Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum vs  hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Beauty Team replied:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are our organic anti-aging serum line and they have some similar functions.&lt;br /&gt;Both vitamin c and kojic acid have brightening functions. Age defy serum(kojic acid+AHA+BHA) also has exfoliating effect and it can be used at night. Vitamin c serum, you can use it Am and Pm, but best used at Am to utilize vitamin C’s sun-protecting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol serum(vitamin A) should be used only at night. Royal jelly serum is a bee product (contains organic honey,royal jelly,propolis) Royal jelly and propolis preserve and restore proteins and enzymes for anti-aging action. You may search &amp;#34; royal jelly, skin, benefit&amp;#34; to learn more info. It can be used at Am and Pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We designed 2 different HA serums. The first one is 98% natural 5% HA+5% vitamin c+other anti-aging ingredients.  The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients. Why? because some people might be allergic to some ingredients such as jojoba oil, and the original one is oil-free and best for those oily skin or sensitive skin types. One of our customers who has the hypersensitive skin told us this is the only skincare product she can apply to her eye area and does not stimulate her eyes. 3%HA has the thinner texture compared with 5% HA so its absorption is better.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This information (reply from Joyal Beauty Team) help me to know the best way for me to apply different products, so here is how I use at AM and PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My AM Skin Care:&lt;br /&gt;• Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.

            <li> After all these years, I still get facial skin breakouts following stressful situations and after very hot, sweaty days of yard work.  I&#x27;ve been using this Timeless Skin Renewal Serum for a month now--in the morning after I&#x27;ve washed my face and applied my witch hazel toner, and again in late afternoon when the day&#x27;s work is done.  In a month, I&#x27;ve had one small blemish dare to show up, and it never &amp;#34;blossomed&amp;#34; and was gone in two days.  That is proof enough for me!  I am enjoying the results of this serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is almost clear, glides on smoothly, just a tiny bit is easy to distribute across my face, and it soaks in very quickly.  It is definitely not greasy or heavy or cloying.  I don&#x27;t even notice that it is there on my skin, because it soaks in so well.  It does have a wonderful, gentle fragrance--when I breathe it in, I can almost picture the bees buzzing in the flower beds.  It is sort of a &amp;#34;joyful&amp;#34;, mixed up floral fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is soft and never tired-looking.  During these very, very hot and humid days of summer, this serum does not clog up my pores and does not feel sticky.  My face can sweat freely through the serum--and I think that is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Joyal Beauty.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Joyal Beauty Timeless Renewal Serum. I was so excited to try the serum because it is enriched with Royal Jelly, Honey &amp; Bee Propolis. I have heard in the past about the benefits of Royal Jelly so I was anxious to try for myself. So when I read about the Joyal Renewal Serum I really thought it help me address some of my problems. I&#x27;m at that in between age (I&#x27;m 45) where I have some fine lines &amp; I have somewhat combination skin. I have some oilness on my nose and chin although as I&#x27;m getting older I&#x27;m noticing my skin is getting a little dryer. So to get started I like that the serum comes in a pump so much easier to dispense. The serum itself is thicker than other serums I have used. It takes a couple of pumps to cover my face &amp; neck. The serum has a pleasant smell and is a little sticky which most serums are. It absorbs quickly into my skin, I feel a little tightness at first but it goes away very shortly then my skin feels soft and smooth. I use the serum morning and evening as part of my regular skin care routine. I love the fact that this serum is anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-acne, and anti-inflammatory. That will help with my oily skin and occasional break outs. On the flip side the serum is also a collagen booster that will help with my fine lines &amp; dry skin. I love the fact that Joyal Serum is 72% Organic, Non-comedogenic and cruelty-free. In the few short weeks I have been using Joyal Beauty Timeless Skin Renewal Serum my face is softer, more even and less oily than before. I would definitely recommend this wonderful serum. I receive this product for testing purpose and unbiased evaluation.</li>
            <li> So far, a good product. It leaves the face sticky for a bit but then it dries off. I recommend using a very good moisturizer after applying it.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing and packed with many of the bee products known by ancient women for skin perfection. I was sent this product by the company for review and have utterly loved it. It&#x27;s light in both color and consistency and leaves no stickiness or tackiness when applied. The top 3 ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee Propolis: Known and nature&#x27;s penicillin. Disinfects, Cleans and seals in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Royal Jelly:contains minerals like silicon that lead to increased collagen production.  It also contains specific anti-oxidants and nutrients that support skin renewal such as flavonoids, nucleic acid, decanoic acid, enzymes, and hormones. Numerous vitamins and minerals such as B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, acetyl-choline and zinc can be found in royal jelly which are excellent for skin health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honey: It&#x27;s chemical properties that can speed healing and prevent infection. It also keeps moisture close to the skin, which can help your complexion become supple and glowing. Additionally, it moisturizes skin since it&#x27;s a humectant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from these major ingredients, there are many other powerful compounds added that are known for optimal skin health and beauty. I recommend using it on clean, slightly damp skin followed by the Hyaluronic Acid serum and a moisturizer to finish.</li>
            <li> My skin is much better</li>
            <li> This is a great serum.  I now have all of them.  I switched them up.  Giving me really great results.</li>
            <li> After doing a derma-rolling session, I accidentally scratched my face with my own nail and because my face was newly rolled, the scratch was really deep and very red.  I usually put this under my eyes, so I decided to apply this serum directly to the deep, red scratch.  Within 2 days, I could no longer see the scratch, and with in a week it was completely healed.  This may sound like a typical scratch healing, but on newly derma-rolled delicate facial skin, the effects of this wonderful healing serum is amazing.  I&#x27;ve seen first hand the healing effects of this &amp;#34;Joyful (Joyal) serum.  I will always keep this in stock at my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a larger than most size, with a pump instead of the usual dropped top application.  The serum goes on cool like a jelly, then absorbs into the skin within seconds.  You start feeling the healing effects immediately.  No stingling, no burning.  All positive effects.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic. It&#x27;s totally smoothed out and transformed my skin&#x27;s texture. I use it day and night- the best part is that it dries and absorbs completely- after putting it on and letting it dry, your skin feels totally normal-  not greasy, sticky, or dry. Honestly, magic!</li>
            <li> The best skin serum I have ever used! As I simplify my skin care routine and get rid of excess, I know this will be one I will keep as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> The Joyal beauty Timeless skin Renewal serum  is enriched withRoyal jelly ,Honey and Bee propolis ( do take caution if allergic to bees ) I used the product 2 weeks and it works so well my skin is softer and the pores are tighter the bee properties contain minerals like silicon and that will lead to more collegen production at 55 it is what I needed ! I like natural product and this is one I do prefer over some I have used before. Honey is very natural it adds moisture to my skin and I love that .&lt;br /&gt;  The Serum is a nice light scent which I like a lot. Goes on smooth and is very soothing ! I&#x27;m so impressed with the way my skin feels now and even looks a bit younger wow that great&lt;br /&gt;  Always follow the instruction for use on the bottle .By the way the company even emailed me after my order to insure I had the right way to use my product .Disclaimer I did recieve this product at no cost to use and review with my honest opinion 5 stars</li>
            <li> Love this serum. Works great. Best face serum I have tried in a long time. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like this serum, makes my skin feel tight and radiant after I put it on. The only thing I question is its long term effects - I mean does it really have a long term impact on it, or its just a temporary feeling it gives. I might try</li>
            <li> Love this product I suffer from dermatitis on my face so I used this product for it&#x27;s anti fungal properties. I seen a change in my skin after 2 weeks. I felt a tightening of my skin and saw a diminished look of wrinkles. My skin became smooth and bright.I washed my face with a calming facial wash used a cranberry facial toner and then I applied the Joyal serum to my face not rubbing  it in but patting my face with the serum next I would apply my facial moisturizer. Love it</li>
            <li> so far so good with this product. it is still too soon to say, but i like what i am seeing so far!</li>
            <li> this is a great product, and good customer service.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this face serum! After moving across the country to a much more dry and polluted area, my skin started breaking out and getting very dry. Thankfully, this serum helped clear up my skin and it&#x27;s now more beautiful than ever. My skin feels smooth and looks a lot more even-toned. Also, I love that it is all natural and organic! You can&#x27;t get any better than that :)</li>
            <li> Just began using.  Disappointed to need to use a moisturizer, after its use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in tone,moisturizing,brightening or even puffiness.</li>
            <li> This face serum smells great and left my face feeling silky smooth and soft,... it has a nice, light scent. I love the natural ingredients and lack of harmful chemicals. I used to buy raw honey and honey products from a local beekeeper and some of the top selling products she sold besides the honey itself, was Royal Jelly and Bee Propolis,...she had a hard time keeping it in stock. However you do need to make sure you don&#x27;t have any allergies to bees or bee produced products before using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go over all the included ingredients since other reviewers have already mentioned them, however I will mention how nice this made my skin feel. After washing my face I smoothed some onto my face and let it soak in. It dried fast and it felt light on my face. Since I have somewhat dry skin I followed up with a light moisturizer. This would work well under makeup since it absorbs completely into your skin without leaving any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful face serum that really is good for your skin. It has a pump type dispenser cap which makes it easy to dispense. This has the consistency of hand sanitizer. Being fair skinned and having lived in Southern California my entire life, my skin has received it&#x27;s share of abuse. This face serum feels great, I look forward to seeing the results after using for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing serum I have ever used! Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It is really good! But one I used most of it, it is hard to get the bottom serum out which is a huge waste.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Will reorder</li>
            <li> This serum is definitely active- I found that on the areas applied, it created a light peel effect.  Great for skin renewal, but since I purchased it with more of a revitalization effect that included moisture (around the eye area), I found this product to be too drying.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use it on areas where I need to see some resurfacing, and I think it&#x27;ll do a good job of that.</li>
            <li> At first thought I saw signs that it was clearing up my blackheads then started getting small bumps all over my face.  Clogged pores, disclaimer that I was using in conjuction with Egyptian Magic all purpose cream.  But stopped using the all purpose cream and the bumps never went away until I stopped using this completely.  Went away on a trip for 5 days, didn&#x27;t bring either product and my skin cleared up.  No way of knowing which product it was that caused the clogged pores but I did have periods of isolated usage, to no avail.</li>
            <li> They sent me the serum for free for reviewing purposes. I couldn´t be happier that they´ve sent it to me! I´m 40 years oled and my skin never looked more beautiful! This serum has hyaluronic acid, 20% vitamin C (which is a lot!), ferulic acid, witch hazel and Vitamin E. Couldn´t be more antioxidant!&lt;br /&gt;Is organic and the best thing is not tested on animals! That for me is a must. I love animals and noone who tests on animals will have a good review from me. Even if the product works great!&lt;br /&gt;Going back to my skin, I´ve been using the serum for a couple of weeks now and eventhough is not enough time, I´ve seen changes on my skin! It looks smoother, plumper, and brighter! The serum has a scent carachteristic from vitamin C serums, I don´t mind it at all. Is a slight scent..not overwhelming at all and I happen to like it! So if you are thinking about getting a vitamin C serum which is organic, doesn´t test in animals and vegan, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> Smooth, clean and non sticky, this honey product works super well on dry skin. It&#x27;s so hydrating, that you wont need any cream too go along. And what&#x27;s the buying experience good, is that the seller is a number one salesman&#x27;s. You don&#x27;t have too worry about the usage of the product, the company is their for you.</li>
            <li> Great serum for skin that needs soothing.  Red spots are calmed and skin feels prepped for makeup application.  It also dries rather quickly so you don&#x27;t need to wait long before moving to the next step of your routine.  I think this worked great with my anti-acne routine that I have been using and would recommend it to people who have sensitive skin from acne products they are using</li>
            <li> I’ve had the chance to try several different facial serums. The consistency on this one is gel like. It is a thick serum that is very easy to pump out exactly the amount you need. It does not irritate my skin but it does leave my skin feeling a little tight so I prefer to apply a moisturizer after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an awesome list of ingredients including honey, bee pollen, Royal Jelly, Melissa Essential Oil, Aloe Vera and MSM. It does not contain Parabens, Sulfates, Phthalates or Phenoxyethanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great skin care product this is worth considering.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with Royal Jelly.I strong recommend for everyone</li>
            <li> Liked this serum, but only lasted about a month using twice daily. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin and decided was too expensive to buy monthly on my tight budget.</li>
            <li> I had to edit my review since the serum felt good and soothing at first, but the royal jelly/propolis which is one of the most important ingridient  in this serum is listed on the 12th out of 15 ingredients as one of the other reviewer mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;It feels good but after using up the whole bottle my skin didn&#x27;t feel moisturized or youthful and the serum itself is a bit plain like water and witch hazel made my sensitive skin somewhat tight and dry. I&#x27;ve been using other serum and creams made with more concentrated manuka honey and propolis from other brands and they do deliver anti-aging effects and I finally stopped using this serum.</li>
            <li> Sample provided for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face serum smells great and left my face feeling silky smooth and soft,... it has a nice, light scent. I love the natural ingredients and lack of harmful chemicals. I used to buy raw honey and honey products from a local beekeeper and some of the top selling products she sold, besides the honey itself, was Royal Jelly and Bee Propolis,...she had a hard time keeping it in stock. However you do need to make sure you don&#x27;t have any allergies to bees or bee produced products before using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go over all the included ingredients since other reviewers have already mentioned them, however I will mention how nice this made my skin feel. After washing my face I smoothed some onto my face and let it soak in. It dried fast and it felt light on my face. Since I have somewhat dry skin I followed up with a light moisturizer. This would work well under makeup since it absorbs completely into your skin without leaving any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful face serum that really is good for your skin. It has a pump type dispenser cap which makes it easy to dispense. This has the consistency of hand sanitizer. Being fair skinned and having lived in Southern California my entire life, my skin has received it&#x27;s share of abuse. This face serum feels great, I look forward to seeing the results after using for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Amazing serum...&lt;br /&gt;Feels really good an  doesn&#x27;t dry me out like most..&lt;br /&gt;Excellent.. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I received this serum to review and really like it. It&#x27;s different than other serums that I&#x27;ve tested before and that&#x27;s definitely a good thing. Most serums seem to be just the same but this one has tons of awesome ingredients in it. It has really cleared up my face and I will definitely continue using it. If you&#x27;re looking for a good new serum to try, definitely pick this one up. It smells kind of like tea!</li>
            <li> Joyal has four different serums that are similar. This serum has a gel like consistency that is easy to apply. It has virtually no odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important label claim to look for with cosmetics is paraben, sulfate, and phthalate free. These are common chemical classes the cosmetic industry can use without specifically calling out on an ingredient line, or they do call out the chemical and because the classes are so huge, a consumer can never figure out one of these three are in the cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great news, Joyal has printed clearly on their label, they are free of these three classes of chemicals. That&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular serum has Vitamin E and C - both shown to be excellent for skin health. And it contains hyaluronic acid; a compound shown to improve collagen development in skin cells (makes cells fatter so wrinkles disappear). These are all wonderful things to have in a skin treatment. There is a complex mixture of herb and plant extracts in this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply this after you have exfoliated or cleaned your skin. Then apply a moisturizer. For men, that&#x27;s about all you need to do. For women, it is best to apply at night; makeup tends to flake off if use this in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found this to help a lot with razor burn; I have a lot less rash around my neck. My skin feels smooth after applying this. It works well on tender areas. My wife&#x27;s skin glows more than it ever did. She wears less makeup and looks wonderful. It has softened her skin a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> I am new to honey bee products in a skin care system and new to Joyal products. I must say I am pretty darned impressed. There are not many skin care products I try and see immediate results, but it happened with this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture and scent were all great, but the reason I gave this serum 5 stars is very simple ... it absorbed quickly and easily into my skin and I swear there was a &amp;#34;moisture glow&amp;#34; to my skin after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was radiant! I am now a fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Beauty supplied this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> Lovely light product, yet powerfully effective! I use it around my eyes and on my forehead as I don&#x27;t like the greasiness of some other serums. The company called me a couple of hours after I placed my order to confirm my address - extremely efficient and polite woman. I will buy this product again</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast and as promised. I tried this for couple of weeks, it felt very moisture and absorbed in quickly. Combined with hyaluronic serum the moisture was kept day and night. My skin was very sensitive and acne prone, glad to find out this natural organic product line to try. Wish Joyal Beauty could promote sales to Canada in the future.</li>
            <li> I used it for a while but it didnt do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and soothing and therapeutic. When I want to give my skin a nourshing and natural break from actives, I use this. Will always keep some in my cabinet! I have used Egyptian Magic and it&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s too greasy for me as a moisturizer. I like the Acure day moisturizer the most. I put this underneath and I get all the goodness of honey without the grease.</li>
            <li> This serum was delivered promptly to me in perfect packaging. Even though I&#x27;ve been using it for only a short time, I can already feel a difference...softer and smoother skin. I will definitely order it again! Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. suits the sensitive skin too. Adding some type of serum to your skin care regimen can help to hold in some of your skin’s natural moisture, prevent or reduce drying and help keep fine line and wrinkles at bay.This product is a great value for money. If you are in your late twenties and above. Include this product in your skincare routine</li>
            <li> Have purchased three of the Joyal Beauty products &amp; have been very pleased with all of them.  The hyaluronic acid is magnificent.  It seeps right into the skin with no greasy after effects.  The Royal Jelly Serum is really awesome.  It goes onto my skin with a light silky feeling leaving it smooth, greaseless, &amp; silky to the touch.  The Retininol is the last product purchased &amp; it is also a great product.  Just over a two week period of time my crows feet have almost completely gone &amp; so have my laugh lines.  This trio of products has been wonderful.......they do what is promised &amp; I recommend them to everyone.  Sometimes I am not sure which product to use first but so far I am pleased with the order described.  Also, it would be nice to have a moisturizer made by you guys to complete the process.  GREAT PRODUCT..GREAT RESULTS!!!!!!!!  Now lets see them on sale soon!!!!!</li>
            <li> love love love this serum</li>
            <li> This is the BEST! I purchased a bottle and used it at night before applying anti-aging serum and again in the morning under moisturizer. My jowls look less pronounced and my face looks better. My husband used it twice on his elbows before I passed it on to my younger daughter when she came home. My husband&#x27;s elbows had a hard white crust on them for at least ten years. He would try to scrap it off with a foot file, but it would return. From the very first application, the crust started to flake and he pulled it off. The second application smoothed out his elbows.Now they are soft. I purchased a second bottle for my husband and me to use but passed that one on to my older daughter when she came home. Now I am reordering one for us to keep. Absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> My friend recommend to me this product. She said, she did not get any trouble on her face at all and it makes reduced her blackhead. I did not believe her review at the first time. Now, I totally believe and support her review! It becomes 30 days to used this serum since I bought. I used it during I was on period and I got some trouble on my faces. I thought I am not gonna use it anymore. However, I realized that I was on period and I got lots of troubles on period. I can feel this serum is amazing! Because usually during the period, my skin was got lots of troubles like pimples breaks out on my cheeks, chins and forehead. If pimples breaks out, there are more than 10 pimples on my chins but very small or there are only one or two pimples on my cheeks but very big and hurt when I touch it. Even I spend lots of time to get rid of them, it was not work very well.&lt;br /&gt;At this time, I used the serum during the period, and there is only one pimple broke out on my cheek and very very small and it removed in two days! It is amazing! I never got this amazing result when I use new cosmetics! I really love it and I will buy again after this serum empty. I highly recommend!!</li>
