            <li>I would recommend this soap to anyone looking for a more natural soap.</li>
            <li>Fast and friendly service.  </li>
            <li>I received it in time and start using it right away.</li>
            <li>The seaweed grains in the soap is what gives my skin a good beating to make is soft and is starting diminish my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I have to be super gentle</li>
            <li>God willing</li>
            <li>Also, lovely simple scent too.</li>
            <li>i brought one bar to try it out first on my skin</li>
            <li>ONCE I TRIED THE SEAWEED ON MY FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li>I first started using this soap about two months ago when I first purchased it at a spa, and the soap at their place was $7.99 with tax.</li>
            <li>I had little bumps on my tights from cellulite but, now after I used it, no bumps and very smooth!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really give a review yet that would be helpful.  </li>
            <li>I used the whole bar.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for it exfoliating and that it is gentle.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see my cellulite get better but my skin is tremendously soft again!</li>
            <li>I paid so much for S&amp;H that next time I will look to see how to order more items to get that down in price.</li>
            <li>After several weeks using it, you can really feel your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>This soap makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Wanted something natural with no parabens, but won&#x27;t buy this again...</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for tightening, however I would recommend it if you want a natural soap.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>The soap has a grainy texture which can be painful on sensitive parts, but it also is great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>i would buy this direct next time..</li>
            <li>So I will be using this soap as long as live.</li>
            <li>This product exfoliate your skin well, but its rough for skin like mine, I have sensitive skin, I can scrub it against my belly or sensitive areas, or it will get all rashy and red..</li>
    </ol>

The seaweed grains in the soap is what gives my skin a good beating to make is soft and is starting diminish my cellulite.

            <li> i brought one bar to try it out first on my skin i have never used natural soaps only soaps with deodorants in them, but THIS SOAP WORKS GREAT ON BODY. I BROKE OUT FROM THE PANOYL SOAP 5% USING THAT TO TREAT BLEMISHES AN ACNE AN IT BROKE MY FACE OUT IN BLEMISHES AN BLACK MARKS ONCE I TRIED THE SEAWEED ON MY FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME IT TOOK OFF EVERYTHING ALL IMPURITIES BLEMISH MARKS AN DARK MARKS AS WELL AN I ONLY USED IT ONE TIME ON MY FACE IS WORKED RITE AWAY ON BODY AS WELL.THIS IS GREAT BUT ALWAYS TRY FIRST BEFORE U BUY MORE I JUST BROUGHT MORE OF THIS SOAP MY SON LIKES IT AS WELL.IT SMELLS STRONG AN BAD WHEN U USE IT BUT U CAN\\&quot;T SMELL IT ON YOUR BODY SO THATS A GOOD THING BUT ITS CLEANS EVERYTHING..</li>
            <li> I loved the soap, but it did not last. It only lasted me a week and it is only me using it.</li>
            <li> This soap makes my skin so soft. I love it and recommend it to anyone. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see my cellulite get better but my skin is tremendously soft again!</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed when I received this. It DOES Not do what it claims and causes more break outs. It leaves a film on your face. Not a happy customer!</li>
            <li> Its a little rough on your legs but it works. I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really give a review yet that would be helpful.  I have only been using it for 4 days.  Has a strong odor when you take it out of the wrapper but it does not smell bad.  Strong soap smell.  I like the abrasive bits in the soap, don&#x27;t need a loofah.  Feels nice on skin.</li>
            <li> Reviva has the very best products.  The soap came quickly.  Fast and friendly service.  It is impossible to find locally.</li>
            <li> I really liked this soap.  I did not find that it had any odor as some described.  It can be a little hard on the skin if you rubbed it directly on your body however it has a great lather.  So, if you apply to your wash cloth or sponge it&#x27;s great.  Will definitely order again.  Some things you have to try yourself and not rely on reviews.</li>
            <li> seller and product rocks what else can I say!</li>
            <li> I heard how good seaweed was in breaking up toxins in your skin, so after reading the great reviews, I decided to bite the bullet and try it. I also use it with the Slimulator tool from Bliss. The soap has a grainy texture which can be painful on sensitive parts, but it also is great for exfoliating. The smell is not the greatest, but it washes away quickly and leaves your skin sooooo soft! I honestly can see a huge reduction in my cellulite. I&#x27;m going to start using this on my face to see if it helps with red marks. Once this bar that I&#x27;m using runs out, I&#x27;m buying the multi pack!</li>
            <li> After several weeks using it, you can really feel your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Just started using it. Not sure it works yet. But so far so good</li>
            <li> i love the way this soap makes my skin feel ! its a great exfoliator and smells very pleasant too. ive only purchased one bar and only have used it for 4 showers, but i plan on buy a six pack this week end !</li>
            <li> I use it just for my face (oil skin) and feel great after using. the soap last long.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it will help my cellulite but it has a wonderful scent &amp; the exfoliation is nice.</li>
            <li> I Love This soap. It was recommended by a friend who swears by it and now I swear by it. It has a fresh smell that I also love. When I use it, my son says he can smell it all the way upstairs...lol.. Great product,  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I am all for some good exfoliation, but this is just too much. Anywhere other than my legs I have to be super gentle so that I don&#x27;t scratch my skin. It&#x27;s really not a pleasant bath bar. I&#x27;m reviewing the seaweed soap, not sure what the oatmeal is like, though they show on the same page. Wanted something natural with no parabens, but won&#x27;t buy this again...</li>
            <li> This product exfoliate your skin well, but its rough for skin like mine, I have sensitive skin, I can scrub it against my belly or sensitive areas, or it will get all rashy and red.. my husband love it. It does not make u lose weight, just sayin cuz some ppl said it does on website. No losing weight here. Lol. Just for exfoliating is what its gd for. :) smell ok, not as fancy smell..</li>
            <li> Reviva Labs all natural Seaweed Soap features a pure vegetable base of palm and Koconut oils instead of animal tallow/guts common to most mustard soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a fanatic of Seaweed and Soap, this will make your Seaweed radar tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I like dry Seaweed on my Japanese noodles only.</li>
            <li> This soap was a waste of money. Pros: lasted a long time. Cons: extremely sharp, scratchy (could not use on arms) but some people like that for exfoliation; smelled pretty bad left a fishy type odor on skin, although you get used to it. I did not notice any results such as smoothness or reduction of cellulite. I used the whole bar.</li>
            <li> I brought this to firm and tighten my skin it didn&#x27;t do that it however did soften it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for tightening, however I would recommend it if you want a natural soap.</li>
            <li> This is a soap, it doesn&#x27;t leave residue on your skin and it has a very pleasant smell.  My husband also likes the grit of the seaweed and that he feels clean afterwards.  Some soaps leave a coating on your skin that you can&#x27;t wash off, yuck!  Love this soap and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I usually get this at my local health food store but they have not had the last few times I checked.  I really like this product for it exfoliating and that it is gentle.  I paid so much for S&amp;H that next time I will look to see how to order more items to get that down in price.</li>
            <li> This is a good soap.  It lasts awhile.  It does soften skin. It does leave a residue in the bathtub and that is the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great and is very good at exfoliating the skin.  I have never used seaweed soap before but read somewhere that it can help with swelling so I&#x27;m giving it a try.  I would recommend this soap to anyone looking for a more natural soap.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything re: cellulite.</li>
            <li> My skin was smooth and used on my face for acne breakout and is very good!!! I would buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> I first started using this soap about two months ago when I first purchased it at a spa, and the soap at their place was $7.99 with tax. This leaves my skin feeling soft. And I would recommend it to everybody. I am allergic to some soap because I had a round rash on my in front of my elbow and I went to a pharmacy and they thought I had a ring worm, definitely I did not and I started using cortizone  with chamomile and everything went away. I started using this soap and since then I have not had any allergies. So I will be using this soap as long as live.</li>
