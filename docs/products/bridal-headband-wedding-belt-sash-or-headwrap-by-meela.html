            <li> It broke the same day... Very cheap. Its beautiful but cheap</li>
            <li> This headband is absolutely stunning. It was Perfect for my wedding 12.13.14 beach wedding. The seller paid the additional shipping fee so I could receive the headband in time for my beach wedding. I will be purchasing another headband for my daughter</li>
            <li> I wore this headband for my wedding. The headband itself was very high quality. I had to replace the strings with a thicker ribbon. They were too shinny and slippery for my hair and I needed the headband to stay on my head all day. When I searched for other headbands and saw the difference in price I didn&#x27;t hesitate to order this one. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Got this beautiful headband in and it&#x27;s so perfect for the wedding..  Only one complaint is one of the prongs that hold the crystals is broken but it can easily be fixed with some super glue..  Overall great product!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this yet but it looks nice. Would like for my daughter to wear it as a belt around her dress. Has anyone done this? And is it long enough to wear as a belt?</li>
            <li> The item that I received was broke when open. I tried to glue back together and as I was moving it another chunk of it broke off. Not happy with quality of headband. Now I have to find a new piece to wear a week before my wedding. Headband was gorgeous but not worth the money I paid. Upset that I have to find a new one.</li>
            <li> This headband was everything I hoped for! I was nervous about the quality and it was beautiful and sparkly. It was half the price of some on etsy and I think it is just as beautiful as any of those would be.</li>
            <li> I love the bridal head band /wedding belt.... it came in a neat small bag, its really pretty and a great price. can&#x27;t wait to wear it on my wedding day.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping; ! It was well wrapped and arrived in perfect condition. I will wear this for my wedding in a few months. It is well worth the price; very sparkly and elegant. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>

            <li> Much more beautiful than I expected due to the low price.  It is an excellent length to allow for a comfortable fit without a headache.  I will be wearing it for my wedding in December.</li>
            <li> This item was to my liking. Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> This is so beautiful in person!! It sparkles insanely! Shipped fast as well! Great buy!</li>
            <li> This item is totally beautiful. i can not wait until i can wear it to serve in my mother in laws wedding. I love it</li>
            <li> Stunning!!!! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchased!! It&#x27;s beautiful, shining, excellent price, the shipping was fast, I received it 2 weeks before the date they told me. Also it came very well packed!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this!!!! I order for all my bridesmaids and myself! Everyone also loved them!!! A touch of elegance and sparkle! Good quality!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful it was what I expected</li>
            <li> I received this headband on accident and just fell in love with it. It looks so beautiful in person and I can not wait to wear it on my wedding day!</li>
            <li> So pretty! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it on my wedding day.</li>
            <li> I will give you 5 stars but I felt that the ribbon on this could of been a little nicer. Other than that Our BRIDE made this head band Sparkle and shine!!&lt;br /&gt;It could be used as a belt also on the right gown but I would most diffidently want a different ribbon for that. Behind the hair it was hidden. Perfect length.</li>
            <li> When this headband arrived I was hoping for the best and my fears were alleviated. I could not wait to try it on and it works just fine, fits around my head and it will work on my wedding day.  Why 4 stars, only because I have to replace the ribbon with my wedding color theme. Otherwise, it was well packaged and arrived days before what was stated.</li>
            <li> When I received it was broken in half in the package. Very pretty. Ribbon is not attached very nicely but it can be taken off and redone.</li>
            <li> The head piece was stunning and it fit perfectly.  The bridal headband can just in time and came with two pretty bows. But I only wore the head piece.  I will recommend this product.  And the seller. I had to email them and the responded at a proper time amazing!!!!!</li>
