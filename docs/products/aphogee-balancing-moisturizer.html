            <li>I bought a small bottle at first and used it so much that I ran out fast.</li>
            <li>makes hair soft after application of aphogee treatment</li>
            <li>It words very well on African American hair when using the complete product line.</li>
            <li>everything went back to normal</li>
            <li>The keratin that gave me the super straight hair also gave serious damage.</li>
            <li>Im not sure if this was really worth it</li>

            <li> Its not a bad product, but its also not a good product.  </li>
            <li> As a stand alone conditioner when used directly after the aphogee shampoo....my results were the same; soft hair but still dull looking.</li>
            <li> my hair was still very dry looking until I used my regular moisturizing conditioner and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this with the two step treatment and while it did restore the softness after the hard protein treatment, I still wouldn&#x27;t consider this very moisturizing..</li>
            <li> so Im not going to waste money re-purchasing this.  </li>
            <li> I gave up relaxer a few years ago and went to keratin.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if its hair lotion or conditioner, but Ive used it as either and its just whatever,</li>
            <li> Hair was very unhealthy after doing this treatment and buying this seperately</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about hair products but my hair was in desparate need of treatment it was breaking off bad</li>
            <li> This smells so horrible.  </li>

            <li> THIS PRODUCTS WORKS WONDERS IN THE \\&quot;SOFTNESS DEPARTMENT\\&quot; IT GOES WELL AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE APHOGEE 2 STEP PROTEIN TREATMENT. THIS IS A MUST HAVE AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR HANDS OUT OF YOUR HAIR. THIS WILL BE A PART OF MY REGULAR ROUTINE.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! It words very well on African American hair when using the complete product line.</li>

            <li> great product good price.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about hair products but my hair was in desparate need of treatment it was breaking off bad but thanks to Aphogee the breakage has stop and my hair feels a lot strong. I would recommend this product to friends and family members.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try this yet but according to all my ladies on Youtube its amazing</li>
            <li> this stuff really worked for my wife her hair was damaged from dying it. Hair was very unhealthy after doing this treatment and buying this seperately everything went back to normal</li>
            <li> Life saver after using Aphogee protien treatment. The Protien treatment was so strong that it just about completely dried out my hair and made it drastically brittle.  Leaving Aphogee Balancing Moisturizer in over-night instead of only the 2 minutes, is what saved me.</li>
            <li> Its not a bad product, but its also not a good product.  This does nothing for my hair, Ive had hair lotions that worked better than this.  Im not sure if its hair lotion or conditioner, but Ive used it as either and its just whatever, so Im not going to waste money re-purchasing this.  And on top of that, it doesnt smell good, like, at all, so Im not even going to finish the bottle :-p</li>
            <li> very good product. I use it with the two step protein treatment and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this with the two step treatment and while it did restore the softness after the hard protein treatment, I still wouldn&#x27;t consider this very moisturizing..my hair was still very dry looking until I used my regular moisturizing conditioner and moisturizer. As a stand alone conditioner when used directly after the aphogee shampoo....my results were the same; soft hair but still dull looking.</li>
            <li> This a must have to go along with your shampoo and conditioner. It makes your hair nice and soft and managable.</li>
            <li> This balancing moisturizer is truly awesome. It made my hair super soft, and helped it a lot the first time I used it. I can&#x27;t wait to continue using this product. Aphogee is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I felt a difference in my hair texture after the first use.  I have only used it with the protein treatment (not as a stand alone) and am very pleased with the results. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Cannot use the Two Step Protein without it.....</li>
            <li> Aphogee products are the best. I buy Aveda for 10 times the price (literally), but these products saved my hair when it got damaged last year.  I gave up relaxer a few years ago and went to keratin. The keratin that gave me the super straight hair also gave serious damage. Try the 2 minute reconstructor and 2 step protein treatment.  After, your hair will feel silky like you just had keratin.</li>
            <li> Really loves how this shampoo leaves my hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This smells so horrible.  It did seem to make my hair softer, but I didn&#x27;t use it properly either- I rinsed it off too soon because I couldn&#x27;t take the smell any longer.  PS the smell STAYED WITH ME after I rinsed this out! ick</li>
            <li> My hair is still breaking so Im not sure if this was really worth it - guess it was ok</li>
            <li> This is a product that lives up to its claims. I have used this for over one year and notice that it indeed stops breakage when used as directed.  It also make your hair soft and manageable. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is just what moisturizer should be like. It makes your hair super soft, especially after the two step protein treatment. I bought a small bottle at first and used it so much that I ran out fast. This time I got myself a bigger bottle. I use this moisturizer weekly after I use the Aphogee Shampoo for damaged hair....great product line.</li>
            <li> I have order this product and I love it. I try to make sure I do not run it. It works great on my hair and the price is the best I have seen.</li>
            <li> makes hair soft after application of aphogee treatment</li>
            <li> If you are one who needs a protein and moisture balance then this product is definitely for you. I recommend using it only once a week or once a month. Very good product from aphogee!</li>
            <li> Amazing love this brand</li>
