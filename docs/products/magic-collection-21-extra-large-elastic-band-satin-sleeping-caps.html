    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is a great value for being delivered to my home.</li>
            <li>great for sleeping, covering up curlers.</li>
            <li>Rest works good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect fit  and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>MORE ROOM PICTURE IS DECEIVING!</li>
            <li>It is nice but does not contain all of my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for my highly textured hair.</li>
            <li>it fits just right and works great</li>
            <li>I love my satin cap keeps hair in place.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it was too comfortable that i forgot to remove it while running an errand!</li>
            <li>Still going strong after many washes.</li>
            <li>comfortable and fits well</li>
            <li>Packaging stated that it is an extra large but in reality it&#x27;s a large at best.</li>
            <li>JUST RIGHT!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;really comfortable, very breathable!!!&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>this black sleeping cap is very comfortable and very smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>The item was delivered very quickly however it was not an &amp;#34;extra large band&amp;#34; and was not a &amp;#34;Very large cap&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This barely holds my hair--resembles a large swim cap more than the photo.  </li>
            <li>I will be getting more for my personal collection.</li>
            <li>Plus, when hair is tucked inside and slept on, looks funny in the morning.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as large as I thought it was gone be.</li>
            <li>it said large</li>
            <li>I will now go and purchase a real satin bonnet.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient and stays put all night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The material is not satin, but does seem like it would breathe better than real satin, which is helpful if hair is slightly damp.</li>
            <li>That being said, I think they&#x27;re handy for when you can&#x27;t find your usual silk or satin bonnets.</li>
            <li>slept for the first time with lots of extensions on my head, yet felt as though i had my natural hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also ask them to send me a return label by the time I paid for a return that would be more than half of what I had to pay for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The band was more suited to someone with a tiny head and very short hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a tight mesh with no hemming.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I also had a satin pillowcase it might stay on, but I&#x27;m not sure since it&#x27;s a pretty close fit for the way it looks on the photo.</li>
            <li>Runs small, Cheap Satin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shoddy manufacturing job and a cheap product.</li>
            <li>One cap is so large it does not stay on you head, the other on is smaller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging clearly indicates that the cap is 21 inches across when lain flat and with the elastic applied--that is clearly an elastic circle in the center of the photo.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, but its low quality made it less resistant to constant wear.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Please use Amazons Return Center to return the products back to us.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you wear rollers or have big thick hair, this cap is definitely big enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so inexpensive that it seem not worth it to send it back, but it&#x27;s not really usable for my purposes.</li>
            <li> I wore it one night to bed, despite the fact that my hair was jammed in there, thinking the smoothness of the cap would keep my curls nicer, but I woke up with the cap off.</li>
            <li> careful ladies...</li>
            <li> Making it hard to stay on especially while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have sent them four emails of pictures of the caps also how all the black stuff was coming out and off of the caps and getting in my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to stuff my long thick locs in the cap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a smooth, opaque satin cap as it advertised to be.</li>
            <li> However, they&#x27;re really stiff and a bit course in texture.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Smells weird, and definitely isn&#x27;t made of satin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t keep my hair in place, actually made it stick out really weird.</li>
            <li> However, it is actually approximately 12 inches across.  </li>
            <li> These are the worse sleep caps I have ever had or seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the very thin elastic band leaves a mark on forehead.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The cap is lightweright and provides sufficient ventilation.  However, the width measurement is not as illustrated on the packaging.is misleading.  The packaging clearly indicates that the cap is 21 inches across when lain flat and with the elastic applied--that is clearly an elastic circle in the center of the photo.  However, it is actually approximately 12 inches across.  The only way that it could be 21 inches across is with the elastic removed.  What the benefit of providing that information?</li>
            <li> The item was delivered very quickly however it was not an &amp;#34;extra large band&amp;#34; and was not a &amp;#34;Very large cap&amp;#34;.  The band was more suited to someone with a tiny head and very short hair.</li>
            <li> comfortable and fits well</li>
            <li> Prevent breakage of hair while you sleep. Usefull. Just don&#x27;t support the elastic band of the cap in your forehead, because it will leave a mark. Just that. Rest works good. It does what is supposed to do; hold your hair while you sleep.</li>
            <li> I tried to like it, but it fits much smaller on the head that what the photo suggests. I wore it one night to bed, despite the fact that my hair was jammed in there, thinking the smoothness of the cap would keep my curls nicer, but I woke up with the cap off. It&#x27;s not a smooth, opaque satin cap as it advertised to be. It&#x27;s more of a tight mesh with no hemming. Just a circular piece of inexpensive fabric with elastic sewn in a circle to keep it on. It&#x27;s so inexpensive that it seem not worth it to send it back, but it&#x27;s not really usable for my purposes. Maybe if I also had a satin pillowcase it might stay on, but I&#x27;m not sure since it&#x27;s a pretty close fit for the way it looks on the photo. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the same product as shown, frankly.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as large as I thought it was gone be. To me it&#x27;s just a regular size bonnet.</li>
            <li> Wear this every night</li>
            <li> This satin cap is big enough to handle ALL my big hair!  It is a great value for being delivered to my home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect fit  and very comfortable. I will be getting more for my personal collection. It&#x27;s wonderful for my highly textured hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like the satin bonnet in the picture.  This sleep cap is see-thru, flimsy, and if you have any type of nightly hair routine that involves creams and oils, it does nothing to trap in those essentials for overnight haircare.  I will now go and purchase a real satin bonnet.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for naturals.  Trust me, this is not what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> this black sleeping cap is very comfortable and very smooth to the touch. it fits well. great for sleeping, covering up curlers.</li>
            <li> This barely holds my hair--resembles a large swim cap more than the photo.  Also, the very thin elastic band leaves a mark on forehead.  The material is not satin, but does seem like it would breathe better than real satin, which is helpful if hair is slightly damp.</li>
            <li> I thought these caps were going to be allot softer than what they actually are. I have no issues with their size or the fact that you get 3 for the price. However, they&#x27;re really stiff and a bit course in texture. That being said, I think they&#x27;re handy for when you can&#x27;t find your usual silk or satin bonnets.</li>
            <li> I love my satin cap keeps hair in place. it said large but i think its a medium, but it works for me. Thank You</li>
            <li> NOT AS BIG AS PICTURED ON PACKAGE ....I HAVE EXTENSION IN MY HAIR AN CAP COVERS MY HAIR JUST RIGHT!  I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE MORE ROOM PICTURE IS DECEIVING!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 and received 1!!!</li>
            <li> Still going strong after many washes.</li>
            <li> Packaging stated that it is an extra large but in reality it&#x27;s a large at best. I had to stuff my long thick locs in the cap. Making it hard to stay on especially while sleeping.</li>
            <li> it fits just right and works great</li>
            <li> Does what it does (ie covers my head), but elastic separated and edge fraying after only a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Love it. Very convenient and stays put all night.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it</li>
            <li> If you wear rollers or have big thick hair, this cap is definitely big enough. Holds everything together.</li>
            <li> OMG!&lt;br /&gt;I slept for the first time with lots of extensions on my head, yet felt as though i had my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;really comfortable, very breathable!!!&lt;br /&gt;5 star if not more.&lt;br /&gt;it was too comfortable that i forgot to remove it while running an errand! careful ladies...</li>
            <li> These are the worse sleep caps I have ever had or seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I contact the company MayaBeauty, I sent them pictures of the caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the reply I received back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please use Amazons Return Center to return the products back to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will investigate this for you and process you either a replacement or refund depending on what occurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions or concerns, please don&#x27;t hesitate to contact us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric - Customer Relations Specialist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MayaBeauty,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Relations Specialist Eric, was telling me to send the sleep caps back and they would investigate and or send me a refund or a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have sent them four emails of pictures of the caps also how all the black stuff was coming out and off of the caps and getting in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also ask them to send me a return label by the time I paid for a return that would be more than half of what I had to pay for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can post the pictures on this site if needed.  One cap is so large it does not stay on you head, the other on is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Both are suppose to be the same size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Constance Taylor,</li>
            <li> I only used this satin cap one night before the elastic band frayed and began to tear off. One use? It&#x27;s a shoddy manufacturing job and a cheap product. Don&#x27;t waste your money! I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but its low quality made it less resistant to constant wear.</li>
            <li> Smells weird, and definitely isn&#x27;t made of satin. Didn&#x27;t keep my hair in place, actually made it stick out really weird.</li>
            <li> It is nice but does not contain all of my hair.</li>
            <li> Runs small, Cheap Satin. Decided to purchase Silk pillowcase and not use this product at all.  Plus, when hair is tucked inside and slept on, looks funny in the morning. Just not for me.</li>
