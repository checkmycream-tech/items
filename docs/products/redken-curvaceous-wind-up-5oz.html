            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I had read good reviews on this product and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>Great as s finishing spray for fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>It is just not as effective as a styling product for me.</li>
            <li>this product is perfect for keeping the frizzies at bay; and it does so without making my hair crunchy which the older product did not do.  </li>
            <li>This product is also very light and doesn&#x27;t change the texture of my hair at all.</li>
            <li>I love how this product helps keep the curl or wave of my hair without the crunchy look &amp; feeling.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair curly that is for sure.  </li>
            <li>But, I have to say I love the Curvaceous Wind Up.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my permed curls curly, better than most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Love the smell as well.</li>
            <li>Let the magic happen.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Prices is better than salon.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t do more than one day of curls without it.</li>
            <li>Worked so much better on fine hair.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li>The scent is so strong and didn&#x27;t seem to fade.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m putting it on lightly.</li>
            <li>soft perfect curls that last, touch ups with a quick spritz of water if needed.</li>
            <li>I have heard this product works best on thick, curly hair</li>
            <li>I love this whole line of products.  </li>
            <li>Love these new sane products which help the problem.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a natural scent - it smells like cheap drugstore cologne and its so strong</li>
            <li>I contacted Redken because they no longer make the Fresh Curls product I have used for years.</li>
            <li>But after about half an hour my hair is good to go for another day.</li>
            <li>A good little pick-me-up for curly or wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I really miss the Redken Fresh Curls product that they pulled off the market.</li>
            <li>I used it very lightly on dry hair, just on the ends since I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would go on.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and does help make your hair curly when it needs a little extra help!</li>
            <li>Straight haired irls will never understand..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell you if this product works or not.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/curly hair and this spray enhances it perfectly...love it!!!</li>
            <li>I normally use the product on my dry hair to define my curls and tone down the frizzy, fly aways.</li>
            <li>I use the Curvaceous shampoo and conditioner as well, and the try really really does promote a nice natural curl, with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li>I used the older product for about 15 years, it worked for me</li>
            <li>The only thing is the size is smaller (5 ounces), where the older product was 8.5 ounces; and it&#x27;s more money than the older product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviews on the Redken site where people are very upset about the old line of products going away and being replaced by this line.  </li>
            <li>I would even venture to say that this product makes my second day curls (and third ... and occasionally fourth) better than the first.</li>
            <li>Not so with this new product.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the new scent - it is overpowering.</li>
            <li>Not stiff or oily.  </li>
            <li>Works much better to simply spray your hair with water, and add a little Ringlet Protection Lotion.</li>
            <li>It did not give me the lift and body to help my curls come alive.</li>
            <li>and it is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m waiting to see if Amazon will sell it \\&quot;two for the price of one\\&quot; like they did with the old product.  </li>
            <li>The spray is not heavy and not sticky.</li>
            <li>I will also say that it never looks quite right in the moments after spraying, when my hair still looks wet from the product.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, long hair and</li>
            <li>After sleeping on my curls they get seriously unruly and look more like a tangled nest than my actual hair.</li>
            <li>It can leave a bit of crunch behind, but with a bit more scrunching that fades.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, naturally curly hair so almost anything I put in</li>

            <li> it, but I would recommend for application on absolutely dry hair to rejuvenate slept on or &#x27;hat-head&#x27; curls/waves.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of the products in the Redken curl line, at least the older version of the curl line.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that with the minimal amount of humidity in the air will get frizzie, but with this product I can control those frizzies.  </li>
            <li> She sprays it on her wet hair before bed and wakes up with well defined curls.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can have a second day of curls, with just a few sprits.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Need to use a base product too, though.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed as I had hoped to use it as a midweek pick-me-up for my curls or as a refresher spray in the mornings.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I love how this product helps keep the curl or wave of my hair without the crunchy look &amp; feeling.</li>
            <li> My wife told me this was a counterfit product. She was not satisified.</li>
            <li> I contacted Redken because they no longer make the Fresh Curls product I have used for years. They suggested I try this one as a replacement. It is just not as effective as a styling product for me. It did not give me the lift and body to help my curls come alive. And, considering the price, I expected much more than what I can get from a less expensive product I can purchase at any department store.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair curly that is for sure.  Helps a lot on the second and third days if you don&#x27;t shampoo daily.  Not stiff or oily.  I have very thick hair and it is naturally curly.  I can not wash it every day, so this helps each morning to get the curls under control.  Best product I have found yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviews on the Redken site where people are very upset about the old line of products going away and being replaced by this line.  But, I have to say I love the Curvaceous Wind Up.  I have very curly, long hair and this product is perfect for keeping the frizzies at bay; and it does so without making my hair crunchy which the older product did not do.  I used the older product for about 15 years, it worked for me but I did have to play with it quite a bit to get rid of the crunchiness.  Not so with this new product.  So, I&#x27;m happy with it and I would recommend it.  The only thing is the size is smaller (5 ounces), where the older product was 8.5 ounces; and it&#x27;s more money than the older product.  So, I&#x27;m waiting to see if Amazon will sell it \\&quot;two for the price of one\\&quot; like they did with the old product.  We&#x27;ll see.....</li>
            <li> I have used this for 1 week now and this has practically eliminated the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;.  I have curly hair that with the minimal amount of humidity in the air will get frizzie, but with this product I can control those frizzies.  I would recommend this spray to anyone with the same problem as me!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use the Curvaceous shampoo and conditioner as well, and the try really really does promote a nice natural curl, with little to no frizz. This product is also very light and doesn&#x27;t change the texture of my hair at all. If I feel like it&#x27;s going to be a frizzy day I tame my hair with Redken guts spray mousse, but I would like to try one of the Curvaceous mousses to keep the curling theme.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and does help make your hair curly when it needs a little extra help! Great!n</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the new scent - it is overpowering. I am not able to use the product.</li>
            <li> Spray, scrunch and voile- soft perfect curls that last, touch ups with a quick spritz of water if needed. Try it!</li>
            <li> Unlike the Curvaceous Ringlet Protection Lotion, this product makes your hair crunchy and crusty.  Works much better to simply spray your hair with water, and add a little Ringlet Protection Lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of the products in the Redken curl line, at least the older version of the curl line. I had read good reviews on this product and thought I would try it. I used it very lightly on dry hair, just on the ends since I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would go on. I have very dry, naturally curly hair so almost anything I put in it soaks up in a very short period of time, even oils. This left the ends of my hair feeling slick to the touch-greasy slick, not smooth slick-even after several hours. I am very disappointed as I had hoped to use it as a midweek pick-me-up for my curls or as a refresher spray in the mornings. Amazon&#x27;s site says it is not returnable so I guess I will be donating or tossing it.:(</li>
            <li> I have heard this product works best on thick, curly hair but I have thin, wavy hair and it just leaves my hair sticky and I&#x27;m putting it on lightly. I really miss the Redken Fresh Curls product that they pulled off the market. Worked so much better on fine hair.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my permed curls curly, better than most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.</li>
            <li> Great product for curl and frizz control.</li>
            <li> Redken Curvaceous Wind Up spray is great on my hair. I have thin, curly hair about mid-back length. I normally use the product on my dry hair to define my curls and tone down the frizzy, fly aways. It leaves my hair shiny and smelling great. The spray almost has a tropical scent like coconut or jojoba. My daughter loves the spray. She sprays it on her wet hair before bed and wakes up with well defined curls. The spray is not heavy and not sticky. A small spray goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve crazy curly hair and this just makes it a bit easier to manage. Love the smell as well. Do not need a lot of the product either as I put some in a separate bottle, water it down &amp; spray on my curls</li>
            <li> Great as s finishing spray for fine, curly hair. Need to use a base product too, though.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair which I used to hate.  Love these new sane products which help the problem. Finally. Straight haired irls will never understand..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell you if this product works or not. The scent is so strong and didn&#x27;t seem to fade. I eventually gave up and washed my hair again just to get away from it. It isn&#x27;t a natural scent - it smells like cheap drugstore cologne and its so strong it began to give me a headache.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can have a second day of curls, with just a few sprits.&lt;br /&gt;No water to add frizz, the spray works great.&lt;br /&gt;Scrunch the hair after you spray.  Let the magic happen.</li>
            <li> I always keep this product on hand. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this whole line of products.  I keeps the frizzed out, and it does not weigh the hair down</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past, this is the first time I am not buying from a salon.  Prices is better than salon.  I like the product does a great job!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. After sleeping on my curls they get seriously unruly and look more like a tangled nest than my actual hair. This stuff works miracles on my unruly bedhead. Just spray, scrunch, and my curls are rebirthed! I would even venture to say that this product makes my second day curls (and third ... and occasionally fourth) better than the first. It can leave a bit of crunch behind, but with a bit more scrunching that fades. I will also say that it never looks quite right in the moments after spraying, when my hair still looks wet from the product. But after about half an hour my hair is good to go for another day. Couldn&#x27;t do more than one day of curls without it.</li>
            <li> A good little pick-me-up for curly or wavy hair.  It don&#x27;t &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it, but I would recommend for application on absolutely dry hair to rejuvenate slept on or &#x27;hat-head&#x27; curls/waves.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair and this spray enhances it perfectly...love it!!!</li>
