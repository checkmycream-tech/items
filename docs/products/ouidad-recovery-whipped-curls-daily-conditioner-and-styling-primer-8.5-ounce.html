            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>And smells amazing, as a bonus</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this product and it did a good job of conditioning my curly hair</li>
            <li>honestly they could improve the can a bit....</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my hair look and feel and it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>I find this very effective to keep my curls looking fresh.</li>
            <li>Even with the cons, I&#x27;ve purchased this 3 times now because it is more smoothing than any leave-in I have tried, and I have tried tons of products.</li>
            <li>but it definitely works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>I usually love Ouidad products but this one really isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>Perhaps someone with thicker hair would have better luck.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love Whipped Curls.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine love sit though which is why I tried it.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work perfectly, but my hair he&#x27;s been healthier since i have been using it.</li>
            <li>The whiter my hair gets, though, the more frizzy it gets.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get much more of a testimonial than that.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for my fine, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong perfume-y scent.</li>
            <li>I use this as my first product, followed by Ouidad&#x27;s heat &amp; humidity gel, which is also an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This conditioner, used as a leave-in, does an excellent job of calming them down so they blend in and clump with the lengths of my hair.</li>
            <li>It does define the curls nicely, and it gives them a lot of movement, but again if you put too much then it will be a bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is worth the price!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>The thick &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; texture and smell of the product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t get the nozzle to work easily</li>
            <li>Spread it on your fingertips and then lightly go through the ends of your hair first.</li>
            <li>After that, my curls look amazing and will last a day or two.</li>
            <li>however I think it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I used too much at first and have been very pleased that it works even better with just a small amount.</li>
            <li>I really like the dispenser - fun!</li>
            <li>I use it as a leave-in conditioner often with no other hair styling product and my curls love it.</li>
            <li>Though strong, the fragrance does not trigger my allergies/asthma like many other products do.</li>
            <li>and my hair needs lots of protection from humidity, but I suspect it can hold up on its own when the weather&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>I wanted a heavier product than those that are advertised as &amp;#34;lightweight curls&amp;#34; and this is exactly that without looking greasy.</li>
            <li>I first tried it as a primer.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smooth texture and is very heavy, almost like mayonnaise.</li>
            <li>Not for me, it really dries out my hair....</li>
            <li>- I thought it was too damaged from highlights to bounce back, but all it needed was a fantastic moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight as a rinse-out conditioner, but gives just enough weight as a leave-in to eliminate any frizzies and flyaways.  </li>
            <li>Whipped Curls really improves the texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It did a nice job as a conditioner, but again, for me the fragrance was just too heavy.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair with 2c/3a curls and it weighs them down too much.</li>
            <li>I went back to not using it for a few days, and my hair just didn&#x27;t look as good.</li>
            <li>I am almost 65 (but have been using Ouidad products for over 10 years), and have medium short, fine, white, flyaway hair, in an angled bob, that is just a dandelion head when there&#x27;s no product in it.  </li>
            <li>One can goes a long way because you don&#x27;t need much at any one time - too much and your hair will be greasy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll never go back; it&#x27;s a very pretty white.  </li>
            <li>I like the piece-y look for curls and this keeps them together better than other products I&#x27;ve used without weighing them down too much.</li>
            <li>sometimes it&#x27;s hard to push the nozzle, especially on first use.  </li>
            <li>I go through it with the Ouidad Clear Control Pomade.</li>
            <li>It really has helped put moisture back into my hair.</li>
            <li>Not the soft curls I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t work for me, made my hair too soft and unmanegable.</li>
            <li>Only product that keeps my curls together and soft still.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and the curl I love so much always falls out after a day or less, but with this product my hair stays curly and soft even in dry weather.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s an especially &amp;#34;frizzy weather day&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ll smooth on the pomade when my hair is almost dry, or a little coconut oil or shea butter.  </li>
            <li>But eventually I figured out the right &amp;#34;touch.&amp;#34; Also, use just a very little.</li>
            <li>My 2C/3a thick, frizz prone hair feels awful--coated and full of product (even when I use a tiny bit).</li>
            <li>However I didn&#x27;t feel like the container was really all the way full of product, and the last bit of product was difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I bend  over at the waist, comb the mixture through, separate the curls with my fingers, blot with a paper towel, let it dry naturally, or if I&#x27;m in a hurry, a blow dryer on low with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of hair products and Ouidad, especially this particular product, is one I always come back to after trying other products such as Frizz-Eze (sp?) or Devacurl.  </li>
            <li>Loses 1 star due to strong fragrance and price.</li>

            <li> Loses 1 star due to strong fragrance and price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I haven&#x27;t had much luck with hair products, but this one really does the trick!</li>
            <li> This is the only leave in conditioner and styler I have ever found that will leave my hair curly without frizz, even after a long day and running my fingers through it.  </li>
            <li> It goes a long way (a quarter size or less on shoulder-length hair is enough for me) and my curls keep their shape while remaining soft and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> My natural hair texture is really frizzy though, especially in humidity, so some of you with less frizz or in dry climates can probably get away with using a small amount of this and avoiding the tacky feeling this can cause.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it as a regular rinse out conditioner and couldn&#x27;t get it out of the can with wet hands.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a Ouidad stylist, and although my hair looks good when using this as a styling primer, I hate how it feels.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is so nourishing for my dry, frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> My only grief, as others have mentioned, is how the product is dispensed, hoping they make a better nozzle in the future</li>
            <li> I use it as a deep conditioner and as a styling primer, by leaving just a little bit in my hair and letting it air dry and apply product.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY thick product that I don&#x27;t feel can be used during the week when getting ready in a hurry for work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but the delivery system is horrible.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I tried it a few days later as a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Other negatives is that it is difficult to use the right amount so that you get the benefits without your hair feeling tacky and gunky.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount (little goes a long way with this one) to soaking wet hair from the middle of my head down to the ends then apply my gel; it was too heavy to use on my entire head.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when ordering this product, but it worked exactly the way it said it would.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very thick, so only use a little bit, otherwise it will be too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually with time it made my hair a bit dry ...</li>
            <li> Once my hair dries, it&#x27;s a little crunchy, so</li>
            <li> I have not had any trouble with the packaging and feel I get all of the product out of the can.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed from the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I had always colored it, but when it grew back in I was shocked to see how white it had gotten.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this for dry hair, not for normal/oily hair, otherwise it will make it worse.</li>
            <li> It is also my go-to after a bad, too-short haircut, because if I use a lot of it, it smooths my hair to the point where the curls are looser and don&#x27;t shrink much, so it looks longer.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you need to rub the product well on your hands to melt it or else you may get chunks of the product in your hair - not attractive!</li>
            <li> I use a &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; of product - a dollop of this product about the size of a small walnut, plus a squirt of Climate Control.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it as an after-shampoo treatment and almost always use just a tiny bit as a base for the other products.  </li>
            <li> I have ridiculously curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my daughter and she had a serious allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> and I though it was broken.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the smell, but at least its not overpowering as to make it useless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My stylist recommended this for my dry hair. It really has helped put moisture back into my hair. While keeping my style</li>
            <li> Love this product for curly hair!!</li>
            <li> I have ridiculously curly, frizzy hair. This conditioner is so nourishing for my dry, frizzy curls. I love it! It does have a strong perfume-y scent. I use it as a deep conditioner and as a styling primer, by leaving just a little bit in my hair and letting it air dry and apply product. I have re ordered this several times, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Superior clumping and smoothing of my frizzy, 3b/c porous curls! Loses 1 star due to strong fragrance and price. Though strong, the fragrance does not trigger my allergies/asthma like many other products do. Other negatives is that it is difficult to use the right amount so that you get the benefits without your hair feeling tacky and gunky. My natural hair texture is really frizzy though, especially in humidity, so some of you with less frizz or in dry climates can probably get away with using a small amount of this and avoiding the tacky feeling this can cause. Even with the cons, I&#x27;ve purchased this 3 times now because it is more smoothing than any leave-in I have tried, and I have tried tons of products. As I&#x27;m aging, my hair has been thinning a bit and I have these individual strands that are shorter than the rest and stick out. This conditioner, used as a leave-in, does an excellent job of calming them down so they blend in and clump with the lengths of my hair. It is also my go-to after a bad, too-short haircut, because if I use a lot of it, it smooths my hair to the point where the curls are looser and don&#x27;t shrink much, so it looks longer. I have not tried this by itself, I use a gel, mousse or cream over it as it&#x27;s summer and my hair needs lots of protection from humidity, but I suspect it can hold up on its own when the weather&#x27;s dry. This is worth the price!</li>
            <li> It is pricey however I think it is worth every penny.  You only need a small amount and it lasts a long time.  I love the smell and the way it makes my hair look and feel and it smells amazing.  I have not had any trouble with the packaging and feel I get all of the product out of the can.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this product and it did a good job of conditioning my curly hair (I am Caucasian).  However I didn&#x27;t feel like the container was really all the way full of product, and the last bit of product was difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product for curl definition and hold without getting crunchy. Keeps hair hydrated, too. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you need to rub the product well on your hands to melt it or else you may get chunks of the product in your hair - not attractive! I find this very effective to keep my curls looking fresh. I have bought this product twice and I do it recommend.</li>
            <li> Not the soft curls I was hoping for.  Still &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; and it did not enhance my curls.  Did not work as a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but the delivery system is horrible. For the price you pay its can is ineffective for maximum use. I will not buy it again until they put it in another jar or bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for my fine, naturally curly hair. I use it as a styling primer (I put it in before my regular curl styling product) and it helps my curls &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34; and stay defined.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY thick product that I don&#x27;t feel can be used during the week when getting ready in a hurry for work.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I haven&#x27;t had much luck with hair products, but this one really does the trick! Enhances and maintains my curls beautifully! I have thick wavy hair and the curl I love so much always falls out after a day or less, but with this product my hair stays curly and soft even in dry weather. I used too much at first and have been very pleased that it works even better with just a small amount. May not work for everyone but it definitely works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> I usually love Ouidad products but this one really isn&#x27;t my favorite. It has a nice smooth texture and is very heavy, almost like mayonnaise. I have very fine hair with 2c/3a curls and it weighs them down too much. Perhaps someone with thicker hair would have better luck.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. The consistency is very thick, so only use a little bit, otherwise it will be too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually with time it made my hair a bit dry ... but perhaps that&#x27;s just for me. It does define the curls nicely, and it gives them a lot of movement, but again if you put too much then it will be a bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for dry hair, not for normal/oily hair, otherwise it will make it worse.</li>
            <li> This product has become a staple in my wash and go regimen.</li>
            <li> Only product that keeps my curls together and soft still. I wanted a heavier product than those that are advertised as &amp;#34;lightweight curls&amp;#34; and this is exactly that without looking greasy. Can&#x27;t go without this product ever again! Only wish there was a travel size! And smells amazing, as a bonus</li>
            <li> I have 3b/3c curly hair and was searching for a conditioning primer to use before styling. I&#x27;m really happy with this product! I apply a small amount (little goes a long way with this one) to soaking wet hair from the middle of my head down to the ends then apply my gel; it was too heavy to use on my entire head. It helps a lot with managing frizz and helps second day curls last. My only grief, as others have mentioned, is how the product is dispensed, hoping they make a better nozzle in the future</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It brings control to my curls.</li>
            <li> Not for me, it really dries out my hair....I was really disappointed from the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Did not like this at all. Went back to Kinky Kurly after trying twice. Gave it to my daughter and she had a serious allergic reaction. Would not buy it again. It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t get the nozzle to work easily and I though it was broken. But eventually I figured out the right &amp;#34;touch.&amp;#34; Also, use just a very little. Spread it on your fingertips and then lightly go through the ends of your hair first. I use it before the Climate Control styling gel - which I also put on the same way. Once my hair dries, it&#x27;s a little crunchy, so I go through it with the Ouidad Clear Control Pomade. After that, my curls look amazing and will last a day or two. I went back to not using it for a few days, and my hair just didn&#x27;t look as good.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I really like the dispenser - fun! And I have noticed my hair is easier to manage. Not a fan of the smell, but at least its not overpowering as to make it useless. Haven&#x27;t tried it as a primer yet.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  I first tried it as a primer.  The fragrance was overpowering and my hair felt tacky, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash it out.  I tried it a few days later as a conditioner.  It did a nice job as a conditioner, but again, for me the fragrance was just too heavy.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way (a quarter size or less on shoulder-length hair is enough for me) and my curls keep their shape while remaining soft and frizz-free. I like the piece-y look for curls and this keeps them together better than other products I&#x27;ve used without weighing them down too much. The thick &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; texture and smell of the product is wonderful. I use this as my first product, followed by Ouidad&#x27;s heat &amp; humidity gel, which is also an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I love Whipped Curls.  It immediately restored my hair - I thought it was too damaged from highlights to bounce back, but all it needed was a fantastic moisturizer.  It&#x27;s light weight as a rinse-out conditioner, but gives just enough weight as a leave-in to eliminate any frizzies and flyaways.  Great stuff for my hair!</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for me, made my hair too soft and unmanegable. A friend of mine love sit though which is why I tried it.</li>
            <li> Whipped Curls really improves the texture of my hair.  Sometimes I use it as an after-shampoo treatment and almost always use just a tiny bit as a base for the other products.  I love it!  Tho honestly they could improve the can a bit....sometimes it&#x27;s hard to push the nozzle, especially on first use.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my curly hair for two years. One can goes a long way because you don&#x27;t need much at any one time - too much and your hair will be greasy. I use it as a leave-in conditioner often with no other hair styling product and my curls love it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a Ouidad stylist, and although my hair looks good when using this as a styling primer, I hate how it feels. My 2C/3a thick, frizz prone hair feels awful--coated and full of product (even when I use a tiny bit). I tried to use it as a regular rinse out conditioner and couldn&#x27;t get it out of the can with wet hands. Awful!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m exchanging this for something different.</li>
            <li> My curls have never been so in control and they last all day.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when ordering this product, but it worked exactly the way it said it would. This is my HG!!!  Not only does it work perfectly, but my hair he&#x27;s been healthier since i have been using it. Definitely worth the money. I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> This is the only leave in conditioner and styler I have ever found that will leave my hair curly without frizz, even after a long day and running my fingers through it.  I am almost 65 (but have been using Ouidad products for over 10 years), and have medium short, fine, white, flyaway hair, in an angled bob, that is just a dandelion head when there&#x27;s no product in it.  Some history - 3 years ago I had chemotherapy and all my hair fell out.  I had always colored it, but when it grew back in I was shocked to see how white it had gotten.  I decided to keep my white hair and I&#x27;ll never go back; it&#x27;s a very pretty white.  The whiter my hair gets, though, the more frizzy it gets.  I have tried a lot of hair products and Ouidad, especially this particular product, is one I always come back to after trying other products such as Frizz-Eze (sp?) or Devacurl.  It&#x27;s pricey but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  I use a &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; of product - a dollop of this product about the size of a small walnut, plus a squirt of Climate Control. I bend  over at the waist, comb the mixture through, separate the curls with my fingers, blot with a paper towel, let it dry naturally, or if I&#x27;m in a hurry, a blow dryer on low with a diffuser.  If it&#x27;s an especially &amp;#34;frizzy weather day&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ll smooth on the pomade when my hair is almost dry, or a little coconut oil or shea butter.  Total strangers compliment me on my hair.  Can&#x27;t get much more of a testimonial than that.</li>
