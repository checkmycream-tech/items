    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The Galvanic Spa is the best thing I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I was impressed by their 20 million dollars in research and 125 scientist on the panel.  </li>
            <li>and I do it twice a week to look great!</li>
            <li>I had a very good experience with the Galvanic Machine using the Nutriol Hair stuff.</li>
            <li>Nu skin also has a great return policy - they guarantee you will see results, so go for it.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with the outcome and the service.</li>
            <li>I think this is the most awesome product on this earth.  </li>
            <li>This spa does everything they say it will - easy to use and my skin has b&#x3D;never been so great!!</li>
            <li>But it is surprising that there is no pulses of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see how good it looks myself</li>
            <li>so here is a good buy, BUT</li>
            <li>I started using the Galvanic Spa from the day I saw it, and I have absolutely LOVED the results,</li>
            <li>my spa is still going strong!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m NOT working for Cle De Peau, OK!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m NOT working for Cle De Peau, OK!</li>
            <li>I will never ever stop using this amazing technology.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice plumpness.</li>
            <li>They are all nice, but always leave the question \\&quot;is</li>
            <li>Also, if anyone has used the machine on their face or head, it would be nice if they posted it.</li>
            <li>That is that nice thing about Amazon, you can share those experiences.  </li>
            <li>, if you are someone that goes to a Spa and gets facials, this is a cost effective alternative.  </li>
            <li>As it was summer and especially hot, I thought I was getting some kind of heat rash.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>The machine helped to relieve the puffiness with the first use and my skin looks great also.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking to keep your skin healthy this is the best treatment you can do for your skin long term - you will love the way it feels!</li>
            <li>, I gotta say Cle De Peau is my lately favorite, and I&#x27;m NOT going</li>
            <li>, I gotta say Cle De Peau is my lately favorite, and I&#x27;m NOT going</li>
            <li>Cheap and EZ with NO RISK!</li>
            <li>I know many people that it did not work as well for.  </li>
            <li>have had these most of my life;  </li>
            <li>This is a product that will help your skin get better and better over time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products from arbonne to shaklee to origins, etc.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find one person who has tried my device that didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>It cleanses, hydrates the skin giving it a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>But then they come out with a more efficient product and one reason they give for this increased efficiency is the improved face conductor.</li>
            <li>It would be interesting to know for everyone.</li>
            <li>since I have not used it for that yet), many people were living beyond their means.  </li>
            <li>or they can tell you where to get more gels etc.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love my Galvanic Spa &amp; ageLoc products.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li>Skin is clearer, more radiant, fine wrinkles from smoking and sun damage ELIMINATED.  </li>
            <li>Best money I have EVER spent.</li>
            <li>Treatments like these have been performed by estheticians for years for treatment of acne, psoriasis, fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>When you smooth out all the conversation (as this product smoothes out wrinkles, or claims to-</li>
            <li>I do concede it isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>My expression lines in my forehead have reduced significantly, as well as my frown lines.</li>
            <li>- I finally discovered that totally natural is best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say buy a nice silver spoon instead, because the micro currents actually brings out MORE Spider Veins that you never had b4 on your face...</li>
            <li>and it was virtually completely clean from using the device.  </li>
            <li>Now all I use is aloe vera gel (a certain brand with oxygen &amp; trace minerals added) and I don&#x27;t have to ask my daughter if my skin looks better now.</li>
            <li>The Galvanic Spa II device is a good, basic machine manufactured in China for Nu Skin Enterprises.  </li>
            <li>Rankine&#x27;s Remedies offers an affordable, effective alternative to the costly ageLOC gels.</li>
            <li>if you think you could get a full and luxurious set of hair...</li>
            <li>Husband uses it as well, he loved ageing younger.</li>
            <li>When I was approached at my health club and given this lengthy sales pitch, so full of promises</li>
            <li>Since she is a good customer and buys all their stuff, their is no reason for them to not try to make her happy, and find out what went wrong.</li>
            <li>Take a look at the various offerings on Amazon, see which one gives you the most value for you money, but also remember that eventually you are going to need to re-order supplies, so make sure you can get them from whomever you buy it from</li>
            <li>My skin is more firm, the texture is softer, and it is just getting better and better.</li>
            <li>The machine is working good except it has some minor scratch and looks like used.</li>
            <li>But what is most telling about this company is they refuse to sell the new face conductor separately.</li>
            <li>I know, I recently got myself a roller for that matter, any kind of roller will do ( face roller, massage roller preferably )</li>
            <li>What needs to be calculated is how it will benefit you and is it therefore worth it.</li>
            <li>If you do, and are going to buy something, then this might be the right choice for you.  </li>
            <li>AgeLOC is a blend of ingredients, readily available and used in many other products.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed when I first got this machine from NuSkin as it delivered benefits with my first use.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research first because I am a tru bona fide skeptic.  </li>
            <li>Safe galvanic current does.</li>
            <li>First they sell a product at a dramatically increased price (over $300) which some say cost about $50.</li>
            <li>I must say I was skeptical that this would work but after using the machine for 4 years now I can truly say it has been the best investment I have ever made in my skin!</li>
            <li>AgeLOC Galvanic Spa II is an very effective product for anti-aging in that it will extract debris from deep down and then infuse the skin with a patented product called AgeLOC.  </li>
            <li>The Spa generates 12 volts from the two 1.5 volt batteries, and is capable of reversing the polarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really needed some skin help</li>
            <li>Cheap and EZ with NO RISK!just happened to like experimenting skin products, I also have so much different skin care brands in my vanity room @</li>
            <li>really working?\\</li>
            <li>I used the Nu Skin Galvanic Spa and gels system for over 3 months and could see absolutely ZERO difference in the tone or tightness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>So for all of you loyal customers who have been supporting this company and using the old Galvanic Spa II, you have to buy a whole new Spa II to get the benefits of the new face conductor.</li>
            <li>ageLOC gels are very overpriced and there is nothing really new in the formulation.  </li>
            <li>probably our human skin cells just not ready for this kind of \\&quot;shock treatments\\&quot; yet.</li>
            <li>Something that really works, wow!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wanna reveal where I got mine, otherwise you&#x27;ll think I&#x27;m selling some stuff over the review section, but in terms of NuSkin, I&#x27;ll say their Tru Face series is MUST HAVE, also Tri-Phasic White series, 180 series, Face Lift formula, NaPCA Moisture Mist for all over body right after shower..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend a Jade Roller for face..</li>
            <li>just anything HIGH END!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just anything HIGH END!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To get the new face conductor you must spend another $300 for the whole new system.</li>
            <li>She thought the UNTREATED side looked a little better.</li>
            <li>(I did not want to waste more money on claims that don&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li>I was so determined to get my money&#x27;s worth out of this, but at last, I have to face the fact that I got scammed.  </li>
            <li>&quot; You can totally tell right after using the galvanic.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you want to feel foxy, young and radiant again!</li>
            <li>This is almost like a Soap Opera \\&quot;the continuing saga of Keira.\\&quot; In any case, I am glad she shared her experience, positive or negative.  </li>
            <li>All the hype about how this would plump my skin with new collagen production...</li>
            <li>My guess is that the gels are the problem and since my skin is pretty normal, I imagine a lot of others have had this same issue.  </li>
            <li>Just turned 63 and was aware of the galvanic spa benefits when I would go to get a facial.  </li>
            <li>It is done through consistent galvanic current.</li>
            <li>I usually buy my skin care from my doctors office and have been spoiled by being told truthfully what to expect from a product.  </li>
            <li>Now do you think that they make a new improved face conductor to work with the old model.</li>
            <li>According to the literature, the little machine provides the same results as the big machine at a fancy spa, with the only difference being you need to kiss your own rear end, instead of someone else doing it for you!</li>
            <li>So at the end of 5 weeks, I asked my 27 year old daughter to look close at my face to see if she could identify which side</li>
            <li>, then you&#x27;ll save yourself a risk being a spider vein-y old person.</li>
            <li>I have told so many people about it (as they have been asking about my skin lately) that I am beginning to think I should work for this company.  </li>
            <li>and my skin feels soft as a babies</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old and feel it has taken 10-15 years</li>
            <li>Has anyone been to a professional Spa with Galvanics, and also tried the Nu Skin machine?</li>
            <li>Maybe Keira can contact Nu Skin directly, tell them what happened, and get an answer.</li>
            <li>If you do not have \\&quot;discretionary income\\&quot; like Keira, you really have no business buying this sort of thing (especially in today&#x27;s economy).  </li>
            <li>grateful that I bought direct from a distributor as I got a wareety which I used at the 23 month mark for a spa head that stopped conducting -</li>
            <li>My personal experience is reduction in pigmentation, laugh lines are gone, reduction in crow&#x27;s feet, removed the furrows between my eyebrows and has helped immensely with sun damage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal &amp; regular customer of NuSkin/Pharmanex products, I literally ordered from them every single month, Yes!</li>
            <li>my home, YES, I&#x27;m r*ch enough to afford an en suite room for my beauty creams, and I&#x27;m young too!</li>
            <li>my home, YES, I&#x27;m r*ch enough to afford an en suite room for my beauty creams, and I&#x27;m young too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Becoming a distributor with Nu Skin will give you access to all products at 30% off plus if you utilize an ADR you will then get up to 20% in points to use on other products the first year.</li>
            <li>well I have them all plus more that I just tired typing..  </li>

            <li> &quot; You can totally tell right after using the galvanic.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you want to feel foxy, young and radiant again!</li>
            <li> This is almost like a Soap Opera \\&quot;the continuing saga of Keira.\\&quot; In any case, I am glad she shared her experience, positive or negative.  </li>
            <li> All the hype about how this would plump my skin with new collagen production...</li>
            <li> My guess is that the gels are the problem and since my skin is pretty normal, I imagine a lot of others have had this same issue.  </li>
            <li> Just turned 63 and was aware of the galvanic spa benefits when I would go to get a facial.  </li>
            <li> It is done through consistent galvanic current.</li>

            <li> I have told so many people about it (as they have been asking about my skin lately) that I am beginning to think I should work for this company.  </li>
            <li> and my skin feels soft as a babies</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old and feel it has taken 10-15 years</li>
            <li> Has anyone been to a professional Spa with Galvanics, and also tried the Nu Skin machine?</li>
            <li> Maybe Keira can contact Nu Skin directly, tell them what happened, and get an answer.</li>
            <li> If you do not have \\&quot;discretionary income\\&quot; like Keira, you really have no business buying this sort of thing (especially in today&#x27;s economy).  </li>
            <li> grateful that I bought direct from a distributor as I got a wareety which I used at the 23 month mark for a spa head that stopped conducting -</li>
            <li> My personal experience is reduction in pigmentation, laugh lines are gone, reduction in crow&#x27;s feet, removed the furrows between my eyebrows and has helped immensely with sun damage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal &amp; regular customer of NuSkin/Pharmanex products, I literally ordered from them every single month, Yes!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Becoming a distributor with Nu Skin will give you access to all products at 30% off plus if you utilize an ADR you will then get up to 20% in points to use on other products the first year.</li>

            <li> Made my face thin and ruined its plumpness in two days. Had to toss it took two weeks for my face to gain it&#x27;s nice plumpness. Last thing u want is lose face volume</li>
            <li> Yeah for Galvanics! It has totally helped my acne like nothing else I have tried. I had underground acne that other skin products could not get to. The Galvanics erased the line from my nose to my mouth and smoothed my rugged skin. I am so grateful I found this product!</li>
            <li> The Galvanic Spa II device is a good, basic machine manufactured in China for Nu Skin Enterprises.  The Spa generates 12 volts from the two 1.5 volt batteries, and is capable of reversing the polarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Spa is being used, the PIC microprocessor senses the current flow between the two electrodes (its tip and the skin), and regulates the amount of current flowing through and fixing it at about 200 micro amperes. It&#x27;s is not a trivial function because it involves input current sensing, and output current control, in a closed loop system. The microprocessor also generates the beeps, and controls the LCD display.  The program for the PIC is estimated at about 600 lines of code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is current modulation and current reversal built into the device.  But it is surprising that there is no pulses of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a well constructed device, and there are three integrated circuits (including the 3 volt to ±12 volt converter), 11 transistors inside, plus lots of capacitors, resistors, and inductors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One could probably duplicate the guts of the device for about $50 of electronic parts (the PIC16F72 is about $2.00).  Of course, it&#x27;s made in China, so the overall manufacturing cost for a single unit is probably around $40 when mass produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ageLOC gels are very overpriced and there is nothing really new in the formulation.  AgeLOC is a blend of ingredients, readily available and used in many other products.  Rankine&#x27;s Remedies offers an affordable, effective alternative to the costly ageLOC gels.</li>
            <li> I used the galvanic spa, as directed, several times a week for 5 weeks, but only on ONE SIDE OF MY FACE. (It is time consuming to use) I could never tell any difference whatsoever in my skin. So at the end of 5 weeks, I asked my 27 year old daughter to look close at my face to see if she could identify which side I used the galvanic on. She picked the WRONG SIDE! She thought the UNTREATED side looked a little better. I am 59 and I really needed some skin help - I finally discovered that totally natural is best. Now all I use is aloe vera gel (a certain brand with oxygen &amp; trace minerals added) and I don&#x27;t have to ask my daughter if my skin looks better now. I can see how good it looks myself everytime I look in the mirror! Firmer skin, smaller pores, skin tags almost gone, less lines, lighter age spots - and it&#x27;s only been about 30 days of use! I&#x27;ll tell you all about it. [...]</li>
            <li> I bought Galvanic Spa II @ a regular price without anybody cream/gel... so here is a good buy, BUT WAIT!!! I&#x27;ll say buy a nice silver spoon instead, because the micro currents actually brings out MORE Spider Veins that you never had b4 on your face... So you want spider veins on your face... GET IT!! Otherwise this product does nothing else a silver spoon can&#x27;t or if you like to spend money on a so called cellulite eraser device then get it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;m a loyal &amp; regular customer of NuSkin/Pharmanex products, I literally ordered from them every single month, Yes! I got the money for that! I used every high-end product (USD$100 or above) and mid-price product. Galvanic Spa System probably is the worst nightmare that you could ever done to you face/body, Not only it&#x27;ll shock every single vein to the surface on your skin plus it will made your skin feels \\&quot;dead\\&quot;.. probably our human skin cells just not ready for this kind of \\&quot;shock treatments\\&quot; yet. But for those who have tons of beauty steps at night like myself, it&#x27;s kinda frustrated to look for a roller or \\&quot;the last step booster\\&quot;... I know, I recently got myself a roller for that matter, any kind of roller will do ( face roller, massage roller preferably ), then you&#x27;ll save yourself a risk being a spider vein-y old person. Take my advice; just don&#x27;t get this device,&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t start with me by using Galvanic Spa System with NuSkin&#x27;s Nutriol® Hair Fitness Treatment... if you think you could get a full and luxurious set of hair... you don&#x27;t wanna know my result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I highly recommend a Jade Roller for face.. I don&#x27;t really wanna reveal where I got mine, otherwise you&#x27;ll think I&#x27;m selling some stuff over the review section, but in terms of NuSkin, I&#x27;ll say their Tru Face series is MUST HAVE, also Tri-Phasic White series, 180 series, Face Lift formula, NaPCA Moisture Mist for all over body right after shower.. well I have them all plus more that I just tired typing..  I do NOT work for NuSkin, I just happened to like experimenting skin products, I also have so much different skin care brands in my vanity room @ my home, YES, I&#x27;m r*ch enough to afford an en suite room for my beauty creams, and I&#x27;m young too! If you asked me which brand I like, I&#x27;ll say discover yourself, don&#x27;t limit your beauty regimens, put it on or put it on your feet, my theory is try it or trash it, but I gotta 2 convince you that I&#x27;m not working for NuSkin, I gotta say Cle De Peau is my lately favorite, and I&#x27;m NOT going 2 convince you I&#x27;m NOT working for Cle De Peau, OK! GOSH.. also I like AmorePacific, Chanel, Dior, Perricone, La Prairie etc..  just anything HIGH END!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a Roller! Cheap and EZ with NO RISK!just happened to like experimenting skin products, I also have so much different skin care brands in my vanity room @ my home, YES, I&#x27;m r*ch enough to afford an en suite room for my beauty creams, and I&#x27;m young too!

            <li> I have used my galvanic face spa for 4 years and it definitely lifts my \\&quot;jowels\\&quot; below my cheeks, around my mouth.  Also my pores are basically invisible and it looks like I always have facials.  My skin was tested for bacteria and cleanliness, etc. and it was virtually completely clean from using the device.  I lost mine with luggage and am bummed to see my skin start sagging again.  I know many people that it did not work as well for.  My intial demo was on one side of my face and there was a BIG difference.  I used it twice a week for 5 minutes at a time for each gel.</li>
            <li> It works!  Skin is clearer, more radiant, fine wrinkles from smoking and sun damage ELIMINATED.  I have told so many people about it (as they have been asking about my skin lately) that I am beginning to think I should work for this company.  I bought stock as well.</li>
            <li> Just turned 63 and was aware of the galvanic spa benefits when I would go to get a facial.  I was amazed when I first got this machine from NuSkin as it delivered benefits with my first use.  I have bags under my eyes and dark circles;  have had these most of my life;  it&#x27;s an inherited thing.  The machine helped to relieve the puffiness with the first use and my skin looks great also.  Yeah NuSkin</li>
            <li> I have been using the galvanic spa and gels for over a year, my skin has had a dramatic improvment. This is a product that will help your skin get better and better over time. You&#x27;re not going to see dramatic results in a week, have patience it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> The Galvanic Spa is the best thing I have ever used. I&#x27;ve tried many products from arbonne to shaklee to origins, etc. They are all nice, but always leave the question \\&quot;is it really working?\\&quot; You can totally tell right after using the galvanic. My skin is more firm, the texture is softer, and it is just getting better and better. My expression lines in my forehead have reduced significantly, as well as my frown lines. I have also been on prescription medications for acne since I was a teen, and this product has dramatically cleared my skin up. I am a total believer. You definitely want to use it with the gels, they work with the device to produce results. Nu skin also has a great return policy - they guarantee you will see results, so go for it.  Not sure what the woman in the spider vein comment is talking about. I have yet to find one person who has tried my device that didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> This is a greedy lying crappy product making it a disgrace to be here sold on amazon. It is Overpriced crap that doesnt work. I tryed this product for a month doing only one arm to see if there was a diffrence with photos to see the diffrence, there was no diffrence. The photos online with the diffrence between the arms was done by just tighting up the muscles in the arms. Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> I think this is the most awesome product on this earth.  I tried it and saw results in ten minutes and was totally dumbfounded.  Something that really works, wow!  This day and age, you buy something and it doesn&#x27;t work and it ends up broken and thrown away.  Not this thing, it gets rid of my wrinkles, grows my husband hair, gets rid of my cellulite on my legs and my angel wings under my arms.  I know some people who use two of these at the same time!  Proof is in the pudding, you won&#x27;t believe it until you see it! I did a lot of research first because I am a tru bona fide skeptic.  I was impressed by their 20 million dollars in research and 125 scientist on the panel.  Yes, I bought it, I like it and I do it twice a week to look great!</li>
            <li> I started using the Galvanic Spa from the day I saw it, and I have absolutely LOVED the results, I look younger today at 50  than I did when I was 35 and my skin feels soft as a babies bum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughters have been using it as long as I have and it has helped them through the years of troubled skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Husband uses it as well, he loved ageing younger.</li>
            <li> AgeLOC Galvanic Spa II is an very effective product for anti-aging in that it will extract debris from deep down and then infuse the skin with a patented product called AgeLOC.  The galvanic spa itself is the device you use to deliver product deep into the dermis.  It is done through consistent galvanic current. Treatments like these have been performed by estheticians for years for treatment of acne, psoriasis, fine lines and wrinkles.  It cleanses, hydrates the skin giving it a healthy glow.  Manually you cannot accomplish this topically by hand because your skin care product cannot pentrate deep down into the dermis.  Safe galvanic current does. My personal experience is reduction in pigmentation, laugh lines are gone, reduction in crow&#x27;s feet, removed the furrows between my eyebrows and has helped immensely with sun damage.  I use it twice a week with the ageLOC gels. I am 56 years old and feel it has taken 10-15 years off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Becoming a distributor with Nu Skin will give you access to all products at 30% off plus if you utilize an ADR you will then get up to 20% in points to use on other products the first year. Second year the ADR will raise to 30%.  Substantial savings.  Your warranty on the spa itself is 2 years.  Your guarantee from the Nu Skin company is 90 days on any AgeLOC product.</li>
            <li> Having taken a look at their marketing scheme, this company is greedy. First they sell a product at a dramatically increased price (over $300) which some say cost about $50. to make. Okay that&#x27;s not too bad. That&#x27;s capitalism. But then they come out with a more efficient product and one reason they give for this increased efficiency is the improved face conductor. Now do you think that they make a new improved face conductor to work with the old model. Of course the answer is no. To get the new face conductor you must spend another $300 for the whole new system. I am not sure whether the new face conductor will work with the old system. When I asked I got conflicting answers from their company. One person thought no and another thought yes. But what is most telling about this company is they refuse to sell the new face conductor separately. So for all of you loyal customers who have been supporting this company and using the old Galvanic Spa II, you have to buy a whole new Spa II to get the benefits of the new face conductor. I call this greed.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0015OGO3M Galvanic Spa System II (White)]] Please note that the unit sold here only has \\&quot;3\\&quot; attachments.  I included the product insert link for the current units that come with \\&quot;four\\&quot; attachments.      Now let me respond to Keira: I am sorry Keira had a bad experience. I had a very good experience with the Galvanic Machine using the Nutriol Hair stuff. I got hair! Will it work for everyone, of course not, but it worked for me. No where in Keira&#x27;s review does she mention ever going to a Spa. With all the money she has, I wonder why? According to the literature, the little machine provides the same results as the big machine at a fancy spa, with the only difference being you need to kiss your own rear end, instead of someone else doing it for you! I have not used it on my face yet, but I might! I tried it for the potential hair growth! Has anyone been to a professional Spa with Galvanics, and also tried the Nu Skin machine? Can you post a comment, so we all have a comparison! Maybe Keira can contact Nu Skin directly, tell them what happened, and get an answer. Since she is a good customer and buys all their stuff, their is no reason for them to not try to make her happy, and find out what went wrong. It would be interesting to know for everyone. Also, if anyone has used the machine on their face or head, it would be nice if they posted it. There is plenty of literature on Nu Skin, I read alot of it before I got the device (I did not want to waste more money on claims that don&#x27;t work). Maybe I am the exception rather than the rule, but it is working for me. I hope Keira&#x27;s spider veins go away. Maybe she can let us know what happened, or what she did to get rid of them, or did they go away by themselves. This is almost like a Soap Opera \\&quot;the continuing saga of Keira.\\&quot; In any case, I am glad she shared her experience, positive or negative.  No matter what the technology, method, treatment etc. there is always going to be different experiences for different people.  That is that nice thing about Amazon, you can share those experiences.  Based on common sense, if you are someone that goes to a Spa and gets facials, this is a cost effective alternative.  If you are spending money every month on hair growth stuff, take the shot with this.  According to the literature, it increases absorption up to 70% with whatever you use, so no real downside.  If you do not have \\&quot;discretionary income\\&quot; like Keira, you really have no business buying this sort of thing (especially in today&#x27;s economy).  When you smooth out all the conversation (as this product smoothes out wrinkles, or claims to- since I have not used it for that yet), many people were living beyond their means.  If you do not have an extra $300 bucks, don&#x27;t buy it.  If you do, and are going to buy something, then this might be the right choice for you.  Take a look at the various offerings on Amazon, see which one gives you the most value for you money, but also remember that eventually you are going to need to re-order supplies, so make sure you can get them from whomever you buy it from or they can tell you where to get more gels etc.  There seems to be plenty of offerings all over the internet, or you might even want to hook up with a Nu Skin Distributor, up to you.  Hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> I received my order and one piece was missing however after contacting the distributor directly, they forwarded the missing piece in a separate order.  I was happy with the outcome and the service.</li>
            <li> The machine is working good except it has some minor scratch and looks like used. The product works wonder. I love it.</li>
            <li> I must say I was skeptical that this would work but after using the machine for 4 years now I can truly say it has been the best investment I have ever made in my skin! I used to have blemishes and rough dry patchy skin that would actually flake and feel uncomfortable with seasonal changes - this has cleared up completely and I regularly get compliments on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;So grateful that I bought direct from a distributor as I got a wareety which I used at the 23 month mark for a spa head that stopped conducting - my spa is still going strong!! If you are looking to keep your skin healthy this is the best treatment you can do for your skin long term - you will love the way it feels!</li>
            <li> The are the worst send me facial spa instead GALVANIC SPA II  like they show in the picture</li>
            <li> I usually buy my skin care from my doctors office and have been spoiled by being told truthfully what to expect from a product.  When I was approached at my health club and given this lengthy sales pitch, so full of promises, I guess I thought they were the same caliber as my doctor&#x27;s group.  Not so.  After I bought the package I never heard from the sales person again.  After spending almost $400...nothing. I used the Nu Skin Galvanic Spa and gels system for over 3 months and could see absolutely ZERO difference in the tone or tightness of my skin.  All the hype about how this would plump my skin with new collagen production...I saw nothing.  What I did get however, were big red bumps that broke out on my face, repeatedly.  As it was summer and especially hot, I thought I was getting some kind of heat rash.  Finally a trip to the dermatologist suggested that I was allergic to something I was using. When I stopped using the Nu Skin system, my skin cleared up.  I&#x27;m 58 and have used a lot of different skin care products over the years and never once have I had an allergic reaction to anything.  When I tracked down an email address to contact the sales person, she told me that another client of hers had the same reaction and that I needed to spritz water on my face before applying the gel and again over the gel.  I tried that and it made no difference.  My guess is that the gels are the problem and since my skin is pretty normal, I imagine a lot of others have had this same issue.  I was so determined to get my money&#x27;s worth out of this, but at last, I have to face the fact that I got scammed.  This product is virtually worthless, unless you can put a value on big red bumps that take weeks to completely go away.</li>
            <li> Save your money- at least find a company that has a properly working product. Nu skin is about the hype not the value.</li>
            <li> It works. Keep it simple and deal in facts. Go to see a demo and ignore any marketing rhetoric. You will see the results of lifted firmer skin. I do concede it isn&#x27;t cheap. What needs to be calculated is how it will benefit you and is it therefore worth it.</li>
            <li> I love my Galvanic Spa &amp; ageLoc products. I use the galvanic spa 2x /week and look 10 years younger, my friends say 15 years younger! They all think I had a facelift. My skin is firm, wrinkles diminished, skin tone is even and radiates like a baby. I will never ever stop using this amazing technology. I&#x27;ve spent $1000&#x27;s at face spas on their million dollar machines. I invested $360 and have used it every week for 2 years. And it&#x27;s still going strong! Best money I have EVER spent. Highly recommend if you want to feel foxy, young and radiant again!</li>
