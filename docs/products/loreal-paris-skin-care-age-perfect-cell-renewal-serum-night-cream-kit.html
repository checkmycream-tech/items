            <li>Great product, I&#x27;ll keep it in my rotation.</li>
            <li>Smells great but seems to leave my skin oily feeling and shiny looking.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This product is moisterizing, the price is fair and the packaging is attractive.</li>
            <li>Liked this product a lot!</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and bright.</li>
            <li>feels good when applied -</li>
            <li>Feels good on your skin</li>
            <li>she has used high end serums before and says this works just as great loreal serums are great priced for what they can do!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this serum since they introduced it and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Outstanding products!</li>
            <li>Have been using it 5 months now and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I had once tried a VERY high priced serum which was wonderful -- but who can afford it to use on an on-going basis.</li>
            <li>The product does feel great, leaving a smooth silky feel...just wish it didn&#x27;t have the perfume scent.  </li>
            <li>Smelled nice but not 1 wrinkle went anywhere.</li>
            <li>However the lotion is still nice.</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells - pleasant, but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Makeup applies better.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product but it did nothing that it reads.</li>
            <li>It seems to just sit on the skin and it didn&#x27;t make my skin any more radiant, as it claims that it does.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even imagine putting makeup on over the top of this product.</li>
            <li>It looks brighter and just better....</li>
            <li>more taut?  </li>
            <li>I threw it away after many uses because it smelled like alcohol and not moisturising at all.</li>
            <li>I love it, I used morning and night.</li>
            <li>or I find something better that I can afford.</li>
            <li>This is the 1st face serum i have used more than two week, I&#x27;m into my 4th bottle.  </li>
            <li>I am normally a huge fan of this brand, I expect more from this brand.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t linger, thankfully, but it really does not smell good when going on.</li>
            <li>Also bottle did not seem completely full?!</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily, isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>Great price and super fast shipping, thank you so much!</li>
            <li>is looking good for her age and due to great serums and protecting early!</li>
            <li>There is a golden shine to this that brightens your skin when you apply it, giving you a glow.  </li>
            <li>I use it day and night right after cleansing</li>
            <li>so I have only been able to use it once.  </li>
            <li>and I love this product; especially for the price point!</li>
            <li>One start to see the differences in yopur skin almost since the first application</li>
            <li>Way too much scent, no one needs that much perfume on their FACE, and there are pretty large glitter particles, I assume that is the &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really like how this seems to refine my 65 year-old skin.  </li>
            <li>I started with 4 stars because there is an overpowering fragrance that is almost too much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not worrying as much now.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping&lt;br</li>
            <li>i ordered this for my mother which is 42 years old and she loves this!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it for the first month to see how lasting the effects are</li>
            <li>What I can say so far is that it does have an immediate effect.  </li>
            <li>and I doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time - 1 pump covers my whole face.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and while there was a touch of burning I did exfoliate before using it is so it is possible</li>
            <li>After using for about 6 weeks my wrinkles are less noticeable and my skin is much softer.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great serum. Makeup applies better. My friends are using as well. This was for my wife.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product but it did nothing that it reads. Smelled nice but not 1 wrinkle went anywhere. Skip it.</li>
            <li> Great price and super fast shipping, thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum since they introduced it and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product. Why do companies put fragrance into their skincare products? This product has a heavy musky scent and it smells like something a man would wear. The scent doesn&#x27;t linger, thankfully, but it really does not smell good when going on. It seems to just sit on the skin and it didn&#x27;t make my skin any more radiant, as it claims that it does. It wasn&#x27;t as greasy as the day lotion, but it still feels greasy on my face hours later. I can&#x27;t even imagine putting makeup on over the top of this product. Not a fan and I would never buy.</li>
            <li> I really like how this seems to refine my 65 year-old skin.  It looks brighter and just better....more taut?  Maybe!  I will buy it again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> The product does feel great, leaving a smooth silky feel...just wish it didn&#x27;t have the perfume scent.  Bottle arrived without manufacture pkg-just the bottle with scan label on it which left a sticky residue when peeled off.  Also bottle did not seem completely full?!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. Too drying on my skin and the perfume smell is so heavy I feel like I sprayed perfume in my mouth</li>
            <li> great product for smoothing the texture of your skin</li>
            <li> great for skin goes on well</li>
            <li> I threw it away after many uses because it smelled like alcohol and not moisturising at all.</li>
            <li> Not the product I ordered (I wanted the oil).  However the lotion is still nice.</li>
            <li> This is excellent serum. I had once tried a VERY high priced serum which was wonderful -- but who can afford it to use on an on-going basis. I kept trying others and when I tried this ... for me , it is as close as I can get to what was unaffordable for repeat use.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, there&#x27;s a visible improvement in my skin.  It absorbs easily, isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  Great product, I&#x27;ll keep it in my rotation.</li>
            <li> i ordered this for my mother which is 42 years old and she loves this! she has used high end serums before and says this works just as great loreal serums are great priced for what they can do! she has not one tiny wrinkle expression line or anything her face is looking good for her age and due to great serums and protecting early!</li>
            <li> Softer skin,that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I only have a sample size, won&#x27;t finish the sample and won&#x27;t purchase. Way too much scent, no one needs that much perfume on their FACE, and there are pretty large glitter particles, I assume that is the &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34; part but the target market for this product isn&#x27;t trying to walk around with glitter all over our faces. Huge fail. I am normally a huge fan of this brand, I expect more from this brand.</li>
            <li> Smells great but seems to leave my skin oily feeling and shiny looking.  I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again</li>
            <li> This is an initial review.  I just received the product today so I have only been able to use it once.  What I can say so far is that it does have an immediate effect.  There is a golden shine to this that brightens your skin when you apply it, giving you a glow.  I started with 4 stars because there is an overpowering fragrance that is almost too much.  I will continue to use it for the first month to see how lasting the effects are but it will be hard to ignore the smell.  I have incredibly sensitive skin and while there was a touch of burning I did exfoliate before using it is so it is possible it is not from the serum (but also possible it is since it is heavily perfumed).  I will update this review in a month.</li>
            <li> Terrific product smoothed out my skin.  Would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is moisterizing, the price is fair and the packaging is attractive.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells - pleasant, but not too strong.  I use it day and night right after cleansing and I have noticed increased smoothness and improved skin texture.  This serum also leaves a subtle &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my skin.  During the humid months here in upstate NY, I can still use it because it has a sheer, lightweight feeling, I just don&#x27;t use a moisturizer over it. I&#x27;m heading toward 50 and I love this product; especially for the price point! Lasts a long time - 1 pump covers my whole face.</li>
            <li> feels good when applied - it broke my face out a bit - but it could just my sensitivity</li>
            <li> After using for about 6 weeks my wrinkles are less noticeable and my skin is much softer.  I am going to keep using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. My skin feels smoother and bright. I love it, I used morning and night. One start to see the differences in yopur skin almost since the first application</li>
            <li> Feels good on your skin and I think it has made my skin smoother.  Now it may be my imagination but I think the hair on my temples has been revived.  It seems to be fluffier.  I&#x27;m not worrying as much now.  That&#x27;s just my opinion.  Doesn&#x27;t grow hair.  Don&#x27;t get the wrong idea.  I think I&#x27;ll be using this product for awhile until my skin gets use to it or I find something better that I can afford. LOL!</li>
            <li> Liked this product a lot! It goes on smoothly and I doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it since it came out.  It is excellent.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Ks</li>
            <li> Outstanding products! This is the 1st face serum i have used more than two week, I&#x27;m into my 4th bottle.  Have been using it 5 months now and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Seems to moisturize a lot of area with a very little bit of product.</li>
