    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product is really wonderful....</li>
            <li>lemme tell ya :D :D &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>so I am very impressed at the size of my pores when I wake up in the morning after using this product.</li>
            <li>and i have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li>Incredible product a must have!!!</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I bought it at Nordstrom where I knew the return policy was incredible - that way if it doesn&#x27;t work out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible.  </li>
            <li>I know that word is greatly overused.</li>
            <li>and I feel great about myself.     </li>
            <li>Because I want to show everyone how happy I am with this product after just one use.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m happy with product.    </li>
            <li>so, this seemed like a great solution for me.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I think everyone with skin problems should give this a good faithful try.</li>
            <li>I think everyone with skin problems should give this a good faithful try.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I still look great by end of day in the heat of the AZ Summer....</li>
            <li>So no wonder that I am very satisfied with the price.</li>
            <li>This product (light) matches my skin tone perfectly, and conceals my pores, fine lines, and redness.</li>
            <li>My skin has NEVER looked this amazing.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s MORE smooth and glowy, and I am very happy :)  </li>
            <li>The tint makes it nice</li>
            <li>I take the cap off and use my own sponge to apply it.  </li>
            <li>As another reviewer said, it&#x27;s a bonus to have your skin looking nice at night.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely the best make up (night &amp; day), I have ever tried (I&#x60;m 55).</li>
            <li>My face has never been better, it&#x27;s pretty close to flawless and it took about 2 weeks to turn things around.   </li>
            <li>I am thoroughly impressed and am glad there are absolutely no negative side effects (like some exfoliants)in this product.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to be the first person to review this product.</li>
            <li>But again, I thought it seemed too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>My skin is glowy and very very smooth.  </li>
            <li>And my skin (besides my forehead) is already very smooth and glowy.  </li>
            <li>and I could swear my skin tone looks more even.  </li>
            <li>I was oily and I seemed to need more makeup...</li>
            <li>I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li>(but I must make sure I have washed my face with a face wash..</li>
            <li>89% felt their skin was firmer and more resilient -</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I used proactiv and it was ok, but I still had acne.   </li>
            <li>When i started using this product immediately i noticed smaller pores and the best part of it all no acne.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more from a beauty product, although if it was a bit cheaper I think they&#x27;d find more women out there could realistically stick to using this for years and years.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it</li>
            <li>I tend to break out on my chin, and to top it all off</li>
            <li>but I do love this product.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so not only is this an excellent product for reducing pore size, but it got rid of all my razor burn!</li>
            <li>So women out there whose husbands have a problem with razor burn, this product is outstanding for it..</li>
            <li>I find that it works even better with the Cosmedicine line, which you can get at any Sephora..</li>
            <li>I love it on top of my eyelids, though.  </li>
            <li>My eyeliner sticks better, my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t crease, and my mascara doesn&#x27;t rub off onto my eyelids like it used to.</li>
            <li>was nervous that with the minerals on my face my skin wouldn&#x27;t be able to breathe at night, thus leading to a breakout, but this has not been the case.</li>
            <li>Rather, my skin is looking SO much better-</li>
            <li>ago, I haven&#x27;t touched anything else, and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>since there many people that claim that it does wonders for them...</li>
            <li>i now have more cystic acne than i&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li>The longer I have used it, the better my skin appears.  </li>
            <li>With a month&#x27;s use, my skin continues to get better each day.  </li>
            <li>This is fabulous &amp; well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>This product calms my skin down and makes it look beautiful for bed, which is nice for my husband too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the benefits over continued use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the benefits over continued use!</li>
            <li>It claims to increase skin luminosity, and I think it does make my face reflect more light and appear more even.</li>
            <li>The minerals went into my skin really smoothly and felt nice and extremely light- not like wearing makeup at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to wake up with a fresh looking face.  </li>
            <li>, I thought it was great too to be able to use it at night and actually have some sort of makeup on to even skin out</li>
            <li>A side note too - if you do have problem skin, the coverage of the product to wear to bed is great for helping you feel better about your skin at night - even if you&#x27;re the only one who sees it!</li>
            <li>my son uses this to cover a little acne; easy to apply, good for your skin &amp; good for your self esteem :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest the first year or two</li>
            <li>From July 14, 2009 to July 20, 2009 go to[...] and save 50% on RareMinerals Skin Revival Treatment, plus they include a free sample of the RareMinerals moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The pillow puff applicator does a great job distributing just enough of the product in an even manner.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great and I will definitely re-purchase.</li>
            <li>If that wasn&#x27;t great enough it also helps with lines on my face!!</li>
            <li>It is not heavy, and it feels good to wear.</li>
            <li>While it does add a touch of color or rather a glow to the skin (there is a clear version too), I didn&#x27;t feel like I looked like I was wearing makeup, which was good.  </li>
            <li>I at 49, with reasonably good skin, but I wanted to try this new intriguing product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, but I noticed after the first use I kept coughing, like I had some dust in my lungs.</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s just the unique application process that makes it float in the air around my nose and mouth.    </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product so far, and I will update in a while to see if it&#x27;s still working.</li>
            <li>This is a POWDER, powder that does not get absorbed, powder that clogs pores!  </li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t change anything else in my skincare routine, so i&#x27;m pretty confident that the skin revival treatment is the cause.</li>
            <li>so I was quite excited when I saw this treatment.  </li>
            <li>I make sure I wait until my nightly moisturizer has been absorbed into my skin for about 15 minutes or so before using the Rare Minerals</li>
            <li>Im sure that all the amazing claims are true, but I just dont see a big difference.  </li>
            <li>Also, the spongy top gets very yucky if you don&#x27;t clean it.  </li>
            <li>I like using this when i&#x27;m at home on the weekends during the days too when i dont want to put on full make up and just want some color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certainly starting to notice some changes with my fair skin.</li>
            <li>It soaks up excess oil, and makes your skin feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 months already and to tell you that I dont see amazing results!!!!!!!The reviews on here are so good that i was compelled to try it, being a daily user of the bare products anyway.  </li>
            <li>I was a real skeptic, but I&#x27;m so glad I tried Rare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>What I can tell is that my skin actually feels so nice and smooth after putting it on.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I need to quickly put some makeup on.  </li>
            <li>I am a lotion and potion junkie, most creams don&#x27;t excite me, this one has because its so easy and actually makes you look and feel better WHEN ITS ON, not worse.</li>
            <li>Use it consistently every night and you&#x27;ll see a difference!</li>
            <li>It certainly wasn&#x27;t cheap, but now that I&#x27;m 31</li>
            <li>AFTER: routine is to put on Rare Minerals before bed...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll apply the rare minerals blemish therapy to my spots.    </li>
            <li>I am so thrilled I can&#x27;t say enough..</li>
            <li>Within a month&#x27;s time, my face stopped breaking out and it looked clear and healthy.</li>
            <li>It is the Rare Minerals.</li>
            <li>Started using rare minerals 3 nights ago and it gave me pimples.  </li>
            <li>I found the literature compelling and the reviews encouraging.  </li>
            <li>about another couple months worth of product</li>
            <li>Most products claim to reduce the \\&quot;appearance\\&quot; of pore size which basically means your pores look smaller because they are now filled with silicone.  </li>
            <li>Clear would have been a better choice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice to go to bed, after having cleansed my face, and look into the mirror and see a glowing complexion looking back.</li>
            <li>Anyway, overall my skin is pretty good, I just always search for a light treatment at night to improve it if I can while I am still young.  </li>
            <li>Yes it makes me look good when i go to bed, but I dont see the pour reduction, glow, or any of the things that other people have claimed.</li>
            <li>guess I am doing it right.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge huge fan of Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>Clean face with something gentle like aveeno face wash, or cetafil   </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals night treatment was just \\&quot;another product\\&quot; but I figured I try it because it didn&#x27;t have the acids or chemicals that many acne treating cleansers</li>
            <li>In general I&#x27;ve noticed a much more even skin tone.</li>
            <li>love Bare Minerals makeup</li>
            <li>So, fine lines are not an issue, but my pores are naturally huge, especially around my nose.  </li>
            <li>I certainly LOOK healthier!</li>
            <li>yesterday, I looked at myself in the mirror (about 7 a.m.) and actually asked \\&quot;did I wash my face last night?\\&quot; meaning my skin looked great</li>
            <li>The mirror on top is more decorative than useful since it is too small to see my whole face.</li>
            <li>was I really getting the product on my face evenly?!</li>
            <li>Thanks, BE!</li>
            <li>My skin is combination, but pretty oily in the T-zone area.</li>
            <li>&gt; THe first 2 nights</li>
            <li>Many people asked me what I was doing differently.</li>
            <li>First week use</li>
            <li>After I became aware of what I was doing it has not been a problem since.</li>
            <li>After the first night it got rid of ALL of it.</li>
            <li>I have tried various illuminating powders &amp; creams that looked more like glitter than glow, but this product makes my skin glow.      </li>
            <li>I put my eye cream on first, wait about 5 mins.</li>
            <li>The first night, as soon as I put it on, I saw an improvement, and thought it was just the opacity of the product.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, I have just had 1 pimple when I used to have 6 to 8 typically around \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My face is so clear and healthy, and it clearly works just as well on men!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I have noticed too much a change in fine lines, but with the other results I have noticed, I strongly recommend this product if you have combination skin and a problem with redness.</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Escentuals foundation for about a year, and it has made a huge improvement with my skin in texture and reduction of breakouts.  </li>
            <li>also have to mention that pretty much every vitamin or mineral ever revealed to benefit or enhance the appearance of you skin</li>
            <li>Here we are over a year later (August 2007) and I am still loving Rare Minerals Skin Treatment; it actually delivers what it promises!</li>
            <li>(There&#x27;s details on the website but the coupon codes are REVIVAL and PURE.)</li>
            <li>and I think my biggest frustration is my large pores.</li>
            <li>Combating large pot-hole size pores was the reason I tried this product.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and I&#x27;m using the clear version of this - which actually makes me look slightly tanned (for me).  </li>
            <li>It feels &amp; looks nice on but is a little spendy for use just as makeup.  </li>
            <li>I love the Bare Escentuals line and have used the Bare Minerals foundation for over 2 years now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really out of my price range, but I received mine as part of a gift set for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Was anything really coming out of the applicator?</li>
            <li>so I can see if it&#x27;s really on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did take about 4 nights use before I could see a difference, but there really is something to this.  </li>
            <li>This treatment along with my Clean/Clear moisturizer has really improved my skin.</li>
            <li>BEFORE: skin was very BLAH in the a.m.</li>
            <li>2-3 times per week use a gentle exfoliating cleanser like St. Ives Apricot scrub  Every night, use the night treatment puff</li>
            <li>My skin is normally very oily in the morning</li>
            <li>and I have got to say, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>So, its a great product for people who hate heavy creams on their face and it does give skin a great smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>so if someone stops by after I have washed my face for the night or before I am ready in the morning</li>
            <li>My mom bought this for me because I really wanted to try it but felt that it was too spendy.</li>
            <li>I have been using Rare Minerals for nearly three weeks.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>$60 is not too much money.</li>
            <li>So much so that I stopped using the prescription rosacea treatment I got from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>The next day when I washed my face, though, it genuinely seemed smoother.  </li>
            <li>we have to pay three time as much for the product.</li>
            <li>I think $60 is too much to pay for this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is oily/acne prone in the T-Zone with large pores and normal along the cheeks.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that has ever actually made them appear smaller; so overall, I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that has ever actually made them appear smaller; so overall, I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I have the product in Clear color, so at first it was like a placebo -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this skin treatment for about 2 months (and not that consistently at that) and those marks are completely gone.</li>
            <li>In hopes of diminishing some of the fine lines I&#x27;ve developed in my 30s, and even further improving my skin, I took a gamble on this RareMinerals treatment.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE A WHOLE NEW FACE!!!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>but I wonder if the Philosophy supernatural makeup replacement sponges would work for this.  </li>
            <li>so its hard to tell, I am sure it will last long so the price is OK for me as compared to most creams out there if it streches use over a long time.  </li>
            <li>I originally thought I would buy the product once and keep moving on to the next thing as I have with so many other products, but despite the price I will definitely repurchase this product when I run out.  </li>
            <li>I will buy it myself next time, it it totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>I come home from work and wash my face, put this on and have no problem greeting neighbors or drop by guests, as I normally would have.</li>
            <li>Daily Mositurizer, wait 5 minutes, and then apply Rare Minerals.</li>
            <li>Then, apply the product by removing the lid and \\&quot;click\\&quot; or twist the spongy puff to the right to open the slow-release powder into the applicator.</li>
            <li>Currently 25 - have had pimple outbreaks since I turned 19 and have been trying different products ever since along with clean diets, colonics, drinking tons of water, homeopathy, whole food nutritional suplements, cleanses - ANd NO RESULTS.  </li>
            <li>purchased the Rare Minerals night time treatment in Clear last Friday, May 12th and have used it faithfully every night since.</li>
            <li>The first one doesn&#x27;t help me with my problem but the 2nd one suggests that I apply the product with a brush instead of the applicator.  </li>
            <li>We had a couple of really hot days last week, and the thought of putting on foundation and having it slide off...</li>
            <li>Wow!...</li>
            <li>In the day, sometimes I might have a new pimple or even an old one that&#x27;s still healing</li>
            <li>Of course, there was a tiny little bit of negativity in the back of my mind, telling me the only thing that&#x27;s going to make my rosacea better is most likely the prescriptions I have from my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>Sure, I still have red areas, but they&#x27;re getting less noticable over time.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the nice coverage it provides, I noticed over time my pores were smaller around my nose, my skin is infinitely smoother and MUCH less red.  </li>
            <li>In the morning my skin is clear and radiant.  </li>
            <li>So, I got the clear</li>
            <li>But, I have clear</li>
            <li>I use the clear one, because the goal isn&#x27;t to look like a chick.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help clear up my pimples.  </li>
            <li>but after nearly 60 days of diligent use I can say it does work....</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s has a powder application that makes your skin feel fluffly and soft (not greasy and sticky) before you go to bed.  </li>
            <li>My skin became sensitive to touch</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about two months now, and it has made a considerable difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>so you can actually see where this is being applied and how much.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and looks airbrushed.      </li>
            <li>I was worried it would rub off on my pillowcase, but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed that at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 41 years old.</li>
            <li>Having the product pass through that thickness of sponge makes me think that most of it gets trapped in the middle, which seems wasteful.  </li>
            <li>it is a bit irritating to apply (kind of a blotting motion)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s got a hefty little price tag, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s totally worth it!   </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t do well for the fine lines and puffiness under my eyes, so I use very little, if any there.      </li>
            <li>younger, brighter, smoother, and more even-toned, in just a few weeks!   </li>
            <li>The price tag on this product was holding me back from trying it, but this week I was surprised to find that now I can sample the RareMinerals without having to worry about a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>I cannot comment on the overall appearance of my skin because I do not know if it is because of this or my normal skin care regimine.</li>
            <li>I also recommend when trying a new beauty product to keep the rest of your beauty routine constant-</li>
            <li>Use it consistently every night and you&#x27;ll see a difference!so achieving other results.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2 days and have already noticed my face looks much more refined, pores less noticable and less flaky skin.</li>
            <li>wakeup, shower, bare minerals primer, and a little Rare Minerals before my make up....</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish is that the jar was clear so you knew when you were running out.  </li>
            <li>This is my skin care routine before bedtime- wash with Clearasil Daily Wash, apply eye cream around my eyes, apply Aveeno Clear Complexion ( 0.5% Salicylic Acid )</li>
            <li>I have used Bare Minerals/Rare Minerals for two years.</li>
            <li>I like Oil of Olay Regenerist products also, but they take much longer to show results, and all three products cost about the same amount as this single product and it doesn&#x27; require multiple steps.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend trying it for at least a few weeks and think most people should see a difference in their skin and their overall appearance.</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive when I first heard of this product...sleeping in a powder?</li>
            <li>its impossible to tell if a new product is advantageous if you&#x27;re trying more than one new product at a time.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll get a color other than \\&quot;clear\\&quot; so that I can tell how much I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>When it runs out I won&#x27;t purchase it again &amp; will go back to using my Bare Minerals makeup for day instead.</li>
            <li>I came here to look and see if anything was actually going on as applicator seems to barely deliver and product to sponge,</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t reccommend the Bare Minerals make-up enough.</li>
            <li>I am not one to spend $60 dollars on facial product, but as a Bare Escentuals  fan I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li>but my skin is still pretty firm since I am 28.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 30s with combination skin, big pores, uneven texture and rarely have breakout.  </li>
            <li>I told the woman at the store where I bought it that I absolutely did not want anything that would mess up my skin.  </li>
            <li>The other thing I reccomend is using a shade darker than your normal foundation</li>
            <li>I am 37, with somewhat oily skin, medium to large pores, and a few blemishes from time to time.</li>
            <li>I have large pores, an oily T-zone, occasional acne and uneven skin tone.</li>

            <li> Incredible product a must have!!!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I bought it at Nordstrom where I knew the return policy was incredible - that way if it doesn&#x27;t work out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredible.  </li>
            <li> I know that word is greatly overused.</li>
            <li> and I feel great about myself.     </li>
            <li> Because I want to show everyone how happy I am with this product after just one use.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m happy with product.    </li>
            <li> so, this seemed like a great solution for me.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I think everyone with skin problems should give this a good faithful try.</li>
            <li> I think everyone with skin problems should give this a good faithful try.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I still look great by end of day in the heat of the AZ Summer....</li>
            <li> So no wonder that I am very satisfied with the price.</li>
            <li> This product (light) matches my skin tone perfectly, and conceals my pores, fine lines, and redness.</li>
            <li> My skin has NEVER looked this amazing.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s MORE smooth and glowy, and I am very happy :)  </li>
            <li> The tint makes it nice</li>
            <li> I take the cap off and use my own sponge to apply it.  </li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, it&#x27;s a bonus to have your skin looking nice at night.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely the best make up (night &amp; day), I have ever tried (I&#x60;m 55).</li>
            <li> My face has never been better, it&#x27;s pretty close to flawless and it took about 2 weeks to turn things around.   </li>
            <li> I am thoroughly impressed and am glad there are absolutely no negative side effects (like some exfoliants)in this product.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to be the first person to review this product.</li>
            <li> But again, I thought it seemed too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> My skin is glowy and very very smooth.  </li>
            <li> And my skin (besides my forehead) is already very smooth and glowy.  </li>
            <li> and I could swear my skin tone looks more even.  </li>
            <li> I was oily and I seemed to need more makeup...</li>
            <li> I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li> (but I must make sure I have washed my face with a face wash..</li>
            <li> 89% felt their skin was firmer and more resilient -</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I used proactiv and it was ok, but I still had acne.   </li>
            <li> When i started using this product immediately i noticed smaller pores and the best part of it all no acne.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more from a beauty product, although if it was a bit cheaper I think they&#x27;d find more women out there could realistically stick to using this for years and years.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it</li>
            <li> I tend to break out on my chin, and to top it all off</li>
            <li> but I do love this product.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so not only is this an excellent product for reducing pore size, but it got rid of all my razor burn!</li>
            <li> So women out there whose husbands have a problem with razor burn, this product is outstanding for it..</li>
            <li> I find that it works even better with the Cosmedicine line, which you can get at any Sephora..</li>
            <li> I love it on top of my eyelids, though.  </li>
            <li> My eyeliner sticks better, my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t crease, and my mascara doesn&#x27;t rub off onto my eyelids like it used to.</li>
            <li> was nervous that with the minerals on my face my skin wouldn&#x27;t be able to breathe at night, thus leading to a breakout, but this has not been the case.</li>
            <li> Rather, my skin is looking SO much better-</li>
            <li> ago, I haven&#x27;t touched anything else, and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> since there many people that claim that it does wonders for them...</li>
            <li> i now have more cystic acne than i&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> The longer I have used it, the better my skin appears.  </li>
            <li> With a month&#x27;s use, my skin continues to get better each day.  </li>
            <li> This is fabulous &amp; well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> This product calms my skin down and makes it look beautiful for bed, which is nice for my husband too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the benefits over continued use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the benefits over continued use!</li>
            <li> It claims to increase skin luminosity, and I think it does make my face reflect more light and appear more even.</li>
            <li> The minerals went into my skin really smoothly and felt nice and extremely light- not like wearing makeup at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to wake up with a fresh looking face.  </li>
            <li> , I thought it was great too to be able to use it at night and actually have some sort of makeup on to even skin out</li>
            <li> A side note too - if you do have problem skin, the coverage of the product to wear to bed is great for helping you feel better about your skin at night - even if you&#x27;re the only one who sees it!</li>
            <li> my son uses this to cover a little acne; easy to apply, good for your skin &amp; good for your self esteem :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest the first year or two</li>
            <li> From July 14, 2009 to July 20, 2009 go to[...] and save 50% on RareMinerals Skin Revival Treatment, plus they include a free sample of the RareMinerals moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The pillow puff applicator does a great job distributing just enough of the product in an even manner.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great and I will definitely re-purchase.</li>
            <li> If that wasn&#x27;t great enough it also helps with lines on my face!!</li>
            <li> It is not heavy, and it feels good to wear.</li>
            <li> While it does add a touch of color or rather a glow to the skin (there is a clear version too), I didn&#x27;t feel like I looked like I was wearing makeup, which was good.  </li>
            <li> I at 49, with reasonably good skin, but I wanted to try this new intriguing product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, but I noticed after the first use I kept coughing, like I had some dust in my lungs.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s just the unique application process that makes it float in the air around my nose and mouth.    </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product so far, and I will update in a while to see if it&#x27;s still working.</li>
            <li> This is a POWDER, powder that does not get absorbed, powder that clogs pores!  </li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t change anything else in my skincare routine, so i&#x27;m pretty confident that the skin revival treatment is the cause.</li>
            <li> so I was quite excited when I saw this treatment.  </li>
            <li> I make sure I wait until my nightly moisturizer has been absorbed into my skin for about 15 minutes or so before using the Rare Minerals</li>
            <li> Im sure that all the amazing claims are true, but I just dont see a big difference.  </li>
            <li> Also, the spongy top gets very yucky if you don&#x27;t clean it.  </li>
            <li> I like using this when i&#x27;m at home on the weekends during the days too when i dont want to put on full make up and just want some color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly starting to notice some changes with my fair skin.</li>
            <li> It soaks up excess oil, and makes your skin feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 months already and to tell you that I dont see amazing results!!!!!!!The reviews on here are so good that i was compelled to try it, being a daily user of the bare products anyway.  </li>
            <li> I was a real skeptic, but I&#x27;m so glad I tried Rare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> What I can tell is that my skin actually feels so nice and smooth after putting it on.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I need to quickly put some makeup on.  </li>
            <li> I am a lotion and potion junkie, most creams don&#x27;t excite me, this one has because its so easy and actually makes you look and feel better WHEN ITS ON, not worse.</li>
            <li> Use it consistently every night and you&#x27;ll see a difference!</li>
            <li> It certainly wasn&#x27;t cheap, but now that I&#x27;m 31</li>
            <li> AFTER: routine is to put on Rare Minerals before bed...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll apply the rare minerals blemish therapy to my spots.    </li>
            <li> I am so thrilled I can&#x27;t say enough..</li>
            <li> Within a month&#x27;s time, my face stopped breaking out and it looked clear and healthy.</li>
            <li> It is the Rare Minerals.</li>
            <li> Started using rare minerals 3 nights ago and it gave me pimples.  </li>
            <li> I found the literature compelling and the reviews encouraging.  </li>
            <li> about another couple months worth of product</li>
            <li> Most products claim to reduce the \\&quot;appearance\\&quot; of pore size which basically means your pores look smaller because they are now filled with silicone.  </li>
            <li> Clear would have been a better choice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice to go to bed, after having cleansed my face, and look into the mirror and see a glowing complexion looking back.</li>
            <li> Anyway, overall my skin is pretty good, I just always search for a light treatment at night to improve it if I can while I am still young.  </li>
            <li> Yes it makes me look good when i go to bed, but I dont see the pour reduction, glow, or any of the things that other people have claimed.</li>
            <li> guess I am doing it right.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge huge fan of Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> Clean face with something gentle like aveeno face wash, or cetafil   </li>
            <li> Bare Minerals night treatment was just \\&quot;another product\\&quot; but I figured I try it because it didn&#x27;t have the acids or chemicals that many acne treating cleansers</li>
            <li> In general I&#x27;ve noticed a much more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> love Bare Minerals makeup</li>
            <li> So, fine lines are not an issue, but my pores are naturally huge, especially around my nose.  </li>
            <li> I certainly LOOK healthier!</li>
            <li> yesterday, I looked at myself in the mirror (about 7 a.m.) and actually asked \\&quot;did I wash my face last night?\\&quot; meaning my skin looked great</li>
            <li> The mirror on top is more decorative than useful since it is too small to see my whole face.</li>
            <li> was I really getting the product on my face evenly?!</li>
            <li> Thanks, BE!</li>
            <li> My skin is combination, but pretty oily in the T-zone area.</li>
            <li> &gt; THe first 2 nights</li>
            <li> Many people asked me what I was doing differently.</li>
            <li> First week use</li>
            <li> After I became aware of what I was doing it has not been a problem since.</li>
            <li> After the first night it got rid of ALL of it.</li>
            <li> I have tried various illuminating powders &amp; creams that looked more like glitter than glow, but this product makes my skin glow.      </li>
            <li> I put my eye cream on first, wait about 5 mins.</li>
            <li> The first night, as soon as I put it on, I saw an improvement, and thought it was just the opacity of the product.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, I have just had 1 pimple when I used to have 6 to 8 typically around \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My face is so clear and healthy, and it clearly works just as well on men!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have noticed too much a change in fine lines, but with the other results I have noticed, I strongly recommend this product if you have combination skin and a problem with redness.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Escentuals foundation for about a year, and it has made a huge improvement with my skin in texture and reduction of breakouts.  </li>
            <li> also have to mention that pretty much every vitamin or mineral ever revealed to benefit or enhance the appearance of you skin</li>
            <li> Here we are over a year later (August 2007) and I am still loving Rare Minerals Skin Treatment; it actually delivers what it promises!</li>
            <li> (There&#x27;s details on the website but the coupon codes are REVIVAL and PURE.)</li>
            <li> and I think my biggest frustration is my large pores.</li>
            <li> Combating large pot-hole size pores was the reason I tried this product.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and I&#x27;m using the clear version of this - which actually makes me look slightly tanned (for me).  </li>
            <li> It feels &amp; looks nice on but is a little spendy for use just as makeup.  </li>
            <li> I love the Bare Escentuals line and have used the Bare Minerals foundation for over 2 years now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really out of my price range, but I received mine as part of a gift set for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Was anything really coming out of the applicator?</li>
            <li> so I can see if it&#x27;s really on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did take about 4 nights use before I could see a difference, but there really is something to this.  </li>
            <li> This treatment along with my Clean/Clear moisturizer has really improved my skin.</li>
            <li> BEFORE: skin was very BLAH in the a.m.</li>
            <li> 2-3 times per week use a gentle exfoliating cleanser like St. Ives Apricot scrub  Every night, use the night treatment puff</li>
            <li> My skin is normally very oily in the morning</li>
            <li> and I have got to say, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> So, its a great product for people who hate heavy creams on their face and it does give skin a great smooth texture.  </li>
            <li> so if someone stops by after I have washed my face for the night or before I am ready in the morning</li>
            <li> My mom bought this for me because I really wanted to try it but felt that it was too spendy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rare Minerals for nearly three weeks.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> $60 is not too much money.</li>
            <li> So much so that I stopped using the prescription rosacea treatment I got from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> The next day when I washed my face, though, it genuinely seemed smoother.  </li>
            <li> we have to pay three time as much for the product.</li>
            <li> I think $60 is too much to pay for this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin is oily/acne prone in the T-Zone with large pores and normal along the cheeks.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that has ever actually made them appear smaller; so overall, I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that has ever actually made them appear smaller; so overall, I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have the product in Clear color, so at first it was like a placebo -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this skin treatment for about 2 months (and not that consistently at that) and those marks are completely gone.</li>
            <li> In hopes of diminishing some of the fine lines I&#x27;ve developed in my 30s, and even further improving my skin, I took a gamble on this RareMinerals treatment.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE A WHOLE NEW FACE!!!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> but I wonder if the Philosophy supernatural makeup replacement sponges would work for this.  </li>
            <li> so its hard to tell, I am sure it will last long so the price is OK for me as compared to most creams out there if it streches use over a long time.  </li>
            <li> I originally thought I would buy the product once and keep moving on to the next thing as I have with so many other products, but despite the price I will definitely repurchase this product when I run out.  </li>
            <li> I will buy it myself next time, it it totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I come home from work and wash my face, put this on and have no problem greeting neighbors or drop by guests, as I normally would have.</li>
            <li> Daily Mositurizer, wait 5 minutes, and then apply Rare Minerals.</li>
            <li> Then, apply the product by removing the lid and \\&quot;click\\&quot; or twist the spongy puff to the right to open the slow-release powder into the applicator.</li>
            <li> Currently 25 - have had pimple outbreaks since I turned 19 and have been trying different products ever since along with clean diets, colonics, drinking tons of water, homeopathy, whole food nutritional suplements, cleanses - ANd NO RESULTS.  </li>
            <li> purchased the Rare Minerals night time treatment in Clear last Friday, May 12th and have used it faithfully every night since.</li>
            <li> The first one doesn&#x27;t help me with my problem but the 2nd one suggests that I apply the product with a brush instead of the applicator.  </li>
            <li> We had a couple of really hot days last week, and the thought of putting on foundation and having it slide off...</li>
            <li> Wow!...</li>
            <li> In the day, sometimes I might have a new pimple or even an old one that&#x27;s still healing</li>
            <li> Of course, there was a tiny little bit of negativity in the back of my mind, telling me the only thing that&#x27;s going to make my rosacea better is most likely the prescriptions I have from my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> Sure, I still have red areas, but they&#x27;re getting less noticable over time.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the nice coverage it provides, I noticed over time my pores were smaller around my nose, my skin is infinitely smoother and MUCH less red.  </li>
            <li> In the morning my skin is clear and radiant.  </li>
            <li> So, I got the clear</li>
            <li> But, I have clear</li>
            <li> I use the clear one, because the goal isn&#x27;t to look like a chick.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help clear up my pimples.  </li>
            <li> but after nearly 60 days of diligent use I can say it does work....</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s has a powder application that makes your skin feel fluffly and soft (not greasy and sticky) before you go to bed.  </li>
            <li> My skin became sensitive to touch</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two months now, and it has made a considerable difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> so you can actually see where this is being applied and how much.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and looks airbrushed.      </li>
            <li> I was worried it would rub off on my pillowcase, but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed that at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 41 years old.</li>
            <li> Having the product pass through that thickness of sponge makes me think that most of it gets trapped in the middle, which seems wasteful.  </li>
            <li> it is a bit irritating to apply (kind of a blotting motion)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s got a hefty little price tag, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s totally worth it!   </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t do well for the fine lines and puffiness under my eyes, so I use very little, if any there.      </li>
            <li> younger, brighter, smoother, and more even-toned, in just a few weeks!   </li>
            <li> The price tag on this product was holding me back from trying it, but this week I was surprised to find that now I can sample the RareMinerals without having to worry about a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on the overall appearance of my skin because I do not know if it is because of this or my normal skin care regimine.</li>
            <li> I also recommend when trying a new beauty product to keep the rest of your beauty routine constant-</li>
            <li> Use it consistently every night and you&#x27;ll see a difference!so achieving other results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 days and have already noticed my face looks much more refined, pores less noticable and less flaky skin.</li>
            <li> wakeup, shower, bare minerals primer, and a little Rare Minerals before my make up....</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish is that the jar was clear so you knew when you were running out.  </li>
            <li> This is my skin care routine before bedtime- wash with Clearasil Daily Wash, apply eye cream around my eyes, apply Aveeno Clear Complexion ( 0.5% Salicylic Acid )</li>
            <li> I have used Bare Minerals/Rare Minerals for two years.</li>
            <li> I like Oil of Olay Regenerist products also, but they take much longer to show results, and all three products cost about the same amount as this single product and it doesn&#x27; require multiple steps.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend trying it for at least a few weeks and think most people should see a difference in their skin and their overall appearance.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive when I first heard of this product...sleeping in a powder?</li>
            <li> its impossible to tell if a new product is advantageous if you&#x27;re trying more than one new product at a time.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll get a color other than \\&quot;clear\\&quot; so that I can tell how much I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> When it runs out I won&#x27;t purchase it again &amp; will go back to using my Bare Minerals makeup for day instead.</li>
            <li> I came here to look and see if anything was actually going on as applicator seems to barely deliver and product to sponge,</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t reccommend the Bare Minerals make-up enough.</li>
            <li> I am not one to spend $60 dollars on facial product, but as a Bare Escentuals  fan I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> but my skin is still pretty firm since I am 28.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30s with combination skin, big pores, uneven texture and rarely have breakout.  </li>
            <li> I told the woman at the store where I bought it that I absolutely did not want anything that would mess up my skin.  </li>
            <li> The other thing I reccomend is using a shade darker than your normal foundation</li>
            <li> I am 37, with somewhat oily skin, medium to large pores, and a few blemishes from time to time.</li>
            <li> I have large pores, an oily T-zone, occasional acne and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> and I felt I needed makeup due to red spots, lines, sun damage which were all visible...and even when I wore makeup by early a.m.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I was with the BareMinerals makeup at first, both won me over (I think the foundation or makeup is wonderful for spot coverage with the smaller brush and for any blemishes on chest or shoulders as you don&#x27;t have to worry about it rubbing off onto clothes, I HATE liquid foundation,</li>
            <li> Whenever I run out of this product, I will get a color other than Clear</li>
            <li> I have dry, thin skin with fine lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although I was slightly confused about how to apply it at first since the sponge was clear, once the minerals started to pass through the sponge I saw it was indeed rubbing off on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see what other benefits come out of it since I am hoping to get my moneys worth since it&#x27;s so dang expensive!</li>
            <li> I would have red marks on my skin from zits that were long gone.  </li>
            <li> (my moisturizer seems to clog up the applicator pad if I don&#x27;t wait long enough).</li>
            <li> I have several issues with my skin - it&#x27;s dry, I have rosacea, large pores around my nose, and a still-healing area along the side of my nose where I had to get a small skin cancer removed.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using bare escentuals mineral foundation and other products for over a year now</li>
            <li> I know that Rare Minerals has helped my skin because it is the only thing I have added/changed in the past few weeks...</li>
            <li> I usually have no blemishes whatsoever but wanted to start protecting my skin as I got older.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin, dry cheeks dry forehead, oily chin, and a oily nose with big pores!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at paying 60 bucks, but my skin is pretty clear and when</li>
            <li> Now that my jar is empty, I have to say that this product just simply did nothing.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this product since it didn&#x27;t make sense to me to go to bed with makeup on my face, but I decided to try it due to reviews on this and other sites, and my love of the other Bare Escentuals products.  </li>
            <li> While I got a little shine in the T-zone late in the day, it looked more like a dewy glow than a grease slick.  </li>
            <li> This powder is extremely fine, so just be careful not to inhale at the wrong time.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this I have not gotten a single pimple</li>
            <li> my pores apprear smaller and less shiny through the day.  </li>
            <li> The directions say to just go over your face once and that you&#x27;ll get the same benefit by using a little or a lot.</li>
            <li> When I used it a second time I started to choke a little...</li>
            <li> I was more than a little skeptical and a little panicky.</li>
            <li> There are some reviewers who finds the Rare Minerals expensive.</li>
            <li> and my skin is smoother, less red, and less blotchy.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and my cheeks have been much less dry</li>
            <li> Only now I can see it&#x27;s a little less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin is less oily after just a week&#x27;s use, but I&#x27;ve mainly paid attention to how small my pores appear now, so I am not sure if I&#x27;m also achieving other results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear any make up other than blush</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but if it continues to help, it will be pretty unbelivable.  </li>
            <li> It did take me a couple nights to get use to not put on my usual  goopy night cream, and I thought the powdered mineral formula would surely dry my already dry skin out, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks, and already my pores look smaller, my skin seems clearer and healthier, and less oily!!</li>
            <li> I got the medium which turned out too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> However, I HATE the feeling most creams and moisturizers leave me with,</li>
            <li> I use other Bare Escentuals products and I&#x27;ve never experienced this problem before, so either this stuff is finer</li>
            <li> i will continue to use other be products, but i definitely wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> Wait until your skin is less tacky.</li>
            <li> Yes  83% saw fewer imperfections and less visible pores -</li>
            <li> Blackhead is less.  </li>
            <li> and my t-zone has been much less oily and the redness has been reduced.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The area where I had a small skin cancer removed was starting to flake as it healed... since I started using this treatment, I get no more flaking skin over the area.</li>
            <li> and if I do break out, its less disastorous than it used to be.</li>
            <li> Normally, (ever since i was about 12) i&#x27;ve had random acne.</li>
            <li> But I kept with it after those initial pimples died down and haven&#x27;t broken out since.        </li>
            <li> So I tend to keep on tapping and rubbing for a few minute.  </li>
            <li> Plus, when I pull the applicator out I can see a lot of the powder wasted around the applicator.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely annoyed and am going to try to get my money back.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few nights now</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say that it only made my skin worse.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product, but after only a few days I can already tell a difference!</li>
            <li> The only reason I haven&#x27;t thrown it away is because it was so damn expensive.</li>
            <li> If this were $20 less expensive, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The skin on my forehead was breaking out in these little creepy inflamed bumps (that I HATE), and I woke up this morning, and they are very nearly flat and MUCH less inflamed.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible combination skin that is so oily in my t-zone that sometimes my makeup runs at the same time that my cheeks will be so dry that they are peeling.  </li>
            <li> have (which make my face worse).      </li>
            <li> Of course, I wondered if it was all just hyped up because this brand has become so infamous lately.  </li>
            <li> my acne is worse than it was before.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but figured I would go ahead and try it since nothing else has worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cant say that this product is useless - try it out...</li>
            <li> One thing I do deal with is horrible, horrible reactions to cold weather or wind, its so sensitive to that.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product&#x27;s claim that it can reduce the diamater of the pores.  </li>
            <li> , I had bad reaction.  </li>
            <li> Reason for 4 star is because I hate the applicator.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to people of all skin types you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> From July 14, 2009 to July 20, 2009 go to[...] and save 50% on RareMinerals Skin Revival Treatment, plus they include a free sample of the RareMinerals moisturizer. The price tag on this product was holding me back from trying it, but this week I was surprised to find that now I can sample the RareMinerals without having to worry about a huge waste of money. (There&#x27;s details on the website but the coupon codes are REVIVAL and PURE.)</li>
            <li> I am so NOT the target market for skin revival products since I am 33 and living in a humid climate.  So, fine lines are not an issue, but my pores are naturally huge, especially around my nose.  I have been using this product for three weeks- not even every night - and my pores apprear smaller and less shiny through the day.  I am thoroughly impressed and am glad there are absolutely no negative side effects (like some exfoliants)in this product.  I like Oil of Olay Regenerist products also, but they take much longer to show results, and all three products cost about the same amount as this single product and it doesn&#x27; require multiple steps.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since adolescence (I&#x27;m in my 30s).  Since I started using this I have not gotten a single pimple and I could swear my skin tone looks more even.  Next time I&#x27;ll get a color other than \\&quot;clear\\&quot; so that I can tell how much I&#x27;m applying- but this is something I will always have in my medicine cabinet!!</li>
            <li> I have moderate rosacea and acne. I have dry, thin skin with fine lines. This product (light) matches my skin tone perfectly, and conceals my pores, fine lines, and redness. It claims to increase skin luminosity, and I think it does make my face reflect more light and appear more even. I haven&#x27;t noticing any \\&quot;firming,\\&quot; but my skin is still pretty firm since I am 28. The pillow puff applicator does a great job distributing just enough of the product in an even manner. I don&#x27;t like to wear make-up, but I wear this day and night. It is not heavy, and it feels good to wear. The mirror on top is more decorative than useful since it is too small to see my whole face. If this were $20 less expensive, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. It&#x27;s really out of my price range, but I received mine as part of a gift set for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I love the Bare Escentuals line and have used the Bare Minerals foundation for over 2 years now. I have large pores, an oily T-zone, occasional acne and uneven skin tone. I&#x27;ve had to use foundations &amp; cover-up since I was a teen and I think my biggest frustration is my large pores. That&#x27;s something that I&#x27;ve heard will never change. If you don&#x27;t take care of your skin as a teen, then it can lead to forever enlarged pores. Combating large pot-hole size pores was the reason I tried this product. I was skeptical, but figured I would go ahead and try it since nothing else has worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Rare Minerals night time treatment in Clear last Friday, May 12th and have used it faithfully every night since. I bought it at Nordstrom where I knew the return policy was incredible - that way if it doesn&#x27;t work out I can get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing your skin and following up with a PH-balancing toner, eye cream, serum, moisturizer or whatever your routine is, let your skin soak in the products you&#x27;ve applied. Wait until your skin is less tacky. You may want to skip your moisturizer or serum. Then, apply the product by removing the lid and \\&quot;click\\&quot; or twist the spongy puff to the right to open the slow-release powder into the applicator. All you do is swipe it once over your entire face. I have the product in Clear color, so at first it was like a placebo - was I really getting the product on my face evenly?! Was anything really coming out of the applicator? The directions say to just go over your face once and that you&#x27;ll get the same benefit by using a little or a lot. Whenever I run out of this product, I will get a color other than Clear so I can see if it&#x27;s really on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, within 2 days my pores were noticeably smaller and I didn&#x27;t think this was even possible! My skin is less oily after just a week&#x27;s use, but I&#x27;ve mainly paid attention to how small my pores appear now, so I am not sure if I&#x27;m also achieving other results. I still have visible pores but it&#x27;s only been a week. This is the first product that has ever actually made them appear smaller; so overall, I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it. I&#x27;m excited to see the benefits over continued use! I&#x27;m telling my friends about it and even bought some for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day because she has Rosacea. I think everyone with skin problems should give this a good faithful try. Use it consistently every night and you&#x27;ll see a difference!so achieving other results.

            <li> I ordered this product because I admit to be a product junkie.  I at 49, with reasonably good skin, but I wanted to try this new intriguing product.  It did take about 4 nights use before I could see a difference, but there really is something to this.  My skin actually glows and I know that word is greatly overused. It did take me a couple nights to get use to not put on my usual  goopy night cream, and I thought the powdered mineral formula would surely dry my already dry skin out, but NO!  In the morning my skin is clear and radiant.  Even my pores look better--especially the ones on my nose.  I was a real skeptic, but I&#x27;m so glad I tried Rare Minerals.  I will continue to buy it.  Thanks, BE!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product, but after only a few days I can already tell a difference! My skin is combination, but pretty oily in the T-zone area. This treatment along with my Clean/Clear moisturizer has really improved my skin. I&#x27;m sticking with this and the make-up! Just wish I would&#x27;ve tried this out sooner.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as makeup in the daytime because I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results except softer skin after using it at night for several weeks.  It feels &amp; looks nice on but is a little spendy for use just as makeup.  When it runs out I won&#x27;t purchase it again &amp; will go back to using my Bare Minerals makeup for day instead.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 days and have already noticed my face looks much more refined, pores less noticable and less flaky skin. I use a retinol so my skin can tend to flake but this has helped and it has only been 2 days. I am excited to see what other benefits come out of it since I am hoping to get my moneys worth since it&#x27;s so dang expensive!</li>
            <li> Soooo...I have used this off and on for about 4 years....I&#x27;ll be honest the first year or two I just went thru the motions...But, I am now in my mid 40&#x27;s and I have been committed to using this daily for the last 2 months...so this review is all about the last 2 months....    BEFORE: skin was very BLAH in the a.m. and I felt I needed makeup due to red spots, lines, sun damage which were all visible...and even when I wore makeup by early a.m. I was oily and I seemed to need more makeup...I never looked finished...    AFTER: routine is to put on Rare Minerals before bed...wakeup, shower, bare minerals primer, and a little Rare Minerals before my make up....and I can honestly say I still look great by end of day in the heat of the AZ Summer....yesterday, I looked at myself in the mirror (about 7 a.m.) and actually asked \\&quot;did I wash my face last night?\\&quot; meaning my skin looked great......    This product is really wonderful....it is a bit irritating to apply (kind of a blotting motion) but after nearly 60 days of diligent use I can say it does work....I have dabbled with this product over the years but I will tell you that I know that it does \\&quot;something\\&quot; and I see a difference.....this is now a staple for me!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased.  Here&#x27;s my skin story:  Currently 25 - have had pimple outbreaks since I turned 19 and have been trying different products ever since along with clean diets, colonics, drinking tons of water, homeopathy, whole food nutritional suplements, cleanses - ANd NO RESULTS.  Bare Minerals night treatment was just \\&quot;another product\\&quot; but I figured I try it because it didn&#x27;t have the acids or chemicals that many acne treating cleansers have (which make my face worse).      My face has never been better, it&#x27;s pretty close to flawless and it took about 2 weeks to turn things around.   Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been doing:  Clean face with something gentle like aveeno face wash, or cetafil   2-3 times per week use a gentle exfoliating cleanser like St. Ives Apricot scrub  Every night, use the night treatment puff (but I must make sure I have washed my face with a face wash.. not just water - otherwise I break out)  In the day, sometimes I might have a new pimple or even an old one that&#x27;s still healing and I&#x27;ll apply the rare minerals blemish therapy to my spots.    I am so thrilled I can&#x27;t say enough.. I thought my skin would always be crappy and pimpled and covered in noticeable concealer, but now I can say that some days  I don&#x27;t wear any make up other than blush and I feel great about myself.     PS&gt; THe first 2 nights I tried the night treatment, I broke out  - But I kept with it after those initial pimples died down and haven&#x27;t broken out since.        89% felt their skin was firmer and more resilient - Yes  85% felt their skin texture had improved - Yes  83% saw fewer imperfections and less visible pores - Yes  82% saw clearer skin 81% saw fewer discolorations - Yes  68% saw a reduction in facial lines and wrinkles - Yes</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive when I first heard of this product...sleeping in a powder? Within a month&#x27;s time, my face stopped breaking out and it looked clear and healthy. Many people asked me what I was doing differently. It is the Rare Minerals. It is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> Everyone with any skin problems at all should buy this.  I used it, and after one night, my skin looks radiant.  It&#x27;s incredible.  I probably should have waited until after four weeks or whatever to write this review, so I could say, \\&quot;HEY I HAVE A WHOLE NEW FACE!!!\\&quot;  But I&#x27;m not.  Because I want to show everyone how happy I am with this product after just one use.  The skin on my forehead was breaking out in these little creepy inflamed bumps (that I HATE), and I woke up this morning, and they are very nearly flat and MUCH less inflamed.  My skin is glowy and very very smooth.  And my skin (besides my forehead) is already very smooth and glowy.  Now it&#x27;s MORE smooth and glowy, and I am very happy :)  Think of what will happen to my skin after 4 weeks!  Can&#x27;t wait, lemme tell ya :D :D &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also have to mention that pretty much every vitamin or mineral ever revealed to benefit or enhance the appearance of you skin...is in this product.  It&#x27;s like an \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; type of deal.  And it&#x27;s has a powder application that makes your skin feel fluffly and soft (not greasy and sticky) before you go to bed.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the starter kit about 3 weeks ago. My skin has never looked better.  Normally, (ever since i was about 12) i&#x27;ve had random acne. I used proactiv and it was ok, but I still had acne.   When i started using this product immediately i noticed smaller pores and the best part of it all no acne.  I like using this when i&#x27;m at home on the weekends during the days too when i dont want to put on full make up and just want some color.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30s with combination skin, big pores, uneven texture and rarely have breakout.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 6 months.  First week use, I had bad reaction.  My skin became sensitive to touch and I started to have acne.  So I contacted the customer service.  I received 2 different replies.  The first one doesn&#x27;t help me with my problem but the 2nd one suggests that I apply the product with a brush instead of the applicator.  She thinks I might be allergy to the applicator which is made of latex.  I use latex glove all the time and have no allergy.  Anyway, after I avoid using the applicator all the acne disappeared and I see improvement.  The way I apply it is by tapping some powder out on my palm, dab on my face and rub all over.  Then, I apply my moisturizer.  I&#x27;m doing the opposite way but it works for me.      My skin is normally very oily in the morning but it&#x27;s not anymore.  It&#x27;s nice to wake up with a fresh looking face.  Blackhead is less.  Pore size takes quite awhile to reduce.  Only now I can see it&#x27;s a little less noticeable.  Skin texture is smoother.  Overall my skin looks clearer.  So I&#x27;m happy with product.    Reason for 4 star is because I hate the applicator.  When applying with the applicator, I don&#x27;t even know how much I actually rub on my face.  So I tend to keep on tapping and rubbing for a few minute.  May be it irritates my skin and cause the breakout?  Plus, when I pull the applicator out I can see a lot of the powder wasted around the applicator.  Those I can use for a week using my fingers.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous &amp; well worth the money!!! Also- my son uses this to cover a little acne; easy to apply, good for your skin &amp; good for your self esteem :)</li>
            <li> Started using rare minerals 3 nights ago and it gave me pimples.  I told the woman at the store where I bought it that I absolutely did not want anything that would mess up my skin.  I usually have no blemishes whatsoever but wanted to start protecting my skin as I got older.  Now 3 days in I have 5 pimples.  I&#x27;m extremely annoyed and am going to try to get my money back.</li>
            <li> WARNING!    I love this product, but I noticed after the first use I kept coughing, like I had some dust in my lungs. When I used it a second time I started to choke a little...I realized I was actually inhaling some of it, and it was getting in my lungs. Note this only happened when I was patting my face with the applicator to release some of the powder, NOT when I was buffing it all in with the applicator. This powder is extremely fine, so just be careful not to inhale at the wrong time. After I became aware of what I was doing it has not been a problem since. I use other Bare Escentuals products and I&#x27;ve never experienced this problem before, so either this stuff is finer or it&#x27;s just the unique application process that makes it float in the air around my nose and mouth.    I bought this and the acne treatment together. It certainly wasn&#x27;t cheap, but now that I&#x27;m 31 I&#x27;m certainly starting to notice some changes with my fair skin. It has only been two weeks and my skin is smoother, less red, and less blotchy. I certainly LOOK healthier! I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more from a beauty product, although if it was a bit cheaper I think they&#x27;d find more women out there could realistically stick to using this for years and years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few nights now and I have got to say, I really like it.  I was skeptical as I was with the BareMinerals makeup at first, both won me over (I think the foundation or makeup is wonderful for spot coverage with the smaller brush and for any blemishes on chest or shoulders as you don&#x27;t have to worry about it rubbing off onto clothes, I HATE liquid foundation, so, if you get a chance, try it, if only for a concealer).  Anyway, overall my skin is pretty good, I just always search for a light treatment at night to improve it if I can while I am still young.  However, I HATE the feeling most creams and moisturizers leave me with, so, this seemed like a great solution for me.  Of course, I wondered if it was all just hyped up because this brand has become so infamous lately.  So, I got the clear, I thought it was great too to be able to use it at night and actually have some sort of makeup on to even skin out so you don&#x27;t look like a greaseball as with creams in case you have to run out, etc.  But again, I thought it seemed too good to be true.  To my surprise, I really like it.  I came here to look and see if anything was actually going on as applicator seems to barely deliver and product to sponge, guess I am doing it right.  But, I have clear so its hard to tell, I am sure it will last long so the price is OK for me as compared to most creams out there if it streches use over a long time.  What I can tell is that my skin actually feels so nice and smooth after putting it on.  I love the feel of it and when I touch it during the day, it does seem smoother.  I have not had any breakouts either so maybe that is helping as I do get them once in a while, and again, night creams would cause them as well.  One thing I do deal with is horrible, horrible reactions to cold weather or wind, its so sensitive to that.  So, hopefully it will help with that, we will see!  So, its a great product for people who hate heavy creams on their face and it does give skin a great smooth texture.  Was skeptical but if it continues to help, it will be pretty unbelivable.  I am a lotion and potion junkie, most creams don&#x27;t excite me, this one has because its so easy and actually makes you look and feel better WHEN ITS ON, not worse.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product to work.  I found the literature compelling and the reviews encouraging.  It was acclaimed at Sephora.  I used it faithfully every night.  Now that my jar is empty, I have to say that this product just simply did nothing. It was as though I wasn&#x27;t even using a product.  NO RESULTS WHATSOEVER.</li>
            <li> I am a huge huge fan of Bare Minerals so I thought I would give their skin care line a try.  I&#x27;m 26 and the reason I bought this product was because I have scarring from zits.  I would have red marks on my skin from zits that were long gone.  I&#x27;ve been using this skin treatment for about 2 months (and not that consistently at that) and those marks are completely gone. In general I&#x27;ve noticed a much more even skin tone. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have terrible combination skin that is so oily in my t-zone that sometimes my makeup runs at the same time that my cheeks will be so dry that they are peeling.  I tend to break out on my chin, and to top it all off I have roseacea.  I have been using this product for about two months now, and it has made a considerable difference in my skin.  The tint makes it nice so if someone stops by after I have washed my face for the night or before I am ready in the morning I don&#x27;t feel like I need to quickly put some makeup on.  I have also noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and my cheeks have been much less dry and my t-zone has been much less oily and the redness has been reduced.  I originally thought I would buy the product once and keep moving on to the next thing as I have with so many other products, but despite the price I will definitely repurchase this product when I run out.  (After two months I still have about another couple months worth of product left, so it lasts a while.)  I can&#x27;t say I have noticed too much a change in fine lines, but with the other results I have noticed, I strongly recommend this product if you have combination skin and a problem with redness.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product&#x27;s claim that it can reduce the diamater of the pores.  I thought nothing can do that.  Most products claim to reduce the \\&quot;appearance\\&quot; of pore size which basically means your pores look smaller because they are now filled with silicone.  However this is not a silicone based product so I am very impressed at the size of my pores when I wake up in the morning after using this product. I cannot comment on the overall appearance of my skin because I do not know if it is because of this or my normal skin care regimine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I am not a real big fan of the BE foundation but I do love this product.  The only thing I wish is that the jar was clear so you knew when you were running out.  Also I wish it came with replacement sponges but I wonder if the Philosophy supernatural makeup replacement sponges would work for this.  The other thing I reccomend is using a shade darker than your normal foundation so you can actually see where this is being applied and how much.  Since you are wearing it to sleep anyway a darker shade should not matter.  So although it is a bit pricey, I do recommend giving it a try if you are looking for a non silicone product to shrink your pores.</li>
            <li> I am happy to be the first person to review this product. I have only been using it for one week, and already I can see a difference! I am 39 and my skin tends to be a bit oily, and I get blemishes every so often. This product calms my skin down and makes it look beautiful for bed, which is nice for my husband too! It soaks up excess oil, and makes your skin feel nice and soft. Plumps up those tiny lines too. It is a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way. I am very pleased with this product so far, and I will update in a while to see if it&#x27;s still working. As of today, two big thumbs up! UPDATE: Here we are over a year later (August 2007) and I am still loving Rare Minerals Skin Treatment; it actually delivers what it promises! My skin looks great and I will definitely re-purchase. A winner!</li>
            <li> Ok, so not only is this an excellent product for reducing pore size, but it got rid of all my razor burn! My face is so clear and healthy, and it clearly works just as well on men! So women out there whose husbands have a problem with razor burn, this product is outstanding for it.. After the first night it got rid of ALL of it. I use the clear one, because the goal isn&#x27;t to look like a chick. I find that it works even better with the Cosmedicine line, which you can get at any Sephora.. So ya, A++ product</li>
            <li> I bought this to help clear up my pimples.  What was I thinking.  This is a POWDER, powder that does not get absorbed, powder that clogs pores!  Also, the spongy top gets very yucky if you don&#x27;t clean it.  Suffice it to say that it only made my skin worse.  The only reason I haven&#x27;t thrown it away is because it was so damn expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks now.  My skin has NEVER looked this amazing.  I use it at night, but I am also using it during the day instead of foundation.  We had a couple of really hot days last week, and the thought of putting on foundation and having it slide off...yuck.  I used this instead.  While I got a little shine in the T-zone late in the day, it looked more like a dewy glow than a grease slick.  I have tried various illuminating powders &amp; creams that looked more like glitter than glow, but this product makes my skin glow.      I have very fair skin, and I&#x27;m using the clear version of this - which actually makes me look slightly tanned (for me).  My pores look miniscule.  My skin feels soft and looks airbrushed.      The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I don&#x27;t like the applicator.  Having the product pass through that thickness of sponge makes me think that most of it gets trapped in the middle, which seems wasteful.  I take the cap off and use my own sponge to apply it.  It also doesn&#x27;t do well for the fine lines and puffiness under my eyes, so I use very little, if any there.      I love it on top of my eyelids, though.  My eyeliner sticks better, my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t crease, and my mascara doesn&#x27;t rub off onto my eyelids like it used to.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this product since it didn&#x27;t make sense to me to go to bed with makeup on my face, but I decided to try it due to reviews on this and other sites, and my love of the other Bare Escentuals products.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although I was slightly confused about how to apply it at first since the sponge was clear, once the minerals started to pass through the sponge I saw it was indeed rubbing off on my skin. The minerals went into my skin really smoothly and felt nice and extremely light- not like wearing makeup at all. While it does add a touch of color or rather a glow to the skin (there is a clear version too), I didn&#x27;t feel like I looked like I was wearing makeup, which was good.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was nervous that with the minerals on my face my skin wouldn&#x27;t be able to breathe at night, thus leading to a breakout, but this has not been the case. Rather, my skin is looking SO much better- younger, brighter, smoother, and more even-toned, in just a few weeks!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend trying it for at least a few weeks and think most people should see a difference in their skin and their overall appearance. I also recommend when trying a new beauty product to keep the rest of your beauty routine constant- its impossible to tell if a new product is advantageous if you&#x27;re trying more than one new product at a time.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this for me because I really wanted to try it but felt that it was too spendy. I will buy it myself next time, it it totally worth the money. I am 37, with somewhat oily skin, medium to large pores, and a few blemishes from time to time. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks, and already my pores look smaller, my skin seems clearer and healthier, and less oily!! I was worried it would rub off on my pillowcase, but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed that at all. As another reviewer said, it&#x27;s a bonus to have your skin looking nice at night. I come home from work and wash my face, put this on and have no problem greeting neighbors or drop by guests, as I normally would have. I put my eye cream on first, wait about 5 mins. then apply this. I haven&#x27;t tried it with moisturizer underneath, I haven&#x27;t felt that I need to. I also can&#x27;t reccommend the Bare Minerals make-up enough. After starting it 3 yrs. ago, I haven&#x27;t touched anything else, and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 months already and to tell you that I dont see amazing results!!!!!!!The reviews on here are so good that i was compelled to try it, being a daily user of the bare products anyway.  Im sure that all the amazing claims are true, but I just dont see a big difference.  Yes it makes me look good when i go to bed, but I dont see the pour reduction, glow, or any of the things that other people have claimed. I am 22, have oily skin.  I cant say that this product is useless - try it out...since there many people that claim that it does wonders for them...but my expectations were not met!</li>
            <li> Wearing make up to bed?!!! I was more than a little skeptical and a little panicky. My initial reaction was, \\&quot;I am going to break out into Mount Everest sized zits!\\&quot;...I have been using Rare Minerals for nearly three weeks. My pores are smaller. Skin clarity is improved. Skin texture is improved - smoother. Most importantly, I have just had 1 pimple when I used to have 6 to 8 typically around \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot;. I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 41 years old. My skin is oily/acne prone in the T-Zone with large pores and normal along the cheeks. I was a Pro-Activ user, but the benzoyl peroxide was too drying for my skin. This is my skin care routine before bedtime- wash with Clearasil Daily Wash, apply eye cream around my eyes, apply Aveeno Clear Complexion ( 0.5% Salicylic Acid )Daily Mositurizer, wait 5 minutes, and then apply Rare Minerals. Wow!...I know that Rare Minerals has helped my skin because it is the only thing I have added/changed in the past few weeks...$60 is not too much money. I estimate the jar will last 2 to 3 months.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using bare escentuals mineral foundation and other products for over a year now and i have been very happy with them. i have oily skin and i tend to break out, so when i read the glowing reviews on the be rareminerals skin revival treatment, i thought i would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used the product as directed every night for over a month. my acne is worse than it was before. i now have more cystic acne than i&#x27;ve had in years. i didn&#x27;t change anything else in my skincare routine, so i&#x27;m pretty confident that the skin revival treatment is the cause. i will continue to use other be products, but i definitely wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> I have several issues with my skin - it&#x27;s dry, I have rosacea, large pores around my nose, and a still-healing area along the side of my nose where I had to get a small skin cancer removed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love Bare Minerals makeup so I was quite excited when I saw this treatment.  Of course, there was a tiny little bit of negativity in the back of my mind, telling me the only thing that&#x27;s going to make my rosacea better is most likely the prescriptions I have from my dermatologist.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I tried it - and now I use it faithfully every night.  I make sure I wait until my nightly moisturizer has been absorbed into my skin for about 15 minutes or so before using the Rare Minerals (my moisturizer seems to clog up the applicator pad if I don&#x27;t wait long enough). Aside from the nice coverage it provides, I noticed over time my pores were smaller around my nose, my skin is infinitely smoother and MUCH less red.  So much so that I stopped using the prescription rosacea treatment I got from the dermatologist.  Sure, I still have red areas, but they&#x27;re getting less noticable over time.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The area where I had a small skin cancer removed was starting to flake as it healed... since I started using this treatment, I get no more flaking skin over the area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sure, it&#x27;s got a hefty little price tag, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s totally worth it!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Escentuals foundation for about a year, and it has made a huge improvement with my skin in texture and reduction of breakouts.  In hopes of diminishing some of the fine lines I&#x27;ve developed in my 30s, and even further improving my skin, I took a gamble on this RareMinerals treatment.  The first night, as soon as I put it on, I saw an improvement, and thought it was just the opacity of the product.  The next day when I washed my face, though, it genuinely seemed smoother.  The longer I have used it, the better my skin appears.  With a month&#x27;s use, my skin continues to get better each day.  A side note too - if you do have problem skin, the coverage of the product to wear to bed is great for helping you feel better about your skin at night - even if you&#x27;re the only one who sees it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at paying 60 bucks, but my skin is pretty clear and when and if I do break out, its less disastorous than it used to be.</li>
            <li> I have used Bare Minerals/Rare Minerals for two years. It is absolutely the best make up (night &amp; day), I have ever tried (I&#x60;m 55). All products work as promised. Before this I bought Dior products. They are all out now. &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;   There are some reviewers who finds the Rare Minerals expensive. I can see that from an American point of view - but I am Danish and wait....we have to pay three time as much for the product. So no wonder that I am very satisfied with the price.</li>
            <li> I am not one to spend $60 dollars on facial product, but as a Bare Escentuals  fan I figured I&#x27;d give this a try. I&#x27;m 21 I have combination skin, dry cheeks dry forehead, oily chin, and a oily nose with big pores! My biggest problem was my pores which I had considered  a lost cause until I used RareMinerals. Within 2 days of using this product the pores on my nose were visibly getting smaller. I had to do a double take in the mirror I couldn&#x27;t believe it! Incredible product a must have!!! I recommend this to people of all skin types you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference with regard to skin tone and clarity.  I did notice some redness  around my nose disappear. I think $60 is too much to pay for this product.  Just seems like a lot of hype.  I got the medium which turned out too dark for me.  Clear would have been a better choice.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice to go to bed, after having cleansed my face, and look into the mirror and see a glowing complexion looking back.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I have oily skin and it tends to break out.  This product helps take the redness from my skin and helps with the breakouts.  If that wasn&#x27;t great enough it also helps with lines on my face!!</li>
