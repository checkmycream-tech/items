            <li>Unfortunately my canvas wasn&#x27;t good with pain</li>
            <li>the problem i had was the black quickly faded soon after, like i said could have been an error on my part, would appreciate helpful tips</li>
            <li>arrived quickly; the ink is very dark too.</li>
            <li>this ink is crisp and black still.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to clean off the skin around the design though</li>
            <li>Goes in easy, black and stays black.</li>
            <li>Works well when doing cursive names and shades pretty well , dark as they come.</li>

            <li> arrived quickly; the ink is very dark too.</li>
            <li> this ink is crisp and black still.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to clean off the skin around the design though</li>
            <li> Goes in easy, black and stays black.</li>
            <li> Works well when doing cursive names and shades pretty well , dark as they come.</li>
            <li> I particularly like this shade of black because it sets in well in dark skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional tattoo artist by any means.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re serious about tattooing or just starting out, get a bigger bottle of black because 1/2 an ounce will be used up FAST.</li>
            <li> I have done a tattoo before using india ink and it turned blue after a few years.</li>
            <li> I have all black and grey tattoos, and other inks i find turn grey/blue after a few years.</li>
            <li> And stays dark.</li>
            <li> Holds well in the skin and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of hammering or doubling over to set it in dark (unlike sumi).</li>
            <li> Dark, dark black.</li>
            <li> Im going to keep using this as my liner black</li>
            <li> Ink goes in the skin well and stays black.</li>
            <li> so I was forced to rush through it, and he will have to come back for round two.</li>
            <li> but also kinda like a shiny black if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> but I will not risk buying mom&#x27;s black ink again.</li>
            <li> it is to thin too me,it was hard to work into the skin,i had to go back over a lot of my lines a second time with this ink.</li>
            <li> This black is very dark.</li>
            <li> but the black onyx i found to be very black</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely BLACK!  </li>
            <li> Definitely black!</li>
            <li> Ink shows up real dark.</li>
            <li> Extremely Dark, Used For An Amateur Tattoo, Darkest Ive Seen!</li>
            <li> I did half of it and got bored and have yet to finish the other half</li>
            <li> My shipment was delayed due to bad weather, but still arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> It is just very bad quality ink, I would do more research on ink if you are serious about tattooing.</li>
            <li> Truest black I&#x27;ve ever seen!!</li>
            <li> or I was extremely off my game, it was the ink.</li>
            <li> Thick And Lasts.</li>
            <li> While tattooing it&#x27;s hard to get the ink to stay in and in a few short days it looked awful.</li>
            <li> it is a tad thin</li>
            <li> I am not sure if others have had this issue or I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update if anything goes wrong.</li>
            <li> I know that Mom&#x27;s is a trusted brand and used in every tattoo shop across the country, but this black is awful.</li>

            <li> I switched from Starbrite to this, huge difference. this ink actually stays in, doesn&#x27;t fade, keeps it&#x27;s color and heals quick. Deffinitely buying again</li>
            <li> ones of the best ink :)</li>
            <li> the ink is the best i have used so far</li>
            <li> Best ink I&#x27;ve bought! It&#x27;s definitely BLACK!  And stays black and sticks very well!!! Love it. Shipping was fast, packaged well!</li>
            <li> This black is very dark. And stays dark. It&#x27;s a very good price for a very good ink! I just recomend bigger bottles because this ink is perfect for lining and color. If you are experienced like I am you can also use it for grey shading.</li>
            <li> Came early and is high quality ink</li>
            <li> Smooth and stays dark. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting it again. No complaints.</li>
            <li> it is to thin too me,it was hard to work into the skin,i had to go back over a lot of my lines a second time with this ink.</li>
            <li> The label does not match the picture. But I don&#x27;t really care. The ink goes in and stays in pretty well,. Works well when doing cursive names and shades pretty well , dark as they come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional tattoo artist by any means. I just made a gun (not a rickety thing, honestly, my gun is on par with professional guns) and did some simple designs on my own skin. (if you&#x27;re going to do DIY tattoo, do some research into sterilization techniques and protocols that professionals and surgeons use, for pete&#x27;s sake. and try drawing the tattoo on your skin with regular pen for a few weeks to see if you really like it)&lt;br /&gt;This ink appears to be very good, and dark. It is hard to clean off the skin around the design though but in the end that is what you want. I have done a tattoo before using india ink and it turned blue after a few years. If this stuff turns blue i will definitely come back and update this.</li>
            <li> This is top quality ink and it got here sooner than expected. Will order again.</li>
            <li> The ink is too dark when it goes on the skin but otherwise from that it&#x27;s a great ink for that price. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Eh can be blotchy. Dark in some areas light in others</li>
            <li> very excited to use this, ive had no problems with this, i use this as practice ink thou comes out very well,&lt;br /&gt;tho i did try and tatoo a person once didnt come out like how i intended maybe it was myself idk the problem i had was the black quickly faded soon after, like i said could have been an error on my part, would appreciate helpful tips</li>
            <li> Best ink I have ever had its a nice black stays well and it&#x27;s American made and safe</li>
            <li> Just perfect ink. Works great :)&lt;br /&gt;Stays in the skin well, looks good, doesn&#x27;t fade just overall great product :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought ink before so I don&#x27;t have much to compare this too, but it worked really well for me! 💙 I bought a box of needles and this ink to fill in a tattoo on my side by myself. I did half of it and got bored and have yet to finish the other half lol but I intend on doing so in the future. It&#x27;s been a few more months now &amp; the color seems to be holding well!</li>
            <li> arrived quickly; the ink is very dark too. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product.  Ink shows up real dark.</li>
            <li> It is just very bad quality ink, I would do more research on ink if you are serious about tattooing.</li>

            <li> this is really good ink, i havnt been tattooing that long but compared to other inks ive tried, this is up there with the best, stays dark</li>
            <li> Extremely Dark, Used For An Amateur Tattoo, Darkest Ive Seen! Not Watery Like Many Other Inks, Thick And Lasts. ExtremelySatisfied.</li>
            <li> Great tattoo ink. I&#x27;ve been a skin candy prude for a number of years but decided to give moms a shot. This stuff is great! Holds well in the skin and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of hammering or doubling over to set it in dark (unlike sumi). I particularly like this shade of black because it sets in well in dark skin. I used this in one guy who has ALOT of freckles on his back and there was no change in depth throughout the different pigments. My canvas&#x27; girlfriend had drawn this design and I wasn&#x27;t allowed to tweak it at all, so I wasn&#x27;t too excited about that but I was happy to try this ink out. Unfortunately my canvas wasn&#x27;t good with pain so I was forced to rush through it, and he will have to come back for round two. My shipment was delayed due to bad weather, but still arrived a day early. I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Great ink love how dark it is and stays that way</li>
            <li> I received this ink in the mail on Friday and used it for the first time last night. This ink is really good stuff, not watered down and not mud but a happy medium. The color is perfect and It went in the skin smooth and even. I will be recommending this ink to friends and I will be buying more of it. The price was pretty good too, lol and it shipped fast. It came in a bubble wrap envelope. The bottle matched the picture on Amazon (not that it really matters, but it&#x27;s nice when it does) the only thing is one of the bottles had a dent in it (I&#x27;m sure it happened in shipping) but no ink was lost.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter as she does some tatooing. Watched her do one and the guy did not say anything but cool so I would have to say this is a pretty good description.</li>
            <li> Stays in the skin very well.  I definitely recommend this ink.</li>
            <li> Iron sakura cheap ink sticks better then this moms, it can&#x27;t be legit moms. ve used moms before, and was happy. But this was garbage</li>
            <li> If your looking for a perfect ink for tribals then look no farther! Stays dark and nice coverage! No blurred lines either!</li>
            <li> Finally got around to using this ink. So far, so good. Definitely black! I&#x27;ll update if anything goes wrong.</li>
            <li> love this brand ink... flows smoothing... doesnt fade and they have so many colors... but the black onyx i found to be very black but also kinda like a shiny black if that makes sense. i used more for shading than lining... 1/2 bottle... what ya got to lose?.... enjoy</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The ink takes really well to the skin. The black is bright and looks really good for out lines and filler..I would recommend this product to anyone pro or beginner...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moms ink, of course it is a great product and who doesn&#x27;t love nice dark black tats?! Buy it.</li>
            <li> ty..was a good deal and fast shipping..moms ink is high quality and for the price i would advice any artist to use</li>
            <li> works well, lays one of the blackest lines i have ever seen. very high qaulity ink . . . . thanks</li>
            <li> I Got it hella fast and the ink is so thick not thin like that cheap ink they sell for cheap it was a good price for a good qualitly thanks alot</li>
            <li> Met my expectations and a fair price</li>
            <li> One of the best blacks i&#x60;ve used!</li>
            <li> This ink looks great on my skin</li>
            <li> Awesome. Came on time, looks just like the picture and seems good quality!</li>
            <li> I got my order 3 days after ordering it.  I recomend this ink to all my friends its the best on the market, even if you dont tattoo, and go to an artist in  a shop, bring this ink with you, its the best tattoo ink on the market hands down.  I have all black and grey tattoos, and other inks i find turn grey/blue after a few years. this ink is crisp and black still.  i love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite black ink!!</li>
            <li> No. I know that Mom&#x27;s is a trusted brand and used in every tattoo shop across the country, but this black is awful. While tattooing it&#x27;s hard to get the ink to stay in and in a few short days it looked awful. I didn&#x27;t get it, I thought my machine was at fault and not hitting right or I was extremely off my game, it was the ink. I got a 20 color pack of Sakura and the black that it came with holds so much better than this product. I am not sure if others have had this issue or I got a bad batch but I will not risk buying mom&#x27;s black ink again. If you&#x27;re serious about tattooing or just starting out, get a bigger bottle of black because 1/2 an ounce will be used up FAST.</li>
            <li> Goes in easy, black and stays black.</li>
            <li> Spectacular ink!!!!!  Truest black I&#x27;ve ever seen!!</li>
            <li> I bought this with another set of inks and recieved them all within a few days of placing my order and I am very happy with them.</li>
