            <li>Love not having to wear mascara!</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I decided maybe if I just dyed them they would look better - and it worked!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I will buy again for SURE!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m able to squeeze two applications out of each capsule!</li>
            <li>Anyway, the product was easy to use and works great, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re lucky to get a good 3 days!</li>
            <li>So, if you are auburn, Light Brown probably won&#x27;t look great on you.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This Product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Well my eyebrows which used to be really nice,</li>
            <li>Now you are set up for doing your own.  </li>
            <li>&quot; handy.  </li>
            <li>Love, love love!!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to mix and apply, and works in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>This was very easy to use</li>
            <li>made tinting my brows so easy!</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>look nice on clean face look nice with make up!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty foolproof, easy to clean up, and best of all doesn&#x27;t stain the skin around your brows!</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe how quick and easy it was to get beautiful looking brows with this product, and for such a great price.</li>
            <li>I play up the browns in my red hair and haven&#x27;t fussed with my perfect brows in many weeks.</li>
            <li>The longest wear I&#x27;ve been able to obtain is maybe</li>
            <li>Ok i love tinting my brows</li>
            <li>but i dont mind because i will do it again when it goes away, its much better than using pencil, powder, tinting gel etc...</li>
            <li>Ok ladies (and gentleman?)</li>
            <li>for best shape results get yourself some of those plastic eyebrow shappers, find your correct shape and hold that on your eyebrow and fill in with the tinting solution... also get yourself some of those beauty q-tips to remove any tint solution from areas \\&quot;outside of the line\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>They look more defined and are easier to shape when the hairs are darker.  </li>
            <li>The capsule (there are 4 in a box) contained more powder than I would need for one application of both brows.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even able to try it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am with the results I got from this product.</li>
            <li>So glad I saved my money and bought the Godefroy tint instead.</li>
            <li>I got my eyebrows tattoo many years ago.</li>
            <li>I love not having to use an eyebrow pencil!&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>I was able to sleep, exercise, and wash my face without worrying if the tint would rub off.</li>
            <li>I can do it much better &amp; even with the stick they provide.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use the vasaline on your skin to keep from staining it.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and covers gray very well.</li>
            <li>Maybe 2 to 3 weeks at the most.</li>
            <li>And make sure to use vaseline on the skin around the brow</li>
            <li>:)....</li>
            <li>and I love me some eyebrows</li>
            <li>One brow was perfect, the other one needed a bit more, so another 30 seconds of dying... and DONE!  </li>
            <li>I completely love it</li>
            <li>I was able to apply the tint the way I wanted to with the brush</li>
            <li>and you can ration out the developer because it comes out in a .4 oz container with screw on top.</li>
            <li>I bought it on a lark while at the beauty supply and thought that I might be able to do what they do for me at the salon.  </li>
            <li>and this is better than both of those options.  </li>
            <li>(Is this really a con??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!!!!</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use and so much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how good it turned out, and how fast it was!  </li>
            <li>this stuff is awesome, as long as you FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say more 3-4, but it is still a bargain and easy to mix and use.</li>
            <li>This is so fun to apply, I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>but that is what happens when you dye your hair your natural color, LOL.</li>
            <li>I love this product to darken my light brown eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>It was easy to mix, and each capsule makes quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The product was easy to use and went on without a problem.</li>
            <li>Easy to order.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use, doesn&#x27;t damage.</li>
            <li>I use the stick they provide and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>First: I liked the product and its simplicity of use.</li>
            <li>so i got a shade lighter which I believe was dark brown and that worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this eyebrow tint, and I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I used the dark brown and and very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I tinted my brows last weekend, and ever since have been admiring how beautifully they turned out.  </li>
            <li>came out dark brown, which is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows came out great, nice and dark, no staining around the skin since I did apply some petroleum jelly as directed.  </li>
            <li>I only wish the stain under the hairs stayed as well since the first couple of days looked awesome.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick &amp; does the job, so I like the result!</li>
            <li>For sparse brows this is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>I have light brown eyebrows</li>
            <li>FABULOUS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Used the product last weekend, my eyebrows look great.</li>
            <li>I have medium/dark brown hair and my skin tone is fairly light.</li>
            <li>We followed the directions precisely.  </li>
            <li>It lasts several weeks and looks great.</li>
            <li>Tried the light brown</li>
            <li>but I used an old eyelash brush from my mascara that I cleaned really good.</li>
            <li>Which would be great if my hair was natural right now.</li>
            <li>NOW I CAN REALLY SEE MY BROWS !!!</li>
            <li>The instructions are super easy.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use and stays on for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Application is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use, and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole capsule at a time.  </li>
            <li>mix too much activator or you won&#x27;t get a very strong color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it because of the reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li>try wiping off the tint in 30-second intervals, then reapplying more product if needed, to gradually get to the exact color you want.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to no longer spend that time every morning to color in my eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And yes, this doesn&#x27;t last more than two weeks, but it is nice to wake up with eyebrows in the a.m.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I have nice, natural, rich color as you cannot tell I dyed them.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to use it because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This product is great, however, please read other reviews before using for some great tips on how to apply, how long to leave on, etc.  </li>
            <li>The  dark  brown eyebrow tint was delivered fast and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>The first time,  they looked great but only lasted 3-days for me and 2-days for my friend.  </li>
            <li>Good value for multiple months of use.</li>
            <li>, my arm/leg hair is baby blonde (like you can&#x27;t even see it), I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>Had eyebrow tinting done professionally before I did it myself to see if I liked the results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blown away to finally be able to see my brows, which are much fuller than I thought they were.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so inexpendive too, I really hope it lasts for more than a week.</li>
            <li>I was able to get it off without much of a problem using a qtip and some hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>After researching I saw that Godefroy had a good possible eyebrow tint.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad thing, just an observation.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective - enhance your face in one easy step.</li>
            <li>But this was SUPER</li>
            <li>The stain wears off fairly quickly but it is just easier to not let it touch</li>
            <li>Any excess washes off quickly within a day or two.  </li>
            <li>If you wait, you&#x27;ll be better able to gauge if you want to re-apply a second time.</li>
            <li>and I was on my way to super results.</li>
            <li>Works very quickly and has good results, lasts a bit longer than most but not long enough.</li>
            <li>I found that amazon does sell the \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; kit for a higher price</li>
            <li>Really happy with the dark brown.  </li>
            <li>It colors eyebrows so easily and super fast.</li>
            <li>But even so, my review is 100% positive because product description is accurate.</li>
            <li>These tips were very helpful when I used the product myself!!</li>
            <li>Since I dye my own eyebrows (much more convenient than going to a salon and way  less costly and time consuming)</li>
            <li>So, I bought Light Brown, and left it on for one minute, wiped off, did it again 2 minutes, wiped off, and did it again one more minute.</li>
            <li>One of the nice things about this product is that you get the color in 4 individual doses, along with 4 mixing sticks.</li>
            <li>This really does work and looks great but be careful not to dye your skin around the brows and follow the directions using vaseline around the area</li>
            <li>you can always wash it off early to check then apply more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may give it another try to see if it is worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I now can see enough of a line to do my own brows with this dye product.  </li>
            <li>but the tint tends to wash away every time you wash your face but was worth the try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never colored my own brows before, only had it done at the salon...</li>
            <li>I looked so fun in the beginning</li>
            <li>Maybe we just don&#x27;t have the right skin type for this product?  </li>
            <li>My brows are naturally a very light ashy gray/black color that looks barely there.</li>
            <li>to mix, easy to apply, it tints the eyebrows just right, so right that they look very natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a super fair, natural blonde</li>
            <li>I recommend opening the capsules and using a pinch of powder + developer to get your moneys worth, as using a full capsule is way too much product for just one use, and you just end up wasting it.</li>
            <li>Following the instructions was very easy.  </li>
            <li>Great product I also tried Eylure Dyelash and was not pleased with it.</li>
            <li>But because it&#x27;s so easy to use and the results give a natural look, I would repurchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, not messy &amp; gives the results it claims.</li>
            <li>This works very well, and quickly.  </li>
            <li>The second time,  they looked great but only lasted 2 days for both of us.  </li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t give me much more than my natural color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, it doesn&#x27;t stain as much as what I get from the salon or from the hair dye.</li>
            <li>worry too much about it getting on your skin, it washes off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are very light blonde</li>
            <li>Worked exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely order more when I need it.</li>
            <li>I only wish they included a couple more of the color.</li>
            <li>Real eyebrows!</li>
            <li>Looks OK but just too dark for light to medium brown hair.</li>
            <li>have a hair stylist/salon prep you first by waxing your brows.</li>
            <li>When you try it for the first time, take the dye off your eyebrows and wait about an hour.  </li>
            <li>But this product delivers exactly what is promises.</li>
            <li>This is my first review</li>
            <li>I used the medium brown, which was the perfect shade for my very pale skin and blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, looks natural (a little dark the first 2 days, then perfect), lasts over a month.</li>
            <li>I used several brands before but this one works the best and the result is long lasting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced the color will last six weeks, but I&#x27;m headed into my third week and it looks pretty good still.</li>
            <li>maybe this product is only good  for the one that have light eyebrow.my eyebrow is pretty black and ain&#x27;t work on mine.</li>
            <li>however I love anything beauty and thought I&#x27;d give it a try anyway (especially since I wasnt blessed with much in the brow dept</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the results and how long it has lasted, along with the price of the item for the number of applications.</li>
            <li>Do follow the directions exactly, it works very well</li>
            <li>This is my first time that I try to dye my eyebrow very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that they do dye your skin and it will sting sometimes, but otherwise a great product for light brows or change of hair color.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for a while-- 20 minutes or so, so it makes my eyebrows nice and dark.</li>
            <li>and my brows still look nice and dark.</li>
            <li>My eyebrow are dark and looking nice and even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tinted my eye brows before so have no other products for comparison but this really works for light hair.</li>
            <li>Application was easy, and the results are terrific!  </li>
            <li>so I was really amazed the first time I used it how much difference it made.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend a professional application first so she can recommend the right color of tint to use.</li>
            <li>I prefer super dark brows so the dark color works great for me.</li>
            <li>Simple to use, and I will be back for more when it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li>This has also saved me some time in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>It works fast.</li>
            <li>mixed like you would dye your hair-using a cheap eyeliner brush to apply</li>
            <li>(Very Helpful)   </li>
            <li>I was ready to have my brows salon tinted when I found this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this to make my eyebrow lighter but it get much darker.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t think you will need to use the whole thing....</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much of this product</li>
            <li>but it does really work.  </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t see a way around it.</li>
            <li>Tks much</li>
            <li>With the price of this product you really can&#x27;t beat the value.</li>
            <li>anyhow I figured I dont have much to lose</li>
            <li>I found I didnt need the whole capsule</li>
            <li>I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>and it was so much easier.</li>
            <li>so I  repurchased my old favorites and this morning performed the act-wiped it off-wella!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to mix and application easy and very fast acting, covered all the gray but medium brown was almost black and did not come off with shampoo or face cleanser.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, one capsule contains more tint than is needed, so you can easily use half a capsule, which would make one box last for months.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, takes only 2 minutes &amp; it really does last!!  </li>
            <li>They still look great 4 days later though but verdict is still out on how long this will last.</li>
            <li>I tried a couple of other eyebrow tint kits and while they worked okay, nothing compares to the Godefroy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>For 8 minutes total time to do, this is worth it!</li>
            <li>but I really felt like I was looking so much older with what looked like no eye brows.</li>
            <li>I let my natural brunette color grow in for the first time in 10 years, and it is much darker than my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>my hair is dyed auburn right now and a lot of the reviews said even the Light Brown looks dark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and gives lasting results and natural looking eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I looked like I had huge grey birthmarks behing my eyebrows for a day or two.</li>
            <li>With my first application, I noticed a nice, subtly, darker color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so my eyebrows look more black than before, can wait for the color on my skin to go away.</li>
            <li>you do NOT need an entire capsule for 1 application (i use maybe 1/3 to 1/4 of a capsule every application)... make sure you mix equal parts developer and tint...</li>
            <li>I am older and over the years over plucked my brows.  </li>
            <li>I tried it 3 times in a row on the same night and left it on more than 10 mins each time.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have enough eyebrows, it will fill them in (dying the skin) but this will quickly fade.  </li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to do anything extra to my eyebrows and I will definitely be ordering more to never run out.</li>
            <li>It filled in my brows and now I don&#x27;t have to wear eyebrow makeup every single day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have very light eyebrows and don&#x27;t like having to use makeup on them everyday.</li>
            <li>I wanted something just to make them stand out a little more....</li>
            <li>I bought some disposable mascara brushes (or you could clean up an old one and use that) and brushed the dye on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It colors nicely and is easy to mix with very little mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too cheap and easy not to give it at least a try!</li>
            <li>Please be careful when timing if you have light eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It really defines and darkens my eyebrows but looks natural.</li>
            <li>This will last me a long time :)</li>
            <li>I prepped the area around my brows with a waxy lip balm to prevent any tint from staining my skin and used just a thick cotton ball with warm water to wipe off the tint when done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, not too messy, and gave me lovely dark brows that look very youthful and natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also a very economical product in that the capsules containing the colour can be partially used at any one time.  </li>
            <li>Left it for 2 more minutes and wiped it off with wet cotton.</li>
            <li>Its amazing how many little thin, blonde hairs I actually had on my brows that filled in the gaps and gave my eyebrows thickness they hadn&#x27;t had in years.</li>
            <li>It mixed very fast that way.  </li>
            <li>This last a long time and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>If I were to dye my hair really dark brown or black, then this would be a good match, though.      </li>
            <li>It really gets dark quick,</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m done with my second brow, it&#x27;s time to wash off the first one.</li>
            <li>have dark brown hair with sparse, light colored eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Ok so the application for the dye is MESSY!</li>
            <li>This kept me from the scary Joan Crawford look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big enthusiastic thumbs-up!</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>I do recommend reading all of the brief instructions first.</li>
            <li>If you have light hair like me leave it on for less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I found that a half a capsule is more than enough dye for an application.</li>
            <li>I only used this last night and will update if it fades quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been filling them in for years using clear mascara and then eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Got the same results as the professional and it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>The instructions make it clear that you don&#x27;t want this stuff in your eyes or on your lashes.</li>
            <li>The directions scared me some, but they are clear and can&#x27;t argue with the results.</li>
            <li>natural looking brows</li>
            <li>My natural hair and brow color is ash/dishwater/</li>
            <li>And then I was too busy to return.</li>
            <li>use this eyebrow stuff on your lashes (using a mascara brush) too - it works very well (and has also stayed on my eyelashes for the last three weeks) - although it does sting your eyes a bit from the chemicals.</li>
            <li>This tinter works very and lasts several weeks for me.  </li>
            <li>I used an old mascara brush that seems to work well.</li>
            <li>While applying it I just washed it off early and kept re-applying it until I achieved the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problems with skin staining, and the finished results look natural.</li>
            <li>I had my eyebrows dyed professionally at my salon before I tried this product</li>
            <li>For very sparse brows, you need to leave on a bit longer than 2 minutes....and sometimes repeat with the left over mixture.  </li>
            <li>If you are only doing your eyebrows, you don&#x27;t need gobs of product to get the job done and this kit allows you to pick and choose how much you want to use at any one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sparse eyebrows, being of Asian descent</li>
            <li>and I have filled in my eyebrows everyday since the seventh grade.</li>
            <li>This is really easy to use and it will last a long time; I would say that one dye capsule could last through 3-4 uses.</li>
            <li>Follow timing instructions closely or you will get super dark brows.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have to note that on my light skin, dark brown color came out as pretty much black.</li>
            <li>but I like to use dark brown brow products because I find that tints and brow pencils or powders that are light brown or blonde tend to look orangey on me.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and only left the dye in for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>and as I&#x27;ve gotten older my eye brows are thinning and have become so blonde</li>
            <li>Watch the time carefully as it develops very fast.</li>
            <li>I made a small mess as I was struggling to open the powder capsule, but that was easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>I did a fairly sloppy application in order to get full coverage, and the tint that ended up on my skin washed right off.</li>
            <li>Next time I order a new product I will order one shade lighter.  </li>
            <li>I have been using regular hair dye on my brows when I do my new growth coloring and its always staining my skin.</li>
            <li>I saw this product and the price was right, so I ordered the dark brown kit.  </li>
            <li>I applied a second time, this time swiping back &amp; forth and really getting it in, even on the skin.</li>
            <li>Get yourself a thin makeup brush, the kind used for eye makeup application and apply the tint with that instead of the wooden application sticks...</li>
            <li>Apparently nothing but the gray!</li>
            <li>I also followed the directions and put a little lip balm above and below my brows, and used a cheap eyebrow brush that I wouldn&#x27;t mind potentially throwing away to put the color on.</li>
            <li>I have naturally very light hair and color it a dark (almost black) brown regularly.</li>
            <li>I like this product in general.</li>
            <li>all the negative reviews are for people with light brown.</li>
            <li>I use a small angled elf brush that was only a dollar to get precise coverage, then just rinse it after each use.</li>
            <li>but WOW I used this last night as directed and was immediately thinking \\&quot;I&#x27;ll never stray!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Im giving this product a 4 because i love the tinting concept but the packaging is not great...</li>
            <li>I purchased dark brown which is good if you have dark brown or black hair (no red in this product...</li>
            <li>I find this to work very well, but as other reviewers pointed out, I don&#x27;t think it lasts six weeks.</li>
            <li>I bought the medium brown the first time, and the dark brown the second time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is dark in the first 3 days but did not even last a week...</li>
            <li>I could probably get by with the medium brown kit since the dark brown is sort of a cross between a charcoal black and brown, and I have light skin.  </li>
            <li>With careful use and following directions of other reviewers, I can make an entire package last me a full year.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, highly recommend it and urge women to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other point:  </li>
            <li>Much easier than Godefroy -cleaner and less money</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can get away with using half a capsule of dye at a time, you don&#x27;t need to use a whole one and it will last twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I will definitely only use a half a capsule next time because I had a whole lot left</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This Product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.</li>

            <li> Now you are set up for doing your own.  </li>
            <li> &quot; handy.  </li>
            <li> Love, love love!!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to mix and apply, and works in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> This was very easy to use</li>
            <li> made tinting my brows so easy!</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> look nice on clean face look nice with make up!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty foolproof, easy to clean up, and best of all doesn&#x27;t stain the skin around your brows!</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t believe how quick and easy it was to get beautiful looking brows with this product, and for such a great price.</li>
            <li> I play up the browns in my red hair and haven&#x27;t fussed with my perfect brows in many weeks.</li>
            <li> The longest wear I&#x27;ve been able to obtain is maybe</li>
            <li> Ok i love tinting my brows</li>
            <li> but i dont mind because i will do it again when it goes away, its much better than using pencil, powder, tinting gel etc...</li>
            <li> Ok ladies (and gentleman?)</li>
            <li> for best shape results get yourself some of those plastic eyebrow shappers, find your correct shape and hold that on your eyebrow and fill in with the tinting solution... also get yourself some of those beauty q-tips to remove any tint solution from areas \\&quot;outside of the line\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> They look more defined and are easier to shape when the hairs are darker.  </li>
            <li> The capsule (there are 4 in a box) contained more powder than I would need for one application of both brows.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even able to try it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am with the results I got from this product.</li>
            <li> So glad I saved my money and bought the Godefroy tint instead.</li>
            <li> I got my eyebrows tattoo many years ago.</li>
            <li> I love not having to use an eyebrow pencil!&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> I was able to sleep, exercise, and wash my face without worrying if the tint would rub off.</li>
            <li> I can do it much better &amp; even with the stick they provide.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use the vasaline on your skin to keep from staining it.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and covers gray very well.</li>
            <li> Maybe 2 to 3 weeks at the most.</li>
            <li> And make sure to use vaseline on the skin around the brow</li>
            <li> :)....</li>
            <li> and I love me some eyebrows</li>
            <li> One brow was perfect, the other one needed a bit more, so another 30 seconds of dying... and DONE!  </li>
            <li> I completely love it</li>
            <li> I was able to apply the tint the way I wanted to with the brush</li>
            <li> and you can ration out the developer because it comes out in a .4 oz container with screw on top.</li>
            <li> I bought it on a lark while at the beauty supply and thought that I might be able to do what they do for me at the salon.  </li>
            <li> and this is better than both of those options.  </li>
            <li> (Is this really a con??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use and so much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good it turned out, and how fast it was!  </li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome, as long as you FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say more 3-4, but it is still a bargain and easy to mix and use.</li>
            <li> This is so fun to apply, I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> but that is what happens when you dye your hair your natural color, LOL.</li>
            <li> I love this product to darken my light brown eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> It was easy to mix, and each capsule makes quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use and went on without a problem.</li>
            <li> Easy to order.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to use, doesn&#x27;t damage.</li>
            <li> I use the stick they provide and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> First: I liked the product and its simplicity of use.</li>
            <li> so i got a shade lighter which I believe was dark brown and that worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this eyebrow tint, and I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I used the dark brown and and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I tinted my brows last weekend, and ever since have been admiring how beautifully they turned out.  </li>
            <li> came out dark brown, which is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows came out great, nice and dark, no staining around the skin since I did apply some petroleum jelly as directed.  </li>
            <li> I only wish the stain under the hairs stayed as well since the first couple of days looked awesome.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick &amp; does the job, so I like the result!</li>
            <li> For sparse brows this is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> I have light brown eyebrows</li>
            <li> FABULOUS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Used the product last weekend, my eyebrows look great.</li>
            <li> I have medium/dark brown hair and my skin tone is fairly light.</li>
            <li> We followed the directions precisely.  </li>
            <li> It lasts several weeks and looks great.</li>
            <li> Tried the light brown</li>
            <li> but I used an old eyelash brush from my mascara that I cleaned really good.</li>
            <li> Which would be great if my hair was natural right now.</li>
            <li> NOW I CAN REALLY SEE MY BROWS !!!</li>
            <li> The instructions are super easy.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use and stays on for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Application is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use, and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole capsule at a time.  </li>
            <li> mix too much activator or you won&#x27;t get a very strong color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it because of the reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> try wiping off the tint in 30-second intervals, then reapplying more product if needed, to gradually get to the exact color you want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to no longer spend that time every morning to color in my eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And yes, this doesn&#x27;t last more than two weeks, but it is nice to wake up with eyebrows in the a.m.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I have nice, natural, rich color as you cannot tell I dyed them.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use it because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This product is great, however, please read other reviews before using for some great tips on how to apply, how long to leave on, etc.  </li>
            <li> The  dark  brown eyebrow tint was delivered fast and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> The first time,  they looked great but only lasted 3-days for me and 2-days for my friend.  </li>
            <li> Good value for multiple months of use.</li>
            <li> , my arm/leg hair is baby blonde (like you can&#x27;t even see it), I have fair skin.</li>
            <li> Had eyebrow tinting done professionally before I did it myself to see if I liked the results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blown away to finally be able to see my brows, which are much fuller than I thought they were.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so inexpendive too, I really hope it lasts for more than a week.</li>
            <li> I was able to get it off without much of a problem using a qtip and some hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> After researching I saw that Godefroy had a good possible eyebrow tint.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad thing, just an observation.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective - enhance your face in one easy step.</li>
            <li> But this was SUPER</li>
            <li> The stain wears off fairly quickly but it is just easier to not let it touch</li>
            <li> Any excess washes off quickly within a day or two.  </li>
            <li> If you wait, you&#x27;ll be better able to gauge if you want to re-apply a second time.</li>
            <li> and I was on my way to super results.</li>
            <li> Works very quickly and has good results, lasts a bit longer than most but not long enough.</li>
            <li> I found that amazon does sell the \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; kit for a higher price</li>
            <li> Really happy with the dark brown.  </li>
            <li> It colors eyebrows so easily and super fast.</li>
            <li> But even so, my review is 100% positive because product description is accurate.</li>
            <li> These tips were very helpful when I used the product myself!!</li>
            <li> Since I dye my own eyebrows (much more convenient than going to a salon and way  less costly and time consuming)</li>
            <li> So, I bought Light Brown, and left it on for one minute, wiped off, did it again 2 minutes, wiped off, and did it again one more minute.</li>
            <li> One of the nice things about this product is that you get the color in 4 individual doses, along with 4 mixing sticks.</li>
            <li> This really does work and looks great but be careful not to dye your skin around the brows and follow the directions using vaseline around the area</li>
            <li> you can always wash it off early to check then apply more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may give it another try to see if it is worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I now can see enough of a line to do my own brows with this dye product.  </li>
            <li> but the tint tends to wash away every time you wash your face but was worth the try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never colored my own brows before, only had it done at the salon...</li>
            <li> I looked so fun in the beginning</li>
            <li> Maybe we just don&#x27;t have the right skin type for this product?  </li>
            <li> My brows are naturally a very light ashy gray/black color that looks barely there.</li>
            <li> to mix, easy to apply, it tints the eyebrows just right, so right that they look very natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a super fair, natural blonde</li>
            <li> I recommend opening the capsules and using a pinch of powder + developer to get your moneys worth, as using a full capsule is way too much product for just one use, and you just end up wasting it.</li>
            <li> Following the instructions was very easy.  </li>
            <li> Great product I also tried Eylure Dyelash and was not pleased with it.</li>
            <li> But because it&#x27;s so easy to use and the results give a natural look, I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, not messy &amp; gives the results it claims.</li>
            <li> This works very well, and quickly.  </li>
            <li> The second time,  they looked great but only lasted 2 days for both of us.  </li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t give me much more than my natural color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, it doesn&#x27;t stain as much as what I get from the salon or from the hair dye.</li>
            <li> worry too much about it getting on your skin, it washes off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are very light blonde</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely order more when I need it.</li>
            <li> I only wish they included a couple more of the color.</li>
            <li> Real eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Looks OK but just too dark for light to medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> have a hair stylist/salon prep you first by waxing your brows.</li>
            <li> When you try it for the first time, take the dye off your eyebrows and wait about an hour.  </li>
            <li> But this product delivers exactly what is promises.</li>
            <li> This is my first review</li>
            <li> I used the medium brown, which was the perfect shade for my very pale skin and blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, looks natural (a little dark the first 2 days, then perfect), lasts over a month.</li>
            <li> I used several brands before but this one works the best and the result is long lasting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced the color will last six weeks, but I&#x27;m headed into my third week and it looks pretty good still.</li>
            <li> maybe this product is only good  for the one that have light eyebrow.my eyebrow is pretty black and ain&#x27;t work on mine.</li>
            <li> however I love anything beauty and thought I&#x27;d give it a try anyway (especially since I wasnt blessed with much in the brow dept</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the results and how long it has lasted, along with the price of the item for the number of applications.</li>
            <li> Do follow the directions exactly, it works very well</li>
            <li> This is my first time that I try to dye my eyebrow very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that they do dye your skin and it will sting sometimes, but otherwise a great product for light brows or change of hair color.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for a while-- 20 minutes or so, so it makes my eyebrows nice and dark.</li>
            <li> and my brows still look nice and dark.</li>
            <li> My eyebrow are dark and looking nice and even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tinted my eye brows before so have no other products for comparison but this really works for light hair.</li>
            <li> Application was easy, and the results are terrific!  </li>
            <li> so I was really amazed the first time I used it how much difference it made.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend a professional application first so she can recommend the right color of tint to use.</li>
            <li> I prefer super dark brows so the dark color works great for me.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, and I will be back for more when it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> This has also saved me some time in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> It works fast.</li>
            <li> mixed like you would dye your hair-using a cheap eyeliner brush to apply</li>
            <li> (Very Helpful)   </li>
            <li> I was ready to have my brows salon tinted when I found this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my eyebrow lighter but it get much darker.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t think you will need to use the whole thing....</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much of this product</li>
            <li> but it does really work.  </li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t see a way around it.</li>
            <li> Tks much</li>
            <li> With the price of this product you really can&#x27;t beat the value.</li>
            <li> anyhow I figured I dont have much to lose</li>
            <li> I found I didnt need the whole capsule</li>
            <li> I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> and it was so much easier.</li>
            <li> so I  repurchased my old favorites and this morning performed the act-wiped it off-wella!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to mix and application easy and very fast acting, covered all the gray but medium brown was almost black and did not come off with shampoo or face cleanser.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, one capsule contains more tint than is needed, so you can easily use half a capsule, which would make one box last for months.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, takes only 2 minutes &amp; it really does last!!  </li>
            <li> They still look great 4 days later though but verdict is still out on how long this will last.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of other eyebrow tint kits and while they worked okay, nothing compares to the Godefroy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> For 8 minutes total time to do, this is worth it!</li>
            <li> but I really felt like I was looking so much older with what looked like no eye brows.</li>
            <li> I let my natural brunette color grow in for the first time in 10 years, and it is much darker than my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> my hair is dyed auburn right now and a lot of the reviews said even the Light Brown looks dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and gives lasting results and natural looking eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I looked like I had huge grey birthmarks behing my eyebrows for a day or two.</li>
            <li> With my first application, I noticed a nice, subtly, darker color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so my eyebrows look more black than before, can wait for the color on my skin to go away.</li>
            <li> you do NOT need an entire capsule for 1 application (i use maybe 1/3 to 1/4 of a capsule every application)... make sure you mix equal parts developer and tint...</li>
            <li> I am older and over the years over plucked my brows.  </li>
            <li> I tried it 3 times in a row on the same night and left it on more than 10 mins each time.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have enough eyebrows, it will fill them in (dying the skin) but this will quickly fade.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to do anything extra to my eyebrows and I will definitely be ordering more to never run out.</li>
            <li> It filled in my brows and now I don&#x27;t have to wear eyebrow makeup every single day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very light eyebrows and don&#x27;t like having to use makeup on them everyday.</li>
            <li> I wanted something just to make them stand out a little more....</li>
            <li> I bought some disposable mascara brushes (or you could clean up an old one and use that) and brushed the dye on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It colors nicely and is easy to mix with very little mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too cheap and easy not to give it at least a try!</li>
            <li> Please be careful when timing if you have light eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It really defines and darkens my eyebrows but looks natural.</li>
            <li> This will last me a long time :)</li>
            <li> I prepped the area around my brows with a waxy lip balm to prevent any tint from staining my skin and used just a thick cotton ball with warm water to wipe off the tint when done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, not too messy, and gave me lovely dark brows that look very youthful and natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also a very economical product in that the capsules containing the colour can be partially used at any one time.  </li>
            <li> Left it for 2 more minutes and wiped it off with wet cotton.</li>
            <li> Its amazing how many little thin, blonde hairs I actually had on my brows that filled in the gaps and gave my eyebrows thickness they hadn&#x27;t had in years.</li>
            <li> It mixed very fast that way.  </li>
            <li> This last a long time and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> If I were to dye my hair really dark brown or black, then this would be a good match, though.      </li>
            <li> It really gets dark quick,</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m done with my second brow, it&#x27;s time to wash off the first one.</li>
            <li> have dark brown hair with sparse, light colored eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Ok so the application for the dye is MESSY!</li>
            <li> This kept me from the scary Joan Crawford look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big enthusiastic thumbs-up!</li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> I do recommend reading all of the brief instructions first.</li>
            <li> If you have light hair like me leave it on for less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I found that a half a capsule is more than enough dye for an application.</li>
            <li> I only used this last night and will update if it fades quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been filling them in for years using clear mascara and then eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Got the same results as the professional and it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li> The instructions make it clear that you don&#x27;t want this stuff in your eyes or on your lashes.</li>
            <li> The directions scared me some, but they are clear and can&#x27;t argue with the results.</li>
            <li> natural looking brows</li>
            <li> My natural hair and brow color is ash/dishwater/</li>
            <li> And then I was too busy to return.</li>
            <li> use this eyebrow stuff on your lashes (using a mascara brush) too - it works very well (and has also stayed on my eyelashes for the last three weeks) - although it does sting your eyes a bit from the chemicals.</li>
            <li> This tinter works very and lasts several weeks for me.  </li>
            <li> I used an old mascara brush that seems to work well.</li>
            <li> While applying it I just washed it off early and kept re-applying it until I achieved the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with skin staining, and the finished results look natural.</li>
            <li> I had my eyebrows dyed professionally at my salon before I tried this product</li>
            <li> For very sparse brows, you need to leave on a bit longer than 2 minutes....and sometimes repeat with the left over mixture.  </li>
            <li> If you are only doing your eyebrows, you don&#x27;t need gobs of product to get the job done and this kit allows you to pick and choose how much you want to use at any one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyebrows, being of Asian descent</li>
            <li> and I have filled in my eyebrows everyday since the seventh grade.</li>
            <li> This is really easy to use and it will last a long time; I would say that one dye capsule could last through 3-4 uses.</li>
            <li> Follow timing instructions closely or you will get super dark brows.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have to note that on my light skin, dark brown color came out as pretty much black.</li>
            <li> but I like to use dark brown brow products because I find that tints and brow pencils or powders that are light brown or blonde tend to look orangey on me.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and only left the dye in for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> and as I&#x27;ve gotten older my eye brows are thinning and have become so blonde</li>
            <li> Watch the time carefully as it develops very fast.</li>
            <li> I made a small mess as I was struggling to open the powder capsule, but that was easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> I did a fairly sloppy application in order to get full coverage, and the tint that ended up on my skin washed right off.</li>
            <li> Next time I order a new product I will order one shade lighter.  </li>
            <li> I have been using regular hair dye on my brows when I do my new growth coloring and its always staining my skin.</li>
            <li> I saw this product and the price was right, so I ordered the dark brown kit.  </li>
            <li> I applied a second time, this time swiping back &amp; forth and really getting it in, even on the skin.</li>
            <li> Get yourself a thin makeup brush, the kind used for eye makeup application and apply the tint with that instead of the wooden application sticks...</li>
            <li> Apparently nothing but the gray!</li>
            <li> I also followed the directions and put a little lip balm above and below my brows, and used a cheap eyebrow brush that I wouldn&#x27;t mind potentially throwing away to put the color on.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very light hair and color it a dark (almost black) brown regularly.</li>
            <li> I like this product in general.</li>
            <li> all the negative reviews are for people with light brown.</li>
            <li> I use a small angled elf brush that was only a dollar to get precise coverage, then just rinse it after each use.</li>
            <li> but WOW I used this last night as directed and was immediately thinking \\&quot;I&#x27;ll never stray!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Im giving this product a 4 because i love the tinting concept but the packaging is not great...</li>
            <li> I purchased dark brown which is good if you have dark brown or black hair (no red in this product...</li>
            <li> I find this to work very well, but as other reviewers pointed out, I don&#x27;t think it lasts six weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought the medium brown the first time, and the dark brown the second time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is dark in the first 3 days but did not even last a week...</li>
            <li> I could probably get by with the medium brown kit since the dark brown is sort of a cross between a charcoal black and brown, and I have light skin.  </li>
            <li> With careful use and following directions of other reviewers, I can make an entire package last me a full year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, highly recommend it and urge women to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other point:  </li>
            <li> Much easier than Godefroy -cleaner and less money</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can get away with using half a capsule of dye at a time, you don&#x27;t need to use a whole one and it will last twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I will definitely only use a half a capsule next time because I had a whole lot left</li>
            <li> My natural brows are very thin and fine and sparse, I barely have to pluck and have spent the last 10 years using pencil and powder.   </li>
            <li> - this goes away :) The only other complaint I have is that I semi-freaked out when I dyed my skin around my brows - dark brown/green.</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair black, but my natural hair color is blonde.</li>
            <li> Be aware, that the dark brown will come out VERY dark initially.  </li>
            <li> I have dark hair and the few white hairs in my eyebrows were looking very noticeable!</li>
            <li> I am a mature woman with dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> In the long run I  finally got it but would  NEVER purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> Also this product does not last as long as promised.    </li>
            <li> I just happened to stumble upon this product and decided to try it, instead of using a brow enhancer, daily.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about trying to dye my brows on my own</li>
            <li> I am african american and have deep dark brown eyebrows</li>
            <li> Also, you can use only half a portion and it&#x27;s enough, therefore, lasts double the time!</li>
            <li> I did find that the medium would get dark enough if I left it a bit longer (10 mins, compared to 2-4), but I would prefer not to have to do that.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I think even that was too long.</li>
            <li> Does not cover the grey as promised in the add.    </li>
            <li> It has been 2 weeks and the color is still covering the grey.</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t feel like going to get your eyebrows done professionally every few weeks</li>
            <li> Pull the capsule apart, empty it into the mixing bowl,pour in enough developer to make a paste and apply using the provided pointy/slanted applicator.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long while and I would recommend it to anyone looking to give their eyebrows some color...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for long time wear try another brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my eyebroes for a long time.  </li>
            <li> You dont have to leave it on too long though.</li>
            <li> I have mostly grey eyebrows and had to leave it on for 5 minutes for it to work.</li>
            <li> The gray took several tries before it would change color</li>
            <li> you have grey hairs and have difficulty seeing those hairs, you might want to 1.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it specifically said it covers grey hair.</li>
            <li> Lasts just as long as when I go to the salon.</li>
            <li> Getting the capsule open was the only part that proved a tiny bit messy.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know how long the gray will stay tinted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed that my brows otherwise look unchanged--no big color difference--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad my hair is black because they would look really weird if it was any lighter.    </li>
            <li> Simple to use and my only complaint would be the capsules as they&#x27;re such a pain to open.</li>
            <li> I swiped a bit of vaseline across the skin above and below my brows, mixed just a little of one caspule</li>
            <li> - so don&#x27;t leave it on too long!</li>
            <li> I use this product about once a month to cover some obvious white hairs in my very dark brows.  </li>
            <li> I also closed my eye and covered it with a gauze pad to prevent anything getting in( I just like to be extra careful of course</li>
            <li> I have dyed black hair, light pale skin and green eyes and was going to get the black dye kit</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t lasting as long as the brows, but a box of four is still cheaper than a box of hair color, and it&#x27;s a lot less messier.</li>
            <li> I will be buying Dark Brown next</li>
            <li> I am 62 yrs old and in my younger years, plucked out my thick brows (thin was in back in the early 70&#x27;s!).  </li>
            <li> Next time I will keep it less than that.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m just waiting for it to fade, but next time I think I&#x27;ll try using less powder..</li>
            <li> I will probably use just half a capsule next time.  </li>
            <li> I used only half the capsule and had plenty of product to apply.</li>
            <li> the dye holder container was a flimsy plastic-the applicators were wooden sticks-it was a very messy procedure-if you don&#x27;t know the proper time (how would you if you never used it before on yourself)</li>
            <li> The color is black because I leave it on so long to cover the grey.</li>
            <li> BUT, I left it on my eyebrows for 2 minutes and they are way too dark!</li>
            <li> With so little brows the pencil and powder/gel products wouldn&#x27;t last throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Now my eyebrows finally match my dark hair color!  </li>
            <li> The kit comes with a little wooden stick applicator to stir and apply.</li>
            <li> The dark brown was too dark with my red hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not last 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I usually dye my brows when I dye my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> It faded so fast and the products ability to darken decreased over time.</li>
            <li> The capsules can be resealed if you are careful, and you can use the leftover color powder, even if it is not in the capsule.</li>
            <li> I used a wet paper towel to wipe the brows after a minute or two of processing time.  </li>
            <li> Although the colour fades faster in summer than winter, this is to be expected and the ease of using the product makes this a non-issue in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have naturally dark eyebrows that are disappearing with age AND turning grey.)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any harsh skincare products but my color doesn&#x27;t seem to last the 4-6 weeks that the box says.</li>
            <li> and I got tired of pulling them out with tweezers and because of that I was thinning my eyebrows out too much.</li>
            <li> I definitely see why people would be concerned that this would be too dark, almost black.</li>
            <li> so I only used half of one altough I could prob even get away with using less than that.</li>
            <li> I still fill in a little bit when I go out or have a concert (because my eyebrows are still not super thick), but for day to day I wake up ready to go.</li>
            <li> They send you only a few little applicator sticks, but you can dry and reuse them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an active swimmer and not really into a lot of make-up</li>
            <li> So black hair and blonde eyebrows looked a little funky.</li>
            <li> It made my brows look thicker--turns out the are not really sparse, just a lot of my brow hair is baby blonde/invisible!</li>
            <li> I definitely would prefer a small brush to the orange sticks, and because I did not use petroleum jelly,</li>
            <li> then any other product in the drugstore.    </li>
            <li> I have medium blond eyebrows and usually will dye them at the same time I dye my dish-water blond hair a darker brown.  </li>
            <li> There was very minimal shadow just at the beginiing of my brow, closest to the nose, which was gone after my shower this morning.</li>
            <li> Be very careful to not get it on exposed skin as it will stain.  </li>
            <li> It looks a bit weird for the first few days, but I doubt anyone notices other than myself (and I wear glasses, so that makes it harder to notice).</li>
            <li> My advice would be to mix very little color with the solution and not keep it on for too long.</li>
            <li> but read other reviews that said the black was too dark</li>
            <li> Got the dark brown one.</li>
            <li> If you want it really dark brown leave it on for four minutes instead of two.</li>
            <li> My friend uses the dark brown Godefroy tint too.</li>
            <li> so I ordered dark brown.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Dark Brown shade.  </li>
            <li> I bought the dark brown tint.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> you are worried about them getting too dark</li>
            <li> I chose the tint in Dark Brown and processed for three minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I color my dishwater colored hair dark</li>
            <li> My brows are naturally blonde, and so faint that they are barely visible.</li>
            <li> but it was too dark.  </li>
            <li> I tried this time the dark brown</li>
            <li> If you are medium to dark olive complextion, leave dye in a lot longer than recommended for darker results.  </li>
            <li> and my brows got really dark</li>
            <li> Its way too difficult to use and doesnt really do anything.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I use dark brown.  </li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown.</li>
            <li> i ll continue use dark brown for now and</li>
            <li> even if u have dark hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased dark brown and have medium to dark brown brows.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a lighter color than you think you need if you don&#x27;t want it too dark.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the eyebrow tint in dark brown.  </li>
            <li> This product does not work on dark eyebrows, maybe for lighter hair.</li>
            <li> and I purchased the dark brown kit.</li>
            <li> I just mix up enough dye to use for a one-time application, put it on thickly on my eyebrows and wipe off any excess on my skin with a q tip.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal as even with thick brows</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than the Roux brand eyebrow dye I&#x27;ve been buying for years, also much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> cuz my eyebrow was black dark and skin was painted also so i was not used to</li>
            <li> so I opt for the dark brown and leave it on a bit less than what the directions say to.</li>
            <li> Plus it suppose to be dark brown and my skin its black</li>
            <li> the dye lightly stained my skin (not too bad) and also made my brows tingle a little bit.</li>
            <li> They are a little too dark, however, other reviewers say that the color will lighten in a few days.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows turned out jet black.</li>
            <li> If your hair is any lighter than black</li>
            <li> There was less residue on my skin than when I&#x27;ve had tinting done by professionals.</li>
            <li> I might try splitting a capsule in half and tinting every three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the black color</li>
            <li> The problem is it dyes your skin black and</li>
            <li> And costs less.</li>
            <li> I used less than half of the capsule and developer and did 2 applications with some waste).</li>
            <li> think is i ordered dark brown what means black if u not sure between medium and dark brown pick medium.</li>
            <li> tried a similar product (Roux) but found the process complicated and the results spotty: some of my brow became very, very dark and some was still grey.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The tint arrives in a powder form which is packaged in little capsules.</li>
            <li> It has been a little over a week</li>
            <li> It comes in little capsules and you just mix the powder and developer together.</li>
            <li> They recommend that you cover the skin with Vaseline, but I find it&#x27;s very hard to get the Vaseline close enough without getting it in my eyebrows and ruining the dye job.</li>
            <li> Color is as described, a very dark brown.</li>
            <li> you have a few hit and miss trials and by then your skin is irritated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my brows with hair color and it fades within a few days.</li>
            <li> A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this stays on for a few days.</li>
            <li> I used women&#x27;s rogaine to regrow the hairs for a few weeks and then used this product.</li>
            <li> Also, it does appear GREEN when it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> I have a few gray hairs in my eyebrows</li>
            <li> (PLus, look at the time it took me, less than 5 minutes!)</li>
            <li> I used the stick that comes with the product for mixing and also a small stiff eyebrow brush to apply.</li>
            <li> The developer comes in a small bottle.</li>
            <li> made for those who usually color thier eyebrows in.</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;m usually lazy for another couple weeks before I do it again.</li>
            <li> For the past year I have had my hair stylist color my brows.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am now left with sparse gray eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> sorry for my english its not my language.</li>
            <li> not sure if I will order again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I tried it three times with the same result - no coverage.</li>
            <li> A waste of money!</li>
            <li> I just got tired of  plucking out the gray and using different products to cover the gray but not successfully.</li>
            <li> : It is very messy to apply -</li>
            <li> I have thin sparse brows, so I was nervous that I&#x27;d end up with black dye all over my forehead, but I used vaseline around them, and tried to just get the HAIR, not the skin when applying the dye.  </li>
            <li> Still, I recommend using this at least one day before you are going out, e.g., so you have time to thoroughly remove any staining.</li>
            <li> : The color does last, and don&#x27;t be afraid to scrub your skin if you accidentally dyed it like I did</li>
            <li> I noticed my eyebrows were getting gray and didn&#x27;t look as thick.</li>
            <li> I mean, this is a brow TINTING kit.</li>
            <li> I used a very small 1/8 tsp measure spoon for the developer and to stir.  </li>
            <li> Firs day was little bit weird</li>
            <li> I hate using a pencil (it just never looks natural).</li>
            <li> If you find that the brow shape is on the skin/outside of the line, remove it IMMEDIATELY or you will be stuck with weird eyebrows for a few days!</li>
            <li> If the tint stays on longer, Godefroy Instant Tint would be rated a 20 STAR. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong....</li>
            <li> I was tired to pay $20 every month for salon eye brow/lash tinting and thought I would give this a shot.</li>
            <li> This piece of crap didn&#x27;t even last 2 days.</li>
            <li> I was getting so tired off drawing them in</li>
            <li> but since my eye brows are so thin it wasn&#x27;t working so well.</li>
            <li> And it might stain your lids a bit if you are too sloppy, but</li>
            <li> It was getting too expensive to do at a salon.</li>
            <li> Not the company&#x27;s fault that I chose the wrong color for me.   </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my eyebrows would lighten up over a shorter amount of time than my hair, so I wanted to find a product that would allow me to just dye my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I just got the wrong color.</li>
            <li> Perhaps we are doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> It was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> and I hate coloring it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got the dark brown one. The instructions are super easy. I applied petroleum jelly on the skin around the brows to prevent staining. I left the mixture on my brows for 3 min and I&#x27;m happy with the result.</li>
            <li> I have used roux dye for years. It faded so fast and the products ability to darken decreased over time. This product is awesome! The dark brown was too dark with my red hair. But even so, my review is 100% positive because product description is accurate. I&#x27;m trying medium brown next. Recommend go lighter, you can always go darker if you aren&#x27;t happy. I play up the browns in my red hair and haven&#x27;t fussed with my perfect brows in many weeks.</li>
            <li> I get my eyebrows colored every 2-3 weeks. It was getting too expensive to do at a salon. So happy i found this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and gives lasting results and natural looking eyebrows. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with \\&quot;fading\\&quot; eyebrows for years, and tried everything.  This product is great, however, please read other reviews before using for some great tips on how to apply, how long to leave on, etc.  These tips were very helpful when I used the product myself!!</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I used several brands before but this one works the best and the result is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I was tired to pay $20 every month for salon eye brow/lash tinting and thought I would give this a shot. First: I liked the product and its simplicity of use. Good value for multiple months of use. On the directions it says to keep it on only for 2 minutes. I have to say that I think even that was too long. The tinting process is literally instant. Next time I will keep it less than that. Also, I have to note that on my light skin, dark brown color came out as pretty much black. This is not a bad thing, just an observation. I like this product in general. The only reason I am taking one star out is because this product can&#x27;t be used on eye lashes. For that I still have to go to a salon or just keep putting mascara on. I wanted to try it on my lashes but on the box it says that it may cause permanent blindness!!! Oops... I don&#x27;t think I will want to test it.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are very light blonde and I was considering a permanent tattoo on the eyebrow to darken them...until I found this product. It is super easy to use and stays on for a couple of weeks. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I used this product and it worked for me. I am happy with the results and the cost was wonderful. I can get up and go and I have eyebrows that you can see without applying any make-up.</li>
            <li> I have eyebrows! I&#x27;ve been filling them in for years using clear mascara and then eyeliner. Now I wake up in the morning looking human enough to leave the house without makeup. I still fill in a little bit when I go out or have a concert (because my eyebrows are still not super thick), but for day to day I wake up ready to go. This has also saved me some time in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use, and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole capsule at a time.  My only complaint is that it does not last 6 weeks.  The longest wear I&#x27;ve been able to obtain is maybe 10 to 14 days wear.  But because it&#x27;s so easy to use and the results give a natural look, I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> The  dark  brown eyebrow tint was delivered fast and in perfect condition. I have light brown eyebrows but I like to use dark brown brow products because I find that tints and brow pencils or powders that are light brown or blonde tend to look orangey on me. It works fast. If you want it really dark brown leave it on for four minutes instead of two. If you have light hair like me leave it on for less than 2 minutes. My friend uses the dark brown Godefroy tint too. Her eyebrows are sparse and blonde. She leaves it on for only a minute and it tints the skin under the brow hair as well so her eyebrows look fuller and she doesnt have to wear eyebrow powder for up to 2 weeks. The directions are simple and there are four individual servings(: I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Ok i love tinting my brows ps the tint only lasts like 3 or 4 days tops... but i dont mind because i will do it again when it goes away, its much better than using pencil, powder, tinting gel etc... Ok ladies (and gentleman?) here is the skinny... Get yourself a thin makeup brush, the kind used for eye makeup application and apply the tint with that instead of the wooden application sticks... you do NOT need an entire capsule for 1 application (i use maybe 1/3 to 1/4 of a capsule every application)... make sure you mix equal parts developer and tint... for best shape results get yourself some of those plastic eyebrow shappers, find your correct shape and hold that on your eyebrow and fill in with the tinting solution... also get yourself some of those beauty q-tips to remove any tint solution from areas \\&quot;outside of the line\\&quot;. If you find that the brow shape is on the skin/outside of the line, remove it IMMEDIATELY or you will be stuck with weird eyebrows for a few days! Im giving this product a 4 because i love the tinting concept but the packaging is not great...</li>
            <li> I have blond eyebrows, so I thought I would try to darken them.  The product is very easy to use and a great price. BUT, I left it on my eyebrows for 2 minutes and they are way too dark! Please be careful when timing if you have light eyebrows.  I am hoping the color will fade soon!</li>
            <li> Since I dye my own eyebrows (much more convenient than going to a salon and way  less costly and time consuming) I thought I would give Godefroy a try-First of all  the dye holder container was a flimsy plastic-the applicators were wooden sticks-it was a very messy procedure-if you don&#x27;t know the proper time (how would you if you never used it before on yourself) you have a few hit and miss trials and by then your skin is irritated.  In the long run I  finally got it but would  NEVER purchase it again.  For years I was using color charm hair dye  mixed like you would dye your hair-using a cheap eyeliner brush to apply (also used a shot glass to mix the dye and peroxide) so I  repurchased my old favorites and this morning performed the act-wiped it off-wella!!! Great Job.  Much easier than Godefroy -cleaner and less money-I can do my eyebrows quite a number of times with one dye bottle and the  peroxide.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very light hair and color it a dark (almost black) brown regularly. This is the best option I&#x27;ve tried for getting darker, yet natural looking brows in.under 5 minutes. I recommend opening the capsules and using a pinch of powder + developer to get your moneys worth, as using a full capsule is way too much product for just one use, and you just end up wasting it. I use a small angled elf brush that was only a dollar to get precise coverage, then just rinse it after each use. It&#x27;s really pretty foolproof, easy to clean up, and best of all doesn&#x27;t stain the skin around your brows! I don&#x27;t see myself looking for anything else now that I&#x27;ve found this product.</li>
            <li> My natural hair and brow color is ash/dishwater/mousey colored, my arm/leg hair is baby blonde (like you can&#x27;t even see it), I have fair skin. My natural brows are very thin and fine and sparse, I barely have to pluck and have spent the last 10 years using pencil and powder.   I was unsure what color to get bc my hair is dyed auburn right now and a lot of the reviews said even the Light Brown looks dark. So, I bought Light Brown, and left it on for one minute, wiped off, did it again 2 minutes, wiped off, and did it again one more minute. It made my brows look thicker--turns out the are not really sparse, just a lot of my brow hair is baby blonde/invisible! So my baby blonde hairs turned ash/mousey/dishwater colored. Which would be great if my hair was natural right now. I&#x27;m kind of disappointed that my brows otherwise look unchanged--no big color difference--but that is what happens when you dye your hair your natural color, LOL. Not the company&#x27;s fault that I chose the wrong color for me.   So, if you are auburn, Light Brown probably won&#x27;t look great on you. I will be buying Dark Brown next (because Medium Brown seems to be sold out at the moment), I will review that as well.   I definitely would prefer a small brush to the orange sticks, and because I did not use petroleum jelly, the dye lightly stained my skin (not too bad) and also made my brows tingle a little bit. Otherwise though, this is a great product. :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use and it works. Had eyebrow tinting done professionally before I did it myself to see if I liked the results but it cost $30.00. Since then I ordered the product, watched a google video on how to tint your eyebrows, and read the directions.Got the same results as the professional and it was much cheaper. Would recommend a professional application first so she can recommend the right color of tint to use.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use and so much cheaper than the salon. Dyes your eyebrows in what feels like seconds. By the time I&#x27;m done with my second brow, it&#x27;s time to wash off the first one. Lasts about 2 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> very good product.  Would buy it again.  Worked exactly as promised.  It is very easy to use.  Lasts along time.</li>
            <li> I am older and over the years over plucked my brows.  This product is amazing.  With so little brows the pencil and powder/gel products wouldn&#x27;t last throughout the day.  I now actually look as though I have brows even without makeup.  I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> I love this product to darken my light brown eyebrows. It really defines and darkens my eyebrows but looks natural. I have dyed black hair, light pale skin and green eyes and was going to get the black dye kit but read other reviews that said the black was too dark so i got a shade lighter which I believe was dark brown and that worked perfectly. I washed it off when i saw the color get to where i wanted it. It lasted maybe 2 weeks depending on what you use on your face. I use retin a and glycolic toner and also use vitamin c serum so it could of gotten lighter cus of the products i use.</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair black, but my natural hair color is blonde. So black hair and blonde eyebrows looked a little funky. I didn&#x27;t want to get black dye because it looks too bold (even with black hair) so I ordered dark brown. I had some shipping issues, but it worked out.     I was very excited to use it because of all the positive reviews. I followed the directions exactly and only left the dye in for 2 minutes. My eyebrows turned out jet black. According to my sister, I look like a cartoon, lol. I&#x27;m glad my hair is black because they would look really weird if it was any lighter.    Now I&#x27;m just waiting for it to fade, but next time I think I&#x27;ll try using less powder.. see how that works out.  If your hair is any lighter than black I would suggest the medium brown.. unless the cartoon look is what you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li> I have blonde eyelashes and brows. I&#x27;ve been coloring my brows with hair color and it fades within a few days. I also use BE eyebrow powder and gel kit which is great but time consuming.  I purchased the \\&quot;medium brown\\&quot; tint because I didn&#x27;t know that there was a lighter one. I read reviews and tips here on amazon. (Very Helpful)   I applied the tint last night. I mixed only 1/2 capsule and developer, used chapstick around my brows and began timing 1 min as soon as I applied.  NOW I CAN REALLY SEE MY BROWS !!! They are a little too dark, however, other reviewers say that the color will lighten in a few days.  I found that amazon does sell the \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; kit for a higher price but I will purchase it to use next time.  This is a great product and as others have said, I wish I had known about this years ago !!!</li>
            <li> Does not cover the grey as promised in the add.    Is not any different then any other product in the drugstore.    Also this product does not last as long as promised.    hl</li>
            <li> Godefroy Instant Eyebrow Tint worked as advertised.  It has been 2 weeks and the color is still covering the grey.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this eyebrow tint, and I am thrilled.  Even if it only last a week and I have to reapply, it will still save me time every morning doing eyebrow powder.  I can&#x27;t believe how good it turned out, and how fast it was!  Love, love love!!</li>
            <li> I have medium blond eyebrows and usually will dye them at the same time I dye my dish-water blond hair a darker brown.  They look more defined and are easier to shape when the hairs are darker.  Unfortunately, my eyebrows would lighten up over a shorter amount of time than my hair, so I wanted to find a product that would allow me to just dye my eyebrows.  I saw this product and the price was right, so I ordered the dark brown kit.  Gave it a try within minutes of it being delivered, and it works great!  It&#x27;s sort of like henna, with the powder color and the liquid activator.  It was easy to mix, and each capsule makes quite a bit.  I had a lot left over when I was done, and I applied it twice.  I will probably use just half a capsule next time.  My eyebrows came out great, nice and dark, no staining around the skin since I did apply some petroleum jelly as directed.  I could probably get by with the medium brown kit since the dark brown is sort of a cross between a charcoal black and brown, and I have light skin.  If I were to dye my hair really dark brown or black, then this would be a good match, though.      Anyway, the product was easy to use and works great, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Dark Brown shade.  Application was easy, and the results are terrific!  The package indicates the color will last for 6 weeks.  It has been 4 weeks since I applied the tint, and I can see it is fading a tiny bit, but I still do not need to use an eyebrow pencil. The capsule (there are 4 in a box) contained more powder than I would need for one application of both brows. I will definitely order more when I need it.</li>
            <li> One of the nice things about this product is that you get the color in 4 individual doses, along with 4 mixing sticks. The developer comes in a small bottle. So it&#x27;s a compact and inconspicuous package. I prepared according to instructions and it was all finished in 10 minutes. There was less residue on my skin than when I&#x27;ve had tinting done by professionals. One tip for users: Wear a pair of swim goggles to protect your eyes while applying. Then you won&#x27;t have to apply the solution with just one eye open. The instructions make it clear that you don&#x27;t want this stuff in your eyes or on your lashes.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. This product does what it says it will do. It&#x27;s easy to apply, not messy &amp; gives the results it claims.</li>
            <li> It doesnt last for two weeks like it says, it only lasts for about two days tops and then it fades away</li>
            <li> This piece of crap didn&#x27;t even last 2 days. I will never buy this again and do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  Recommend using a spoolie or eyebrow brush to apply.  Will color your skin a bit - just use some shampoo or dishsoap to remove it.  Follow timing instructions closely or you will get super dark brows.  My brows looks fuller &amp; no longer need pencil to fill them in.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, looks natural (a little dark the first 2 days, then perfect), lasts over a month. I no longer use eyebrow makeup. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it because of the reviews I&#x27;ve read. I bought the dark brown tint.  Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I tried it 3 times in a row on the same night and left it on more than 10 mins each time.  Didn&#x27;t work.  Not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I find this to work very well, but as other reviewers pointed out, I don&#x27;t think it lasts six weeks. I&#x27;d say more 3-4, but it is still a bargain and easy to mix and use. Glad I found it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tinted my eye brows before so have no other products for comparison but this really works for light hair. I&#x27;m an active swimmer and not really into a lot of make-up but I really felt like I was looking so much older with what looked like no eye brows. I was getting so tired off drawing them in and as I&#x27;ve gotten older my eye brows are thinning and have become so blonde so I thought I&#x27;d try this. This really does work and looks great but be careful not to dye your skin around the brows and follow the directions using vaseline around the area so you don&#x27;t.  I only wish the stain under the hairs stayed as well since the first couple of days looked awesome.  They still look great 4 days later though but verdict is still out on how long this will last. Will definitely use again.</li>
            <li> This works very well, and quickly.  Really happy with the dark brown.  I only needed a third of a capsule.  Glad I found it.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have very light eyebrows and don&#x27;t like having to use makeup on them everyday. So if you don&#x27;t feel like going to get your eyebrows done professionally every few weeks this stuff will do the trick. A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get away with using half a capsule of dye at a time, you don&#x27;t need to use a whole one and it will last twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t mix too much activator or you won&#x27;t get a very strong color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are worried about them getting too dark you can always wash it off early to check then apply more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry too much about it getting on your skin, it washes off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I have never tinted my brows before and some of the tinting horror stories had me spooked. But this was SUPER easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tint arrives in a powder form which is packaged in little capsules. Pull the capsule apart, empty it into the mixing bowl,pour in enough developer to make a paste and apply using the provided pointy/slanted applicator. I prepped the area around my brows with a waxy lip balm to prevent any tint from staining my skin and used just a thick cotton ball with warm water to wipe off the tint when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair with sparse, light colored eyebrows. I chose the tint in Dark Brown and processed for three minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced the color will last six weeks, but I&#x27;m headed into my third week and it looks pretty good still. I might try splitting a capsule in half and tinting every three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cost and the ease-factor, I would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> The directions scared me some, but they are clear and can&#x27;t argue with the results. I only wish they included a couple more of the color.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely perfect!! It colors nicely and is easy to mix with very little mess. It lasts for a long while and I would recommend it to anyone looking to give their eyebrows some color... Perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product about once a month to cover some obvious white hairs in my very dark brows.  It works quite well if you follow the instructions &amp; are watchful about the length of time you leave the tint on!  It&#x27;s quick &amp; does the job, so I like the result!</li>
            <li> The color lasted for over one month.  Next time I order a new product I will order one shade lighter.  But I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> It works but definetly doesn&#x27;t last. You&#x27;re lucky to get a good 3 days! If you&#x27;re looking for long time wear try another brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, wish I would have found it years ago! I color my dishwater colored hair dark so my brows don&#x27;t match. This solves that problem.</li>
            <li> I just happened to stumble upon this product and decided to try it, instead of using a brow enhancer, daily. With my first application, I noticed a nice, subtly, darker color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I save time being able to skip some of the brow routine every morning! I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> The package was defective the solution had spilled inside package. I wasn&#x27;t even able to try it. Save your money</li>
            <li> all the negative reviews are for people with light brown. I mean, this is a brow TINTING kit. why use if you don&#x27;t want to tint /darken your eyebrows. made for those who usually color thier eyebrows in. FABULOUS PRODUCT. made my life easier.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and the few white hairs in my eyebrows were looking very noticeable! This stuff is a godsend. I bought the medium brown the first time, and the dark brown the second time. I did find that the medium would get dark enough if I left it a bit longer (10 mins, compared to 2-4), but I would prefer not to have to do that. It will stain your skin, but you can scrub it off with a washcloth and soap. Still, I recommend using this at least one day before you are going out, e.g., so you have time to thoroughly remove any staining. They recommend that you cover the skin with Vaseline, but I find it&#x27;s very hard to get the Vaseline close enough without getting it in my eyebrows and ruining the dye job. They send you only a few little applicator sticks, but you can dry and reuse them. Alternatively, just use orange sticks from a nail kit. The capsules can be resealed if you are careful, and you can use the leftover color powder, even if it is not in the capsule.</li>
            <li> very easy to use. great price. it was delivered to my door the next day. will order again from them.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I let my natural brunette color grow in for the first time in 10 years, and it is much darker than my eyebrows. I was pencilling them in for a while but knew there must be an easier way. I found Godefroy and haven&#x27;t looked back! With careful use and following directions of other reviewers, I can make an entire package last me a full year. I just mix up enough dye to use for a one-time application, put it on thickly on my eyebrows and wipe off any excess on my skin with a q tip. I leave it on for a while-- 20 minutes or so, so it makes my eyebrows nice and dark. It looks a bit weird for the first few days, but I doubt anyone notices other than myself (and I wear glasses, so that makes it harder to notice). The dye lasts about 3 weeks and then I&#x27;m usually lazy for another couple weeks before I do it again. This stuff is great and I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> My daughters turned me on to this product and it works perfectly.  A great savings with today&#x27;s economy and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Used the product last weekend, my eyebrows look great. It&#x27;s like I have nice, natural, rich color as you cannot tell I dyed them. So simple to use. I will reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am with the results I got from this product. My brows are naturally blonde, and so faint that they are barely visible. I hate using a pencil (it just never looks natural). I was ready to have my brows salon tinted when I found this product. What a find! It was very easy to mix and apply, and works in a matter of minutes. I used the medium brown, which was the perfect shade for my very pale skin and blonde hair. I&#x27;m blown away to finally be able to see my brows, which are much fuller than I thought they were. As others have mentioned, one capsule contains more tint than is needed, so you can easily use half a capsule, which would make one box last for months. I&#x27;m also happy to report that the tint did not stain my skin in the slightest. I did a fairly sloppy application in order to get full coverage, and the tint that ended up on my skin washed right off. I honestly can&#x27;t believe how quick and easy it was to get beautiful looking brows with this product, and for such a great price. My local salon wanted $30 for a brow tint. So glad I saved my money and bought the Godefroy tint instead.</li>
            <li> I thought I loved this product until it was ruining what Lil brows I had left.    Plus it burned :|     No thx.</li>
            <li> And then I was too busy to return. So it was a big flush. Second time I had an issue with this product.</li>
            <li> Works very quickly and has good results, lasts a bit longer than most but not long enough. Wish there was a permanent fix.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my eyebroes for a long time.  I used the black color but it was too dark.  I tried this time the dark brown and it came out perfect.  I recommend it.  Of course, you need to use Color Briliance stain removal or similar products to remove the stain.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s only two minutes amd I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my eyebrow lighter but it get much darker. maybe this product is only good  for the one that have light eyebrow.my eyebrow is pretty black and ain&#x27;t work on mine.</li>
            <li> I purchased dark brown which is good if you have dark brown or black hair (no red in this product...which is good for olive skin) I am happy with the ease of application.  If you don&#x27;t have enough eyebrows, it will fill them in (dying the skin) but this will quickly fade.  The hair does stay dyed.  If you are medium to dark olive complextion, leave dye in a lot longer than recommended for darker results.  I ordered the medium brown for my husband and will use on his mustach too.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!!! I have been using regular hair dye on my brows when I do my new growth coloring and its always staining my skin. I looked like I had huge grey birthmarks behing my eyebrows for a day or two. Also, the eyebrow tint was gone in two weeks time. I only used this last night and will update if it fades quickly but WOW I used this last night as directed and was immediately thinking \\&quot;I&#x27;ll never stray!\\&quot;  I swiped a bit of vaseline across the skin above and below my brows, mixed just a little of one caspule (don&#x27;t think you will need to use the whole thing.... I used less than half of the capsule and developer and did 2 applications with some waste). I used a concealer brush that I bought for a dollar and swiped it on my brows, left it for about 2 minutes and wiped off. No staining! Darker brows! I applied a second time, this time swiping back &amp; forth and really getting it in, even on the skin. Left it for 2 more minutes and wiped it off with wet cotton. Real eyebrows! Yesss! There was very minimal shadow just at the beginiing of my brow, closest to the nose, which was gone after my shower this morning. I used the dark brown and and very happy with it. Give it a shot! It&#x27;s so inexpendive too, I really hope it lasts for more than a week. Time will tell!  Edit: It has been a little over a week and my brows are still noticeably darker. I can tell I will need to reapply this weekend but don&#x27;t mind because of the ease of use and speedy delivery of the product. Still very happy!</li>
            <li> It was actually a good product. I just got the wrong color.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for years. I got my eyebrows tattoo many years ago. And need a touch up and haven&#x27;t had the time and money to get them done. And it&#x27;s perfect to making them look better. For a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the 28 Day Mascara Tint (also by Godefroy) and I have to say: JUST USE THIS. It comes in little capsules and you just mix the powder and developer together. I bought some disposable mascara brushes (or you could clean up an old one and use that) and brushed the dye on my eyebrows. I only left it on for two minutes and my brows got really dark - so don&#x27;t leave it on too long! But its been three weeks and my brows still look nice and dark. I love not having to use an eyebrow pencil!&lt;br /&gt;Next: The mascara tint - I just have to warn you: Dont bother. Its way too difficult to use and doesnt really do anything.&lt;br /&gt;Just use this eyebrow stuff on your lashes (using a mascara brush) too - it works very well (and has also stayed on my eyelashes for the last three weeks) - although it does sting your eyes a bit from the chemicals. You dont have to leave it on too long though. Maybe a minute. And it might stain your lids a bit if you are too sloppy, but nothing that wont come off in a day (try some eye-makeup remover or Ponds cream or Vaseline) Again! Love not having to wear mascara!</li>
            <li> I loved the results of the eyebrow tint. I was able to sleep, exercise, and wash my face without worrying if the tint would rub off. I was in make up heaven. I didn&#x27;t have to use a eyeliner pencil. However, the second and third application did have the same results. The tint rubbed off within two days. If the tint stays on longer, Godefroy Instant Tint would be rated a 20 STAR. :(</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff! I have medium/dark brown hair and my skin tone is fairly light. I usually dye my brows when I dye my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t last long and I only dye my hair every couple of months. I use benzoyl peroxide on my face, so at times it can creep onto my eyebrows and bleach them. This is really easy to use and it will last a long time; I would say that one dye capsule could last through 3-4 uses. I definitely see why people would be concerned that this would be too dark, almost black. My advice would be to mix very little color with the solution and not keep it on for too long. I prefer super dark brows so the dark color works great for me. I also followed the directions and put a little lip balm above and below my brows, and used a cheap eyebrow brush that I wouldn&#x27;t mind potentially throwing away to put the color on. If you&#x27;re on the fence, get it! It&#x27;s too cheap and easy not to give it at least a try!</li>
            <li> This last a long time and easy to apply.  It really gets dark quick, next time I am getting a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> This tinter works very and lasts several weeks for me.  The color is as indicated.  I use dark brown.  Application is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice. I have mostly grey eyebrows and had to leave it on for 5 minutes for it to work. The problem is it dyes your skin black and this stays on for a few days. The color is black because I leave it on so long to cover the grey. I would prefer a lighter color. I may give it another try to see if it is worth the effort. I used an old mascara brush that seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Easy to mix and application easy and very fast acting, covered all the gray but medium brown was almost black and did not come off with shampoo or face cleanser. Looks OK but just too dark for light to medium brown hair. Watch the time carefully as it develops very fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! Very easy to use, takes only 2 minutes &amp; it really does last!!  My hairdresser did my eyebrows once &amp; they were all crooked. I can do it much better &amp; even with the stick they provide.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Well my eyebrows which used to be really nice, sort of &amp;#34;went away&amp;#34; once I hit my 50s, and now they are not only sparse, but the color has faded.  I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much of this product so I was really amazed the first time I used it how much difference it made.  I let the mixture sit on my brows a bit longer than is said to but it does really work.  Simple to use, and I will be back for more when it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> A friend and I did this together.  We followed the directions precisely.  The first time,  they looked great but only lasted 3-days for me and 2-days for my friend.  The second time,  they looked great but only lasted 2 days for both of us.  Perhaps we are doing something wrong.  I  will try again.  Maybe we got a defective batch?  Maybe we just don&#x27;t have the right skin type for this product?  I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong....</li>
            <li> I am a mature woman with dark brown hair.  I ordered this product to tint some graying eyebrow hairs.  The product was easy to use and went on without a problem. I used a wet paper towel to wipe the brows after a minute or two of processing time.  My skin was not stained and the brows looked great.  I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Ok so the application for the dye is MESSY! but I really don&#x27;t see a way around it. I tried using vasoline but since my eye brows are so thin it wasn&#x27;t working so well. I am SO HAPPY I tried this product since I have been struggling for years to regrow my over-tweezed brows. I decided maybe if I just dyed them they would look better - and it worked! Its amazing how many little thin, blonde hairs I actually had on my brows that filled in the gaps and gave my eyebrows thickness they hadn&#x27;t had in years. I have been searching for an answer to my problem forever and I am so happy to have found a fix! I used women&#x27;s rogaine to regrow the hairs for a few weeks and then used this product. I am so pleased with the results and how long it has lasted, along with the price of the item for the number of applications. This will last me a long time :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: The color does last, and don&#x27;t be afraid to scrub your skin if you accidentally dyed it like I did - it does not take the color out of the brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It is very messy to apply - I ordered dark brown. It is a bit darker than I thought, but your eyebrows should be a shade darker than your hair. While applying it I just washed it off early and kept re-applying it until I achieved the results I wanted. Also, it does appear GREEN when it&#x27;s on - this goes away :) The only other complaint I have is that I semi-freaked out when I dyed my skin around my brows - dark brown/green. I was able to get it off without much of a problem using a qtip and some hydrogen peroxide. I also used some make-up remover pads which contained alcohol. I was very pleased that it removed the color around my skin but did not remove the color of the brows. (Is this really a con??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!!!! I will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Good price  Easy to order.  Didn&#x27;t have to drive around looking for it  Came to my front door.  Tks much</li>
            <li> This tint is great. Be sure to use the vasaline on your skin to keep from staining it. The stain wears off fairly quickly but it is just easier to not let it touch were you do not want the tint. It is a great product and covers gray very well.</li>
            <li> I found that a half a capsule is more than enough dye for an application. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with skin staining, and the finished results look natural. The color doesn&#x27;t last anywhere close to 6 weeks though. Maybe 2 to 3 weeks at the most.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than the Roux brand eyebrow dye I&#x27;ve been buying for years, also much less expensive.  I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
            <li> I was nervous to tint my eyebrows at home but figured I would give it a try. With the price of this product you really can&#x27;t beat the value. The results delivered as promise however I did have to reapply the tint and leave it on for about 7-8 minutes versus the instructed 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li> This Product is amazing. It colors eyebrows so easily and super fast. Also, you can use only half a portion and it&#x27;s enough, therefore, lasts double the time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried anything like this before but turning 60 I noticed my eyebrows were getting gray and didn&#x27;t look as thick. This was very easy to use and I didn&#x27;t end up with dye around my eyebrows. I used the stick that comes with the product for mixing and also a small stiff eyebrow brush to apply. The gray took several tries before it would change color but I was nervous about the product getting on my skin and wiped it off after 2 to 3 minutes. Some of the gray took 3 attempts before it changed color. I used only half the capsule and had plenty of product to apply. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it wears off within 2 weeks. That will not stop me from continuing to use this and buying it again. I had my eyebrows dyed professionally at my salon before I tried this product and it only lasted a week. My eyebrows look thicker and define my eyes beautifully again.</li>
            <li> For the past year I have had my hair stylist color my brows.  I am 62 yrs old and in my younger years, plucked out my thick brows (thin was in back in the early 70&#x27;s!).  Unfortunately, I am now left with sparse gray eyebrows.  It was only on my hair stylists&#x27;s suggestion to let her wax to get a definite brow line and then color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have grey hairs and have difficulty seeing those hairs, you might want to 1. have a hair stylist/salon prep you first by waxing your brows. Now you have a definite brow line.  2. Have her/him color your brows.  Now you are set up for doing your own.  I now can see enough of a line to do my own brows with this dye product.  I use a magnifier mirror on a stand, good lighting, and have a \\&quot;Chapstick\\&quot; handy.  Use the Chapstick (no menthol or anything) and use that around the area you don&#x27;t want stained.  If you use the stick provided or a tiny brush you will need to brush the brow hairs against the growth several times.  For very sparse brows, you need to leave on a bit longer than 2 minutes....and sometimes repeat with the left over mixture.  Be aware, that the dark brown will come out VERY dark initially.  For sparse brows this is a huge plus.  Any excess washes off quickly within a day or two.  And yes, this doesn&#x27;t last more than two weeks, but it is nice to wake up with eyebrows in the a.m.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My eyebrow are dark and looking nice and even. I dont have to do anything with them anymore! look nice on clean face look nice with make up!&lt;br /&gt;Only think is i ordered dark brown what means black if u not sure between medium and dark brown pick medium. i ll continue use dark brown for now and when i finish package i ll try medium one. Firs day was little bit weird cuz my eyebrow was black dark and skin was painted also so i was not used to it.&lt;br /&gt;starts with medium even if u have dark hair. sorry for my english its not my language.</li>
            <li> After spending enormous amounts of money to get my eyebrows tinted in the salons, I decided that it was time to economize and try to save some money.  I tried a couple of other eyebrow tint kits and while they worked okay, nothing compares to the Godefroy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to mix, easy to apply, it tints the eyebrows just right, so right that they look very natural.  Although the colour fades faster in summer than winter, this is to be expected and the ease of using the product makes this a non-issue in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a very economical product in that the capsules containing the colour can be partially used at any one time.  If you are only doing your eyebrows, you don&#x27;t need gobs of product to get the job done and this kit allows you to pick and choose how much you want to use at any one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a couple of months back I went into a local business that specializes in threading (hair removal) and eyebrow tinting.  Lo and behold!!  What are they using to tint eyebrows?  Godefroy&#x27;s!!  And yes, charging me $25 for the privilege.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, highly recommend it and urge women to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other point:  When you try it for the first time, take the dye off your eyebrows and wait about an hour.  I&#x27;ve found that it takes awhile for the product to properly penetrate the hair shaft and reach its final colour.  If you wait, you&#x27;ll be better able to gauge if you want to re-apply a second time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is dark in the first 3 days but did not even last a week...not sure if I will order again.</li>
            <li> The box did not contain the 4oz bottle of developer, so I could not use it.  It was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and very effective.  I have eyebrows again, without having to draw them on every morning. Do follow the directions exactly, it works very well so don&#x27;t leave the dye on any longer than instructed.  There are four capsules so this ought to last for four months.  The blurb on the front of the box says the dye lasts six weeks, but I would say your eyebrows stay dyed about a month. And make sure to use vaseline on the skin around the brow or you&#x27;ll end up with caterpillar eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I purchased dark brown and have medium to dark brown brows.  I wanted something just to make them stand out a little more....this did it!  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about trying to dye my brows on my own however I love anything beauty and thought I&#x27;d give it a try anyway (especially since I wasnt blessed with much in the brow dept anyhow I figured I dont have much to lose :).... MY GOSH what a difference! They actually looked fuller and thicker! I found I didnt need the whole capsule so I only used half of one altough I could prob even get away with using less than that. I will buy again for SURE!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. It works in about a minute. It lasts several weeks and looks great.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I have very sparse eyebrows, being of Asian descent and I have filled in my eyebrows everyday since the seventh grade. But this product delivers exactly what is promises. It filled in my brows and now I don&#x27;t have to wear eyebrow makeup every single day.I am very pleased with my purchase. This product is definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it specifically said it covers grey hair. Unfortunately, I tried it three times with the same result - no coverage. A waste of money!</li>
            <li> It worked well initially, but it is not as permanent as it states. The color doesn&#x27;t stay for 6 weeks, it faded away in like 2-3 days after a couple of face-washing.&lt;br /&gt;Also, some hair dropped off from my eyebrow leaving bald spots - might be one of the side effects i don&#x27;t know really.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t work for me i guess.</li>
            <li> I tinted my brows last weekend, and ever since have been admiring how beautifully they turned out.  (I have naturally dark eyebrows that are disappearing with age AND turning grey.)  This product is easy to use, not too messy, and gave me lovely dark brows that look very youthful and natural.  You don&#x27;t realize how expressive eyebrows are until you start to lose them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a similar product (Roux) but found the process complicated and the results spotty: some of my brow became very, very dark and some was still grey.  The Godefroy product, however, is so simple that I only needed to read the instructions once and I was on my way to super results. I made a small mess as I was struggling to open the powder capsule, but that was easy to clean up. Here&#x27;s my best tip:  try wiping off the tint in 30-second intervals, then reapplying more product if needed, to gradually get to the exact color you want. This kept me from the scary Joan Crawford look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big enthusiastic thumbs-up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a super fair, natural blonde and I love me some eyebrows so this stuff is a must! Simple to use and my only complaint would be the capsules as they&#x27;re such a pain to open. Tried the light brown and it really doesn&#x27;t give me much more than my natural color so I opt for the dark brown and leave it on a bit less than what the directions say to. My brows come out perfect every time although I do have to tint them every 2 weeks. I don&#x27;t use any harsh skincare products but my color doesn&#x27;t seem to last the 4-6 weeks that the box says. Not a big deal as even with thick brows, I&#x27;m able to squeeze two applications out of each capsule!</li>
            <li> This is my first time that I try to dye my eyebrow very dissapointed. The only part that I got color was on my skin, maybe they forgot to write in the instructions ( Its not to change the color on your eyebrows ) Plus it suppose to be dark brown and my skin its black so my eyebrows look more black than before, can wait for the color on my skin to go away.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well. I use a limitless at a time and the product lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> used it only once...but the tint tends to wash away every time you wash your face but was worth the try</li>
            <li> Great product I also tried Eylure Dyelash and was not pleased with it. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> wow!  I&#x27;ve never colored my own brows before, only had it done at the salon... this stuff is awesome, as long as you FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!  I have thin sparse brows, so I was nervous that I&#x27;d end up with black dye all over my forehead, but I used vaseline around them, and tried to just get the HAIR, not the skin when applying the dye.  I waited 1 min and wiped off with damp cloth... I needed it a tiny bit darker, so reapplied, waited 30 seconds...  wiped off again.  One brow was perfect, the other one needed a bit more, so another 30 seconds of dying... and DONE!  I would recommend getting a lighter color than you think you need if you don&#x27;t want it too dark.  I got med. brown and my brows (which actually ARE medium brown) came out dark brown, which is perfect for me.  Also, use the vaseline!  It definitely did not color the skin where I had vaseline.  I&#x27;ll never pay $30 at a salon again!  (PLus, look at the time it took me, less than 5 minutes!)</li>
            <li> This is so fun to apply, I am in love with this product! I looked so fun in the beginning but after you remove it. I completely love it and I will keep buying it :D</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! My eyebrows look great, and it covered the light and gray ones perfectly. I even used it on my hair. I get grays, but they only frame my face and I hate coloring it. So after my eyebrows, I thought, Hm, what have you got to lose? Apparently nothing but the gray! It isn&#x27;t lasting as long as the brows, but a box of four is still cheaper than a box of hair color, and it&#x27;s a lot less messier.</li>
            <li> East to use and all done in 3 minutes!</li>
            <li> Very good! made tinting my brows so easy! I don&#x27;t think it lasts all the way to 6 weeks before I have to reapply it but overall I like it</li>
            <li> Lasts just as long as when I go to the salon. And costs less. Easy to use. And always arrives promptly.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product a couple of times now and she&#x27;s more than happy with it. Simple and effective - enhance your face in one easy step.</li>
            <li> easy to use, doesn&#x27;t damage.</li>
            <li> I ordered the eyebrow tint in dark brown.  Following the instructions was very easy.  Getting the capsule open was the only part that proved a tiny bit messy.  I used a very small 1/8 tsp measure spoon for the developer and to stir.  It mixed very fast that way.  It did take two applications to get the desired color I wanted but that was simple to do and there was still plenty left over.  Be very careful to not get it on exposed skin as it will stain.  Now my eyebrows finally match my dark hair color!  I&#x27;m excited to no longer spend that time every morning to color in my eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the product worked as advertised.  I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Since I use Buf-Puf to exfoliate my face daily, longevity is my only remaining question.</li>
            <li> This product does not work on dark eyebrows, maybe for lighter hair.</li>
            <li> I have a few gray hairs in my eyebrows and I got tired of pulling them out with tweezers and because of that I was thinning my eyebrows out too much. After researching I saw that Godefroy had a good possible eyebrow tint. I do recommend reading all of the brief instructions first. I am african american and have deep dark brown eyebrows and I purchased the dark brown kit. It says to leave on one to two minutes and double that if you are trying to cover gray. I used one capsule and did one eyebrow at a time. I used vaseline around the skin area as recommended so I wouldn&#x27;t get the tint on that area. I also closed my eye and covered it with a gauze pad to prevent anything getting in( I just like to be extra careful of course that was not in the instructions. The kit comes with a little wooden stick applicator to stir and apply. I used it to stir the product but I used an old eyelash brush from my mascara that I cleaned really good. I was able to apply the tint the way I wanted to with the brush and it was so much easier. I left the product on for about 4 1/2 minutes and wiped it off with a cotton pad then washed with lukewarm soapy water. The tint worked like a charm I thought I would have to apply it again to cover the gray but I didn&#x27;t. I will definitely only use a half a capsule next time because I had a whole lot left and you can ration out the developer because it comes out in a .4 oz container with screw on top. This is my first review and I had to give one because I know it&#x27;s a lot of women out there with my problem of gray in eyebrows. I just got tired of  plucking out the gray and using different products to cover the gray but not successfully. Now I don&#x27;t have to do anything extra to my eyebrows and I will definitely be ordering more to never run out. My experience is an A+ but I don&#x27;t know how long the gray will stay tinted. If I do have any future issues I will give an update.</li>
            <li> on the package it says that there should be 4 capsules, 4 sticks and a mixing cup. I received mine with 3 capsules only and 3 sticks and there were no mixing cup!</li>
            <li> My brows are naturally a very light ashy gray/black color that looks barely there. I use this every 2-3 weeks to darken them up. My only complaint would be that they do dye your skin and it will sting sometimes, but otherwise a great product for light brows or change of hair color. Color is as described, a very dark brown.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I bought it on a lark while at the beauty supply and thought that I might be able to do what they do for me at the salon.  The product that they use at the salon to dye my blonde brows takes about 10 min but this one took only 3 minutes.  I have brown hair and blonde brows and have used hair dye which takes 20 minutes and have also had them dyed at the salon and this is better than both of those options.  It&#x27;s quick, it doesn&#x27;t stain as much as what I get from the salon or from the hair dye. I use the stick they provide and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I use the opposite end to scrape off any excess. It lasts about 3 weeks.  For 8 minutes total time to do, this is worth it!</li>
