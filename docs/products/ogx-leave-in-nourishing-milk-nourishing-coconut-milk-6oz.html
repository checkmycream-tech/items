            <li>this was just ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Ok, but not as nourishng  as the Split End Mender</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that your products are Never tested on animals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the perfume - and a greatproduct</li>
            <li>I believe that if the weather in my area were more consistant I would have a better review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my hair smell good, but the scent is VERY strong and gives me a headache if I put too much.</li>
            <li>This product smells wonderful, and the scent will stay in your hair for quite a long time after application.  </li>
            <li>good deal and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Smells great but not so good on black hair</li>
            <li>Ok i originally thought that This was gonna be a leave in conditioner like a cream</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful &amp; really makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this leave-in, the scent is so sweet you almost want to taste it.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use as a leave-in for my fine, wavy, dry/frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Finally something that would make me happy.</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and light and worked well when i used hair oils and it also seemed to make my hair stronger.  </li>
            <li>I spray this leave-in and wait for a few minutes and it combs out awesomely.</li>
            <li>My daughter really likes it!!!</li>
            <li>Its a quick and easy fix when ur n a rush...</li>
            <li>Overall, it wasn&#x27;t for me, but it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>It helps me greatly during the summer as my hair is long and gets frizzy in the summer!</li>
            <li>Sure, it smells nice, but that&#x27;s not enough.</li>
            <li>It used to be a thick creamy product to put on the ends of your hair, and smelled delightful.  </li>
            <li>Second, it doesn&#x27;t do anything except smell good.</li>
            <li>So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Bottle was not what I would call FULL.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I MUCH prefer to just leave in the regular coconut conditioner, which is a very nice product.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter hates having her fine hair brushed....</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Not only do you get the great smell of coconut, it leaves my hair soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>Helps to make hair silky feeling and helps tame frizz plus it smells great to.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a leave in for my natural hair, it is a decent detangler and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>This is a good product but if you have curly hair you might want to use it with some other leave-in.</li>
            <li>and it make my hair shiny and detangled right away</li>
            <li>I mix it with Monistat 7 Vaginal Antifungal Cream, folicure for fine and thinning hair, and some cantu shea butter leave in conditioning repair cream this has made my hair really grown faster than it would normally grow in a month.</li>
            <li>It looks very oily after using it!</li>
            <li>Love this product; I use the entire line of Organix coconut products.  </li>
            <li>it actually kept my hair in place better</li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue to buy this!</li>
            <li>it still makes ur hair soft an shiny an frizz free an</li>
            <li>I visit a gym daily and the Nourishing Milk keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>It always leaves my hair soft, shiny, and full of body once I unwrap it.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle, my hair health did not improve, but i must say, it smells</li>
            <li>I spray it on after I get out of the shower and wrap my hair in a towel until I am ready to style it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li>While i will say that this product smells heavenly, I will also say it doesn&#x27;t do much for my 4C kinks.</li>
            <li>really helps with tangles and frizz.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair strong, long, and non-dandruff oriented because my hair needs some nourishment and something to drink every once in awhile</li>
            <li>Its a great water based product, however i&#x27;m not sure how much moisture it brought back to my hair.</li>
            <li>is what I bought in here is beautiful, not oily,or greesy).I have Long hair past my waist and baby</li>
            <li>so I use put it in a spray bottle and only spray on my roots only using one applicator of the monistat  and make sure to get a spray bottle that is about 16oz.</li>
            <li>I dont Think i will purchase this particular one again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on the coconut scent and a few sprays of this on damp hair</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair very soft and keeps it from being frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I got this being under the impression it was a cream at first, because of the bottle in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually a spray.</li>
            <li>Very light but heavy enough to moisturize.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and doesnt make it look greasy at all.</li>
            <li>As far as the product</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>I am giving it to one of the young girls where I volunteer.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the Organix brand coconut milk is made of all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The product really does soften my dry hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my normal to dry hair feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>My hair ends up being manageable and soft all day long.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but very long and hard to comb out.</li>
            <li>, what can i not say about this product, it leaves my hair feeling hydrated and soft without having to blow dry or flat iron my hair!</li>

            <li> As far as hair growth - I&#x27;m not sure if I see a direct result in the length of my hair from this product.</li>
            <li> I have thin/fine long hair.</li>
            <li> I trimmed it, and then started using this product after every shower or whenever my hair felt dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> I do not recommend for dry hair at all.</li>
            <li> I also spray it during the day on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I put this in while my hair is damp, before I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I can smell it for hours and that it weighs my hair down and makes my hair flat.</li>
            <li> I use this on wet hair after I shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use this product after a shower while my hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m a new fan of OGX and their shampoo and conditioner, but the nourishing coconut milk just seems weak.</li>
            <li> I do reccomend it to people but be wear if you have thin straight to slightly wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this every other day.</li>
            <li> My hair started breaking off more than before. :(</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel really rough!  </li>
            <li> also you can just use water and a conditioner if you choose not to buy any other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you Organix that you don&#x27;t,I can pray and hope other companies,all companies will follow your example..</li>
            <li> I like the other products from this line ( shampoo &amp; conditioner ).</li>
            <li> my hair gets very dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> This product was completely not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it makes my hair too silky and it weighs it down.</li>
            <li> and it still weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> It may weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> , other times I feel that the frizz is no better and my roots look greasy due to the product.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely tight curls, so i applied it on her hair as a detangler, and it caused her to get a rash across her forehead.</li>
            <li> Also the product seems watered down and not as fragrant as what I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> but I have long thin hair that is slightly wavy at some places</li>
            <li> I have fairly long, VERY thick, wavy hair.  </li>

            <li> When it arrived, the cap was broken, and went into the trash.</li>

            <li> I thought it was a cream but it is liquid, so i didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very satisfied!, what can i not say about this product, it leaves my hair feeling hydrated and soft without having to blow dry or flat iron my hair!</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time so when I could not find it ANYWHERE, I bought it here online. I don&#x27;t know why, but every store I checked was out of it and I panicked. My boyfriend LOVES the wonderful coconut fragrance, which NO other product can beat. I stocked up, in case it is discontinued.</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile back, i have bleached, over-processed hair. I trimmed it, and then started using this product after every shower or whenever my hair felt dry. I used the whole bottle, my hair health did not improve, but i must say, it smells AWESOME!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I have tried.  It makes my hair extremely soft and smells great also!</li>
            <li> I ordered this online because I couldn&#x27;t find it locally anymore.  It used to be a thick creamy product to put on the ends of your hair, and smelled delightful.  It is now a watery product, so I don&#x27;t like it as well, but it still smells very nice.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this product works for me or not....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair smell good, but the scent is VERY strong and gives me a headache if I put too much. I feel like I can smell it for hours and that it weighs my hair down and makes my hair flat.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long, VERY thick, wavy hair.  This product makes my hair very soft and keeps it from being frizzy.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I have silver gray hair and I have used alot of products to try and keep the coarseness and frizzies out of my hair. This product is perfect, not heavy or greasy and it smells great. I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> i received the product just as it showing here, and since I use in my hair for a time now, I recommend this...</li>
            <li> Smells great but not so good on black hair</li>
            <li> The smell is really strong and it makes my hair sticky! It looks very oily after using it!</li>
            <li> I use this every other day. Very light but heavy enough to moisturize. Its a quick and easy fix when ur n a rush...</li>
            <li> good deal and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and I saw this in Wal-Mart and it said Organix (Organic) and Coconut oil and so I thought it would work for me. Finally something that would make me happy. I bough this and the split end repair and GUESS WHAT? My hair started breaking off more than before. :( I do not recommend for dry hair at all.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff on my relaxed hair</li>
            <li> Love this product; I use the entire line of Organix coconut products.  My hair is in great condition, and smells good also</li>
            <li> This is a good product but if you have curly hair you might want to use it with some other leave-in. This one is too watery.  But it does help improve hair appearance.</li>
            <li> I use this on wet hair after I shampoo. I also spray it during the day on dry hair. It smells wonderful and makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a leave-in for my fine, wavy, dry/frizzy hair and I love it! It softens and the coconut scent is pleasing. I am allergic to scents, but this does not bother me as it does not trigger my allergies.</li>
            <li> This product was completely not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have healthy, curly hair.. and even tho it smelled really good, this product made my hair feel like a broom!! It made my hair feel really rough!  I did not like it at all, I will not reorder it.</li>
            <li> I got this being under the impression it was a cream at first, because of the bottle in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually a spray. I gave it to my sister. When it arrived, the cap was broken, and went into the trash. Also, some of it sprayed all over the packaging. Second, it doesn&#x27;t do anything except smell good. Overall, it wasn&#x27;t for me, but it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth. It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> Helps to make hair silky feeling and helps tame frizz plus it smells great to.  Worth the money. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I use it as a leave in for my natural hair, it is a decent detangler and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for overworked hair.  I spray it on after I get out of the shower and wrap my hair in a towel until I am ready to style it.  My hair ends up being manageable and soft all day long.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday but I used it in my hair this morning and I LOVE THIS SMELL! it actually kept my hair in place better and I&#x27;ve been smelling it all day. The only problem is I&#x27;m not sure if I was supposed to wash my hair first and then use it, but I did my regular maintenance and used it as a moisturizer. It gave my hair shine too!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and thd feel. It leaves my hair feeling soft and doesnt make it look greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product - i got cause we went to the beach and since i have an ombre on my hair i didnt want for it to be too fried from the sun so this helped alot :)</li>
            <li> Worst company I ever dealt with if I could do 0 stars I would. It&#x27;s too much mixed communication. As far as the product it&#x27;s ok I guess. But it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted. What I did want was supposed to be sent instead and it never was.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product. This is my third time buying it, it&#x27;s just wonderful. I have thin/fine long hair. I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out for a couple months now. I use this product after a shower while my hair is still wet. You only need couple of sprays to do the job. Smells wonderful &amp; really makes your hair soft. As far as hair growth - I&#x27;m not sure if I see a direct result in the length of my hair from this product. But I love it &amp; will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Yuck! Leaves my normal to dry hair feeling greasy.  I hate it! I ended up giving it to my husband after one use.</li>
            <li> Bottle was not what I would call FULL. Slightly more than 3/4 but I still feel cheated. Also the product seems watered down and not as fragrant as what I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> this product was just what i was looking for to soften and detangle afro kinky curly hair. It is non greasy and light and worked well when i used hair oils and it also seemed to make my hair stronger.  i wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> This is the best product anyone could ask for. Speedy service as well. Did wonders with my hair. Love it</li>
            <li> i like the coconut conditioner and shampoo better it really  is good and it grows my hair..!!!! this was just ok</li>
            <li> Not only do you get the great smell of coconut, it leaves my hair soft and bouncy.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great leave in product I mix it with Monistat 7 Vaginal Antifungal Cream, folicure for fine and thinning hair, and some cantu shea butter leave in conditioning repair cream this has made my hair really grown faster than it would normally grow in a month. I have natural hair so I use put it in a spray bottle and only spray on my roots only using one applicator of the monistat  and make sure to get a spray bottle that is about 16oz. Please do your research on you tube about monistat hair growth before trying this.  It may not work for everyone but it worked for me. I did find that you may have a headace if you do not dilute your monistat also you can just use water and a conditioner if you choose not to buy any other products. I wanted to use product that would keep my hair moisturerized.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My hair is fine, but very long and hard to comb out. I spray this leave-in and wait for a few minutes and it combs out awesomely. I will most definitely continue to buy this!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m a new fan of OGX and their shampoo and conditioner, but the nourishing coconut milk just seems weak. Too watery. Sure, it smells nice, but that&#x27;s not enough. I didn&#x27;t know when buying it, that it was a spray, or I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. I MUCH prefer to just leave in the regular coconut conditioner, which is a very nice product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  I put this in while my hair is damp, before I blow dry.  It also smells amazing...light scent of coconut!!!</li>
            <li> Ok i originally thought that This was gonna be a leave in conditioner like a cream but after i got it i relized that it was a spray an it still makes ur hair soft an shiny an frizz free an it smells amazin but if ur looking for a cream leave in conditoner this product is not for u. I gave it only 3 stars because it was a bit misleading.</li>
            <li> This is a great Leave in Conditioner! Helps take the tangles out. Smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product and it make my hair shiny and detangled right away but I have long thin hair that is slightly wavy at some places but it makes my hair too silky and it weighs it down. I used just one spray on my hand and then rubbed my hands and applied to my roots and ends and it still weighed my hair down. The problem is my hair type and definetly not the product. It smells great and has good ingredients and I am sad I cannot used this because my hair type cannot benefit from this product. I am giving it to one of the young girls where I volunteer. She has thick curly hair and I think it will work great for her but my thin hair cant handle the goodness of this product unfortunely. I do reccomend it to people but be wear if you have thin straight to slightly wavy hair.  It may weigh your hair down. I do recommend the shampoo though! It helps me greatly during the summer as my hair is long and gets frizzy in the summer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok, but not as nourishng  as the Split End Mender</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Good for my hair. Keeps my hair strong, long, and non-dandruff oriented because my hair needs some nourishment and something to drink every once in awhile and when I give it this, my hair is confidently content, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Organix Coconut Milk leave in Conditioner,(which is what I bought in here is beautiful, not oily,or greesy).I have Long hair past my waist and baby fine.&lt;br /&gt; I LOVE that your products are Never tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Organix that you don&#x27;t,I can pray and hope other companies,all companies will follow your example..&lt;br /&gt;My cats thank you too.&lt;br /&gt;Meow/Purrrfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt; Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt; Paula S. of Orlando, FL&lt;br /&gt;Age 51.[[ASIN:B000TGEJT8 Organix Shampoo, Nourishing, Coconut Milk, 13 oz.]]</li>
            <li> This line is amazing! It does the job.</li>
            <li> While i will say that this product smells heavenly, I will also say it doesn&#x27;t do much for my 4C kinks. my hair gets very dry and tight.  I was hoping for something a bit heavier. I like the other products from this line ( shampoo &amp; conditioner ). I dont Think i will purchase this particular one again.</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes it!!! Smells good!!!</li>
            <li> My grand daughter hates having her fine hair brushed....this solves the problem. I use it too...I love the perfume - and a greatproduct</li>
            <li> my daughter loved this</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful, and the scent will stay in your hair for quite a long time after application.  As for the nourishing effect that it has, I go back and forth.  Sometimes I feel that it keeps my frizzy hair in sleek condition, other times I feel that the frizz is no better and my roots look greasy due to the product.  I believe that if the weather in my area were more consistant I would have a better review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on the coconut scent and a few sprays of this on damp hair really helps with tangles and frizz.</li>
            <li> The product really does soften my dry hair. I visit a gym daily and the Nourishing Milk keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this leave-in, the scent is so sweet you almost want to taste it. Its a great water based product, however i&#x27;m not sure how much moisture it brought back to my hair. I would not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin. My daughter has extremely tight curls, so i applied it on her hair as a detangler, and it caused her to get a rash across her forehead. On the plus side, the Organix brand coconut milk is made of all natural ingredients. Also, if you have relaxed hair, this product works great as a setting lotion. It always leaves my hair soft, shiny, and full of body once I unwrap it. I hope this helps.</li>
