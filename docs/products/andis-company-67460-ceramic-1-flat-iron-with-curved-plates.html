            <li>I\\&quot;m very pleased withthe performance of this iron.</li>

            <li>and I really liked how it smoothed it out</li>
            <li>DOEST DO THE JOB RIGHT, NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!</li>
            <li>The ceramic plates kept my hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I love the curved plates</li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>I have an all natural(tightly coiled) hair and it straightens so smoothly when I desirethis type of hair style!</li>
            <li>I love how it can curl or flip my hair and takes a quarter of the time a curling iron would.  </li>
            <li>This is the best quality flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best flat iron&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>For my short, fine hair, the 1\\&quot; barrel is the perfect size.</li>
            <li>A very good flat iron for the value.</li>
            <li>The curved plates make it easy to style your hair, once you get the hang of using this iron.</li>
            <li>This is a great styling iron for your hair, the ease of use is a plus - not to mention the fact that it&#x27;s curved making it much better than any Flat iron.</li>
            <li>My hair stays straight (with some gel pre-straightening)and has a nice shine.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly and I was able to straighten my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I saved about $80 and this flat iron is really great.</li>
            <li>This straight iron does NOT pull your hair and it leaves your hair super smooth!  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you do it right, you won&#x27;t have any problem with indents from the concave side, you just have to move quickly.  </li>
            <li>not a rip-off, however, the curved plates made no difference towards rounding out edges of a smooth style.</li>
            <li>It heats up FAST, straightens well, has an on-off switch and heating light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size for my nape-length hair.</li>
            <li>really helps to curl straight hair easily.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of curved plates, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and the curved plates make it easy to flip hair up and or curve under after you flat iron.</li>
            <li>The heating controls could be a little more precise.  </li>
            <li>I have better luck with my chi ceramic (2001 version) flat iron.</li>
            <li>First I want to commend amazon.com for their fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the ends of my hair don&#x27;t look very good after using this.  </li>
            <li>And it really does work for all hair types.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset...</li>
            <li>Ads just a bit of curl to the very end of hair, so not stick straight.</li>
            <li>It stays hot consistently and it simply feels like a quality piece of equipment in your hands.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recently got a haircut with more layers and my stylist used a flat iron on my ends</li>
            <li>Other flat irons give my ends an nice sleek finished look, this makes them look a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li>(I normally use a curling iron).  </li>
            <li>This flat iron, although not flat, will straighten your hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The curved plates are a little tricky at first, but once you get the hang of them they add a nice little flip or curl to your hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really even tell the difference between this one and the really expensive kind.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one as a starting point for new users.</li>
            <li>This flat iron really does what it says.</li>
            <li>The handle can get a little hot sometimes, but that&#x27;s really the only major gripe.</li>
            <li>The only negative is if you don&#x27;t use smooth actions it makes indents in your hair.</li>
            <li>I was considering buying the expensive InfraShine flat iron, but then I read the reviews for this one, and I&#x27;m glad!</li>

            <li> No more drug store brands or designer brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely comparable to one of those hundred dollar irons, without the crazy price tag.</li>
            <li> bad bad bad!</li>

            <li> This is the best quality flat iron I have ever used. I can&#x27;t believe it was so inexpensive. It stays hot consistently and it simply feels like a quality piece of equipment in your hands. It&#x27;s definitely comparable to one of those hundred dollar irons, without the crazy price tag. I also like the curved plates because they give my bangs a little curve. However, I can just as easily not create that curve in spite of the plates.     You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.

I recommend every woman getting one of these, it&#x27;s a must have!</li>

            <li> Wonderful for curling your hair. Used it for about two years now and it is absolutely amazing. Would recommend it to anyone. I cant seem to find another one quite like it now...</li>

            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s OK.  Good for a back-up, maybe to keep at work.  It doesn&#x27;t glide as well as the more expensive ceramic irons, but it gets the job done. As always, you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> DONT BUY!! DOEST DO THE JOB RIGHT, NOT EVEN CLOSE!!! MY HAIR LOOK LIKE A TOTAL MESS!! I&#x27;m very upset... bad bad bad!</li>

It heats up FAST, straightens well, has an on-off switch and heating light. For my short, fine hair, the 1\\&quot; barrel is the perfect size. I highly recommend this one as a starting point for new users.</li>
