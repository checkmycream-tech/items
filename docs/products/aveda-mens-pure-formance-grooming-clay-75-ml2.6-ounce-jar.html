            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>Tea Tree Shaping Cream 3.00 oz]] which I consider to be a great pomade,</li>
            <li>Smells great and holds well all day.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the hold is great</li>
            <li>Great for manipulating hair to style</li>
            <li>Does a great job of holding my hair where I want it even when it is getting a bit on the longer side.  </li>
            <li>My wife always tells my how great my hair smells.</li>
            <li>Men or women, this is a great hair product.</li>
            <li>Good matte texture and smells great.</li>
            <li>Great product, i love it!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the good news.</li>
            <li>I can tell you, that this stuff is GOOD.</li>
            <li>Smells reasonably good, too.</li>
            <li>This holds the hair very nicely, but it has a very very strong tea tree/minty odor.  </li>
            <li>Sure the scent isn&#x27;t great, but you get used to it</li>
            <li>I love this product and my husband is so happy using it.  </li>
            <li>Its easier to use than &amp;#34;American Crew Fiber&amp;#34; as it is more malleable!</li>
            <li>Has a nice earthy smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Kind of restores your faith in the chemical engineers out there.</li>
            <li>Nice hair goop - but this price is nuts ($35 +</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and was able to get more when I needed it during the product reformulation!</li>
            <li>Does a very good job fixing the hair during a long period and have a great smell as bonus.</li>
            <li>It smells great, fresh and my hair is shiny and stays in place.</li>
            <li>Fair trade offs that I&#x27;m willing to make for a good hair day.</li>
            <li>I really love the smell of it -</li>
            <li>In terms of hold strength, i&#x27;ll give it a 3 star hold but the clay is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Now I have a short hairstyle, and this works great!</li>
            <li>With longer hairstyles, you do need to work the clay in your hands a bit more or it can tend to pull quite a bit when you apply it.</li>
            <li>and I love to style my hair with it.</li>
            <li>All in all I am very happy with Aveda Mens Pure-Formance Grooming Clay and will be using this as my regular product.</li>
            <li>Will keep using for sure.</li>
            <li>Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream is my top choice</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this grooming clay...</li>
            <li>Get bumbles sumo tech, insanely better.</li>
            <li>I started using this when I saw another reviewer reviewing another hair product and saying that this stuff was much better.</li>
            <li>The ladies love it.</li>
            <li>It would probably work even better in men with lighter hair that are going for the combed</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Very unique product.  </li>
            <li>but the hold was still pretty good, better than the Garnier Surf Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to have a long hairstyle, and this worked great!</li>
            <li>Everything came when it was supposed to, safe and sound.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still looking for a product that has a stronger hold that is easy to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lasts for a while and is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Strong hold&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry about fly-away unless the wind is really strong.</li>
            <li>It has strong hold, but isn&#x27;t to strong</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more economical.</li>
            <li>and I have not found anything else that is so free from residue when you rub fingers through hair after it sets in.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this product .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and smells pretty good too.  </li>
            <li>clay from Aveda feels lighter in your hair, yet still provides just as strong and even more natural (no shine) hold than the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream.</li>
            <li>And to top it off, the Aveda product is the same price as the B&amp;B but has an ounce more product</li>
            <li>Although this is still a great styling clay, the texture isn&#x27;t pliable enough to create much definition when shaping hair spikes, waves, parts, etc.</li>
            <li>I have been more than pleased since starting to use this clay.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>First, I love the smell--very warm and spicy, kinda like incense, though it is a little strong until you get accustomed to it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much of it, just a fingernail full and then spread it over your fingers and apply it to your hair.</li>
            <li>and it will be totally worth your investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price for me.  </li>
            <li>Is it worth it?</li>
            <li>Third, it&#x27;s very easy to wash, both from your hands and your hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent product but more expensive on Amazon than buying directly from Aveda.</li>
            <li>It has a nice herbal scent that&#x27;s not too strange.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what was needed.  </li>
            <li>First, the hold is noticeably stronger, and the hold lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Almost over powering at first.  </li>
            <li>Or just order from Aveda online direct for $23 (buy 3 and shipping is free, or find a discount</li>
            <li>Its website offers a much more reasonable price with possible free shipping.</li>
            <li>I have been using American Crew Fiber as my grooming wax to hold my hairs (I have medium-length, straight, undercut hairstyle), and Aveda is remarkably better than American Crew for many reasons.</li>
            <li>A small tip: if you put it in your hair it gets stiff pretty quickly, so use a hair dryer to warm your hair a bit because then you can style the clay really good.</li>
            <li>hair is short and fine, but thick enough that I need a more of a clay/matte paste to get a good hold on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job , it&#x27;s not as messy, good smell and easier to work than many other clay.</li>
            <li>If you want more of a crisp, shiny hold, apply it to wet hair.</li>
            <li>Super natural look, no zits.  </li>
            <li>This really is a &amp;#34;grooming clay&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>(No one ever mentioned the scent unless they were very close</li>
            <li>I need a product that will hold my hair straight up, but doesn&#x27;t freeze my hair into clumps.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Price could be much lower than what it is.  </li>
            <li>It gives a much more natural look, while still holding my hair in place for the entire day.</li>
            <li>Woody&#x27;s clay, BedHead Mastermind, BedHead Matte Separation Wax, Got 2B, Garnier Fructis Surf Hair (actually not a bad product especially for the price)</li>
            <li>so I need something with decent hold.  </li>
            <li>Hold is pretty good and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (I have thin, fine hair).</li>
            <li>The clay offers more control and leaves your hair looking natural and dry after use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten more used to it, but it smells a little bit like pitchouli, that hippy smell</li>
            <li>Second, the Aveda&#x27;s clay did not make your hair any stickier or harder than before grooming, which kind of sounds like a contradiction; you style your hair freely while your texture and softness of the hair are retained -- a property I have never found in any other grooming products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to wash out, some warm water and shampoo, but be careful the first few times to figure out how much you need.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a stronger hold but still manages to be softer with no hard \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; hair that you get with some products.</li>
            <li>Lastly, you generally need less amount of clay to style your hair, justifying slightly higher price for same volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you just have to settle with nothing less than the best</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use very much at all with my hair, not enough to shine, and it holds while I&#x27;m doing 60mph with the windows down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually like the smell very much</li>
            <li>Long lasting and strong hold.</li>
            <li>If you decide that isn&#x27;t what you want, just fluff up your hair, or apply it to dry hair to get a much more matte or natural look.</li>
            <li>Second, I much prefer the hold of the Aveda Pureformance Clay to the B&amp;B Sumotech.</li>
            <li>I only use maybe 2 of these a year, probably not even that much.</li>
            <li>This stuff came almost completely out with just a rinse</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t real goopy like some of the similar products</li>
            <li>I have short hair and usually like to do a messy look, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Like most guys, I have tried several products in the past...</li>
            <li>The only other product I use if I really want a crazy good hold but still to keep the natural dry hair looking type is the &amp;#34;Renati strong hold&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only drawbacks are the high price point and the musky/woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>As much as it pains the wallet, I will be using this for as long as it is in production!</li>
            <li>For me there is no other that compares.</li>
            <li>Oh well, back to my old standby...</li>
            <li>This grooming clay does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note-for it to work, your hair really need to be damp to wet.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and i have trouble with other stuff.</li>
            <li>It does its job of holding your hair without giving you the shine but still looking natural dry hair.</li>
            <li>Start with what you think is absolutely too little and work that in.</li>
            <li>Works really well mixed with a little aveda pomade.</li>

            <li> Hold is pretty good and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (I have thin, fine hair).</li>
            <li> The clay offers more control and leaves your hair looking natural and dry after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more used to it, but it smells a little bit like pitchouli, that hippy smell</li>
            <li> Second, the Aveda&#x27;s clay did not make your hair any stickier or harder than before grooming, which kind of sounds like a contradiction; you style your hair freely while your texture and softness of the hair are retained -- a property I have never found in any other grooming products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to wash out, some warm water and shampoo, but be careful the first few times to figure out how much you need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a stronger hold but still manages to be softer with no hard \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; hair that you get with some products.</li>
            <li> Lastly, you generally need less amount of clay to style your hair, justifying slightly higher price for same volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you just have to settle with nothing less than the best</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use very much at all with my hair, not enough to shine, and it holds while I&#x27;m doing 60mph with the windows down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually like the smell very much</li>
            <li> Long lasting and strong hold.</li>
            <li> If you decide that isn&#x27;t what you want, just fluff up your hair, or apply it to dry hair to get a much more matte or natural look.</li>
            <li> Second, I much prefer the hold of the Aveda Pureformance Clay to the B&amp;B Sumotech.</li>
            <li> I only use maybe 2 of these a year, probably not even that much.</li>
            <li> This stuff came almost completely out with just a rinse</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t real goopy like some of the similar products</li>
            <li> I have short hair and usually like to do a messy look, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Like most guys, I have tried several products in the past...</li>
            <li> The only other product I use if I really want a crazy good hold but still to keep the natural dry hair looking type is the &amp;#34;Renati strong hold&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only drawbacks are the high price point and the musky/woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> As much as it pains the wallet, I will be using this for as long as it is in production!</li>
            <li> For me there is no other that compares.</li>
            <li> Oh well, back to my old standby...</li>
            <li> This grooming clay does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note-for it to work, your hair really need to be damp to wet.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and i have trouble with other stuff.</li>
            <li> It does its job of holding your hair without giving you the shine but still looking natural dry hair.</li>
            <li> Start with what you think is absolutely too little and work that in.</li>
            <li> Works really well mixed with a little aveda pomade.</li>
            <li> may say, $30 seems maybe a bit much for a miracle, but just a lil dab goes a long way, should get you through a few months of use.</li>
            <li> I have medium long hair, and I switch between the bed-head look and a sleeked back Ewan McGregor pompadour style, so I need something that is versatile.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, my hair was flat.</li>
            <li> I wanted a flat finish, medium hold hair product</li>
            <li> Recommendation is to just use a dime size amount on dry hair, and it&#x27;ll last all day.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much, it could get a bit too hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for a long time.</li>
            <li> Just a bit of the clay on dry hair goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just so different than other comparable products.</li>
            <li> It does the same purpose as other cheaper gels in the market .</li>
            <li> well if your hair is dry (opposite for other pomades I&#x27;ve used).</li>
            <li> , you can apply it after your hair is almost dry, style it like you give a hoot...</li>
            <li> then drive down the highway with your window open while you blare SHERRY by Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons (</li>
            <li> The Aveda also has a drier look than the Sumotech; after styling dry hair with Sumotech, sometimes my hair would have a wet look.</li>
            <li> Great product, hold and ease of styling, but it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Does the job it is expected to do.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way when using this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Definitely start with small amounts to figure out what you need for your hair.</li>
            <li> I go for a messy look but my hair stays the way I style it all day long with this Aveda product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not sophisticated enough for this.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of other products.</li>
            <li> Average product for this price .</li>
            <li> and it really isn&#x27;t very powerful, or bad, anyways.</li>
            <li> I usually take a dime sized, rub it into my hands, and then rub it through my wet hair</li>
            <li> but after a few hours, my hair would be weighed down by the product and become flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a little dab&#x27;ll do ya.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but no more than crew or other comparables</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> This stuff is good...but tone down the odor man!</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like how heavy it was.</li>
            <li> I was using sumowax and its very firm and sticky and it was weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> This clay holds my hair all day in a non stiff non greasy way.  </li>
            <li> but when I recently changed my hairstyle, I found myself a little unhappy with the B&amp;B&#x27;s look and a recent change that made Sumotech smell a little like Noxema, at least to me!</li>
            <li> Now for the slight negative.</li>
            <li> Try it at an Aveda store if you&#x27;re not sure if it works for you or not.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have difficult hear to manage, but the sheer length of it means I need something</li>
            <li> I usually rocked a buzz</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s say it is not as tough for holding a crazy mowhawk or certain spike design.</li>
            <li> I know, sometimes when you read the news, it&#x27;s hard to keep going on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If Aveda does not learn, I would say room for competition to enter.. at least on this one product line.</li>
            <li> Men with thick hair who want to have the &amp;#34;Don Draper&amp;#34; look?  </li>
            <li> I have battled my thick hair for over 10 years now.  </li>
            <li> This keeps my thick hair in place and keeps it from getting out of control if it&#x27;s windy or humid.  </li>
            <li> But if you are struggling with thick hair and want to shape it the way you want then Aveda clay is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Horrible, leaves grainy white drandruff looking specs in your hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mind the pitchouli scent, but unfortunately my wife hates it</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just because I didn&#x27;t want to waste my time messing with my annoying hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The really annoying thing about some of the wax products is that they can be very difficult to wash out at the end of the day/night and are even difficult to get off your hands after application.  </li>
            <li> The bad news?</li>
            <li> It smells HORRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect amount of hold for my hair while smelling wonderful. Does not add any shine and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great product. Always buy it at my hairdresser in Frankfurt, Germany. It&#x27;s really expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the money. I really love the smell of it - it&#x27;s just so different than other comparable products. It kinda smells like herbal...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Its easier to use than &amp;#34;American Crew Fiber&amp;#34; as it is more malleable! It does its job of holding your hair without giving you the shine but still looking natural dry hair. Let&#x27;s say it is not as tough for holding a crazy mowhawk or certain spike design. In terms of hold strength, i&#x27;ll give it a 3 star hold but the clay is phenomenal. It does it&#x27;s job , it&#x27;s not as messy, good smell and easier to work than many other clay. Great product, i love it! The only other product I use if I really want a crazy good hold but still to keep the natural dry hair looking type is the &amp;#34;Renati strong hold&amp;#34;. Great great product as well, youtube it.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
            <li> This really is a &amp;#34;grooming clay&amp;#34;. Not greasy sticky or yucky. Very unique product.  Great herbal fragrance. you need this.</li>
            <li> I used to use Crew Pomade and wanted to try something a bit different.  I&#x27;ve used Aveda hair products before and finally settled on the Aveda grooming clay.  It has a nice herbal scent that&#x27;s not too strange.  Just a bit of the clay on dry hair goes a long way.  If you use too much, it could get a bit too hard to manage.  I have short hair and usually like to do a messy look, and it works great.  Recommendation is to just use a dime size amount on dry hair, and it&#x27;ll last all day.  Try it at an Aveda store if you&#x27;re not sure if it works for you or not.  They actually provided me a sample before I finally purchased it.</li>
            <li> Holds without a trace of stiffness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this. I used to have a long hairstyle, and this worked great! Now I have a short hairstyle, and this works great! If you want more of a crisp, shiny hold, apply it to wet hair. If you decide that isn&#x27;t what you want, just fluff up your hair, or apply it to dry hair to get a much more matte or natural look. Sure the scent isn&#x27;t great, but you get used to it and it really isn&#x27;t very powerful, or bad, anyways. The hold, well it&#x27;s excellent. I don&#x27;t use very much at all with my hair, not enough to shine, and it holds while I&#x27;m doing 60mph with the windows down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Now for the slight negative. With longer hairstyles, you do need to work the clay in your hands a bit more or it can tend to pull quite a bit when you apply it. As with everything, though, you get used to it and it isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Definitely start with small amounts to figure out what you need for your hair. Start with what you think is absolutely too little and work that in. It&#x27;s not hard to wash out, some warm water and shampoo, but be careful the first few times to figure out how much you need.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I get it at Aveda and I love to style my hair with it. A small tip: if you put it in your hair it gets stiff pretty quickly, so use a hair dryer to warm your hair a bit because then you can style the clay really good. I only gave it 3 stars here because this tub costs me $23 at the Aveda institute where I go to get my hair cut</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used in my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bumble &amp; Bumble Sumotech for a couple of years now but when I recently changed my hairstyle, I found myself a little unhappy with the B&amp;B&#x27;s look and a recent change that made Sumotech smell a little like Noxema, at least to me! So I noticed this Aveda Mens Pure-Formance Grooming Clay at my salon. First, I love the smell--very warm and spicy, kinda like incense, though it is a little strong until you get accustomed to it. (No one ever mentioned the scent unless they were very close so it&#x27;s not overpowering.) Second, I much prefer the hold of the Aveda Pureformance Clay to the B&amp;B Sumotech. It&#x27;s a stronger hold but still manages to be softer with no hard \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; hair that you get with some products. I go for a messy look but my hair stays the way I style it all day long with this Aveda product. The Aveda also has a drier look than the Sumotech; after styling dry hair with Sumotech, sometimes my hair would have a wet look. And to top it off, the Aveda product is the same price as the B&amp;B but has an ounce more product so it&#x27;s more economical. All in all I am very happy with Aveda Mens Pure-Formance Grooming Clay and will be using this as my regular product.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job fixing the hair during a long period and have a great smell as bonus. Will keep using for sure.</li>
            <li> **UPDATED 2/6/2014**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months of use, I actually revoke my initial statement that I prefer this over Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Shaping Cream. Although this is still a great styling clay, the texture isn&#x27;t pliable enough to create much definition when shaping hair spikes, waves, parts, etc. I&#x27;ve also found that it dries out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream is my top choice but I&#x27;m still looking for a product that has a stronger hold that is easy to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[original review in 2013]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B00AONXUIW Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream 3.00 oz]] which I consider to be a great pomade, but I didn&#x27;t like how heavy it was. I like to spike or shape my hair up but after a few hours, my hair would be weighed down by the product and become flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clay from Aveda feels lighter in your hair, yet still provides just as strong and even more natural (no shine) hold than the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream. It also washes out of your hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks are the high price point and the musky/woodsy smell. Fair trade offs that I&#x27;m willing to make for a good hair day.</li>
            <li> Has a nice earthy smell to it.  Holds well, without the crunchy/greasy look.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what was needed.  I love this product and my husband is so happy using it.  The vendor delivered!</li>
            <li> Just got some of this at the Aveda store. Hold is pretty good and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (I have thin, fine hair). That&#x27;s the good news. The bad news? It smells HORRIBLE. I feel like I should be wearing an Affliction shirt, some bedazzled jeans with rear flap pockets and some square-toed leather loafers. Yuck! Oh well, back to my old standby...</li>
            <li> I have been using American Crew Fiber as my grooming wax to hold my hairs (I have medium-length, straight, undercut hairstyle), and Aveda is remarkably better than American Crew for many reasons. First, the hold is noticeably stronger, and the hold lasts all day. Second, the Aveda&#x27;s clay did not make your hair any stickier or harder than before grooming, which kind of sounds like a contradiction; you style your hair freely while your texture and softness of the hair are retained -- a property I have never found in any other grooming products. Third, it&#x27;s very easy to wash, both from your hands and your hair. Lastly, you generally need less amount of clay to style your hair, justifying slightly higher price for same volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you just have to settle with nothing less than the best and it will be totally worth your investment. Give it a try. Its website offers a much more reasonable price with possible free shipping.</li>
            <li> I tried this product out in an effort to replace the thinning effect that gel has on my hair. I have been more than pleased since starting to use this clay. It gives a much more natural look, while still holding my hair in place for the entire day. A little goes a long way when using this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product but more expensive on Amazon than buying directly from Aveda.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this grooming clay...without a doubt it is the ONLY thing that works on my hair. I have medium long hair, and I switch between the bed-head look and a sleeked back Ewan McGregor pompadour style, so I need something that is versatile. I don&#x27;t have difficult hear to manage, but the sheer length of it means I need something strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Not gel&lt;br /&gt;- Strong hold&lt;br /&gt;- Low shine&lt;br /&gt;- Smells good&lt;br /&gt;- Aveda uses plants over chemicals, enviro-friendly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Freakishly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen, this is definitely more expensive than your Garnier Fructis junk, but it works and it works well. As much as it pains the wallet, I will be using this for as long as it is in production!</li>
            <li> OK, Aveda stuff is stupidly expensive, but I have to use it because it&#x27;s the only product that does not give me zits on my scalp.  This clay holds my hair all day in a non stiff non greasy way.  Super natural look, no zits.  It&#x27;s worth the price for me.  Besides, it ladts forever.  I only use maybe 2 of these a year, probably not even that much.</li>
            <li> This holds the hair very nicely, but it has a very very strong tea tree/minty odor.  Almost over powering at first.  Definitely want to wash your hair out before you go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short and fine, but thick enough that I need a more of a clay/matte paste to get a good hold on my hair.  This stuff is good...but tone down the odor man!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I am a female. Great on my bangs! I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Everything came when it was supposed to, safe and sound.  Isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re looking for when we order something?</li>
            <li> Just a little dab&#x27;ll do ya. I rub between the palms then into the hair and I don&#x27;t have to worry about fly-away unless the wind is really strong.</li>
            <li> I have short hair that I spike up in front. I need a product that will hold my hair straight up, but doesn&#x27;t freeze my hair into clumps. This grooming clay does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note-for it to work, your hair really need to be damp to wet. It doesn&#x27;t work that well if your hair is dry (opposite for other pomades I&#x27;ve used). I usually take a dime sized, rub it into my hands, and then rub it through my wet hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives&lt;br /&gt;1. It has strong hold, but isn&#x27;t to strong&lt;br /&gt;2. I don&#x27;t break out from using. My forehead tends to breakout and since I switched to this stuff, my breakouts have definitely gone down.&lt;br /&gt;3. gives just enough sheen-not too shiny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives&lt;br /&gt;1. I don&#x27;t really like the smell. I&#x27;ve gotten more used to it, but it smells a little bit like pitchouli, that hippy smell&lt;br /&gt;2. A bit pricey, but no more than crew or other comparables</li>
            <li> I know, sometimes when you read the news, it&#x27;s hard to keep going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can tell you, that this stuff is GOOD. Kind of restores your faith in the chemical engineers out there. Maybe, JUST MAYBE, humanity WILL figure out how to survive. If we can figure out how to hold hair in place, without it looking crusty, greasy, or chiseled in place by an aerosol, there is always hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may say, $30 seems maybe a bit much for a miracle, but just a lil dab goes a long way, should get you through a few months of use. Is it worth it? I say yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heck, you can apply it after your hair is almost dry, style it like you give a hoot...then drive down the highway with your window open while you blare SHERRY by Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons (or whatever the kids listen to these days); yet, when you get to your destination, just a simple hand through your hair, and presto, back to civility.</li>
            <li> Horrible, leaves grainy white drandruff looking specs in your hair. Get bumbles sumo tech, insanely better.</li>
            <li> Smells great and holds well all day. The smell is a earthy with hints of wood and citrus. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot and this will last about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and was able to get more when I needed it during the product reformulation! Thanks.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and strong hold. Good matte texture and smells great. Works really well mixed with a little aveda pomade.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and i have trouble with other stuff. This has been the best I&#x27;ve found Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Perfect thing to use for Men&#x27;s Hair</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for a long time. Lasts for a while and is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not sophisticated enough for this.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of other products. For me there is no other that compares. If they ever discontinue this product, I will cry.</li>
            <li> Nice hair goop - but this price is nuts ($35 + shipping costs presently).  My Aveda store sells for $20.  Or just order from Aveda online direct for $23 (buy 3 and shipping is free, or find a discount code).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the pitchouli scent, but unfortunately my wife hates it - so I do wish it had a different aroma.  Nonetheless, the hold is great and I have not found anything else that is so free from residue when you rub fingers through hair after it sets in.</li>
            <li> I started using this when I saw another reviewer reviewing another hair product and saying that this stuff was much better. I totally agree. I was using sumowax and its very firm and sticky and it was weighing my hair down. By the end of the day, my hair was flat. This stuff is creamy and it dries in your hair and keeps it up all day. I have short hair and I like my hair to look piecy and this does the trick. You don&#x27;t need very much of it, just a fingernail full and then spread it over your fingers and apply it to your hair. I love it and highly recommend it. It does have a fragrance, but I don&#x27;t mind it and its not over powering.</li>
            <li> I put this in my hair. The ladies love it. But so do bees. They attack my head and try to pollinate me. Maybe this stuff has flower scent in it?</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  Great for manipulating hair to style you want. Smells nice too. Sort of woodsy.</li>
            <li> I have short hair so I need something with decent hold.  Like most guys, I have tried several products in the past... Woody&#x27;s clay, BedHead Mastermind, BedHead Matte Separation Wax, Got 2B, Garnier Fructis Surf Hair (actually not a bad product especially for the price) and I like this one the best.  I wanted a flat finish, medium hold hair product and this does the job.  I actually like the smell very much, it&#x27;s not overpowering like the Mastermind and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The really annoying thing about some of the wax products is that they can be very difficult to wash out at the end of the day/night and are even difficult to get off your hands after application.  This stuff came almost completely out with just a rinse but the hold was still pretty good, better than the Garnier Surf Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Men with thick hair who want to have the &amp;#34;Don Draper&amp;#34; look?  This is for you.  I have battled my thick hair for over 10 years now.  I usually rocked a buzz but that&#x27;s just because I didn&#x27;t want to waste my time messing with my annoying hair.  After dozens of different products, I finally landed upon Aveda.  This keeps my thick hair in place and keeps it from getting out of control if it&#x27;s windy or humid.  It&#x27;s natural and smells pretty good too.  It would probably work even better in men with lighter hair that are going for the combed over look like I am.  But if you are struggling with thick hair and want to shape it the way you want then Aveda clay is the way to go.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - keeps my &amp;#34;cow-licks&amp;#34; under control all day!  Smells reasonably good, too.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of holding my hair where I want it even when it is getting a bit on the longer side.  It isn&#x27;t real goopy like some of the similar products and I&#x27;ve tried several.  Best is that it smells great.  My wife always tells my how great my hair smells.</li>
            <li> This product shapes my hair the best and is a GREAT alternative to gel or wax. The clay offers more control and leaves your hair looking natural and dry after use. I&#x27;m hooked on this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product, hold and ease of styling, but it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Very good.  Does the job it is expected to do.  Price could be much lower than what it is.  If Aveda does not learn, I would say room for competition to enter.. at least on this one product line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a post chemo woman and just recently started wearing my hair short. This product was recommended to me by my hairdresser and I love it. It smells great, fresh and my hair is shiny and stays in place. It&#x27;s not stick either and my hair doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s got tons of product. Men or women, this is a great hair product.</li>
            <li> Average product for this price . Nothing special about this product . It does the same purpose as other cheaper gels in the market . I would not recommend this product to anyone for this price .</li>
