            <li>Excellent product for keeping hair under control in humid and hot weather.  </li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>The item would be good if it was made with better material.  </li>
            <li>These were popular in the 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li>always looks nice all day and in all types of weather.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice but just doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I saw them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>I have the kind that clips together</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a nice change from a ponytail .</li>
            <li>Really liked the way it made a ponytail look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I really liked the design</li>
            <li>She was excited!!</li>
            <li>I love these, they are easy and very nice to use thank you.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Easy to put your hair up in a fancy no fuss way!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable too.  </li>
            <li>However these feel very cheap.</li>
            <li>The combs on the top are very secure, it holds your hair off your neck without having to be pulled into a pony tail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for more of these combs for years.  </li>
            <li>I have always love these.</li>
            <li>with this most of my hair is in the bottom and just anuff goes in the comb part .</li>
            <li>Better than banana clips for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>Love my Flex Clincher Comb.</li>
            <li>I love the color because it goes with anything and everything.</li>
            <li>Once I got this, I realized that it does not snap at the top.  </li>
            <li>I missed the fact that it does not snap at the top....</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this item.  </li>
            <li>This hair clip is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>i receive many compliments.</li>
            <li>Some might call it &amp;#34;Snoopydancing.&amp;#34; Others might liken it more to Seinfeld&#x27;s Elaine.</li>
            <li>I USE this item the most and did give&lt;br /&gt;one to a family member</li>
            <li>I have wore this type of comb for more than twenty years</li>
            <li>her Girlfrieds love this comb....</li>
            <li>i have another that i purchased many years ago that i still use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck getting the top part to stay together in my hair.</li>
            <li>I love these combs.</li>
            <li>After using it for two days I ordered three more.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Received on time and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love these combs and you can&#x27;t find them in any store.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>Will be looking for more of these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn these for years but haven&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores.  </li>
            <li>I cannot get the clip to stay shut at the top.</li>
            <li>Love it, but I don&#x27;t like that the price went up.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I use a clip at the top.</li>
            <li>I have one like this that I have been using for years and have always wanted more.</li>
            <li>Okay clincher, depending on style used for it does not always stay in place.</li>
            <li>tortious shell color is perfect for my red hair</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>I love the look it creates, it gives it a more flowy, longer look.  </li>
            <li>I get many compliments.  </li>
            <li>I love this comb.  </li>
            <li>and I bet you will love it.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>The&lt;br /&gt;old style was made of heavier, more piable plastic.  </li>
            <li>I think the item would sell more if costumers have an idea on how to put it on.</li>
            <li>but I get many compliments on this clip.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love these combs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found them at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I ordered these as a gift for a friend, who thought she was not going to be able to find them anymore.</li>
            <li>I have yet to figure out ow to use this thing, it does seem more durable than a lot of the plastic hair accessories.</li>
            <li>LOVE how my hair looks with this clip.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>Love the way this product works for your hair.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how cute they make my hair look...</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more just to be sure I always have one available!</li>
            <li>I used this clincher comb many years ago.</li>
            <li>There is no interlocking mechanism at the top to hold the clip.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find them in drugstores for years</li>
            <li>I would suggest this might work for a child with fine hair, or perhaps a woman who has very fine and scarce hair.  </li>
            <li>Good clip to keep my shoulder-length hair out of the way in hot humid weather.</li>
            <li>I loved it when it first arrived.</li>
            <li>I loved these when they first came out.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend love these, but they tend to easily break.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li>She love love loves them, she is very pleased with the product and time it was filled and sent in, at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I wish these were more readily available.</li>
            <li>The original clincher comb was a more flexible plastic and lasted almost 15 years.  </li>
            <li>I like them because they are easy to use your hair</li>
            <li>and it think they will probably break easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put in.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>They seem to be easy on my hair unlike rubber bands that cause breakage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great quality, strong combs and</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super easy to use, very comfortable, and they&#x27;re holding up well.</li>
            <li>Nice for fast pull ups and go!</li>
            <li>I would reccommend &amp; I would buy from this seller again if i see some more when i need them  great for med to long hair</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I have been looking for and received many compliments :-)</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>The combs are easy to use and fit together snugly but smoothly,</li>
            <li>It broke in 1/2 while putting it in my hair the very FIRST time!</li>
            <li>Be sure to pull it up high when closing the combs then poof up the gathered hair for a nice full look.</li>
            <li>Do a nice job of keeping my hair under control without much effort on my part.</li>
            <li>It holds my hair comfortably and securely.</li>
            <li>The comb seems to be made out of a stronger plastic and it securely stays locked together.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Works great to keep my hair back.</li>
            <li>Great for keeping hair back.</li>
            <li>This works great in holding my hair back.</li>
            <li>May be worth more stars as my hair gets longer.  </li>
            <li>but I use two bobby pins and and a rubber band to secure the combs with my hair.  </li>
            <li>so I looked to see if these combs were still available out there</li>
            <li>But, at the time this happened, I was so po&#x27;d about having to cut my hair to get it out and looked up the name of the company on the internet and called their toll free number.  </li>
            <li>and I could have done better at the dollar store not to mention that this item isn&#x27;t good enough to sell there...</li>
            <li>no less look good.  </li>
            <li>REALLY Vidal!!!</li>
            <li>I use to use these all the time when I was in high school which was about 20 years ago, I was glad to see it again because I use to love the way it made my hair look when it was up</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this item.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I received my package today and was so excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>This comb is great to put a loose pony tail type hair style in your hair.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length natural curly hair and this gives me a nice draped ponytail look -</li>
            <li>And I was cool with that.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly, even on my thick, course hair.  </li>
            <li>This peace will probably not work for a straight hair, but will be better on a wavy on curly hair.</li>
            <li>easy to use very good material do not break  become loose like other kinds which i tried before and it looks nice</li>
            <li>The Sassoon clincher comb is all right in a pinch when I secure it with a sweatband at the gym.</li>
            <li>first one broke quite easily</li>
            <li>they came, I did do some mild aerobic activity.</li>
            <li>and sure enough was able to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like much, but you can&#x27;t enjoy the results of this unique hair accessory until you try it.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, and extremely thin/balding on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>The accordian spring catches all the little shorter hairs, and the clip pronounces a full puff.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty nice!  </li>
            <li>..very cheaply made dont think its really by Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li>; so my hair can kind of cascade fall in back.  </li>
            <li>Wish they were like my older ones that didn&#x27;t break so easy though.</li>
            <li>After months of usage, (3 times a week, 3 months), you will notice the teeth at the bottom stretching out a bit, but for the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Or make an add-on purchase grippy socks so old broads like myself don&#x27;t almost take themselves out trying to make magic</li>
            <li>They work OK so far</li>
            <li>and that is why I have to buy them more frequently.  </li>
            <li>when i tried to use it for the first time it broke before i even had it full in my hair.</li>
            <li>Looks nice from the back and sides, clip works well also.</li>
            <li>Live in FL and love it for the hot days to keep the hair off the neck and scalp and not bound up in a ponytail.</li>
            <li>I thought the hooks at the top of each comb connected as with a hinged banana clip, but they are mainly for decoration, and have absolutely nothing to do with attaching this clincher or holding it in place.</li>
            <li>Or when my hair doesn&#x27;t turn out right.  </li>
            <li>Looks nice, but the stretch comb broke within the first five seconds starting to put it on.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the teeth break very easily</li>
            <li>The flex breaks apart easily, and the comb is so tight that is could very easily tear the hair.</li>
            <li>It is a good thing that I have fine hair because anybody with thick hair will have a problem.</li>
            <li>but they feel very flimsy, the teeth don&#x27;t fit together very well,</li>
            <li>It would work good for a young girl (younger than 10, I&#x27;d say)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this hair clip formany years and loved it, until my dog chewed it in half, thus ordering from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was too excited and was doing this in a towel rather than what normal people do, and say, oh, get dressed first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>searched high and low for these  not as good as the older ones....</li>
            <li>Unlike a rubber band or twist, this product lies flat enough to fit under many kinds of hats and visors and helmets comfortably.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair and they hold hair off back of neck and secure on top with the combs on ends.</li>
            <li>So glad I finally found them again.</li>
            <li>Glad I finally found it.</li>
            <li>This item seems ok but the length of the accordion teeth is very short</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how securely this hair accessory held my below-shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually better than the traditional 6-inch banana clip, as one can have shorter hair and this will still work to create an &#x27;up-do&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>So, buyer be aware....</li>
            <li>When I first got this hair clincher, I could not get it to stay in my hair</li>
            <li>the first go around</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s more likely than peeing on Charles Schulz&#x27; Peanuts (Peenuts?)</li>
            <li>My next one will be made of something more sturdy.</li>
            <li>The way this comb gathers my curls together in the back makes for a totally sophisticated style you can pull together in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>I had been searching foe a clip that had the stretchy bottom to pull hair back and was glad to find this one.</li>
            <li>Cheap flimsy plastic which is really unexpected of Vidal Sassoon product.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Two teeth broke off the first day my wife wore it.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t make a standard ponytail, more like a cascading one.  </li>
            <li>first time I ever purchased anything online</li>
            <li>and I really thought it would be useful.......</li>
            <li>indeed the first one did begin to lose teeth after a dozen or so uses.  </li>
            <li>i put my hair in a pony tail first then put thus in place</li>
            <li>I have tried many different styles of clips over the years.</li>
            <li>This is the only place I have been able to find them.</li>
            <li>The upper comb part is ok...</li>
            <li>looks good but not that easy for the thin hair to wear</li>
            <li>The hold is very secure, and since I have moderately curly (shoulder length) hair, the piece is almost completely invisible, yet it holds the hair in a very appealing cascading long ponytail.</li>
            <li>I love it, its a little tight but works great.</li>
            <li>These hair combs are incredibly difficult to find these days, so I was thrilled to find this on Amazon and at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thick, coarse and really wavy, lots of body and these work great!  </li>
            <li>In the \\&quot;questions\\&quot; section above the reviews, I wrote a detailed description of exactly how to use the clincher (dated May 10, 2014).  </li>
            <li>An easy way to put up your hair in a different way than a pony tail.  </li>
            <li>As a result, I wear human hair pieces for the top of my hair but the back of my hair is nice and thick; or for most people, would be considered \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>They are fairly sturdy and last a long time, considering the price.</li>
            <li>Might not work well with really long, thick hair, but for me is perfect.</li>
            <li>I purchased 5 of these this time at such a great price, even with shipping, less than 10 dollars.  </li>
            <li>nice and tight and durable.</li>
            <li>it is extra large ... just what I need !!!</li>
            <li>A great hair accessory to pull your hair back without the stark look of a ponytail.</li>
            <li>It is much easier on the health of my hair than using a ponytail method.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The flexible part at the bottom is very brittle.</li>
            <li>I really like these hair combs&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I really want to give no stars on this product.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it as fast way to fix your hair on the days you can&#x27;t do a thing with your hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t go straight to the landfill, but</li>
            <li>Now these newer ones seem to be much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I can adjust it to the very crown of my head, or the very bottom.</li>
            <li>I really do like it.  </li>
            <li>The stretchy part is very flimsy and it doesn&#x27;t interlock as advertised .....</li>
            <li>Very petty....comfortable...</li>
            <li>I have to much hair for this clip close.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This works very well in mine.  </li>
            <li>but I do not use it as much because of it</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Got it for my daughter and it didn&#x27;t really work for her hair.</li>
            <li>But let me tell you why I&#x27;m giving this 5 whole stars.</li>
            <li>I have about as much hair as a lion.</li>
            <li>I periodically get it thinned, and still feel like there&#x27;s too much volume.</li>
            <li>It is very flimsy and will not stay fastened.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>I brought this to try and do like a cute pin up style with my afro natural hair and my hair was too big for it</li>
            <li>Hair looks pretty and full in the back.</li>
            <li>I was&#x27;t really expecting much as it doesn&#x27;t really look like a high quality item anyway.</li>
            <li>Cute way to style hair and not the pulling like some other types I tried.  </li>
            <li>If you are tired of pony tails, this is a wonderful long hair holder.</li>
            <li>34;add-on&amp;#34; w/a $25 purchase of something else which is not hard for me at all!</li>
            <li>so it is really going to cinch the hair up high.  </li>
            <li>Instead of pulling all your hair away from your face, the open spring bottom gives you a special poofiness at the neck.  </li>
            <li>On the upside this looks really cute on and lets me keep my hair down without it being on my neck and making me sweat.</li>
            <li>less hair.&lt;br /&gt;Should have know better after seeing the picture.</li>
            <li>if this is what you looking for, then I suppose it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m of latin decent with curly hair and this DID NOT hold my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>When I try to use it, it sags looks considerably less cute than when it sits high on my head where it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t hold hair as tight as it could  but still love them</li>
            <li>, I guess my high school dreams are lost hehe.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard for me to find an interesting piece to hold my hair, since it is very fine, delicate and brakes easily.</li>
            <li>It looks little messy in a sexy way :-)</li>
            <li>After a few uses the flexible comb broke, so I surely can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>Have used these combs for years and love that they last a long time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use normal bands and combs, since I always have a chance to stay with no hair at all.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to say the least.  </li>
            <li>I have thick,  wavy shoulder length hair and this comb corrals it nicely.</li>
            <li>There are better products on the market if your goal is to create a loose pony tail or simply to get your hair up and off your neck.</li>
            <li>Holds hair more loosely than a traditional banana clip.</li>
            <li>If the bottom breaks just add a new one.  </li>
            <li>It was my &#x27;go to&#x27;  hair accessory for a quick loose bun or formal hair pull up.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re tired of the old scrunchie look, this is great for pulling back and lifting the hair off the neck.</li>
            <li>Even if I use lots of goop and spray, my hair slips out of most clips usually before I get out the door.</li>
            <li>The main combs hold only as much hair as can fit in them and which is required for the two combs to connect, and all the rest of the hair remains uplifted yet loose, and the hair shapes into a long attractive casual fall.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved the way this holds my long thick hair.  </li>
            <li>This little device is the greatest thing since sliced bread to control my long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>It actually makes the hair look longer by the nature of how it falls, because the &#x27;fall&#x27; starts at the top of the combs, but continues down to the bottom of the spring.</li>
            <li>Why wouldn&#x27;t they make those little hook things at the top actually hook together?</li>
            <li>I lost my old one and could not find any in stores.  </li>
            <li>I have natural 3b hair.  </li>
            <li>do was warn my FB friends and family that if they knew me in the early 90s, they never saw me without one of these in my head, and now, they&#x27;re baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!&lt;br</li>
            <li>the way, &amp;#34;Effing&amp;#34; as listed above wasn&#x27;t what I really said.</li>
            <li>The piece that joins the two combs is much stronger than products I find in my local drug store.</li>
            <li>When you tie your hair back using these combs, the look is really quite flattering.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to replace similar combs which work very well</li>
            <li>Sure, there are more expensive versions of this, but I was really curious if this was well made, and it is.</li>
            <li>The Clincher Comb stretched out of shape the first time I put it in.  </li>
            <li>It is very flattering and keeps the hair fluid.  </li>
            <li>It may be cheap but its still a waste of money.</li>
            <li>having the combs interlock in my hair doesn&#x27;t work for my hair type (african heritage, very coily, type 4a)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find them for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li>Thanks for bringing them back.</li>
            <li>i have really thick curly hair and love the look of the banana clip</li>
            <li>I am not good with fixing my hair (I have very fine hair).</li>
            <li>Both snapped right down the middle the first time I tried to put them in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be Krazy-Gluing the clip back together tomorrow and still have hope for the one still in the packaging, in the same way that women older than myself pray that liver spot cream really works.</li>
            <li>I have past shoulder length hair, somewhat fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I don&#x27;t know where this particular comb being sold on Amazon comes from; but if it is from the same place I got mine, buyer beware.</li>
            <li>I tried to secure it in every possible way but it slides down anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>I searched high and low in retail stores for this type of hair clincher but&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re no longer sold.  </li>
            <li>Hard to use and comes undone too easily.</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t look hard enough at the photo, but I thought this would latch at the top, and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If you have very long, very curly hair, this comb will work and it holds all my hair.</li>
            <li>This one is more difficult to clip together than the others and the teeth don&#x27;t really interlock well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, after the near collision of forehead and marble sinktop, I&#x27;m left with one clip still attached to the flex clincher, and the other clip which broke right off.</li>
            <li>They lift the hair off your neck, out of your face and give you an ultra cool look hanging down the back of your head.</li>
            <li>I do have fine hair which makes it hard to hold a comb or anything else in my hair</li>
            <li>have major hair issues to begin with.  </li>
            <li>I want to offer a rebuttal of the negative reviews for use on fine hair.  </li>
            <li>but it tends to open on it&#x27;s own and its hard to get it to stay closed.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t hold very well and stretches only to stay stretched.</li>
            <li>Except for this clip to really do the job, it has to be done on wet hair.</li>
            <li>In the early 2000&#x27;s I cut my hair very short</li>
            <li>You can adjust it to fit firmly, or a bit loose.  </li>
            <li>Hunted all over for these and the last store that  carried them shut down so ordered a few more.  </li>
            <li>and it held it the best out of all my hair clips, but it seems like they have made it a bit cheaper since then because it looks like after a few uses the plastic is turning white in the creases which means that it could break at some point showing weak spots, not sure when</li>
            <li>But this type of comb is not good for those with FINE HAIR.  </li>
            <li>Hubby likes it too and says it keeps me fresh and young-looking with very little time required.</li>
            <li>thought it was a great idea but disappointed with quality of product and its lack of functionality.</li>
            <li>In general I need a bigger comb.</li>
            <li>The Combs are actually for my Daughter and see lives in Australia, apparently see was using them when she lived here and</li>
            <li>the old style was to long for my head....</li>
            <li>I used these Clincher combs back in the early 90&#x27;s when my hair was long.  </li>
            <li>so I figure it would help that I don&#x27;t actually have a full head of hair, but I guess my hair is still to thick for this thing because it just does nothing to hold the hair in place at all.</li>
            <li>I have difficutly getting it to stay in my super thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>The main thing is that you need to push the teeth of each comb downward into your hair and THROUGH EACH OTHER as tightly as possible.</li>
            <li>Would reccomened to anyone who wants to put their hair up without putting it in a tight ponytail that causes a headache.</li>
            <li>which in turn caused a real \\&quot;choppy\\&quot; mess to the back of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While my current hair does help me stay above my legal height of 5&#x27;4 and a HALF</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine, thin hair and this works well</li>

            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> The item would be good if it was made with better material.  </li>
            <li> These were popular in the 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li> always looks nice all day and in all types of weather.</li>
            <li> Would have been nice but just doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I saw them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Nice.  </li>
            <li> I have the kind that clips together</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a nice change from a ponytail .</li>
            <li> Really liked the way it made a ponytail look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because I really liked the design</li>
            <li> She was excited!!</li>
            <li> I love these, they are easy and very nice to use thank you.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> Easy to put your hair up in a fancy no fuss way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable too.  </li>
            <li> However these feel very cheap.</li>
            <li> The combs on the top are very secure, it holds your hair off your neck without having to be pulled into a pony tail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for more of these combs for years.  </li>
            <li> I have always love these.</li>
            <li> with this most of my hair is in the bottom and just anuff goes in the comb part .</li>
            <li> Better than banana clips for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> Love my Flex Clincher Comb.</li>
            <li> I love the color because it goes with anything and everything.</li>
            <li> Once I got this, I realized that it does not snap at the top.  </li>
            <li> I missed the fact that it does not snap at the top....</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this item.  </li>
            <li> This hair clip is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> i receive many compliments.</li>
            <li> Some might call it &amp;#34;Snoopydancing.&amp;#34; Others might liken it more to Seinfeld&#x27;s Elaine.</li>
            <li> I USE this item the most and did give&lt;br /&gt;one to a family member</li>
            <li> I have wore this type of comb for more than twenty years</li>
            <li> her Girlfrieds love this comb....</li>
            <li> i have another that i purchased many years ago that i still use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck getting the top part to stay together in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love these combs.</li>
            <li> After using it for two days I ordered three more.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Received on time and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love these combs and you can&#x27;t find them in any store.</li>
            <li> ok.  </li>
            <li> Will be looking for more of these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn these for years but haven&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I cannot get the clip to stay shut at the top.</li>
            <li> Love it, but I don&#x27;t like that the price went up.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I use a clip at the top.</li>
            <li> I have one like this that I have been using for years and have always wanted more.</li>
            <li> Okay clincher, depending on style used for it does not always stay in place.</li>
            <li> tortious shell color is perfect for my red hair</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> I love the look it creates, it gives it a more flowy, longer look.  </li>
            <li> I get many compliments.  </li>
            <li> I love this comb.  </li>
            <li> and I bet you will love it.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> The&lt;br /&gt;old style was made of heavier, more piable plastic.  </li>
            <li> I think the item would sell more if costumers have an idea on how to put it on.</li>
            <li> but I get many compliments on this clip.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love these combs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found them at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a gift for a friend, who thought she was not going to be able to find them anymore.</li>
            <li> I have yet to figure out ow to use this thing, it does seem more durable than a lot of the plastic hair accessories.</li>
            <li> LOVE how my hair looks with this clip.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product works for your hair.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how cute they make my hair look...</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 more just to be sure I always have one available!</li>
            <li> I used this clincher comb many years ago.</li>
            <li> There is no interlocking mechanism at the top to hold the clip.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find them in drugstores for years</li>
            <li> I would suggest this might work for a child with fine hair, or perhaps a woman who has very fine and scarce hair.  </li>
            <li> Good clip to keep my shoulder-length hair out of the way in hot humid weather.</li>
            <li> I loved it when it first arrived.</li>
            <li> I loved these when they first came out.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend love these, but they tend to easily break.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> She love love loves them, she is very pleased with the product and time it was filled and sent in, at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I wish these were more readily available.</li>
            <li> The original clincher comb was a more flexible plastic and lasted almost 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I like them because they are easy to use your hair</li>
            <li> and it think they will probably break easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put in.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> They seem to be easy on my hair unlike rubber bands that cause breakage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great quality, strong combs and</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super easy to use, very comfortable, and they&#x27;re holding up well.</li>
            <li> Nice for fast pull ups and go!</li>
            <li> I would reccommend &amp; I would buy from this seller again if i see some more when i need them  great for med to long hair</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for and received many compliments :-)</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> The combs are easy to use and fit together snugly but smoothly,</li>
            <li> It broke in 1/2 while putting it in my hair the very FIRST time!</li>
            <li> Be sure to pull it up high when closing the combs then poof up the gathered hair for a nice full look.</li>
            <li> Do a nice job of keeping my hair under control without much effort on my part.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair comfortably and securely.</li>
            <li> The comb seems to be made out of a stronger plastic and it securely stays locked together.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep my hair back.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping hair back.</li>
            <li> This works great in holding my hair back.</li>
            <li> May be worth more stars as my hair gets longer.  </li>
            <li> but I use two bobby pins and and a rubber band to secure the combs with my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I looked to see if these combs were still available out there</li>
            <li> But, at the time this happened, I was so po&#x27;d about having to cut my hair to get it out and looked up the name of the company on the internet and called their toll free number.  </li>
            <li> and I could have done better at the dollar store not to mention that this item isn&#x27;t good enough to sell there...</li>
            <li> no less look good.  </li>
            <li> REALLY Vidal!!!</li>
            <li> I use to use these all the time when I was in high school which was about 20 years ago, I was glad to see it again because I use to love the way it made my hair look when it was up</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this item.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I received my package today and was so excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li> This comb is great to put a loose pony tail type hair style in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length natural curly hair and this gives me a nice draped ponytail look -</li>
            <li> And I was cool with that.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly, even on my thick, course hair.  </li>
            <li> This peace will probably not work for a straight hair, but will be better on a wavy on curly hair.</li>
            <li> easy to use very good material do not break  become loose like other kinds which i tried before and it looks nice</li>
            <li> The Sassoon clincher comb is all right in a pinch when I secure it with a sweatband at the gym.</li>
            <li> first one broke quite easily</li>
            <li> they came, I did do some mild aerobic activity.</li>
            <li> and sure enough was able to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like much, but you can&#x27;t enjoy the results of this unique hair accessory until you try it.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, and extremely thin/balding on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> The accordian spring catches all the little shorter hairs, and the clip pronounces a full puff.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty nice!  </li>
            <li> ..very cheaply made dont think its really by Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li> ; so my hair can kind of cascade fall in back.  </li>
            <li> Wish they were like my older ones that didn&#x27;t break so easy though.</li>
            <li> After months of usage, (3 times a week, 3 months), you will notice the teeth at the bottom stretching out a bit, but for the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Or make an add-on purchase grippy socks so old broads like myself don&#x27;t almost take themselves out trying to make magic</li>
            <li> They work OK so far</li>
            <li> and that is why I have to buy them more frequently.  </li>
            <li> when i tried to use it for the first time it broke before i even had it full in my hair.</li>
            <li> Looks nice from the back and sides, clip works well also.</li>
            <li> Live in FL and love it for the hot days to keep the hair off the neck and scalp and not bound up in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> I thought the hooks at the top of each comb connected as with a hinged banana clip, but they are mainly for decoration, and have absolutely nothing to do with attaching this clincher or holding it in place.</li>
            <li> Or when my hair doesn&#x27;t turn out right.  </li>
            <li> Looks nice, but the stretch comb broke within the first five seconds starting to put it on.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the teeth break very easily</li>
            <li> The flex breaks apart easily, and the comb is so tight that is could very easily tear the hair.</li>
            <li> It is a good thing that I have fine hair because anybody with thick hair will have a problem.</li>
            <li> but they feel very flimsy, the teeth don&#x27;t fit together very well,</li>
            <li> It would work good for a young girl (younger than 10, I&#x27;d say)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair clip formany years and loved it, until my dog chewed it in half, thus ordering from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was too excited and was doing this in a towel rather than what normal people do, and say, oh, get dressed first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> searched high and low for these  not as good as the older ones....</li>
            <li> Unlike a rubber band or twist, this product lies flat enough to fit under many kinds of hats and visors and helmets comfortably.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and they hold hair off back of neck and secure on top with the combs on ends.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally found them again.</li>
            <li> Glad I finally found it.</li>
            <li> This item seems ok but the length of the accordion teeth is very short</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how securely this hair accessory held my below-shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually better than the traditional 6-inch banana clip, as one can have shorter hair and this will still work to create an &#x27;up-do&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> So, buyer be aware....</li>
            <li> When I first got this hair clincher, I could not get it to stay in my hair</li>
            <li> the first go around</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s more likely than peeing on Charles Schulz&#x27; Peanuts (Peenuts?)</li>
            <li> My next one will be made of something more sturdy.</li>
            <li> The way this comb gathers my curls together in the back makes for a totally sophisticated style you can pull together in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I had been searching foe a clip that had the stretchy bottom to pull hair back and was glad to find this one.</li>
            <li> Cheap flimsy plastic which is really unexpected of Vidal Sassoon product.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Two teeth broke off the first day my wife wore it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make a standard ponytail, more like a cascading one.  </li>
            <li> first time I ever purchased anything online</li>
            <li> and I really thought it would be useful.......</li>
            <li> indeed the first one did begin to lose teeth after a dozen or so uses.  </li>
            <li> i put my hair in a pony tail first then put thus in place</li>
            <li> I have tried many different styles of clips over the years.</li>
            <li> This is the only place I have been able to find them.</li>
            <li> The upper comb part is ok...</li>
            <li> looks good but not that easy for the thin hair to wear</li>
            <li> The hold is very secure, and since I have moderately curly (shoulder length) hair, the piece is almost completely invisible, yet it holds the hair in a very appealing cascading long ponytail.</li>
            <li> I love it, its a little tight but works great.</li>
            <li> These hair combs are incredibly difficult to find these days, so I was thrilled to find this on Amazon and at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, coarse and really wavy, lots of body and these work great!  </li>
            <li> In the \\&quot;questions\\&quot; section above the reviews, I wrote a detailed description of exactly how to use the clincher (dated May 10, 2014).  </li>
            <li> An easy way to put up your hair in a different way than a pony tail.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I wear human hair pieces for the top of my hair but the back of my hair is nice and thick; or for most people, would be considered \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> They are fairly sturdy and last a long time, considering the price.</li>
            <li> Might not work well with really long, thick hair, but for me is perfect.</li>
            <li> I purchased 5 of these this time at such a great price, even with shipping, less than 10 dollars.  </li>
            <li> nice and tight and durable.</li>
            <li> it is extra large ... just what I need !!!</li>
            <li> A great hair accessory to pull your hair back without the stark look of a ponytail.</li>
            <li> It is much easier on the health of my hair than using a ponytail method.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The flexible part at the bottom is very brittle.</li>
            <li> I really like these hair combs&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I really want to give no stars on this product.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it as fast way to fix your hair on the days you can&#x27;t do a thing with your hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t go straight to the landfill, but</li>
            <li> Now these newer ones seem to be much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I can adjust it to the very crown of my head, or the very bottom.</li>
            <li> I really do like it.  </li>
            <li> The stretchy part is very flimsy and it doesn&#x27;t interlock as advertised .....</li>
            <li> Very petty....comfortable...</li>
            <li> I have to much hair for this clip close.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This works very well in mine.  </li>
            <li> but I do not use it as much because of it</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Got it for my daughter and it didn&#x27;t really work for her hair.</li>
            <li> But let me tell you why I&#x27;m giving this 5 whole stars.</li>
            <li> I have about as much hair as a lion.</li>
            <li> I periodically get it thinned, and still feel like there&#x27;s too much volume.</li>
            <li> It is very flimsy and will not stay fastened.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> I brought this to try and do like a cute pin up style with my afro natural hair and my hair was too big for it</li>
            <li> Hair looks pretty and full in the back.</li>
            <li> I was&#x27;t really expecting much as it doesn&#x27;t really look like a high quality item anyway.</li>
            <li> Cute way to style hair and not the pulling like some other types I tried.  </li>
            <li> If you are tired of pony tails, this is a wonderful long hair holder.</li>
            <li> 34;add-on&amp;#34; w/a $25 purchase of something else which is not hard for me at all!</li>
            <li> so it is really going to cinch the hair up high.  </li>
            <li> Instead of pulling all your hair away from your face, the open spring bottom gives you a special poofiness at the neck.  </li>
            <li> On the upside this looks really cute on and lets me keep my hair down without it being on my neck and making me sweat.</li>
            <li> less hair.&lt;br /&gt;Should have know better after seeing the picture.</li>
            <li> if this is what you looking for, then I suppose it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of latin decent with curly hair and this DID NOT hold my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> When I try to use it, it sags looks considerably less cute than when it sits high on my head where it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold hair as tight as it could  but still love them</li>
            <li> , I guess my high school dreams are lost hehe.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard for me to find an interesting piece to hold my hair, since it is very fine, delicate and brakes easily.</li>
            <li> It looks little messy in a sexy way :-)</li>
            <li> After a few uses the flexible comb broke, so I surely can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have used these combs for years and love that they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use normal bands and combs, since I always have a chance to stay with no hair at all.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I have thick,  wavy shoulder length hair and this comb corrals it nicely.</li>
            <li> There are better products on the market if your goal is to create a loose pony tail or simply to get your hair up and off your neck.</li>
            <li> Holds hair more loosely than a traditional banana clip.</li>
            <li> If the bottom breaks just add a new one.  </li>
            <li> It was my &#x27;go to&#x27;  hair accessory for a quick loose bun or formal hair pull up.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of the old scrunchie look, this is great for pulling back and lifting the hair off the neck.</li>
            <li> Even if I use lots of goop and spray, my hair slips out of most clips usually before I get out the door.</li>
            <li> The main combs hold only as much hair as can fit in them and which is required for the two combs to connect, and all the rest of the hair remains uplifted yet loose, and the hair shapes into a long attractive casual fall.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved the way this holds my long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This little device is the greatest thing since sliced bread to control my long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It actually makes the hair look longer by the nature of how it falls, because the &#x27;fall&#x27; starts at the top of the combs, but continues down to the bottom of the spring.</li>
            <li> Why wouldn&#x27;t they make those little hook things at the top actually hook together?</li>
            <li> I lost my old one and could not find any in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have natural 3b hair.  </li>
            <li> do was warn my FB friends and family that if they knew me in the early 90s, they never saw me without one of these in my head, and now, they&#x27;re baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!&lt;br</li>
            <li> the way, &amp;#34;Effing&amp;#34; as listed above wasn&#x27;t what I really said.</li>
            <li> The piece that joins the two combs is much stronger than products I find in my local drug store.</li>
            <li> When you tie your hair back using these combs, the look is really quite flattering.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace similar combs which work very well</li>
            <li> Sure, there are more expensive versions of this, but I was really curious if this was well made, and it is.</li>
            <li> The Clincher Comb stretched out of shape the first time I put it in.  </li>
            <li> It is very flattering and keeps the hair fluid.  </li>
            <li> It may be cheap but its still a waste of money.</li>
            <li> having the combs interlock in my hair doesn&#x27;t work for my hair type (african heritage, very coily, type 4a)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find them for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> Thanks for bringing them back.</li>
            <li> i have really thick curly hair and love the look of the banana clip</li>
            <li> I am not good with fixing my hair (I have very fine hair).</li>
            <li> Both snapped right down the middle the first time I tried to put them in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be Krazy-Gluing the clip back together tomorrow and still have hope for the one still in the packaging, in the same way that women older than myself pray that liver spot cream really works.</li>
            <li> I have past shoulder length hair, somewhat fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I don&#x27;t know where this particular comb being sold on Amazon comes from; but if it is from the same place I got mine, buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I tried to secure it in every possible way but it slides down anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> I searched high and low in retail stores for this type of hair clincher but&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re no longer sold.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use and comes undone too easily.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t look hard enough at the photo, but I thought this would latch at the top, and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If you have very long, very curly hair, this comb will work and it holds all my hair.</li>
            <li> This one is more difficult to clip together than the others and the teeth don&#x27;t really interlock well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, after the near collision of forehead and marble sinktop, I&#x27;m left with one clip still attached to the flex clincher, and the other clip which broke right off.</li>
            <li> They lift the hair off your neck, out of your face and give you an ultra cool look hanging down the back of your head.</li>
            <li> I do have fine hair which makes it hard to hold a comb or anything else in my hair</li>
            <li> have major hair issues to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I want to offer a rebuttal of the negative reviews for use on fine hair.  </li>
            <li> but it tends to open on it&#x27;s own and its hard to get it to stay closed.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t hold very well and stretches only to stay stretched.</li>
            <li> Except for this clip to really do the job, it has to be done on wet hair.</li>
            <li> In the early 2000&#x27;s I cut my hair very short</li>
            <li> You can adjust it to fit firmly, or a bit loose.  </li>
            <li> Hunted all over for these and the last store that  carried them shut down so ordered a few more.  </li>
            <li> and it held it the best out of all my hair clips, but it seems like they have made it a bit cheaper since then because it looks like after a few uses the plastic is turning white in the creases which means that it could break at some point showing weak spots, not sure when</li>
            <li> But this type of comb is not good for those with FINE HAIR.  </li>
            <li> Hubby likes it too and says it keeps me fresh and young-looking with very little time required.</li>
            <li> thought it was a great idea but disappointed with quality of product and its lack of functionality.</li>
            <li> In general I need a bigger comb.</li>
            <li> The Combs are actually for my Daughter and see lives in Australia, apparently see was using them when she lived here and</li>
            <li> the old style was to long for my head....</li>
            <li> I used these Clincher combs back in the early 90&#x27;s when my hair was long.  </li>
            <li> so I figure it would help that I don&#x27;t actually have a full head of hair, but I guess my hair is still to thick for this thing because it just does nothing to hold the hair in place at all.</li>
            <li> I have difficutly getting it to stay in my super thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> The main thing is that you need to push the teeth of each comb downward into your hair and THROUGH EACH OTHER as tightly as possible.</li>
            <li> Would reccomened to anyone who wants to put their hair up without putting it in a tight ponytail that causes a headache.</li>
            <li> which in turn caused a real \\&quot;choppy\\&quot; mess to the back of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While my current hair does help me stay above my legal height of 5&#x27;4 and a HALF</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine, thin hair and this works well</li>
            <li> Combs take a little bit to get used to on getting it closed at first.  </li>
            <li> This is important because I have heavy thick hair and the drugstore versions break or simply do not work to keep my hair under control during various kinds of exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I could hold my long hair in the flexible part and clip it shut, but it&#x27;s too big for the bulk of my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it as long as possible.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll say I totally Elained over the product and put it in dry</li>
            <li> It may be a little tight when you first use it</li>
            <li> This might work well for someone with fine hair but was completely useless for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is not very thick anymore, so I&#x27;ve had trouble finding combs that hold and clips that don&#x27;t pull.  </li>
            <li> seems a little flimsy, but has stayed together so far.  </li>
            <li> My only minus would be that I couldn&#x27;t order this separately but had to include as part of another order</li>
            <li> I have looked for this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It does not stay in place for long.</li>
            <li> 2 broke as soon as I stretched them to put in my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have medium - long hair FORGET IT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much larger than I expected as well.</li>
            <li> It stretched one inch and then snapped.</li>
            <li> I use these combs all summer long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn these for years with hair that is shorter but hits my neck and hair that is mid-length and now, hair that is long.</li>
            <li> but god knows how long that&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> this is prefect for that long hair faux hawk look.</li>
            <li> Would buy again, works well with long hair and curls</li>
            <li> This stretched out after 4-5 x use on long hair.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> and so I eliminated a lot of the styling tools that I used when my hair was long.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick very wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, not so much for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> but before you but a pony tail in... but half up half down with a hair tie doesn&#x27;t work and you can get the right look with bobby pins</li>
            <li> When I could get it in, it was a challenge to get my hair to lay down smoothly on the sides and was unappealing to look at.</li>
            <li> Even after stretching my hair in hopes that the clip will stay around my hair, it snapped in half from the back before I could even clip it properly.</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried to put this product in my hair it broke, so since I bought two, I tried the other one, and it also broke in the same place.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This gigantic clip can not only accommodate all of my hair, but has a shockingly firm hold, with bunches of hair randomly mixed into the comb.</li>
            <li> Not for my Very thick Very curly hair!</li>
            <li> The problem is that it&#x27;s made of rigid plastic and the teeth fall out after a limited amount of wear.  </li>
            <li> so that if I loose one (or give one away)</li>
            <li> There was only one color choice,  I would have preferred black.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair and in the summer time I like to were it up but not tight</li>
            <li> Very disappointed - bought two thinking it would work great.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair back yet is not too tight.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and these combs hold it very well.</li>
            <li> and I spent about 2 hours searching the internet for another.  </li>
            <li> IT HOLDS MY HEAVY HEAD OF HAIR WITH OUT SLIDDING OPEN.</li>
            <li> They used to be... but they are harder to find for some reason.  </li>
            <li> And the bitter taste of disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready for THAT yet, but when I am, I&#x27;ll look for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and it stay closed.</li>
            <li> no real clasp to lock in place.  </li>
            <li> Edges of comb is rough and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; when clinched together.</li>
            <li> It does not clamp nor does it stay closed</li>
            <li> Item arrived exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> and I literally spent hours on the internet trying to find them again.  </li>
            <li> so It doesn&#x27;t get wet.</li>
            <li> I finally found this on Amazon after breaking mine and really missing it.  </li>
            <li> With the new version, this is the third one that the teeth have broken after just a few uses as they are so brittle.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy these years ago in different colors for my long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you have thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> Pushing the combs through each other is what holds the clincher in place.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t pull my hair or give me a headache like some other clips I have used before.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t bother to use the other.</li>
            <li> So when this happened, I was extremely upset and called the company...</li>
            <li> This is the only way to pull back thick curly hair!!  </li>
            <li> : After having it in my drawer for 6 months I tried to put it on - it snapped in half before I even clasped the pieces together.</li>
            <li> (yes, that HALF counts) and</li>
            <li> Too small - I have one similar to this and was hoping for another, but I can&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s too small for all my hair.  </li>
            <li> My previous one was quite longer than the one I just ordered thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I bought two combs, this one and a black one from another manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> My hair is too long and thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several beak/banana-style clips to deviate from the everyday hair tie--the beaks leave some hair out, defeating their purpose, and the banana clips have been too loose and broken after a few (1-5) uses.</li>
            <li> This clip has the flexibility needed to allow me to put my hair up and not be so tight.  </li>
            <li> It will hold you hair, if used correctly, but will not hold it too tight.</li>
            <li> and sometimes they can be a bit tight for my liking.  </li>
            <li> It holds your hair without being too tight.</li>
            <li> I like a little &amp;#34;play&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally this negative about things</li>
            <li> , I did throw a little Moroccan oil up in there along with some</li>
            <li> Wish they were made a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of them since they are very hard to find in my local stores.</li>
            <li> I wore this to work and got compliments on my hair style, my only issue is I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> This was the only hair clip that I could use in my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> A waste of money and plastic production.</li>
            <li> should I, say, go missing, I&#x27;m not looking for this product to make me look like your choice of The Clash&#x27;s video.</li>
            <li> Its not comfortable either.</li>
            <li> because it shows off the curliness that comes with heavy humidity.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Wasted my money on this purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually think it speaks to the inferiority of the product but rather is probably my fumbling with it behind my head.</li>
            <li> I tried to see if I can rig it together, but it was still an epic fail.</li>
            <li> buy a few at a time, and remember not to pull on the stretchy bottom part.</li>
            <li> Now not excited all all pretty upset that the quality was so bad.</li>
            <li> Did not work well in my very thick long hair.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worthless for think, afro American, natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be a little too thick for it</li>
            <li> Wore these clips for aprox 20 years and when my final one broke was unable to locate.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, don&#x27;t even waste your time with this.</li>
            <li> The Comb is small, and cannot hold my hair.</li>
            <li> However I am NOT pleased with Vidal Sassoon and no instructions.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately these were the only ones I could find.</li>
            <li> The clamp was too small and it did not clip together.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what they were called, but after a bit of research, I found them on Amazon - and ordered a few!</li>
            <li> (:/</li>
            <li> i have had this clincher comb in the past but could not find anywhere so as usual</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Plastic is flimsy, not sure if this will prevent it from breaking or break easier.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because I have a lot of hair, but this did nothing for me</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> for the past 8 years I&#x27;ve been growing my hair again</li>
            <li> but this.. the bottom part of the comb from head tipping and twisting turns your hair into a knotted mess!!</li>
            <li> Too small for wavy thick hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get it all in the clip.</li>
            <li> Hard item to find, so</li>
            <li> Once I learned the &amp;#34;new name&amp;#34; for them, there were still hard to locate.  </li>
            <li> Hard to keep clasped.</li>
            <li> so I can just have them since they are hard to find.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find.</li>
            <li> Difficult to close and if you get it closed</li>
            <li> I have had a couple teeth break off, but considering how difficult they are to find, I&#x27;m not really complaining.  </li>
            <li> It also loses it shape.</li>
            <li> I have thick, afro-textured hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy.</li>

            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Old not make them close or clamp onto my hair...very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had the WORST time getting the damn thing out of my hair and ended up cussing a blue streak, which made my dogs run behind furniture as they know when mama starts cussing, she is majorly PO&#x27;d.  </li>
            <li> The bad news is the teeth started breaking almost immediately and within two weeks three were missing from one side and two from the other.</li>
            <li> Too bad it split into 2 the second time I wore it.</li>
            <li> Not fair.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have thin or thick hair.</li>
            <li> but i can&#x27;t review this for a person with thick or thin hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot stand dealing with rude companies; especially when it is the CONSUMER that keeps these idiots in business.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I was using it wrong or</li>
            <li> and they are very hard to find these days.  </li>
            <li> The staff person I spoke with was not helpful; and very rude and hinted that maybe I \\&quot;didn&#x27;t know how to use their product\\&quot;.  </li>

            <li> For $2.99 and a quality product, how can you go wrong?</li>

            <li> May work on thick hair but for my thin hair it is worthless.</li>
            <li> Useless now.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you have very long, very curly hair, this comb will work and it holds all my hair.</li>
            <li> The item would be good if it was made with better material.  Couple of teeth have broken already but it is still functional.</li>
            <li> This is the only way to pull back thick curly hair!!  Nothing else works.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! It is much easier on the health of my hair than using a ponytail method. It also makes a beautiful hairstyle for my curly hair. Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> These were popular in the 80&#x27;s but you can&#x27;t find them these days.  The one I&#x27;d had for years broke and I spent about 2 hours searching the internet for another.  This is the only one I could find.  I have very fine hair but this works on my without falling out.  My only minus would be that I couldn&#x27;t order this separately but had to include as part of another order</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago and somehow it just went by the wayside and when I saw it again I just&lt;br /&gt;had to get it.  I have always loved the way this holds my long thick hair.  Looks great every time.</li>
            <li> I cannot get this comb to stay in my hair.  There were no directions on how to put in your hair.  The two hooks are not deep enough to catch.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for more of these combs for years.  I lost my old one and could not find any in stores.  I have natural curly hair and they hold hair off back of neck and secure on top with the combs on ends. I purchased 5 of these this time at such a great price, even with shipping, less than 10 dollars.  Cute way to style hair and not the pulling like some other types I tried.  So glad I finally found them again.</li>
            <li> Wore these clips for aprox 20 years and when my final one broke was unable to locate.  So happy that I found them as an add on to  my order one day.  Great for work and also at beach or pool.  My hair is thick, coarse and really wavy, lots of body and these work great!  Great price too.  I ordered several so to have spares on hand.</li>
            <li> Difficult to close and if you get it closed it doesn&#x27;t stay closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;99c Store Quality Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a great idea but disappointed with quality of product and its lack of functionality.</li>
            <li> I have always love these.</li>
            <li> A great hair accessory to pull your hair back without the stark look of a ponytail.</li>
            <li> it is extra large ... just what I need !!!</li>
            <li> got this for my wife. She loves it</li>
            <li> This works great.  I have looked for this for a long time.  Glad I finally found it.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE no stregnth to them and they break while in your hair!!</li>
            <li> This item seems ok but the length of the accordion teeth is very short so it is really going to cinch the hair up high.  I like a little &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; so my hair can kind of cascade fall in back.  Looks well made, just not what I was looking for.  Will keep it &amp; try to stretch it.</li>
            <li> Fell apart instantly. Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> It does not stay in place for long. I tried to secure it in every possible way but it slides down anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Update: After having it in my drawer for 6 months I tried to put it on - it snapped in half before I even clasped the pieces together.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS. IT HOLDS MY HEAVY HEAD OF HAIR WITH OUT SLIDDING OPEN. GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I brought this to try and do like a cute pin up style with my afro natural hair and my hair was too big for it</li>
            <li> i have really thick curly hair and love the look of the banana clip but thay always pull apart because of how this my hair is . with this most of my hair is in the bottom and just anuff goes in the comb part . once it is locked in place good it stayed all night . the key is to make shere the teeth are together all the way to the end were the teeth come out at .</li>
            <li> This little device is the greatest thing since sliced bread to control my long, thick hair.  Better than banana clips for me.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how securely this hair accessory held my below-shoulder length hair.  It&#x27;s very comfortable too.  My hair is not very thick anymore, so I&#x27;ve had trouble finding combs that hold and clips that don&#x27;t pull.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not for my Very thick Very curly hair!</li>
            <li> It is much smaller than the one I had years ago, but does serve the purpose.  There was only one color choice,  I would have preferred black.</li>
            <li> Do a nice job of keeping my hair under control without much effort on my part. I bought 3 of them since they are very hard to find in my local stores.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like much, but you can&#x27;t enjoy the results of this unique hair accessory until you try it.  The spring-like connection between the two combs do not show once it is tucked under the hair. The main combs hold only as much hair as can fit in them and which is required for the two combs to connect, and all the rest of the hair remains uplifted yet loose, and the hair shapes into a long attractive casual fall.  It actually makes the hair look longer by the nature of how it falls, because the &#x27;fall&#x27; starts at the top of the combs, but continues down to the bottom of the spring. It&#x27;s actually better than the traditional 6-inch banana clip, as one can have shorter hair and this will still work to create an &#x27;up-do&#x27;.  I wish these were more readily available. They used to be... but they are harder to find for some reason.  Two thumbs up from me ... I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine who can use this comb. If you have any moisture/grease/product in your hair, it won&#x27;t hold. The teeth are supposed to hold together with just friction, which isn&#x27;t enough. Why wouldn&#x27;t they make those little hook things at the top actually hook together? What a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Love my Flex Clincher Comb. It holds my hair comfortably and securely. I love the color because it goes with anything and everything. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> The accordian spring catches all the little shorter hairs, and the clip pronounces a full puff.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty nice!  I like it.</li>
            <li> So very disappointed with this product. I have thick, afro-textured hair. Even after stretching my hair in hopes that the clip will stay around my hair, it snapped in half from the back before I could even clip it properly. If you have thick hair, don&#x27;t even waste your time with this.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 of these combs. 2 broke as soon as I stretched them to put in my hair. The flexible part at the bottom is very brittle. If you have medium - long hair FORGET IT.</li>
            <li> It does the job but it tends to open on it&#x27;s own and its hard to get it to stay closed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally this negative about things but i was very disappointed with this clinch comb. I would give it zero stars if i could. A waste of money and plastic production. Dont bother yourself with this product. I warned you.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t look hard enough at the photo, but I thought this would latch at the top, and it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s much larger than I expected as well. Maybe someday I&#x27;ll pay a stylist to show me how I&#x27;m supposed to wear it to actually keep it in my hair, because it just fell out. Stretchy part of the comb feels quite flimsy.</li>
            <li> REALLY Vidal!!! You need to look at the products from France Luxe and get a clue! Your product needs space between the fingers to get this thing to lock in place and that not even trying to get it to lock in place on my head with hair in it. This product is not at all what I would expect from Vidal Sassoon and I could have done better at the dollar store not to mention that this item isn&#x27;t good enough to sell there...</li>
            <li> Hunted all over for these and the last store that  carried them shut down so ordered a few more.  Wish they were like my older ones that didn&#x27;t break so easy though.</li>
            <li> Does not hold, no matter how you apply it. After a few uses the flexible comb broke, so I surely can&#x27;t recommend it. Great concept, not the reality.</li>
            <li> I really like these hair combs&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work on my hair...I was&#x27;t really expecting much as it doesn&#x27;t really look like a high quality item anyway.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of the old scrunchie look, this is great for pulling back and lifting the hair off the neck. Live in FL and love it for the hot days to keep the hair off the neck and scalp and not bound up in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> The Sassoon clincher comb is all right in a pinch when I secure it with a sweatband at the gym.</li>
            <li> My mistake...I have natural 3b hair.  I was hoping to replace my banana clip that seems to snap when I use it.  Once I got this, I realized that it does not snap at the top.  There is nothing to hold it together but your hair.  I was looking for something to hold the hair up into the banana clip look.  So, buyer be aware....I missed the fact that it does not snap at the top....kinda leaves my hair just hanging there...if this is what you looking for, then I suppose it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li> I have really thick curly hair. This clip just doesn&#x27;t attach or hold the hair in any way whatsoever. My hair is already cut into a mohawk style so I figure it would help that I don&#x27;t actually have a full head of hair, but I guess my hair is still to thick for this thing because it just does nothing to hold the hair in place at all. I wish it had the littler clamp that holds onto itself, then it would have been perfect. Oh, well.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, but the stretch comb broke within the first five seconds starting to put it on. It stretched one inch and then snapped.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull all hair evenly.</li>
            <li> I like wearing this, because it allows hair to &amp;#34;cascade&amp;#34; into a pony tail. It doesn&#x27;t slip out and you can always tighten, instantly, if necessary. After months of usage, (3 times a week, 3 months), you will notice the teeth at the bottom stretching out a bit, but for the price it&#x27;s worth it. You cannot find it in stores anymore. My hair is thick and wavy. I don&#x27;t think it will hold as well for thinner hair, though.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick. The Comb is small, and cannot hold my hair. In general I need a bigger comb.</li>
            <li> When I first got this hair clincher, I could not get it to stay in my hair no matter what I did. I tried it every which way, and also read the answers to the questions and the reviews here, which didn&#x27;t help me at all.  I finally asked a friend (who had recommended it to me) to show me how to put it in, and it is very simple. In the \\&quot;questions\\&quot; section above the reviews, I wrote a detailed description of exactly how to use the clincher (dated May 10, 2014).  The main thing is that you need to push the teeth of each comb downward into your hair and THROUGH EACH OTHER as tightly as possible. Pushing the combs through each other is what holds the clincher in place. I thought the hooks at the top of each comb connected as with a hinged banana clip, but they are mainly for decoration, and have absolutely nothing to do with attaching this clincher or holding it in place.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this item.  However no instructions were supplied.  I have tried several different ways and the clincher combs will not stay put.  I am constantly reattaching the hair comb.  Update 6/7/14 - even though I was not happy the first go around I came back to see if anyone had figured out how to use it.  I found an answer from Amazon Fan (May 10, 14) that gave a wonderful description of how to lace it on your head and hair.  I read it twice and it WORKED the second time I tried it.  Going to increase the rating because it works.  However I am NOT pleased with Vidal Sassoon and no instructions.  Bad Bad Bad</li>
            <li> This hair clip is my favorite.  The comb seems to be made out of a stronger plastic and it securely stays locked together. I have shoulder length natural curly hair and this gives me a nice draped ponytail look - i receive many compliments.</li>
            <li> I wish I had never bought this product. It does not hold hair. The clasp does not work properly. When you visualize how you think it should work and you try it, the actually functionality is lacking. I bought two. What a rip off. There are better products on the market if your goal is to create a loose pony tail or simply to get your hair up and off your neck. Definitely worthless for think, afro American, natural hair.</li>
            <li> I was SO overjoyed when I saw these listed on Amazon. When I say overjoyed, don&#x27;t think I did, like, backflips or anything. I&#x27;m 43, for Your Choice of Deity&#x27;s Sake. But what I ~did~ do was warn my FB friends and family that if they knew me in the early 90s, they never saw me without one of these in my head, and now, they&#x27;re baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were shipped at warp speed. We&#x27;re talking no sooner did I click on the cart, that Captain James T. Kirk himself must have launched them out of the Amazon Warehouse and out the door. Kudos on that, Good Seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they came, I did do some mild aerobic activity. Some might call it &amp;#34;Snoopydancing.&amp;#34; Others might liken it more to Seinfeld&#x27;s Elaine. Yes, that&#x27;s more likely than peeing on Charles Schulz&#x27; Peanuts (Peenuts?) legacy. We&#x27;ll say I totally Elained over the product and put it in dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a moment, I was like, &amp;#34;Ow.&amp;#34; Then I remembered that you have to work the Flexy thing in. Look. I no longer have 6-feet tall hair. It&#x27;s not the 80s anymore. I don&#x27;t have 20 lbs. of product in it either. While my current hair does help me stay above my legal height of 5&#x27;4 and a HALF (yes, that HALF counts) and the DMV and local law enforcement might guess me at 5&#x27;6 should I, say, go missing, I&#x27;m not looking for this product to make me look like your choice of The Clash&#x27;s video. I don&#x27;t need a Mohawk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it held. And I was cool with that. Except for this clip to really do the job, it has to be done on wet hair. Now, I won&#x27;t lie to you. I already told you that my hair is no longer bigger than Texas (Yes, Texas, I could&#x27;ve done battle with you any day in my prime), and that I don&#x27;t go all cray-zeh with product, I did throw a little Moroccan oil up in there along with some glaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, it happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;DUDE, ARE YOU EFFING SERIOUS?&amp;#34; echoed through the house. Yes, that was me. Yes, I scared my dog. I have 18 lbs. of angsty miniature Schnauzer who thought that I was being attacked..by a hair clip. I&#x27;ll spare you the details of almost cracking my head open on the bathroom vanity when I did the Flip-Down-At-The-Waist-And-Put-The-Clip-In-And-Conjoin-The-Sides, because that was so totally my fault. I was too excited and was doing this in a towel rather than what normal people do, and say, oh, get dressed first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, &amp;#34;Effing&amp;#34; as listed above wasn&#x27;t what I really said. Use your imagination. But kids might read this and I don&#x27;t want to offend anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after the near collision of forehead and marble sinktop, I&#x27;m left with one clip still attached to the flex clincher, and the other clip which broke right off. And the bitter taste of disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, I&#x27;m not what I was in the 90s but neither&#x27;s the clip. PLEASE make them the way Goody did. Or make an add-on purchase grippy socks so old broads like myself don&#x27;t almost take themselves out trying to make magic happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be Krazy-Gluing the clip back together tomorrow and still have hope for the one still in the packaging, in the same way that women older than myself pray that liver spot cream really works. I&#x27;m not ready for THAT yet, but when I am, I&#x27;ll look for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have used these combs for years and love that they last a long time. My hair is very thick and these combs hold it very well.</li>
            <li> I use these combs all summer long. They are fairly sturdy and last a long time, considering the price. The piece that joins the two combs is much stronger than products I find in my local drug store. This is important because I have heavy thick hair and the drugstore versions break or simply do not work to keep my hair under control during various kinds of exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn these for years with hair that is shorter but hits my neck and hair that is mid-length and now, hair that is long. It does the trick. It works for golf, for swimming and even on my bicycle under a bike helmet. Unlike a rubber band or twist, this product lies flat enough to fit under many kinds of hats and visors and helmets comfortably. They work for me while I am on my elliptical too, letting me exercise but keeping my long hair from annoying me while I am doing it. Every now and again, the combs unhook while I am in mid-swing (golf) but in two seconds I can re&amp;#34;tie&amp;#34; my hair and keep it off my face and neck while I play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are advertised for children; however, I have been using these for 30 years and am now in my sixties. When you tie your hair back using these combs, the look is really quite flattering. Too bad they don&#x27;t make a version for evening wear!</li>
            <li> I really want to give no stars on this product.  Still can&#x27;t figure out how to use it.  It did not come with instruction at all.  I&#x27;ve attempted to use it on my hair, but it won&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always tried to get the look where you pull your hair up but before you but a pony tail in... but half up half down with a hair tie doesn&#x27;t work and you can get the right look with bobby pins but god knows how long that&#x27;ll stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so this is prefect for that long hair faux hawk look. nice and tight and durable.</li>
            <li> Yeah, not so much for thick hair.  Tried, then it gets caught up and tangled.  Then you get it, and it won&#x27;t clip. AAArgh.</li>
            <li> Holds hair more loosely than a traditional banana clip.</li>
            <li> I love these, they are easy and very nice to use thank you. I USE this item the most and did give&lt;br /&gt;one to a family member and she uses it too often. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I gave this five stars because this is a great comb. I have wore this type of comb for more than twenty years and I have them in all colors. I always get a compliment on my hair. I like them because they are easy to use your hair always looks nice all day and in all types of weather. I recommend it as fast way to fix your hair on the days you can&#x27;t do a thing with your hair.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for more of these for years &amp; was so happy when I found them here. thank you</li>
            <li> Product great I have been searching for 2 years to find one like this i would have liked it a bit longer but perfect for when my hair is a bit longer thank you for your great service</li>
            <li> very poorly made...ordered 2 both broke with 2 wears</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of latin decent with curly hair and this DID NOT hold my hair at all.  Very disappointed in it.  I do not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> The Combs are actually for my Daughter and see lives in Australia, apparently see was using them when she lived here and&lt;br /&gt;they are the only one&#x27;s that she likes so every time she needs some, she emails me and i purchase them and send them to Australia,&lt;br /&gt;All her Girlfrieds love this comb....</li>
            <li> I really like this. Great, I like what I received great product for me. I have no complaints on this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace similar combs which work very well keeping my medium-length hair off the back of my neck. However these feel very cheap. They work OK so far but they feel very flimsy, the teeth don&#x27;t fit together very well, and it think they will probably break easily. Unfortunately these were the only ones I could find.</li>
            <li> I keep buying these combs because it holds my hair back the way I like it.  The only problem is that the teeth break very easily and that is why I have to buy them more frequently.  It is a good thing that I have fine hair because anybody with thick hair will have a problem. Wish they were made a little stronger.</li>
            <li> this is of very poor quality. when i tried to use it for the first time it broke before i even had it full in my hair. very disappointed. i have another that i purchased many years ago that i still use. it must have been made by a different company. this one i would NEVER purchase again!!!!</li>
            <li> The clamp was too small and it did not clip together. the plastic was to flimsy</li>
            <li> These do not work...do not purchase.  They do not close at all.  I have thick hair and. Old not make them close or clamp onto my hair...very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I sooo wanted to like this.  For my work I need my hair pulled back but this is not it. I do have fine hair which makes it hard to hold a comb or anything else in my hair but this.. the bottom part of the comb from head tipping and twisting turns your hair into a knotted mess!! TONS of hair conditioning and coconut oil later, I worked out the comb and the knots. Its not comfortable either. NOT FOR FINE HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> For $2.99 and a quality product, how can you go wrong? I had to try this. Sure, there are more expensive versions of this, but I was really curious if this was well made, and it is. The combs are easy to use and fit together snugly but smoothly, no jagged edges and it&#x27;s comfortable to wear. I can tell that this will last a while if taken care of.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck getting the top part to stay together in my hair. I have really thick hair, so that may be the problem.</li>
            <li> I love these combs. I bought one on a whim after a visit to the stylist rendered my hair a bit too short to put in a ponytail. After using it for two days I ordered three more. I&#x27;ve recently started wearing them at work and have gotten tons of compliments from lady coworkers. They&#x27;re super easy to use, very comfortable, and they&#x27;re holding up well. A million times better than the ol&#x27; banana clip!</li>
            <li> On the upside this looks really cute on and lets me keep my hair down without it being on my neck and making me sweat. The bad news is the teeth started breaking almost immediately and within two weeks three were missing from one side and two from the other. My next one will be made of something more sturdy.</li>
            <li> I thought I could hold my long hair in the flexible part and clip it shut, but it&#x27;s too big for the bulk of my hair and I have to fasten the clip part above it and that just looks silly because it&#x27;s almost to the top of my head. Oh well.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly on my hair. The hold is very secure, and since I have moderately curly (shoulder length) hair, the piece is almost completely invisible, yet it holds the hair in a very appealing cascading long ponytail.</li>
            <li> Too small - I have one similar to this and was hoping for another, but I can&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s too small for all my hair.  It would work good for a young girl (younger than 10, I&#x27;d say)</li>
            <li> I have looked all over for another one of these for 30 years. The one I have has worked for a bad hair day&#x27;s almost all my life!</li>
            <li> awful.  useless. in the trash already</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just what I was looking for. Couldn&#x27;t find these when I looked in several local stores, so decided to hunt for them on Amazon. Didn&#x27;t know what they were called, but after a bit of research, I found them on Amazon - and ordered a few! They help to keep my cooler in the summer time!</li>
            <li> This accessory was just not for my hair type.  I have thick, curly hair that this comb just could not manage.  The comb portion of this accessory has interlocking teeth (there&#x27;s nothing else holding the two sides together).  This might work well for someone with fine hair but was completely useless for me.</li>
            <li> The tooth of this comb doesn&#x27;t clinch. Would have been nice but just doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> IT doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, and I have no idea how to use it in my hair and it stay closed.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep my hair back. I use it all the time and carry it with me when we travel. It makes it easier to put my hair up instead of worrying about styling it every day.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for awhile in stores, they don&#x27;t sell them anymore. I had one from years ago and loved it. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Received on time and I love it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love these combs and you can&#x27;t find them in any store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; s ok.  I have difficutly getting it to stay in my super thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I wish I had ordered several of these instead of the banana cips that I ordered.  Will be looking for more of these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn these for years but haven&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores.  I was thrilled when I saw them on Amazon.  The combs on the top are very secure, it holds your hair off your neck without having to be pulled into a pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality, strong combs and it doesn&#x27;t stretch out of shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy to have found these and you will love them!</li>
            <li> Nice.  I have thick,  wavy shoulder length hair and this comb corrals it nicely.</li>
            <li> Horrable. Does not work. Sorry. :(  (:/</li>
            <li> I have longer than shoulder length curly hair. As a curly girl I have layers cut into my hair so I won&#x27;t look like a head triangle. This works well for my type of hair. The way this comb gathers my curls together in the back makes for a totally sophisticated style you can pull together in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> i have had this clincher comb in the past but could not find anywhere so as usual i go to Amazon and there it is! this works great for my hair. i don&#x27;t have thin or thick hair. its perfect for me but i can&#x27;t review this for a person with thick or thin hair. i ordered several bc  this is an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; w/a $25 purchase of something else which is not hard for me at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair clip formany years and loved it, until my dog chewed it in half, thus ordering from Amazon.  It was my &#x27;go to&#x27;  hair accessory for a quick loose bun or formal hair pull up.  My previous one was quite longer than the one I just ordered thru Amazon.  The one I have now will not stay in place, and my hair keeps sliding out on the sides.  I still like to use it though, but have to make do w bobby pins.</li>
            <li> It didnt last a week.</li>
            <li> This is useless for me.  I couldn&#x27;t even get it to stay in my hair, no less look good.  I would suggest this might work for a child with fine hair, or perhaps a woman who has very fine and scarce hair.  I put it in the donations bag so it doesn&#x27;t go straight to the landfill, but my guess is it will end up there.</li>
            <li> Too weak to hold hair at all, sorry.</li>
            <li> I cannot get the clip to stay shut at the top. I had been searching foe a clip that had the stretchy bottom to pull hair back and was glad to find this one. Would be great if I could get the top to close.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold thin hair well</li>
            <li> There are no instructions on how to use this item.</li>
            <li> Love it, but I don&#x27;t like that the price went up.</li>
            <li> These hair combs are incredibly difficult to find these days, so I was thrilled to find this on Amazon and at such a great price.  It works perfectly, even on my thick, course hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> How the heck does this thing work?  no real clasp to lock in place.  May work on thick hair but for my thin hair it is worthless.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these years ago in different colors for my long, thick hair.  They were wonderful.  Now these newer ones seem to be much cheaper.  The flex breaks apart easily, and the comb is so tight that is could very easily tear the hair.</li>
            <li> The Clincher Comb stretched out of shape the first time I put it in.  Then the end broke off and so it would not stay in my hair.  It seems to be made poorly.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> If you like the 80s look, this retro \\&quot;banana clip\\&quot; will work for you.  Instead of pulling all your hair away from your face, the open spring bottom gives you a special poofiness at the neck.  It is very flattering and keeps the hair fluid.  I call it my \\&quot;Florida hair\\&quot; because it shows off the curliness that comes with heavy humidity.  Hubby likes it too and says it keeps me fresh and young-looking with very little time required.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this item. I have very thick, curly hair and it is impossible to find a banana clip or hair accessory big enough to hold my hair.  This clip has the flexibility needed to allow me to put my hair up and not be so tight.  I haven&#x27;t received my shipment yet, but I ordered 15 so that I&#x27;ll have an ample supply.  I can&#x27;t wait to receive my shipment!</li>
            <li> Love this!  I have been looking for it for a very long time. It may be a little tight when you first use it but it will loosen up.  I ordered 5!</li>
            <li> great product 4 ur hair i love it I would reccommend &amp; I would buy from this seller again if i see some more when i need them  great for med to long hair</li>
            <li> I have loved these for  years. The stores don&#x27;t  carry them. I ordered several because they can break with thicker hair. I use a clip at the top. The only improvement this could use is a longer flexible part.</li>
            <li> Love these! Bought a six pack and shared with friends &amp; family! They love them too! Easy to put your hair up in a fancy no fuss way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard for me to find an interesting piece to hold my hair, since it is very fine, delicate and brakes easily. I can&#x27;t use normal bands and combs, since I always have a chance to stay with no hair at all. This peace will probably not work for a straight hair, but will be better on a wavy on curly hair. It will hold you hair, if used correctly, but will not hold it too tight. It looks little messy in a sexy way :-) I like it. This is exactly what I have been looking for and received many compliments :-)</li>
            <li> looks good but not that easy for the thin hair to wear</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!  It keeps my hair back yet is not too tight.  I can adjust it to the very crown of my head, or the very bottom. I had to shop all over to find it--should have known I would find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Vidal sassoon flex clincher comb arrived on time and as stated.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered two of these.  I have long thick very wavy hair.  I have the kind that clips together and sometimes they can be a bit tight for my liking.  I got these and tried it as soon as I got it out of the package.  I really do like it.  You can adjust it to fit firmly, or a bit loose.  It is great.  I would recommend this product.  Thank You Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are great for putting up your hair in the summertime!</li>
            <li> Good clip to keep my shoulder-length hair out of the way in hot humid weather.</li>
            <li> I bought two combs, this one and a black one from another manufacturer.  This one is more difficult to clip together than the others and the teeth don&#x27;t really interlock well.  I won&#x27;t buy another</li>
            <li> I like this style comb and they are very hard to find these days.  I have had a couple teeth break off, but considering how difficult they are to find, I&#x27;m not really complaining.  Might not work well with really long, thick hair, but for me is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping hair back. Hair looks pretty and full in the back.</li>
            <li> Did not work well in my very thick long hair.  Might work well with less hair.&lt;br /&gt;Should have know better after seeing the picture.</li>
            <li> I have one like this that I have been using for years and have always wanted more. This works great in holding my hair back. I have past shoulder length hair, somewhat fine.</li>
            <li> does not work well with my hair</li>
            <li> Too small for wavy thick hair</li>
            <li> Does not work, need to return.</li>
            <li> Edges of comb is rough and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; when clinched together. Cheap flimsy plastic which is really unexpected of Vidal Sassoon product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these for years. exactly what I was looking for. Very fast shipping! Would reccomened to anyone who wants to put their hair up without putting it in a tight ponytail that causes a headache.</li>
            <li> Best comb to control my hair in the hot summer days!</li>
            <li> I loved it when it first arrived. The stretchy part broke after about a dozen uses. The ones I have bought from Goody Brands have lasted for years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! It broke in 1/2 while putting it in my hair the very FIRST time!</li>
            <li> Two teeth broke off the first day my wife wore it.</li>
            <li> I am growing out my hair and don&#x27;t want it on my neck - this sweeps it up and away neatly.</li>
            <li> Garbage not for ethnic hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair so I got this.  May be worth more stars as my hair gets longer.  You need lots of hair to make this work.</li>
            <li> An easy way to put up your hair in a different way than a pony tail.  Combs take a little bit to get used to on getting it closed at first.  Has worked well for me.  Didn&#x27;t pull my hair or give me a headache like some other clips I have used before.  Would recommend it.  Great for the price.</li>
            <li> I wore this to work and got compliments on my hair style, my only issue is I have very thick hair and it&#x27;s hard to get it all in the clip. But it&#x27;s a nice change from a ponytail .</li>
            <li> Okay clincher, depending on style used for it does not always stay in place.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fasten or snap to hold your hair up!  It&#x27;s useless!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the companies have to keep changing the composition of the products.  The original clincher comb was a more flexible plastic and lasted almost 15 years.  With the new version, this is the third one that the teeth have broken after just a few uses as they are so brittle.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Smaller than the ones I use to buy in the 80&#x27;s.  Had to give them to a child.  My hair is too long and thick.</li>
            <li> I love it, its a little tight but works great. Would buy again, works well with long hair and curls</li>
            <li> Loved them. Ordered 6 in all.</li>
            <li> I can not get it to latch (stay together) even when not putting it in my hair. When I could get it in, it was a challenge to get my hair to lay down smoothly on the sides and was unappealing to look at. Not the effect I was going for. Plastic is flimsy, not sure if this will prevent it from breaking or break easier.</li>
            <li> Does not hold my hair (yes it is a bit thick and wavy). Broke on the 3rd wear. It may be cheap but its still a waste of money.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make a standard ponytail, more like a cascading one.  Looks nice from the back and sides, clip works well also.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and absolutely love it!!! It keeps all my hair up and away from my face.</li>
            <li> Have been trying to find these for years....best buy ever</li>
            <li> The stretchy part is very flimsy and it doesn&#x27;t interlock as advertised .....to make this work I would have to find a way to shorten the stretchy part... every time I see this piece of crap ... I am upset ... first time I ever purchased anything online and it&#x27;s vexatious to my well-being. I tried to modified it but failed miserably ...</li>
            <li> Very petty....comfortable...the old style was to long for my head....this one is perfect...tortious shell color is perfect for my red hair so I CAN WEAR IT WITH ANY THING. I AM SO GLAD I GOT 2.......AND a LOW PRICE TOO.</li>
            <li> This thing does not work. Period. It should not even be sold. I feel like i was ripped off. Not fair.</li>
            <li> easy to use very good material do not break  become loose like other kinds which i tried before and it looks nice</li>
            <li> I think this product is genius, especially for curly hair.  My hair seems to be a little too thick for it but I still make it work.  The combs don&#x27;t hold my hair together but I use two bobby pins and and a rubber band to secure the combs with my hair.  I love the look it creates, it gives it a more flowy, longer look.  I get many compliments.  I would recommend it to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because I have a lot of hair, but this did nothing for me and I really thought it would be useful.......didn&#x27;t hold very well and stretches only to stay stretched. I was hoping for a tighter elasticity, but it&#x27;s only plastic.</li>
            <li> I love this comb.  I use it everyday. If the bottom breaks just add a new one.  I always change the bottom anyway.  Try that and I bet you will love it.  Have fun!!!!</li>
            <li> seems a little flimsy, but has stayed together so far.  Hard item to find, so I&#x27;ll use it as long as possible.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money! It does not clamp nor does it stay closed..very cheaply made dont think its really by Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li> Still hasn&#x27;t figured out how to have stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, especially at the beach.  Or when I&#x27;m doing housework and don&#x27;t want my hair in my face.  Or when my hair doesn&#x27;t turn out right.  So a lot!</li>
            <li> This stretched out after 4-5 x use on long hair. Useless now. There aren&#x27;t any similar clips out there that I could find.</li>
            <li> Really liked the way it made a ponytail look. Too bad it split into 2 the second time I wore it. I have thin hair so if it can&#x27;t stand up to my hair it won&#x27;t stand up to any hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold hair like it should, something is wrong with design.  Very disappointed - bought two thinking it would work great.</li>
            <li> I ordered these about 2 years ago and LOVED them.... recently I lost the last one I had so I ordered 2 more. The quality is not the same as it once was. Both snapped right down the middle the first time I tried to put them in. It&#x27;s a shame because I really liked the design and I can&#x27;t find anyone else who makes them.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair and in the summer time I like to were it up but not tight so these work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for keeping hair under control in humid and hot weather.  Would recommend it to anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> searched high and low for these  not as good as the older ones....doesn&#x27;t hold hair as tight as it could  but still love them</li>
            <li> Does not work for me.  I have to much hair for this clip close.  Wasted my money on this purchase.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low in retail stores for this type of hair clincher but&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re no longer sold.  So I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  I have a lot of fine, thin hair and this works well&lt;br /&gt;for me.  The problem is that it&#x27;s made of rigid plastic and the teeth fall out after a limited amount of wear.  The&lt;br /&gt;old style was made of heavier, more piable plastic.  Since I no longer have options, then  I&#x27;m happy with this.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend love these, but they tend to easily break.</li>
            <li> Good, delivered. Thanks. Item arrived exactly as expected. No complaints.</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried to put this product in my hair it broke, so since I bought two, I tried the other one, and it also broke in the same place. Not happy at all I loved these when they first came out. Then they took them off the shelf I was devastated. These were my go to hair fix. I was so excited when I found them on Amazon. Now not excited all all pretty upset that the quality was so bad.I,ve contacted the seller and as of yet have not heard anything from them. Guess I won&#x27;t be getting anymore of these.</li>
            <li> I wore these years ago and you could find them in every hair care department there was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair grow back out and I literally spent hours on the internet trying to find them again.  Once I learned the &amp;#34;new name&amp;#34; for them, there were still hard to locate.  I bought 3 so that if I loose one (or give one away) I still have a backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t stop carrying them.</li>
            <li> This thing does not work!  I could not figure out how to use it or even close it!  I ended up tossing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Bought as replacement for one that broke after several years of use.  It keeps my hair inside my shower cap so It doesn&#x27;t get wet.</li>
            <li> I want to offer a rebuttal of the negative reviews for use on fine hair.  This works very well in mine.  This is my second order and indeed the first one did begin to lose teeth after a dozen or so uses.  I don&#x27;t actually think it speaks to the inferiority of the product but rather is probably my fumbling with it behind my head.</li>
            <li> I use to use these all the time when I was in high school which was about 20 years ago, I was glad to see it again because I use to love the way it made my hair look when it was up and it held it the best out of all my hair clips, but it seems like they have made it a bit cheaper since then because it looks like after a few uses the plastic is turning white in the creases which means that it could break at some point showing weak spots, not sure when but I do not use it as much because of it, I guess my high school dreams are lost hehe.</li>
            <li> How To Wear Flex the Clincher Comb? I have shoulder-length hair, lot of it, and curly. I think this is what I need but another customer expressed (different store) that she returned the item b/c she could not figure out how to use. Can someone show head pic on how to put on? Lift hair so potential customers can appreciate? I think the item would sell more if costumers have an idea on how to put it on. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This comb is great to put a loose pony tail type hair style in your hair. It holds your hair without being too tight. My hair is very fine and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep clasped.</li>
            <li> I received my package today and was so excited to try this product.  I removed it from the packaging then pulled the combs thru my hair. Guess what happened next -----the comb broke. Poorly made product. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was the only hair clip that I could use in my very thick hair. I was very pleased to find it here on Amazon. It&#x27;s a throw back to the 80&#x27;s but I get many compliments on this clip. I have bought extra to give as gifts to friends who remember and miss this clip. Great product and glad to have found it.</li>
            <li> having the combs interlock in my hair doesn&#x27;t work for my hair type (african heritage, very coily, type 4a)</li>
            <li> Hated it! Don&#x27;t even know how to use the gee darn thing it&#x27;s awful do not buy</li>
            <li> Got it for my daughter and it didn&#x27;t really work for her hair.</li>
            <li> Gave it away, could not make it work with my hair.</li>
            <li> The combs broke as I was about to cut them about the cardboard. They snapped in the middle of the bottom, curvy part. I tried to see if I can rig it together, but it was still an epic fail. Have they had been made with better quality, it would have been an awesome pair of combs for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  Takes practice to figure out how to put it in with only having two hands !  LOL.  i put my hair in a pony tail first then put thus in place and then just take the tail holder out.  Be sure to pull it up high when closing the combs then poof up the gathered hair for a nice full look.</li>
            <li> I love these combs. I wear all the time. My hair can be unruly and I put the combs in it, and presto--cute hairstyle for casual or going out. I highly recommend them. I&#x27;m so glad I found them at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This would probably be wonderful for folks with finer hair then my own. When I try to use it, it sags looks considerably less cute than when it sits high on my head where it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a gift for a friend, who thought she was not going to be able to find them anymore. She love love loves them, she is very pleased with the product and time it was filled and sent in, at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have yet to figure out ow to use this thing, it does seem more durable than a lot of the plastic hair accessories.</li>
            <li> I never got this comb to hold in my hair (thin hair). I am not sure if I was using it wrong or what. I gave it away.</li>
            <li> LOVE how my hair looks with this clip. I am not good with fixing my hair (I have very fine hair). Even if I use lots of goop and spray, my hair slips out of most clips usually before I get out the door. This one holds my hair in place all day and I don&#x27;t need to use goop and spray. It&#x27;s easy to put in. I have tried many different styles of clips over the years. This is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> My boss had one of these and I have been looking everywhere for them  This is the only place I have been able to find them. Love the way this product works for your hair. Especially if you have thick and long hair. I scooped up 4 of them so I can just have them since they are hard to find.</li>
            <li> I finally found this on Amazon after breaking mine and really missing it.  They are so easy to use. I love them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pull too hard--feels like it might break! But let me tell you why I&#x27;m giving this 5 whole stars. I have about as much hair as a lion. I periodically get it thinned, and still feel like there&#x27;s too much volume. I&#x27;ve tried several beak/banana-style clips to deviate from the everyday hair tie--the beaks leave some hair out, defeating their purpose, and the banana clips have been too loose and broken after a few (1-5) uses. This gigantic clip can not only accommodate all of my hair, but has a shockingly firm hold, with bunches of hair randomly mixed into the comb. And it looks neat. Plan: buy a few at a time, and remember not to pull on the stretchy bottom part.</li>
            <li> This clip is a piece of junk. It is very flimsy and will not stay fastened.  It also loses it shape.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find. Love them!</li>
            <li> I used these Clincher combs back in the early 90&#x27;s when my hair was long.  I loved the ease of using them and the style that it gave my hair.  In the early 2000&#x27;s I cut my hair very short and so I eliminated a lot of the styling tools that I used when my hair was long.  for the past 8 years I&#x27;ve been growing my hair again and it&#x27;s at a length of just below my shoulders so I looked to see if these combs were still available out there and sure enough was able to find them on Amazon. I was thrilled to say the least.  As soon as my order came I hurriedly opened the packaging and put my hair up and it was awesome to see just how easy and convenient they are to use and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how cute they make my hair look...I ordered 2 more just to be sure I always have one available!</li>
            <li> If you are tired of pony tails, this is a wonderful long hair holder.</li>
            <li> The comb ends should be 1 inch longer, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Hard to use and comes undone too easily.</li>
            <li> I used this clincher comb many years ago. It&#x27;s the only one that works in my hair. I have baby fine hair. I haven&#x27;t been able to find them for at least 5 years. Thanks for bringing them back.</li>
            <li> Nice for fast pull ups and go!</li>
            <li> There is no interlocking mechanism at the top to hold the clip.I have thick hair and I bought 2.The first one broke quite easily and I didn&#x27;t bother to use the other. This is the worst hair product  have ever bought.</li>
            <li> These are great for shoulder length hair or longer.  I use them all the time on walks and workouts at my gym.  They seem to be easy on my hair unlike rubber bands that cause breakage.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these!! I have not been able to find them in drugstores for years and I found them on here for my mom for christmas. She was excited!! They are a perfect combination of banana clip and expandable head band.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time &amp; good experience</li>
            <li> &#x27;ve used this comb for years. Had them in a variety of colors...then my 2 puppies chewed them - so I hunted to find them again.  They aren&#x27;t in stores.  This is the only place to find them. They lift the hair off your neck, out of your face and give you an ultra cool look hanging down the back of your head.</li>
            <li> I had one of these combs as I always put my hair up one way or another.  But this type of comb is not good for those with FINE HAIR.  The upper comb part is ok...it is the bottom flexible \\&quot;zig-zag\\&quot; piece that will turn your hair into a RATS NEST!  I had the WORST time getting the damn thing out of my hair and ended up cussing a blue streak, which made my dogs run behind furniture as they know when mama starts cussing, she is majorly PO&#x27;d.  I could NOT disentangle this thing out of my hair...I had to CUT it out which in turn caused a real \\&quot;choppy\\&quot; mess to the back of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have major hair issues to begin with.  My hair is very fine, and extremely thin/balding on the top of my head.  As a result, I wear human hair pieces for the top of my hair but the back of my hair is nice and thick; or for most people, would be considered \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.  So when this happened, I was extremely upset and called the company...NOT AMAZON.....in all fairness, I did not get this piece of crap from Amazon. I can&#x27;t remember where I bought it; but it was not online.  I got it at some store; a supermarket I think.  But, at the time this happened, I was so po&#x27;d about having to cut my hair to get it out and looked up the name of the company on the internet and called their toll free number.  The staff person I spoke with was not helpful; and very rude and hinted that maybe I \\&quot;didn&#x27;t know how to use their product\\&quot;.  Really? I said to her...it&#x27;s a NO BRAINER--just like the CEO of your COMPANY, and I hung up. I just wish I could remember WHERE it was that it had come from. I cannot stand dealing with rude companies; especially when it is the CONSUMER that keeps these idiots in business.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I don&#x27;t know where this particular comb being sold on Amazon comes from; but if it is from the same place I got mine, buyer beware.</li>
