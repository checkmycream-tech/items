            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The case they came in is great for travelling and doubles as a brush holder when they are being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I experienced post purchase.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Customer service is beyond great, as well.  </li>
            <li>The powder brush feels great against the skin and they washed well.</li>
            <li>These brushes work great for all my make-up needs.  </li>
            <li>but i wouldnt use them, going to gift them, would be great for a beginner.</li>
            <li>Case is great quality.</li>
            <li>All the reviews were great</li>
            <li>and I could not, which is great.</li>

            <li>they are of great quality &amp;</li>
            <li>The concealer brush is great for applying spot correction.  </li>
            <li>Great product, but over-priced.</li>
            <li>They are the softest brushes I have ever used and do a great job applying my mineral powder.</li>
            <li>The case will be great for travel but for now each side can hold brushes on the counter</li>
            <li>and I am once again extremely happy with my purchase from the Andre Lorent</li>

            <li>Pretty good quality brushes.</li>

            <li>So soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this, it popped on my mind that it might be a good try.</li>
            <li>These brushes are pretty good.</li>
            <li>, we as well own a family business as well and our customers are a very important part of our success.</li>
            <li>for the price u pay; u will get ur money&#x27;s worth!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to choose new brushes for sometime and this set seemed a great choice.</li>
            <li>My set has already been washed a couple of times because of the creamed make up, liquid eyeliner experiment, and the cream glitter being used, and I can tell you that they return to perfect condition after they are dry.</li>
            <li>These brushes are clean, soft, precise, and with the beautiful case- they&#x27;re protected!</li>
            <li>I love the softness of the brush as well as how easily and</li>

            <li>Each different makeup brush applied the powders, eye shadows, and lip products smoothly and beautifully!  </li>
            <li>: This is one of my favorites because it make such precise and perfect lines.</li>
            <li>They are super good and super cute.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this company and Emily - who so kindly emailed me and got my feedback.</li>

            <li>They are also very easy  to clean.</li>

            <li>(the second largest one is perfect for applying foundation, the little slant brush blends eyeliner perfectly)</li>
            <li>These are a great set of makeup brushes for those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>importantly, my makeup looks like it was done by a competent woman and not a manic three-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I received my brushes I was pleasantly surprised to be emailed by Emily, the co-founder, to check on how happy I was with my purchase.</li>

            <li>They make my makeup application so easy..</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;any odors from brush set or strong leather smell from case.  </li>
            <li>so nice soft &amp; nicely shaped.</li>
            <li>The brushes are all perfectly soft, the weight feels good in your hands, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like they will break apart like the many sets I have tried before.</li>
            <li>A strong chemical type of smell.</li>
            <li>These brushes are absolutely the softest and most quality make up brushes I own.</li>
            <li>but I did not find it to be particularly strong with the set I got at all</li>
            <li>There is a strong smell from the case</li>
            <li>This was a great deal and I great price, Skip the expensive ones and try these for sure!</li>
            <li>Knowing that they are made by hand makes them even more special.</li>

            <li>The fact that they are hand crafted is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>so I thought it is relevant to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The brushes are of obvious great quality.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous set of brushes I received as a Xmas gift.</li>
            <li>And it also doesn&#x27;t fit into my travel bag.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fantastic cook by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked them so much I bought another set for my mother-in-law</li>
            <li>The fact that they are vegan and cruelty free is the icing on the cake .</li>
            <li>I could even fit in 2 additional eye shadow brushes..</li>
            <li>I received follow up emails from the co-founder of Andre Lorent to say thank you and ensure the purchasing process went smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Makeup goes on just the way it should; not the way it does with cheap brushes.  </li>

            <li>I purchased this primarily for the powder brush.  </li>

            <li>They are easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>They spread evenly and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Having the travel case has really come in handy, and has kept the bristles from getting damaged on trips when I need to pack them to come with.</li>
            <li>What a bargain for such a great product.</li>
            <li>The hairs are securely placed on the handle and the brushes move across your face like silk.</li>
            <li>I especially liked the liner brush as it made a nice straight (narrow) line when I applied eyeliner under the lash line.</li>
            <li>The customer service was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The quality is great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and come in a good array of shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li>A great product at a reasonable price and delivery was really fast.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>but they are soft and look nice and the case is cute.</li>

            <li>My new favorite brushes!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft, they work great, and they&#x27;re priced just right.</li>
            <li>I love that they are Vegan and cruelty free, which leaves them smelling crisp and clean, no trace of a chemical odor.</li>
            <li>They look really nice, are so soft, and work well!!</li>
            <li>Gorgeous packaging, super soft and luxurious brushes.</li>
            <li>Absolutely loved these brushes, they are super soft.</li>
            <li>They are super soft, have a good grip.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very convenient &amp; the travel case is extremely cute and nice, very high quality.</li>
            <li>Not only are these brushes amazing, so is the company!</li>
            <li>Once washed, they return to their original shape and texture.</li>
            <li>Original item.</li>
            <li>Just look closely at the photos and make sure you understand exactly the size of the brushes you are getting to ensure your satisfaction.</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>smooth and soft brush love it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got the leather case and brushes in the mail and was able to see in person that it was exactly as I hoped.</li>
            <li>They do shed the first couple of times you wash them (but I expect that from most of my brushes).</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>The Foundation Brush worked best for me to apply concealer, I&#x27;m not a fan of small Foundation brushes for face make-up applications.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft and I love that they came in a handy case which is very convenient!</li>
            <li>I have been wishing to own a new make up brush set</li>
            <li>(hi, it might be time to clean things)</li>
            <li>These are great personal touches rarely seen these days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, but not so soft that it doesn&#x27;t hold its shape, making it ideal for any liner or brow gel application that requires precision.</li>
            <li>Second, they arrived in an awesome case which was unexpected.</li>
            <li>I found that the Andre Lorent professional makeup brush set gives you the best of both worlds – affordable (local retail prices) with high-end quality!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to clean them yet</li>
            <li>The brush are super soft, feel nice on skin so far so good.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and durable(: I love them!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that the bristles on the brush are beyond soft!</li>
            <li>Nice, soft brushes, quality set!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re soft and love the case too!</li>
            <li>: I actually have a great blush brush right now</li>
            <li>and they sent me an entirely new one very quickly and said I could keep the original, which means I got 2 sets of these fabulous brushes!</li>
            <li>The products arrived quickly, and so far I have been very pleased with the brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very well made and very smooth.</li>
            <li>I particularly enjoyed the large powder blush</li>
            <li>These brushes rock!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re all just the right size and shape that I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Right on!</li>
            <li>The days of scrounging in the makeup bag for the right brush are over!</li>
            <li>Cruelty free and high end brushes at this price it can&#x27;t be beat!!!</li>
            <li>The brushes are a little smelly first out of the plastic, but let them air out for a day or two and they are great!  </li>
            <li>I cannot speak on the longevity of these brushes yet because I just received them, but I love them so much that I wanted to post a review right away!</li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive so these super soft brushes felt so good on my eyes!</li>
            <li>The quality is outstanding and soooo very soft!!</li>
            <li>set really gives you the bare essentials to achieve a great look.</li>
            <li>the brushes are great basic brushes and I highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li>They are so gentle on your face, its amazing that they aren&#x27;t made out of real hair!</li>
            <li>I saw an ad on Facebook (yes, really) for an amazing deal featured on Amazon for this exact Andrew Lorent Pro Makeup Brush Set.</li>
            <li>They won&#x27;t leave streaks and they are good for powdered products such as bronzer and eye shadows too.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and so nice</li>
            <li>I really wish each brush had written on it what it is used for like most brushes are</li>
            <li>They are really soft and the box is nice.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft.</li>
            <li>, I received my set two days ago and I am pleasantly surprised by how nice the set looks in the leather case.  </li>
            <li>case is sweet also</li>
            <li>Nice fully brushes and in person, they are soft and feel luxurious to the touch.</li>
            <li>I received today and am so far loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants professional quality makeup brushes without the professional price tag, what a great value!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really thinking of buying more to give away as gifts.</li>
            <li>They are simply gorgeous, and especially with the case they come in.</li>
            <li>Not the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever felt, but they are soft and feel nice against the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Loving every bit of this set:) I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It would be nice to see the brushes marked also with &#x27;foundation&#x27; &#x27;powder&#x27; &#x27;eyeshadow&#x27; etc</li>
            <li>Now I will start practicing more with my cream eyeliner, so I am very excited!&lt;br</li>
            <li>i would absolutely get more products from them.</li>
            <li>While they didn&#x27;t smell like sweet succulent flowers, they also did not smell like a landfill.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft, have no fall out, and wash nicely.</li>
            <li>The thing that really put these over the top for me is the case.</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and container is convenient, so far so good, I&#x27;ve been able to use the brushes to apply makeup with ease</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really been enjoying using the brushes.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous, sturdy case, plenty of room for extra brushes!</li>
            <li>However, Andre Lorent has gone above and beyond to cover every detail of this gorgeous set.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>To top it off, the co-founder of Andre Lorent is extremely responsive to questions about the product – he helped answer some of my initial questions about caring for the brushes, and how best to clean them.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and was pleasently surprised by the quality for the price!!!</li>
            <li>but I did tell her that I loved the way they look, that they feel super soft, and the container to put them in was pretty.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful, professional quality, super soft.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy your product, easy to buy, n fast.</li>
            <li>Easy to go case and all the brushes you really need!</li>
            <li>They apply the makeup evenly and the eyeliner brush does such a clean line - it&#x27;s even better than my favorite Clinique one.</li>
            <li>Pretty strong chemical smell upon opening the package</li>
            <li>They did smell strong at first</li>
            <li>Love the brushes they are very soft and work amazing, up opening they did have a new brush odor</li>
            <li>I am kind of a brush junkie, I own many different brushes from different companies.</li>
            <li>Great vegan, cruelty-free alternative to other high-quality make-up brushes.</li>
            <li>Love the brushes and they are thick, cannot beat the price, would buy again and the container is very cute too!</li>
            <li>I just love my new make-up brushes!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love my new makeup brushes and the case they came in makes travel with my makeup a breeze!  </li>
            <li>&amp; I look forward to trying out new products from this line! :)</li>
            <li>My husband picked them out for me on a whim, and he&#x27;s lucky the worked out.</li>
            <li>The length of the wooden part of the brushes could be a tid bit longer but overall, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>, I just wouldn&#x27;t expect it to happen so quickly.</li>
            <li>so I can super glue it on.</li>
            <li>They are a tiny bit short but a great set for trave!</li>
            <li>The brushes were delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>it is super convenient.</li>
            <li>These brushes shipped quickly and exceeded my expectations of the product.  </li>
            <li>Super soft and apply my bare minerals makeup beautifully.</li>
            <li>The case they come in is super study too.</li>
            <li>Which is why I&#x27;m hoping they release more brushes to buy individually as needed :)</li>
            <li>BUT I was quickly contacted about sending a replacement and received that today.</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I have purchased more expensive brushes, because I thought it was the best route to go....</li>
            <li>quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I purchased a set of MAC makeup brushes for more than double the price of these and these seem to be a much better quality.</li>
            <li>Thank you Emily  for your quick response on my question regarding a use description for each brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a result, I go through makeup brushes relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>This was shipped quickly and when I opened it...</li>
            <li>I had bought a MAC foundation brush but quickly found out that I could not keep dropping $35 on brushes.  </li>
            <li>quick ship, just as described.  </li>
            <li>And third, after receiving them, one of the founders of the company wrote me to check and make sure everything was good on my end, very classy move.</li>
            <li>I do love the colors of the brushes, very classy!</li>
            <li>my all time favorite brushes high end are it cosmetics brushes the originals and lowend</li>
            <li>The packaging is also very pretty.  </li>
            <li>The case&#x27;s snaps even close with a solid &amp;#34;thunk.&amp;#34; Very, very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The handles are smooth and comfortable to hold and have good weight: these are not cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li>The case is very pretty and the brushes work well for their intended use.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The company is very interested in customer satisfaction and truly aims to please.  </li>
            <li>Blends my makeup very well and feel better than most professional brushes.</li>
            <li>But wow these brushes are so soft and they come with the most effective brow brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I used to be a Mary Kay rep and loved their brushes that came in their kit, but so far I really am enjoying these brushes a little bit better.  </li>
            <li>These are my new favorite brushes.</li>
            <li>My new favorite tools</li>
            <li>I wanted to try all of them right away, so I did full makeup for a dinner party we had tonight.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and super soft brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and pretty dense and they came in a really nice case.</li>
            <li>The handles are very ergonomic and easy to hold as well.</li>
            <li>When it arrived and I opened the snapped shut case, I loved that the five brushes looked exactly as they present.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and I enjoyed using them this morning.</li>
            <li>:) It is very soft to the skin when applied to it.</li>
            <li>I got these for the $1 special, so I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The case is so pretty!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really pretty looking, too!</li>
            <li>Lost my first set!</li>
            <li>Love them thus far!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of their products!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them so far!</li>
            <li>If there are more types developed, I would buy again!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality makeup brush, buy these!!!</li>
            <li>I also love the white container is comes in which makes it so easy for me to travel</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft and I love the way they apply my  makeup.</li>
            <li>I cannot express how much I love these super soft brushes.</li>
            <li>Love the case, brushes are super soft, yet durable.</li>
            <li>The case is great for traveling and closes tightly.</li>
            <li>The brushes are extremely soft and the craftsmanship very detailed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a fine product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would&#x27;ve preferred black if available but in person the white and copper brown look very beautiful.</li>
            <li>I am going to look closer at your website to see if you sell any more types of brushes or any other products I made need because I just love buying from a seller who is true to their product.  </li>
            <li>And they come in a great little storage case.</li>
            <li>This is a great little kit of brushes.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup lover; I tread high and low for great products at reasonable and/or affordable prices!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re such an amazing price too.</li>
            <li>They came in a sleek case that&#x27;s great for traveling and everyday storage.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are made very well, and are quite comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>It feels great on face and catches power quite firmly.</li>
            <li>This seller goes above and beyond and also has an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>but I would have liked a brush one size larger!!</li>
            <li>This is my concern.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the quality is good, but it does not apply well as I expected .</li>
            <li>Better than I expected:)</li>
            <li>These brushes are top notch professional brushes.  </li>
            <li>While I enjoy make up, I&#x27;m not as creative as my teen, who, of course, wanted to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; these immediately.</li>
            <li>Not only they look so nice</li>
            <li>I have never had such nice makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love the brushes and how soft they are.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the product so far.</li>
            <li>I not only love the color, but they feel extremely smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>Considering I spent $12.95 at CVS for just a foundation brush, this set seemed like a good price.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a nice set for the price.</li>
            <li>Hairs are soft love</li>
            <li>They have a nice white holding case .</li>
            <li>Not my kind of brushes, low quality, I got them on sale for $1 so</li>
            <li>My brushes came earlier than expected and arrived in great shape!</li>
            <li>I bought this set to augment and replace a Borghese set that was more than 20 years old.</li>
            <li>so soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>To me that is a rare quality in business today</li>
            <li>I love these brushes because they are so soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait until I used all of the brushes before posting my review, but I can honestly say this product was worth it after using only 2 of them.</li>
            <li>It  makes for a great gift for a young woman starting to wear makeup or someone who is makeup savvy.</li>
            <li>I honestly bought the entire set just for the eyebrow brush</li>
            <li>The only brush I would have liked to have seen in the kit</li>
            <li>I used the smudging brush, but it would be nice to have that one extra brush.</li>
            <li>The one I&#x27;ve used most so far is the eyeshadow brush.  </li>
            <li>but it works so much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>The quality of these brushes is supurb, no bristles falling out, etc., and I love the case they came in (which could be used for so many other things besides housing the brushes).  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal for me as I can put one of my other brushes in the awesome</li>
            <li>Yes, they did have a smell at first, but this went away quickly.</li>
            <li>I have several sets of high end, big name brush sets and these can and should be ranked with the best.</li>
            <li>I typically prefer to set my foundation with a kabuki brush rather than a long-handled powder brush, but it handled my NARS Light Reflecting Loose Setting Powder marvelously.</li>
            <li>I have paid more for a single brush than this set and these are far better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it to fill in my brows as well as create sharp winged liner, and was delighted at its versatility.</li>
            <li>Received right on time.</li>
            <li>She responded right away.  </li>
            <li>This set is just what I was looking for, all the right size brushs that I need in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>In my search for the right brushes I have spent&lt;br</li>
            <li>Order them right now.</li>
            <li>- it blended my corrector right in without washing it away.</li>
            <li>However, amazon made things right an honored the coupon price</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, I love the fact that is handmade and all natural!!!</li>
            <li>Loved tge brushes not only for the price but works well and feels super soft on each and every use</li>

            <li>These are buy far the best brushes I have ever owned (and ive owned much more expensive ones).</li>
            <li>Small business like this one deserve great recognition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and it&#x27;s actually quite cute!  </li>
            <li>They feel very light and soft on the skin, they clean up well, and so far I&#x27;ve had zero reactions to the brushes.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to use as demo tools with a new makeup kit, and I ended up keeping them for myself and picking up another cheap set.</li>
            <li>This is a company that makes a fantastic product, is proud to make them, and stands behind them every step of the way.  </li>
            <li>The small angled brush works great with cream eyeshadow to get it exactly where you want it, even if your using the cream eyeshadow for eyeliner.</li>
            <li>plus shipping was super fast (2 days)</li>
            <li>Love the soft brush gentle on your skin .</li>

            <li>This is a great set of brushes, they&#x27;re so soft and the bristles don&#x27;t shed as quickly as other brushes I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older (50s), my skin has become more sensitive to make ups, brushes, etc.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes!!!</li>
            <li>Nice to find a vegan product held to such high standards.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t experience the smell others were talking about when I first opened.</li>
            <li>First you maybe experience some stiffness but one or two uses</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>This set is my first makeup brush set</li>
            <li>I love the white color and it brightens up my otherwise-dark makeup table.</li>
            <li>thanks you too!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>, that I am probably going to be ordering more in the future for my sister-in-law&#x27;s and girlfriends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be honest I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person</li>
            <li>For instance I went many years with only one kitchen knife, one pan, and one cast iron dutch oven to cook meals.</li>
            <li>only okay at putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Overall, i&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>These brushes are definately the basic, essential ones that every lady should own!</li>
            <li>I ordered these brushed because I was looking for a set that had a better container because I travel full-time and wanted something that was durable and that the brushes would not fall out of.  </li>
            <li>Very high-quality product !</li>
            <li>They are soft and apply smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li>and it picks up the color and deposits very well!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set!!</li>
            <li>We are both interested in supporting your family business.</li>
            <li>Would most definitely recommend these brushes and buy from them again.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying make up brushes</li>
            <li>The bristles feel soft and comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li>I love the neutral color of the brushes and handles are white with stamped name of product.</li>
            <li>second favorite brush is, without question, the angled brush.</li>
            <li>High recommend these brushes!!</li>
            <li>They are exceptionally soft and do a fantastic job of picking up powders and blending.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the opportunity to try your brushes!</li>
            <li>I have a feeling I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>Some of my high end brushes!!</li>
            <li>Will definately try more from this line in the future!</li>
            <li>The white case that the brushes arrived in is just lovely.</li>
            <li>and I love the foundation brush especially</li>
            <li>I really like the case they came in also!</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how soft they are and how they apply the makeup with a precise definition.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit overpowering at first, but the email from the Co founder said to air them out a couple days and the smell will go away.</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>These brushes are exactly what I have been looking for.  </li>
            <li>I washed before first use.</li>
            <li>I received my elegant make up brushes last week and just had to write a review!  </li>
            <li>I love the set combination, exactly what I use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these brushes to anyone!!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend :-)</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves these brushes!</li>
            <li>The round container is a good idea if you have to take them  on a trip.</li>
            <li>They are so soft!!!!  </li>
            <li>Love the brushes have used all but two of the brushes so far They are very soft</li>
            <li>these brushes are very soft and light, very well made.</li>
            <li>I agree with the hundreds of other reviewers; these brushes are amazingly soft and nice!</li>
            <li>I hope these last a while because these are by far my favorite set of makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>The eye shadow brush was much too small/short and the blush brush was very large.  </li>
            <li>I honestly thought it too good to be true; but nonetheless, I have never had a bad experience ordering from Amazon, so I gave it a go.</li>
            <li>I will never again buy any other kind of brushes.</li>
            <li>and I definitely was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the strong plastic smell when I got the package, although I believe it was mostly from the white container (not the brushes) and dissipated quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is the bulk and the color - white looks good</li>
            <li>No fly away hairs falling out of them, they hold powder nicely and I love the carrying case.</li>
            <li>The brushes are made very, very well and feel absolutely luscious.</li>
            <li>Super soft brush set!</li>
            <li>Super soft brushes!</li>
            <li>super soft!</li>
            <li>They are super soft, sturdy, and affordable!</li>
            <li>Plus, they&#x27;re super soft!</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li>Every girl needs her brushes and these are soft, practical and special.</li>
            <li>Every girl needs her brushes and these are soft, practical and special.</li>
            <li>Last but not least this brush helps achieve an even color (especially when using intense colors) - I don&#x27;t usually use lip brushes, I prefer to use the lipstick straight up, but one of my favorite lipsticks is running low so this is the perfect tool to use even the last piece of that beautiful color and keep my money in my pocket for a little longer before I have to hit the Chanel counter again :)</li>
            <li>but they are super soft and pick up product very well!</li>
            <li>The cute little white leather carrying case is the real bonus to this set, it is so adorable!</li>
            <li>I AM POSITIVE</li>
            <li>I am no professional when it comes to makeup, but these are way better quality than the Sonia kashuk brushes I was using before.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much !</li>
            <li>I am not professional in doing makeup but now after received this brushes, I am trying to learn more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased a few products from this company &amp; their service is always so professional &amp; they always make sure you&#x27;re 100% satisfied..</li>
            <li>The case is super cute wish the case was black</li>
            <li>They are very soft and makes putting on my makeup much easier!!</li>
            <li>They are very well made and super soft!</li>
            <li>and I found that they were right along the lines of what I normally use (</li>
            <li>However, the brush holder is very nice and large enough to put other brushes in there.</li>
            <li>They are super soft though and do not shed at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>The shipping is pretty fast and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Was surprised by how quickly it shipped.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft on your face.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and do not shed.  </li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft and are well made.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and the bristles do not fall out.</li>
            <li>The eye brushes are shaped in such a way that it was easy to apply my eye shadow.</li>
            <li>She likes the versatility of being able to use liquid or dry foundation.</li>
            <li>Feel good on my face and hoepfully will last a long time</li>
            <li>Though Its smell lil&#x27; strong so I must left the case</li>
            <li>out\\&quot; but aside from when I first opened the case there isn&#x27;t any strong smell after the initial opening so that was better than expected.</li>
            <li>The brushed arrived very fast and came in a really nice white leather cylinder case.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m learning to love every single one.</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy from this company again at this price point.</li>
            <li>The large brush is comparable to their kabuki...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my fault that their coupon code wasn&#x27;t set to limit at a certain number of uses.</li>
            <li>I have and use a lot of different brushes, but these are my new favorite.</li>
            <li>The brushes are lightweight but very durable and the case is compact yet strong enough to protect the brushes.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping also verry soft brushes</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft and pick up product very well.</li>
            <li>Super soft yet very durable.</li>
            <li>it is very dense and super soft.</li>
            <li>Great application, easy to wash and fluff back to shape when dry!</li>
            <li>Soft enough to be pleasant on the skin, and enough &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; to evenly and thoroughly apply a sweep across eyelids or cheeks.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Leather box is also very high quality.</li>
            <li>The brush case is very high end, quality and sturdy.</li>
            <li>The carrying case while it is super cute and sturdy it only comes in white which doesn&#x27;t bother me much</li>
            <li>nice little case for them too</li>
            <li>So soft, no chemical smell, and holds up very well through washings!!</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and return to their softness after, unlike some brushes who get a little &#x27;wongo&#x27; after cleaning.  </li>
            <li>They are super soft and hold their shape and texture through application &amp; washing (which is more than I can say for some of my other brushes which I&#x27;ve paid $20+ for).</li>
            <li>The case is very pretty new, but as others have stated the white isn&#x27;t very practical and probably won&#x27;t look nice for long … but it is a quality case.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t found a brush that was smooth and gentle enough to blend in the corrector until tonight.</li>
            <li>All very well made including the case.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting these brushes!</li>
            <li>Very close to pro brushes</li>
            <li>She really likes them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use much eye makeup, so, it won&#x27;t affect me as much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I like the set so much</li>
            <li>Thank-you so much Andre Lorent,...</li>
            <li>Either way the brush is still usable and since I will be traveling overseas in a couple months I just left it off since it wont fit into my travel bag with the handle on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband wants it to keep his sunglasses in though.</li>
            <li>HAHA.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that I received an email from the company</li>
            <li>This company has really hit the nail on the head.</li>
            <li>these brushes are really great,and the case they came in to</li>
            <li>Very stylish!&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>The buyer was very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I really like the fiber the brushes are made of and appreciate the 100% cruelty-free aspect.  </li>
            <li>after purchasing I received a letter straight from the co-founder.</li>
            <li>The seller was very responsive and kept me updated the whole time.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Very substantial.</li>
            <li>But they look and feel very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>They feel like a hardy, quality product (you can definitely tell the difference between cheap quality brushes and these) and perform like it too.  </li>
            <li>And they keep their shape very well.  </li>
            <li>lot more than I spent on these....</li>
            <li>I seem to not use as much make up either...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend working with them and purchasing this make-up brush set!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use a lot of foundation.</li>
            <li>It was better than expected</li>
            <li>I really like the look of them too as well as the case they came in.</li>
            <li>However, the case smell really plastic when it comes in.</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t show dirt as much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend these brushes to buyers!</li>
            <li>They are very dense brushes and transfer the pigment onto my skin without any getting lost in the bristles.</li>
            <li>Very please with this order</li>
            <li>would highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li>Love that it has snaps on each side to keep the case closed.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these brushes, especially the powder brush and eye shadow brush.</li>
            <li>These brushes are a terrific value, and the customer service is fantastic from this company.</li>
            <li>So much that my friend, who was doing my makeup the day of my wedding recommended me to get them</li>
            <li>The deliver was very print</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be purchasing a larger set if one becomes available.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I got an email from the company saying the brushes may have a smell to them when first opening them (which is normal)</li>
            <li>They are better than I expected.</li>
            <li>She told me that the brushes didn&#x27;t work really well with her makeup.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced therefore, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>They applied the makeup equally and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>These are very well made and don&#x27;t leave bristles on your face while applying your makeup.</li>
            <li>The travel case they come in is also really nice!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>very durable just like the brushes,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very picky skin</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They arrived fast and in tact.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spend much time in front of the mirror to get ready for work every morning.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I am really picky about my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I have a few different brands of foundation brushes and this one actually blends the best of all of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>case has become my brush holder at home and works really well.</li>
            <li>These brushes are an absolute MUST HAVE for any makeup lover like myself.</li>
            <li>they are made perfectly, very efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seller was kind enough to email me regarding possible smell of the glue they use.</li>
            <li>Brushes are nice and fluffy.</li>
            <li>(I am a freelance makeup artist and practice different looks on my own face multiple times a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I would have really liked to have a fluffy blending brush in the set.</li>
            <li>I only wish that they made more types of brushes as well, then my set would be complete.</li>
            <li>I have only used these once so far, but I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li>I gave it two star because at least the case is good.</li>
            <li>It felt personal to have that kind of attention as a consumer, especially when it comes to online shopping.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most brush make me blotchy, red, and itchy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the 1st time I&#x27;m using a brush to apply my foundation (I&#x27;ve tried liquid &amp; mousse) and both go on very easily, using a lot less product.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and high quality.</li>
            <li>They are super soft, and they are high quality.</li>
            <li>Highest quality, beyond soft!!!</li>
            <li>Wow!!!  </li>
            <li>The brushes are silky soft, easy to clean, and pick up and release makeup extremely well.</li>
            <li>when u first get them the inside of the case smells like new paint from the case</li>
            <li>I barely had to tap the brush into the well for the powder to quickly adhere to the ultra-soft bristles.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a strong new product smell, but if I did I was informed via personal email</li>
            <li>Other than that ok.</li>
            <li>But other than that,  I absolutely love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>Something you can&#x27;t see in the picture very well is the case is very sturdy and high quality as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how high quality these brushes are at such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;she said these brushes were perfect and very expensive,  her mouth dropped when i told her how much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brushes, and would highly recommend them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much out of it, but it seems to be made of high quality materials and is constructed well.</li>
            <li>Very well made, high quality.</li>
            <li>I also liked they were natural no added color less chemicals added.</li>
            <li>I bought this product while a $1 promotion and I was super surprised on how soft the brushes were.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what I love more, the actual brushes, or the cute little case that the brushes come in.</li>
            <li>Having spent hundreds of dollars on makeup brushes through the years, from mid range brands to high end brushes that I have paid as much as 60 dollars APIECE for, I cannot rave enough about the quality and craftsmanship that I have experienced with these brushes.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint or suggestion I would have is that while the case is very well made and quite attractive...</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft, and apply product very well!</li>
            <li>They are amazingly soft, and I look forward to really trying them out!</li>
            <li>soft, very well put together!  </li>
            <li>My first impression of the brushes are how soft they are and how well made they appear to be.</li>
            <li>I am an avid user of makeup and I apply professionally as well.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft I was amazed the first time I swept them across my face and didn&#x27;t feel like they were scratching my face.</li>
            <li>Soft, smartly angled and very well made.</li>
            <li>I also love the little case they come in, it&#x27;s very convienent for traveling.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a set of new brushes, pick these up!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with this beautiful and high quality set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;FYI, after doing some research my routine for cleaning my brushes is to swirl them in a mixture of Burt&#x27;s Bees baby shampoo with warm water, rinse out, lay flat to dry.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too keen on was the color as white is super hard to keep clean, but it does look nice sitting on the counter in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A black holding case would have been better.</li>
            <li>She has been using sephora face brushes and bobbi brown eye brushes and she is looking for something less pricey, but this one is not so satisfying.</li>
            <li>a darker color (brown or black) may have been a better choice.</li>
            <li>I am one who is very itchy to the rough cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and the carrying case is so convenient to fit into a larger size purse.</li>
            <li>The brushes that tend to come with most make up seem so generic to me, I never achieve the same result I envision in my head.</li>
            <li>This particular set contains everything you need to get started with brushes...</li>
            <li>I will DEFINITELY be buying more from this line in the future.</li>
            <li>I have this set and mainly use the powder and foundation brushes.</li>
            <li>I am also particular of the brushes that I use.</li>
            <li>I wear makeup on a regular basis as a result, I go through makeup brushes relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>I only have an old cheap one to compare it to</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product unless you have a lot of extra time and super glue</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and I am still using them all of the time and they are holding up really well.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very sturdy, and very soft.</li>

            <li>loooooove these brushes they are so soft!!</li>
            <li>I love the little snaps</li>
            <li>They come with a cute little carry case too.</li>
            <li>They compared to other makeup brushes purchased from Bare Minerals, but more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I love the little case they came in.</li>
            <li>There were mentions of it having a strong smell in other reviews</li>
            <li>They are soft and gentle on the face.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and gentle when using.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and the lines are very well-defined.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and seem very well made.</li>
            <li>The brushes are silky soft and transfer the color really well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them much, but I&#x27;ve washed them a couple times and so far there is no shedding</li>
            <li>I night these a couple a weeks ago and so far I really like them.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and apply make up very well.</li>
            <li>It is normal.</li>
            <li>But I wish it had a few more in between eye brushes.</li>
            <li>Not too big or too small and the handles are good quality too.</li>
            <li>I would pay more for that upgrade as the application from the foundation brush is too heavy and streaky.</li>
            <li>and I love the round case they come in.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to using them everyday :)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these brushes, they have a smell when opening it but airing it out for a few days does the trick.</li>
            <li>If you do notice a plastic smell when you first open your set, air them out well and then wash with gentle baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate how each brush was wrapped in its own plastic sleeve, and then all the plastic-wrapped brushes were held together in an even larger plastic sleeve for extra protection.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy and don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re going to fall apart in a few weeks. :)</li>
            <li>For the regular price of these brushes it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>, I think I will order a few more for my girls as well.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are extremely soft, yet are stiff enough to allow for good coverage of product.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft and high quality.</li>
            <li>Super soft and dense at the same time.</li>
            <li>The other benefit is that the container is large enough to fit some of my other favorite brushes.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly and its quality is superior to other brushes that are way more expensive.</li>
            <li>Great brushes, case was very hard to open.</li>
            <li>My other brushes fit in the case too.  </li>
            <li>They are also the perfect size; not too big for traveling, however, they are also not too small for everyday use.</li>
            <li>First off, I was blown away with how high quality these brushes were, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Please keep in touch as your company adds new products.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s the smell of new brushes.</li>
            <li>I need new brushes, I saw these and decided to give them a shot.</li>
            <li>I (always) rinsed them in a mild shampoo water and let them air dry before use.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to replace my old brushes which were never this soft and gentle to use.  </li>
            <li>really nice, soft brushes, give a delicate touch of blush, shadow, or bronzer.  </li>
            <li>I have only used them for a few days so far, but I really love them!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really compare these to other brushes, as this was my first real brush set, but about three days after receiving mine, I ordered a set for my mother.</li>
            <li>High quality, soft brushes.</li>

            <li>Soft brushes I like it!</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;ve used them for nearly 3 weeks and washing them 3 times)!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>For a truly professional application, you have to give these babies a whirl!  </li>
            <li>These brushes are SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>This is the first make-up brush set i have ever gotten and will be the last!</li>
            <li>This set of brushes are by far one of the nicest I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li>(she is an image consultant and makeup professional), and so I did!</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a regular girl who does her own makeup everyday, so I can&#x27;t tell you how they work from a professional point of view.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and well made!</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li>I always buy brushes at Sephora or a similar store when I need them, but always wished I had a higher quality set.</li>
            <li>Words cannot describe how soft these brushes are!  </li>
            <li>So soft!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in applying with these brushes rather than applicators, fingers, or other utensils of choice.  </li>
            <li>I let the maker of this product know that I really felt that the blush brush Should be included, but they argued that the powder brush could also be used for blush, but I simply think the powder brush is too large as my cheekbones are not very narrow.</li>
            <li>Anybody who has tried countless makeup brushes knows how frustrating it can be to find the RIGHT kind.</li>
            <li>First of all, they are soft, but  just enough to where they don&#x27;t lose the makeup before it touches your face.</li>
            <li>the other three are nothing special.  </li>
            <li>They are very natural and soft.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter even noticed how soft they are and stole one of the brushes that she rubs on her face continually while watching TV!</li>
            <li>Super soft on my skin and don&#x27;t have bristled falling off into my face like many other brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I especially like the flat foundation brush, because it&#x27;s a little more dense than my current flat one and smooths out my foundation better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the eyeshadow brush was going to be large enough, but I used it this morning</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to force the brush to get only in certain areas of my face</li>
            <li>Since the time for it finally came, I decided to splurge a little on a better and uniform set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are very high quality and will definitely last a while!  </li>
            <li>I needed to replace an old large brush (for pressed powder and blush) and for the same price as 1 brush at Ulta or MAC I ordered this complete set.  </li>
            <li>I do wish is was a darker color but appreciate the asthetics of clean white, but I know it won&#x27;t last long being around that much makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of the brushes upon arrival was very minimal and went away quickly.</li>
            <li>(although I am careful to make sure the bristles are smoothed out when they are wet.)</li>
            <li>They are not soaking up my CC cream as the natural was.</li>
            <li>The brushes are SO soft, the bristles feel like angel wings on my face as I apply powder.</li>
            <li>It should be aired out before they seal it up and ship it.</li>
            <li>I kept reading about how soft the brushes were and that there were no&lt;</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft and apply my makeup well.</li>
            <li>It is so soft.</li>
            <li>It offers any person who intends to buy a brush.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been a week since l have been using these brushes but l like them so far</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and no shedding</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe they are synthetic, they feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I am just starting to learn makeup techniques, and these brushes are working really well for me.</li>
            <li>These brushes are incredibly soft and well made.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and apply makeup so evenly.</li>
            <li>However, I was actually really surprised at the quality of this set.</li>
            <li>They are so soft on your face, as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They felt so soft on the skin that I couldn&#x27;t wait to use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since receiving them a couple of days ago, I have reached for them every time I applied makeup</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and so far no shedding.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding.</li>
            <li>These are luxuriously soft brushes.</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes blend well and stand up against my old high-end set.</li>
            <li>Although not made with a natural hair fiber, you wouldn&#x27;t know it.  </li>
            <li>So dense and really soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised my brushes were even in there.</li>
            <li>the case smells like leather and the brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not washed them yet, but so far no shedding.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and durable.</li>
            <li>They are truly professional quality.  </li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and compact for traveling.</li>
            <li>They are dense but not too dense and incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a day, but I already don&#x27;t smell it as much.</li>
            <li>and they are really soft.</li>
            <li>They are some of my favorites so far.</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>Brushes are really soft and dense.</li>
            <li>Brushes are so soft.</li>

            <li>I use them as a professional makeup artist and they work wonders.  </li>
            <li>They look really professional too abd</li>
            <li>Bought this product online through Amazon as a gift for my 13 year old niece.  </li>
            <li>Brushes are so soft...</li>
            <li>They are all soft.</li>
            <li>The hair remains puffy and soft after wash.</li>
            <li>Soft is an understatement on how these feel.</li>
            <li>They are amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>Soft, luxurious bristles.</li>
            <li>The high-end makeup brushes are very expense, and the local retail brushes are lower quality.  </li>
            <li>set is reasonably priced (especially for 5 brushes and a case...</li>
            <li>Not only did I get a STEAL of a DEAL with this makeup brush set, but it is absolutely everything it promised it would be.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and well made.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the  Andre Lorent 5-Piece professional brush set in December 2014, but I just got around to using them this month.</li>
            <li>These brushes are hand made and are so soft.  </li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>but I just aired them out for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are incredibly soft - their bristles retain their shape and softness even after washing.</li>
            <li>I would assume a makeup brush case would not receive as much attention as the actual product.</li>
            <li>It is a quality set which presents as classy.  </li>
            <li>The high-end makeup brushes are very expense, and the local retail brushes are lower quality.</li>
            <li>Has a professional feel and ease to take with you when in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Soft and holds the powder well.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li>They are soft and do the job well</li>
            <li>They are so soft.  </li>
            <li>So soft and dense.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really soft and they haven&#x27;t shed this far.</li>
            <li>incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>They are gentle on my skin, no bristles left behind, nice and flexible.  </li>
            <li>It is compact enough to fit in a makeup bag if needed or large enough to throw in some other makeup essentials and go.</li>
            <li>Case is great and is big enough to hold a few of my other brushes as well.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore these brushes, they are incredibly soft and work as any other high end brushes without breaking the bank!</li>
            <li>and they cancelled my order because they didn&#x27;t mean to let so many people use it.</li>
            <li>Other than that I paid for the fast shipping and they were here in two days, which was very convinient because my wedding was the week after that</li>
            <li>I leave it open and filled with other brushes I have also.</li>
            <li>but so far I love them and would recommend them to the serious makeup guru.</li>
            <li>Item toxic:  Very heavy case and smells like formaldehyde (a common ingredient in China&#x27;s glued products) and is shown to cause cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller:  Great and completely refunded without putting me through the hassle of returning.</li>
            <li>They have a slight chemical smell, but it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always skeptical of buying brushes online without being able to see the quality first.</li>
            <li>I had to use a knife to open the white case when if first arrived because that thing is childproof like</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t too hard or too soft, and I can apply my lipstick with it easily.</li>
            <li>Mine didn&#x27;t come with brush use/cleaning instructions, but I just clean them the same way I do all my other brushes.</li>
            <li>amazing, I actually wrote a small suggestion that as long as these are like professional - there should be attached some note which brush is to what....guess what</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for a personal set.</li>
            <li>I have different sets of makeup brushes from inexpensive to high end.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft and the carry-case (though I agree with other buyers, should NOT be white), is durable enough to place in your suitcase for travel, which was my main purpose for getting these brushes.</li>
            <li>The case is fantastic as well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: a year and a half later</li>
            <li>me know that there may be a slight smell to the brushes and to air them out first but that that was normal.</li>
            <li>They are very soft - a couple of the ones I use for eyes are too soft; I wish they had a little more firmness and less &amp;#34;give&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I can see myself using these for a long time as they really hold up well to every day use.</li>
            <li>only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the white handle came off the large brush after 1 week of use.  </li>
            <li>Having worked behind the camera for over 35 years, and using every brush out there, these are easily comparable!  </li>
            <li>The only reason they don&#x27;t get a 5 star rating is that the handle on the blending brush was loose right out of the package.</li>
            <li>They set a new standard after DECADES of brush use!  </li>
            <li>but it does give you dirtier than an actual new case look.</li>
            <li>and I look forward to seeing what new products they will be coming out with in the future!</li>
            <li>a makeup artist I am constantly trying new brushes.</li>
            <li>Smell kinda strange when you first open them</li>
            <li>I like the brush handles are thick and study, makes it easy to apply makeup.</li>
            <li>Was a little worried at first when my order was cancelled without notifying me but amazon came through as always!</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of brushes for typical make-up application.  </li>
            <li>And the case is large enough that I can fit a few other brushes in too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft enough to not irritate the eczema flareups I occasionally get on my eyelids, dense enough to really pack on the color, and is small enough to work on detailed sections of the lid.</li>
            <li>I was a little more concerned with the blush brush because I&#x27;m used to my old blush brush being round and full.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>generally use MAC brushes with some store bought brushes too.</li>
            <li>I can imagine the stains I&#x27;ll have to deal with in the near future.</li>
            <li>They are so soft, but still manage to properly and evenly distribute make up.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used the one for blush or powder and it worked well.  </li>
            <li>only drawback to these brushes is that the case is white, I really wish they&#x27;d make the case in different colors.</li>
            <li>They are truly for everyone, but I can definitely see a professional makeup artist using these.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is that I wish the eye shadow brush was soft and fuller.</li>
            <li>I use them with my Bare Minerals and the powder</li>
            <li>bristles on these brushes are solid but soft.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the case and removing the individual coverings, I was wowed by how soft the brushes were.</li>
            <li>They have such a high-quality, professional feel.</li>
            <li>I have used them daily for almost a month so far.</li>
            <li>like I said before I don&#x27;t usually use a full face of</li>
            <li>The case is very sturdy, not cheap ,and the brushes are So very soft and there has been no shedding whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these brushes to every woman, especially those with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>This brush allowed for the creation of a sharp Cupid&#x27;s bow and did not retain much product after use.</li>
            <li>I only wish there was another big (blush) brush to complete my set -</li>
            <li>I bought these based on the great reviews I read and am not at all disappointed.</li>
            <li>I use them everyday and have no troubles, I have no fail out with these</li>
            <li>so much finer than my previous (cheaper) ones.  </li>
            <li>I find that, thanks to this brush, I use less product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and holds the brushes tightly.</li>
            <li>A large fluffy brush works well with translucent powder.  </li>
            <li>They will definitely become an everyday addition to my large brush collection.</li>
            <li>The only major change I would like to see made to this set would be to replace the flat foundation brush with a flat topped kabuki style.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, now I&#x27;m on a search for other brushes by Andre Lorent!</li>

            <li> Beautiful brushes and sooo soft.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Beautiful case soft brushes.</li>
            <li> They are truly the best brushes she has had in a LONG time.</li>
            <li> So soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this, it popped on my mind that it might be a good try.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty good.</li>
            <li> , we as well own a family business as well and our customers are a very important part of our success.</li>
            <li> for the price u pay; u will get ur money&#x27;s worth!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to choose new brushes for sometime and this set seemed a great choice.</li>
            <li> My set has already been washed a couple of times because of the creamed make up, liquid eyeliner experiment, and the cream glitter being used, and I can tell you that they return to perfect condition after they are dry.</li>
            <li> These brushes are clean, soft, precise, and with the beautiful case- they&#x27;re protected!</li>
            <li> I love the softness of the brush as well as how easily and</li>
            <li> I love the way it glides eyeshadow on so easily.</li>
            <li> She said they were nice and soft and she really loved the case.</li>
            <li> Each different makeup brush applied the powders, eye shadows, and lip products smoothly and beautifully!  </li>
            <li> : This is one of my favorites because it make such precise and perfect lines.</li>
            <li> They are super good and super cute.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this company and Emily - who so kindly emailed me and got my feedback.</li>
            <li> These are really nice brushes,  so soft and a fair price point.</li>
            <li> They are also very easy  to clean.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are very soft and seem to be great quality-for 20.00 it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>

            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been using cream/gel eyeliner for a while because without the perfect brush your perfectly made up eye can turn into a hot mess at the very end.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and exceeded my expectations, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> (the second largest one is perfect for applying foundation, the little slant brush blends eyeliner perfectly)</li>
            <li> These are a great set of makeup brushes for those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> importantly, my makeup looks like it was done by a competent woman and not a manic three-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I received my brushes I was pleasantly surprised to be emailed by Emily, the co-founder, to check on how happy I was with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality and so soft.</li>
            <li> Great for the beginner or professional make-up artist.  </li>

            <li> I love how each brush is so light I feel like when applying my makeup</li>

            <li> but so far they are great brushes.</li>
            <li> I love them they are beautiful and super soft even on your skin.</li>

            <li> They make my makeup application so easy..</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;any odors from brush set or strong leather smell from case.  </li>
            <li> so nice soft &amp; nicely shaped.</li>
            <li> The brushes are all perfectly soft, the weight feels good in your hands, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like they will break apart like the many sets I have tried before.</li>
            <li> A strong chemical type of smell.</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely the softest and most quality make up brushes I own.</li>
            <li> but I did not find it to be particularly strong with the set I got at all</li>
            <li> There is a strong smell from the case</li>
            <li> This was a great deal and I great price, Skip the expensive ones and try these for sure!</li>
            <li> Knowing that they are made by hand makes them even more special.</li>

            <li> I purchased this primarily for the powder brush.  </li>
            <li> I also just had a laser procedure done and was worried about the brushes being to harsh on my face - they were perfect!</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> They spread evenly and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Having the travel case has really come in handy, and has kept the bristles from getting damaged on trips when I need to pack them to come with.</li>
            <li> What a bargain for such a great product.</li>
            <li> The hairs are securely placed on the handle and the brushes move across your face like silk.</li>
            <li> I especially liked the liner brush as it made a nice straight (narrow) line when I applied eyeliner under the lash line.</li>
            <li> The customer service was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The quality is great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and come in a good array of shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li> A great product at a reasonable price and delivery was really fast.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by how gorgeous this set is.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really soft and work really good.</li>
            <li> Overall excellent purchase and definitely replaced my old estee lauder brush for good!</li>
            <li> Also, company emailed me a few times to see how I liked them and to tell me a bit about them - very nice to see a company that takes pride in their merchandise.  </li>
            <li> This set is what I would consider a high end quality set, I really love these brushes!</li>
            <li> The are packaged in a very nice case that I expect to last for years.  </li>

            <li> This is the perfect little set of brushes that meets every need when traveling!</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are very soft and the sizes are perfect for light, daily make up</li>
            <li> The case is very well made and makes traveling with the brushes very easy.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite brushes!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft, they work great, and they&#x27;re priced just right.</li>
            <li> I love that they are Vegan and cruelty free, which leaves them smelling crisp and clean, no trace of a chemical odor.</li>
            <li> They look really nice, are so soft, and work well!!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous packaging, super soft and luxurious brushes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved these brushes, they are super soft.</li>
            <li> They are super soft, have a good grip.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very convenient &amp; the travel case is extremely cute and nice, very high quality.</li>
            <li> Not only are these brushes amazing, so is the company!</li>
            <li> Once washed, they return to their original shape and texture.</li>
            <li> Original item.</li>
            <li> Just look closely at the photos and make sure you understand exactly the size of the brushes you are getting to ensure your satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> smooth and soft brush love it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got the leather case and brushes in the mail and was able to see in person that it was exactly as I hoped.</li>
            <li> They do shed the first couple of times you wash them (but I expect that from most of my brushes).</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> The Foundation Brush worked best for me to apply concealer, I&#x27;m not a fan of small Foundation brushes for face make-up applications.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft and I love that they came in a handy case which is very convenient!</li>
            <li> I have been wishing to own a new make up brush set</li>
            <li> (hi, it might be time to clean things)</li>
            <li> These are great personal touches rarely seen these days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, but not so soft that it doesn&#x27;t hold its shape, making it ideal for any liner or brow gel application that requires precision.</li>
            <li> Second, they arrived in an awesome case which was unexpected.</li>
            <li> I found that the Andre Lorent professional makeup brush set gives you the best of both worlds – affordable (local retail prices) with high-end quality!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to clean them yet</li>
            <li> The brush are super soft, feel nice on skin so far so good.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and durable(: I love them!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that the bristles on the brush are beyond soft!</li>
            <li> Nice, soft brushes, quality set!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re soft and love the case too!</li>
            <li> : I actually have a great blush brush right now</li>
            <li> and they sent me an entirely new one very quickly and said I could keep the original, which means I got 2 sets of these fabulous brushes!</li>
            <li> The products arrived quickly, and so far I have been very pleased with the brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very well made and very smooth.</li>
            <li> I particularly enjoyed the large powder blush</li>
            <li> These brushes rock!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re all just the right size and shape that I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Right on!</li>
            <li> The days of scrounging in the makeup bag for the right brush are over!</li>
            <li> Cruelty free and high end brushes at this price it can&#x27;t be beat!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are a little smelly first out of the plastic, but let them air out for a day or two and they are great!  </li>
            <li> I cannot speak on the longevity of these brushes yet because I just received them, but I love them so much that I wanted to post a review right away!</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive so these super soft brushes felt so good on my eyes!</li>
            <li> The quality is outstanding and soooo very soft!!</li>
            <li> set really gives you the bare essentials to achieve a great look.</li>
            <li> the brushes are great basic brushes and I highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li> They are so gentle on your face, its amazing that they aren&#x27;t made out of real hair!</li>
            <li> I saw an ad on Facebook (yes, really) for an amazing deal featured on Amazon for this exact Andrew Lorent Pro Makeup Brush Set.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t leave streaks and they are good for powdered products such as bronzer and eye shadows too.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and so nice</li>
            <li> I really wish each brush had written on it what it is used for like most brushes are</li>
            <li> They are really soft and the box is nice.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft.</li>
            <li> , I received my set two days ago and I am pleasantly surprised by how nice the set looks in the leather case.  </li>
            <li> case is sweet also</li>
            <li> Nice fully brushes and in person, they are soft and feel luxurious to the touch.</li>
            <li> I received today and am so far loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants professional quality makeup brushes without the professional price tag, what a great value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really thinking of buying more to give away as gifts.</li>
            <li> They are simply gorgeous, and especially with the case they come in.</li>
            <li> Not the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever felt, but they are soft and feel nice against the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Loving every bit of this set:) I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It would be nice to see the brushes marked also with &#x27;foundation&#x27; &#x27;powder&#x27; &#x27;eyeshadow&#x27; etc</li>
            <li> Now I will start practicing more with my cream eyeliner, so I am very excited!&lt;br</li>
            <li> i would absolutely get more products from them.</li>
            <li> While they didn&#x27;t smell like sweet succulent flowers, they also did not smell like a landfill.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft, have no fall out, and wash nicely.</li>
            <li> The thing that really put these over the top for me is the case.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and container is convenient, so far so good, I&#x27;ve been able to use the brushes to apply makeup with ease</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really been enjoying using the brushes.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, sturdy case, plenty of room for extra brushes!</li>
            <li> However, Andre Lorent has gone above and beyond to cover every detail of this gorgeous set.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> To top it off, the co-founder of Andre Lorent is extremely responsive to questions about the product – he helped answer some of my initial questions about caring for the brushes, and how best to clean them.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and was pleasently surprised by the quality for the price!!!</li>
            <li> but I did tell her that I loved the way they look, that they feel super soft, and the container to put them in was pretty.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful, professional quality, super soft.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy your product, easy to buy, n fast.</li>
            <li> Easy to go case and all the brushes you really need!</li>
            <li> They apply the makeup evenly and the eyeliner brush does such a clean line - it&#x27;s even better than my favorite Clinique one.</li>
            <li> Pretty strong chemical smell upon opening the package</li>
            <li> They did smell strong at first</li>
            <li> Love the brushes they are very soft and work amazing, up opening they did have a new brush odor</li>
            <li> I am kind of a brush junkie, I own many different brushes from different companies.</li>
            <li> Great vegan, cruelty-free alternative to other high-quality make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes and they are thick, cannot beat the price, would buy again and the container is very cute too!</li>
            <li> I just love my new make-up brushes!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my new makeup brushes and the case they came in makes travel with my makeup a breeze!  </li>
            <li> &amp; I look forward to trying out new products from this line! :)</li>
            <li> My husband picked them out for me on a whim, and he&#x27;s lucky the worked out.</li>
            <li> The length of the wooden part of the brushes could be a tid bit longer but overall, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> , I just wouldn&#x27;t expect it to happen so quickly.</li>
            <li> so I can super glue it on.</li>
            <li> They are a tiny bit short but a great set for trave!</li>
            <li> The brushes were delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> it is super convenient.</li>
            <li> These brushes shipped quickly and exceeded my expectations of the product.  </li>
            <li> Super soft and apply my bare minerals makeup beautifully.</li>
            <li> The case they come in is super study too.</li>
            <li> Which is why I&#x27;m hoping they release more brushes to buy individually as needed :)</li>
            <li> BUT I was quickly contacted about sending a replacement and received that today.</li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I have purchased more expensive brushes, because I thought it was the best route to go....</li>
            <li> quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I purchased a set of MAC makeup brushes for more than double the price of these and these seem to be a much better quality.</li>
            <li> Thank you Emily  for your quick response on my question regarding a use description for each brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a result, I go through makeup brushes relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> This was shipped quickly and when I opened it...</li>
            <li> I had bought a MAC foundation brush but quickly found out that I could not keep dropping $35 on brushes.  </li>
            <li> quick ship, just as described.  </li>
            <li> And third, after receiving them, one of the founders of the company wrote me to check and make sure everything was good on my end, very classy move.</li>
            <li> I do love the colors of the brushes, very classy!</li>
            <li> my all time favorite brushes high end are it cosmetics brushes the originals and lowend</li>
            <li> The packaging is also very pretty.  </li>
            <li> The case&#x27;s snaps even close with a solid &amp;#34;thunk.&amp;#34; Very, very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The handles are smooth and comfortable to hold and have good weight: these are not cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li> The case is very pretty and the brushes work well for their intended use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The company is very interested in customer satisfaction and truly aims to please.  </li>
            <li> Blends my makeup very well and feel better than most professional brushes.</li>
            <li> But wow these brushes are so soft and they come with the most effective brow brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Mary Kay rep and loved their brushes that came in their kit, but so far I really am enjoying these brushes a little bit better.  </li>
            <li> These are my new favorite brushes.</li>
            <li> My new favorite tools</li>
            <li> I wanted to try all of them right away, so I did full makeup for a dinner party we had tonight.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and super soft brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and pretty dense and they came in a really nice case.</li>
            <li> The handles are very ergonomic and easy to hold as well.</li>
            <li> When it arrived and I opened the snapped shut case, I loved that the five brushes looked exactly as they present.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and I enjoyed using them this morning.</li>
            <li> :) It is very soft to the skin when applied to it.</li>
            <li> I got these for the $1 special, so I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The case is so pretty!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really pretty looking, too!</li>
            <li> Lost my first set!</li>
            <li> Love them thus far!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more of their products!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them so far!</li>
            <li> If there are more types developed, I would buy again!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality makeup brush, buy these!!!</li>
            <li> I also love the white container is comes in which makes it so easy for me to travel</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and I love the way they apply my  makeup.</li>
            <li> I cannot express how much I love these super soft brushes.</li>
            <li> Love the case, brushes are super soft, yet durable.</li>
            <li> The case is great for traveling and closes tightly.</li>
            <li> The brushes are extremely soft and the craftsmanship very detailed.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a fine product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would&#x27;ve preferred black if available but in person the white and copper brown look very beautiful.</li>
            <li> I am going to look closer at your website to see if you sell any more types of brushes or any other products I made need because I just love buying from a seller who is true to their product.  </li>
            <li> And they come in a great little storage case.</li>
            <li> This is a great little kit of brushes.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup lover; I tread high and low for great products at reasonable and/or affordable prices!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re such an amazing price too.</li>
            <li> They came in a sleek case that&#x27;s great for traveling and everyday storage.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are made very well, and are quite comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> It feels great on face and catches power quite firmly.</li>
            <li> This seller goes above and beyond and also has an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> but I would have liked a brush one size larger!!</li>
            <li> This is my concern.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the quality is good, but it does not apply well as I expected .</li>
            <li> Better than I expected:)</li>
            <li> These brushes are top notch professional brushes.  </li>
            <li> While I enjoy make up, I&#x27;m not as creative as my teen, who, of course, wanted to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; these immediately.</li>
            <li> Not only they look so nice</li>
            <li> I have never had such nice makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li> I love the brushes and how soft they are.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the product so far.</li>
            <li> I not only love the color, but they feel extremely smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> Considering I spent $12.95 at CVS for just a foundation brush, this set seemed like a good price.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a nice set for the price.</li>
            <li> Hairs are soft love</li>
            <li> They have a nice white holding case .</li>
            <li> Not my kind of brushes, low quality, I got them on sale for $1 so</li>
            <li> My brushes came earlier than expected and arrived in great shape!</li>
            <li> I bought this set to augment and replace a Borghese set that was more than 20 years old.</li>
            <li> so soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> To me that is a rare quality in business today</li>
            <li> I love these brushes because they are so soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I used all of the brushes before posting my review, but I can honestly say this product was worth it after using only 2 of them.</li>
            <li> It  makes for a great gift for a young woman starting to wear makeup or someone who is makeup savvy.</li>
            <li> I honestly bought the entire set just for the eyebrow brush</li>
            <li> The only brush I would have liked to have seen in the kit</li>
            <li> I used the smudging brush, but it would be nice to have that one extra brush.</li>
            <li> The one I&#x27;ve used most so far is the eyeshadow brush.  </li>
            <li> but it works so much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes is supurb, no bristles falling out, etc., and I love the case they came in (which could be used for so many other things besides housing the brushes).  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal for me as I can put one of my other brushes in the awesome</li>
            <li> Yes, they did have a smell at first, but this went away quickly.</li>
            <li> I have several sets of high end, big name brush sets and these can and should be ranked with the best.</li>
            <li> I typically prefer to set my foundation with a kabuki brush rather than a long-handled powder brush, but it handled my NARS Light Reflecting Loose Setting Powder marvelously.</li>
            <li> I have paid more for a single brush than this set and these are far better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it to fill in my brows as well as create sharp winged liner, and was delighted at its versatility.</li>
            <li> Received right on time.</li>
            <li> She responded right away.  </li>
            <li> This set is just what I was looking for, all the right size brushs that I need in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> In my search for the right brushes I have spent&lt;br</li>
            <li> Order them right now.</li>
            <li> - it blended my corrector right in without washing it away.</li>
            <li> However, amazon made things right an honored the coupon price</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, I love the fact that is handmade and all natural!!!</li>
            <li> Loved tge brushes not only for the price but works well and feels super soft on each and every use</li>
            <li> the, bristles are also very soft and they glide easily.</li>
            <li> As for brushes, they are very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are smooth and feel like high quality.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and full and very useful shapes and sizes</li>
            <li> They are soft, well made and clean with ease!  </li>
            <li> They keep up great with Mac and other high end brushes.</li>
            <li> These seem to be very nice brushes .. so far no shedding, but haven&#x27;t had them long.  </li>

            <li> Small business like this one deserve great recognition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and it&#x27;s actually quite cute!  </li>
            <li> They feel very light and soft on the skin, they clean up well, and so far I&#x27;ve had zero reactions to the brushes.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to use as demo tools with a new makeup kit, and I ended up keeping them for myself and picking up another cheap set.</li>
            <li> This is a company that makes a fantastic product, is proud to make them, and stands behind them every step of the way.  </li>
            <li> The small angled brush works great with cream eyeshadow to get it exactly where you want it, even if your using the cream eyeshadow for eyeliner.</li>
            <li> plus shipping was super fast (2 days)</li>
            <li> Love the soft brush gentle on your skin .</li>

            <li> EVEN THE CASE IS GOOD QUALITY, STURDY AND WELL MADE, TIGHT BRASS SNAPS THAT CLOSE THE CASE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the big brushes as of now and they are very good quality, very soft and haven&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> The shipping came very fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear make up very much.</li>

            <li> This is a great set of brushes, they&#x27;re so soft and the bristles don&#x27;t shed as quickly as other brushes I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older (50s), my skin has become more sensitive to make ups, brushes, etc.  </li>

            <li> didn&#x27;t experience the smell others were talking about when I first opened.</li>
            <li> First you maybe experience some stiffness but one or two uses</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This set is my first makeup brush set</li>
            <li> I love the white color and it brightens up my otherwise-dark makeup table.</li>
            <li> thanks you too!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> , that I am probably going to be ordering more in the future for my sister-in-law&#x27;s and girlfriends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be honest I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person</li>
            <li> For instance I went many years with only one kitchen knife, one pan, and one cast iron dutch oven to cook meals.</li>
            <li> only okay at putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Overall, i&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> These brushes are definately the basic, essential ones that every lady should own!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushed because I was looking for a set that had a better container because I travel full-time and wanted something that was durable and that the brushes would not fall out of.  </li>
            <li> Very high-quality product !</li>
            <li> They are soft and apply smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li> and it picks up the color and deposits very well!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set!!</li>
            <li> We are both interested in supporting your family business.</li>
            <li> Would most definitely recommend these brushes and buy from them again.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying make up brushes</li>
            <li> The bristles feel soft and comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li> I love the neutral color of the brushes and handles are white with stamped name of product.</li>
            <li> second favorite brush is, without question, the angled brush.</li>
            <li> High recommend these brushes!!</li>
            <li> They are exceptionally soft and do a fantastic job of picking up powders and blending.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the opportunity to try your brushes!</li>
            <li> I have a feeling I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Some of my high end brushes!!</li>
            <li> Will definately try more from this line in the future!</li>
            <li> The white case that the brushes arrived in is just lovely.</li>
            <li> and I love the foundation brush especially</li>
            <li> I really like the case they came in also!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how soft they are and how they apply the makeup with a precise definition.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit overpowering at first, but the email from the Co founder said to air them out a couple days and the smell will go away.</li>
            <li> So pretty.</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I have been looking for.  </li>
            <li> I washed before first use.</li>
            <li> I received my elegant make up brushes last week and just had to write a review!  </li>
            <li> I love the set combination, exactly what I use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these brushes to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend :-)</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves these brushes!</li>
            <li> The round container is a good idea if you have to take them  on a trip.</li>
            <li> They are so soft!!!!  </li>
            <li> Love the brushes have used all but two of the brushes so far They are very soft</li>
            <li> these brushes are very soft and light, very well made.</li>
            <li> I agree with the hundreds of other reviewers; these brushes are amazingly soft and nice!</li>
            <li> I hope these last a while because these are by far my favorite set of makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> The eye shadow brush was much too small/short and the blush brush was very large.  </li>
            <li> I honestly thought it too good to be true; but nonetheless, I have never had a bad experience ordering from Amazon, so I gave it a go.</li>
            <li> I will never again buy any other kind of brushes.</li>
            <li> and I definitely was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the strong plastic smell when I got the package, although I believe it was mostly from the white container (not the brushes) and dissipated quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the bulk and the color - white looks good</li>
            <li> No fly away hairs falling out of them, they hold powder nicely and I love the carrying case.</li>
            <li> The brushes are made very, very well and feel absolutely luscious.</li>
            <li> Super soft brush set!</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes!</li>
            <li> super soft!</li>
            <li> They are super soft, sturdy, and affordable!</li>
            <li> Plus, they&#x27;re super soft!</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li> Every girl needs her brushes and these are soft, practical and special.</li>
            <li> Every girl needs her brushes and these are soft, practical and special.</li>
            <li> Last but not least this brush helps achieve an even color (especially when using intense colors) - I don&#x27;t usually use lip brushes, I prefer to use the lipstick straight up, but one of my favorite lipsticks is running low so this is the perfect tool to use even the last piece of that beautiful color and keep my money in my pocket for a little longer before I have to hit the Chanel counter again :)</li>
            <li> but they are super soft and pick up product very well!</li>
            <li> The cute little white leather carrying case is the real bonus to this set, it is so adorable!</li>
            <li> I AM POSITIVE</li>
            <li> I am no professional when it comes to makeup, but these are way better quality than the Sonia kashuk brushes I was using before.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much !</li>
            <li> I am not professional in doing makeup but now after received this brushes, I am trying to learn more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased a few products from this company &amp; their service is always so professional &amp; they always make sure you&#x27;re 100% satisfied..</li>
            <li> The case is super cute wish the case was black</li>
            <li> They are very soft and makes putting on my makeup much easier!!</li>
            <li> They are very well made and super soft!</li>
            <li> and I found that they were right along the lines of what I normally use (</li>
            <li> However, the brush holder is very nice and large enough to put other brushes in there.</li>
            <li> They are super soft though and do not shed at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> The shipping is pretty fast and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Was surprised by how quickly it shipped.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft on your face.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and do not shed.  </li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and are well made.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and the bristles do not fall out.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are shaped in such a way that it was easy to apply my eye shadow.</li>
            <li> She likes the versatility of being able to use liquid or dry foundation.</li>
            <li> Feel good on my face and hoepfully will last a long time</li>
            <li> Though Its smell lil&#x27; strong so I must left the case</li>
            <li> out\\&quot; but aside from when I first opened the case there isn&#x27;t any strong smell after the initial opening so that was better than expected.</li>
            <li> The brushed arrived very fast and came in a really nice white leather cylinder case.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m learning to love every single one.</li>
            <li> I would certainly buy from this company again at this price point.</li>
            <li> The large brush is comparable to their kabuki...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my fault that their coupon code wasn&#x27;t set to limit at a certain number of uses.</li>
            <li> I have and use a lot of different brushes, but these are my new favorite.</li>
            <li> The brushes are lightweight but very durable and the case is compact yet strong enough to protect the brushes.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping also verry soft brushes</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft and pick up product very well.</li>
            <li> Super soft yet very durable.</li>
            <li> it is very dense and super soft.</li>
            <li> Great application, easy to wash and fluff back to shape when dry!</li>
            <li> Soft enough to be pleasant on the skin, and enough &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; to evenly and thoroughly apply a sweep across eyelids or cheeks.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Leather box is also very high quality.</li>
            <li> The brush case is very high end, quality and sturdy.</li>
            <li> The carrying case while it is super cute and sturdy it only comes in white which doesn&#x27;t bother me much</li>
            <li> nice little case for them too</li>
            <li> So soft, no chemical smell, and holds up very well through washings!!</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and return to their softness after, unlike some brushes who get a little &#x27;wongo&#x27; after cleaning.  </li>
            <li> They are super soft and hold their shape and texture through application &amp; washing (which is more than I can say for some of my other brushes which I&#x27;ve paid $20+ for).</li>
            <li> The case is very pretty new, but as others have stated the white isn&#x27;t very practical and probably won&#x27;t look nice for long … but it is a quality case.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t found a brush that was smooth and gentle enough to blend in the corrector until tonight.</li>
            <li> All very well made including the case.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting these brushes!</li>
            <li> Very close to pro brushes</li>
            <li> She really likes them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use much eye makeup, so, it won&#x27;t affect me as much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the set so much</li>
            <li> Thank-you so much Andre Lorent,...</li>
            <li> Either way the brush is still usable and since I will be traveling overseas in a couple months I just left it off since it wont fit into my travel bag with the handle on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband wants it to keep his sunglasses in though.</li>
            <li> HAHA.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that I received an email from the company</li>
            <li> This company has really hit the nail on the head.</li>
            <li> these brushes are really great,and the case they came in to</li>
            <li> Very stylish!&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The buyer was very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I really like the fiber the brushes are made of and appreciate the 100% cruelty-free aspect.  </li>
            <li> after purchasing I received a letter straight from the co-founder.</li>
            <li> The seller was very responsive and kept me updated the whole time.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very substantial.</li>
            <li> But they look and feel very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> They feel like a hardy, quality product (you can definitely tell the difference between cheap quality brushes and these) and perform like it too.  </li>
            <li> And they keep their shape very well.  </li>
            <li> lot more than I spent on these....</li>
            <li> I seem to not use as much make up either...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend working with them and purchasing this make-up brush set!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use a lot of foundation.</li>
            <li> It was better than expected</li>
            <li> I really like the look of them too as well as the case they came in.</li>
            <li> However, the case smell really plastic when it comes in.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t show dirt as much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend these brushes to buyers!</li>
            <li> They are very dense brushes and transfer the pigment onto my skin without any getting lost in the bristles.</li>
            <li> Very please with this order</li>
            <li> would highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> Love that it has snaps on each side to keep the case closed.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these brushes, especially the powder brush and eye shadow brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a terrific value, and the customer service is fantastic from this company.</li>
            <li> So much that my friend, who was doing my makeup the day of my wedding recommended me to get them</li>
            <li> The deliver was very print</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be purchasing a larger set if one becomes available.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I got an email from the company saying the brushes may have a smell to them when first opening them (which is normal)</li>
            <li> They are better than I expected.</li>
            <li> She told me that the brushes didn&#x27;t work really well with her makeup.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced therefore, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> They applied the makeup equally and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> These are very well made and don&#x27;t leave bristles on your face while applying your makeup.</li>
            <li> The travel case they come in is also really nice!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> very durable just like the brushes,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very picky skin</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> They arrived fast and in tact.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend much time in front of the mirror to get ready for work every morning.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am really picky about my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I have a few different brands of foundation brushes and this one actually blends the best of all of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> case has become my brush holder at home and works really well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are an absolute MUST HAVE for any makeup lover like myself.</li>
            <li> they are made perfectly, very efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seller was kind enough to email me regarding possible smell of the glue they use.</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice and fluffy.</li>
            <li> (I am a freelance makeup artist and practice different looks on my own face multiple times a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I would have really liked to have a fluffy blending brush in the set.</li>
            <li> I only wish that they made more types of brushes as well, then my set would be complete.</li>
            <li> I have only used these once so far, but I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li> I gave it two star because at least the case is good.</li>
            <li> It felt personal to have that kind of attention as a consumer, especially when it comes to online shopping.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most brush make me blotchy, red, and itchy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also the 1st time I&#x27;m using a brush to apply my foundation (I&#x27;ve tried liquid &amp; mousse) and both go on very easily, using a lot less product.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and high quality.</li>
            <li> They are super soft, and they are high quality.</li>
            <li> Highest quality, beyond soft!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  </li>
            <li> The brushes are silky soft, easy to clean, and pick up and release makeup extremely well.</li>
            <li> when u first get them the inside of the case smells like new paint from the case</li>
            <li> I barely had to tap the brush into the well for the powder to quickly adhere to the ultra-soft bristles.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a strong new product smell, but if I did I was informed via personal email</li>
            <li> Other than that ok.</li>
            <li> But other than that,  I absolutely love these brushes.  </li>
            <li> Something you can&#x27;t see in the picture very well is the case is very sturdy and high quality as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how high quality these brushes are at such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;she said these brushes were perfect and very expensive,  her mouth dropped when i told her how much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brushes, and would highly recommend them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much out of it, but it seems to be made of high quality materials and is constructed well.</li>
            <li> Very well made, high quality.</li>
            <li> I also liked they were natural no added color less chemicals added.</li>
            <li> I bought this product while a $1 promotion and I was super surprised on how soft the brushes were.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I love more, the actual brushes, or the cute little case that the brushes come in.</li>
            <li> Having spent hundreds of dollars on makeup brushes through the years, from mid range brands to high end brushes that I have paid as much as 60 dollars APIECE for, I cannot rave enough about the quality and craftsmanship that I have experienced with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint or suggestion I would have is that while the case is very well made and quite attractive...</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft, and apply product very well!</li>
            <li> They are amazingly soft, and I look forward to really trying them out!</li>
            <li> soft, very well put together!  </li>
            <li> My first impression of the brushes are how soft they are and how well made they appear to be.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of makeup and I apply professionally as well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft I was amazed the first time I swept them across my face and didn&#x27;t feel like they were scratching my face.</li>
            <li> Soft, smartly angled and very well made.</li>
            <li> I also love the little case they come in, it&#x27;s very convienent for traveling.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a set of new brushes, pick these up!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this beautiful and high quality set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;FYI, after doing some research my routine for cleaning my brushes is to swirl them in a mixture of Burt&#x27;s Bees baby shampoo with warm water, rinse out, lay flat to dry.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too keen on was the color as white is super hard to keep clean, but it does look nice sitting on the counter in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A black holding case would have been better.</li>
            <li> She has been using sephora face brushes and bobbi brown eye brushes and she is looking for something less pricey, but this one is not so satisfying.</li>
            <li> a darker color (brown or black) may have been a better choice.</li>
            <li> I am one who is very itchy to the rough cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and the carrying case is so convenient to fit into a larger size purse.</li>
            <li> The brushes that tend to come with most make up seem so generic to me, I never achieve the same result I envision in my head.</li>
            <li> This particular set contains everything you need to get started with brushes...</li>
            <li> I will DEFINITELY be buying more from this line in the future.</li>
            <li> I have this set and mainly use the powder and foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> I am also particular of the brushes that I use.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup on a regular basis as a result, I go through makeup brushes relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> I only have an old cheap one to compare it to</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product unless you have a lot of extra time and super glue</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and I am still using them all of the time and they are holding up really well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very sturdy, and very soft.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft!</li>
            <li> Very soft!</li>
            <li> Very classy!</li>

            <li> loooooove these brushes they are so soft!!</li>
            <li> I love the little snaps</li>
            <li> They come with a cute little carry case too.</li>
            <li> They compared to other makeup brushes purchased from Bare Minerals, but more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I love the little case they came in.</li>
            <li> There were mentions of it having a strong smell in other reviews</li>
            <li> They are soft and gentle on the face.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and gentle when using.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and the lines are very well-defined.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and seem very well made.</li>
            <li> The brushes are silky soft and transfer the color really well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them much, but I&#x27;ve washed them a couple times and so far there is no shedding</li>
            <li> I night these a couple a weeks ago and so far I really like them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and apply make up very well.</li>
            <li> It is normal.</li>
            <li> But I wish it had a few more in between eye brushes.</li>
            <li> Not too big or too small and the handles are good quality too.</li>
            <li> I would pay more for that upgrade as the application from the foundation brush is too heavy and streaky.</li>
            <li> and I love the round case they come in.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using them everyday :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes, they have a smell when opening it but airing it out for a few days does the trick.</li>
            <li> If you do notice a plastic smell when you first open your set, air them out well and then wash with gentle baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate how each brush was wrapped in its own plastic sleeve, and then all the plastic-wrapped brushes were held together in an even larger plastic sleeve for extra protection.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re going to fall apart in a few weeks. :)</li>
            <li> For the regular price of these brushes it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> , I think I will order a few more for my girls as well.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are extremely soft, yet are stiff enough to allow for good coverage of product.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and high quality.</li>
            <li> Super soft and dense at the same time.</li>
            <li> The other benefit is that the container is large enough to fit some of my other favorite brushes.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and its quality is superior to other brushes that are way more expensive.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, case was very hard to open.</li>
            <li> My other brushes fit in the case too.  </li>
            <li> They are also the perfect size; not too big for traveling, however, they are also not too small for everyday use.</li>
            <li> First off, I was blown away with how high quality these brushes were, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Please keep in touch as your company adds new products.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s the smell of new brushes.</li>
            <li> I need new brushes, I saw these and decided to give them a shot.</li>
            <li> I (always) rinsed them in a mild shampoo water and let them air dry before use.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my old brushes which were never this soft and gentle to use.  </li>
            <li> really nice, soft brushes, give a delicate touch of blush, shadow, or bronzer.  </li>
            <li> I have only used them for a few days so far, but I really love them!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really compare these to other brushes, as this was my first real brush set, but about three days after receiving mine, I ordered a set for my mother.</li>

            <li> Soft brushes I like it!</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;ve used them for nearly 3 weeks and washing them 3 times)!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> For a truly professional application, you have to give these babies a whirl!  </li>
            <li> These brushes are SO SOFT!</li>
            <li> This is the first make-up brush set i have ever gotten and will be the last!</li>
            <li> This set of brushes are by far one of the nicest I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li> (she is an image consultant and makeup professional), and so I did!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a regular girl who does her own makeup everyday, so I can&#x27;t tell you how they work from a professional point of view.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and well made!</li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li> I always buy brushes at Sephora or a similar store when I need them, but always wished I had a higher quality set.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how soft these brushes are!  </li>
            <li> So soft!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in applying with these brushes rather than applicators, fingers, or other utensils of choice.  </li>
            <li> I let the maker of this product know that I really felt that the blush brush Should be included, but they argued that the powder brush could also be used for blush, but I simply think the powder brush is too large as my cheekbones are not very narrow.</li>
            <li> Anybody who has tried countless makeup brushes knows how frustrating it can be to find the RIGHT kind.</li>
            <li> First of all, they are soft, but  just enough to where they don&#x27;t lose the makeup before it touches your face.</li>
            <li> the other three are nothing special.  </li>
            <li> They are very natural and soft.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter even noticed how soft they are and stole one of the brushes that she rubs on her face continually while watching TV!</li>
            <li> Super soft on my skin and don&#x27;t have bristled falling off into my face like many other brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I especially like the flat foundation brush, because it&#x27;s a little more dense than my current flat one and smooths out my foundation better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the eyeshadow brush was going to be large enough, but I used it this morning</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to force the brush to get only in certain areas of my face</li>
            <li> Since the time for it finally came, I decided to splurge a little on a better and uniform set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are very high quality and will definitely last a while!  </li>
            <li> I needed to replace an old large brush (for pressed powder and blush) and for the same price as 1 brush at Ulta or MAC I ordered this complete set.  </li>
            <li> I do wish is was a darker color but appreciate the asthetics of clean white, but I know it won&#x27;t last long being around that much makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of the brushes upon arrival was very minimal and went away quickly.</li>
            <li> (although I am careful to make sure the bristles are smoothed out when they are wet.)</li>
            <li> They are not soaking up my CC cream as the natural was.</li>
            <li> The brushes are SO soft, the bristles feel like angel wings on my face as I apply powder.</li>
            <li> It should be aired out before they seal it up and ship it.</li>
            <li> I kept reading about how soft the brushes were and that there were no&lt;</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft and apply my makeup well.</li>
            <li> It is so soft.</li>
            <li> It offers any person who intends to buy a brush.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been a week since l have been using these brushes but l like them so far</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and no shedding</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they are synthetic, they feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> I am just starting to learn makeup techniques, and these brushes are working really well for me.</li>
            <li> These brushes are incredibly soft and well made.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and apply makeup so evenly.</li>
            <li> However, I was actually really surprised at the quality of this set.</li>
            <li> They are so soft on your face, as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They felt so soft on the skin that I couldn&#x27;t wait to use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since receiving them a couple of days ago, I have reached for them every time I applied makeup</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft.</li>

            <li> These are luxuriously soft brushes.</li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes blend well and stand up against my old high-end set.</li>
            <li> Although not made with a natural hair fiber, you wouldn&#x27;t know it.  </li>
            <li> So dense and really soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised my brushes were even in there.</li>
            <li> the case smells like leather and the brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not washed them yet, but so far no shedding.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and durable.</li>
            <li> They are truly professional quality.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and compact for traveling.</li>
            <li> They are dense but not too dense and incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a day, but I already don&#x27;t smell it as much.</li>
            <li> and they are really soft.</li>
            <li> They are some of my favorites so far.</li>

            <li> They look really professional too abd</li>
            <li> Bought this product online through Amazon as a gift for my 13 year old niece.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft...</li>
            <li> They are all soft.</li>
            <li> The hair remains puffy and soft after wash.</li>
            <li> Soft is an understatement on how these feel.</li>
            <li> They are amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> Soft, luxurious bristles.</li>
            <li> The high-end makeup brushes are very expense, and the local retail brushes are lower quality.  </li>
            <li> set is reasonably priced (especially for 5 brushes and a case...</li>
            <li> Not only did I get a STEAL of a DEAL with this makeup brush set, but it is absolutely everything it promised it would be.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and well made.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the  Andre Lorent 5-Piece professional brush set in December 2014, but I just got around to using them this month.</li>
            <li> These brushes are hand made and are so soft.  </li>
            <li> They are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> but I just aired them out for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are incredibly soft - their bristles retain their shape and softness even after washing.</li>
            <li> I would assume a makeup brush case would not receive as much attention as the actual product.</li>
            <li> It is a quality set which presents as classy.  </li>
            <li> The high-end makeup brushes are very expense, and the local retail brushes are lower quality.</li>
            <li> Has a professional feel and ease to take with you when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Soft and holds the powder well.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li> They are soft and do the job well</li>
            <li> They are so soft.  </li>
            <li> So soft and dense.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really soft and they haven&#x27;t shed this far.</li>
            <li> incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> They are gentle on my skin, no bristles left behind, nice and flexible.  </li>
            <li> It is compact enough to fit in a makeup bag if needed or large enough to throw in some other makeup essentials and go.</li>
            <li> Case is great and is big enough to hold a few of my other brushes as well.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these brushes, they are incredibly soft and work as any other high end brushes without breaking the bank!</li>
            <li> and they cancelled my order because they didn&#x27;t mean to let so many people use it.</li>
            <li> Other than that I paid for the fast shipping and they were here in two days, which was very convinient because my wedding was the week after that</li>
            <li> I leave it open and filled with other brushes I have also.</li>
            <li> but so far I love them and would recommend them to the serious makeup guru.</li>
            <li> Item toxic:  Very heavy case and smells like formaldehyde (a common ingredient in China&#x27;s glued products) and is shown to cause cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller:  Great and completely refunded without putting me through the hassle of returning.</li>
            <li> They have a slight chemical smell, but it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of buying brushes online without being able to see the quality first.</li>
            <li> I had to use a knife to open the white case when if first arrived because that thing is childproof like</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t too hard or too soft, and I can apply my lipstick with it easily.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t come with brush use/cleaning instructions, but I just clean them the same way I do all my other brushes.</li>
            <li> amazing, I actually wrote a small suggestion that as long as these are like professional - there should be attached some note which brush is to what....guess what</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for a personal set.</li>
            <li> I have different sets of makeup brushes from inexpensive to high end.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and the carry-case (though I agree with other buyers, should NOT be white), is durable enough to place in your suitcase for travel, which was my main purpose for getting these brushes.</li>
            <li> The case is fantastic as well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: a year and a half later</li>
            <li> me know that there may be a slight smell to the brushes and to air them out first but that that was normal.</li>
            <li> They are very soft - a couple of the ones I use for eyes are too soft; I wish they had a little more firmness and less &amp;#34;give&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I can see myself using these for a long time as they really hold up well to every day use.</li>
            <li> only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the white handle came off the large brush after 1 week of use.  </li>
            <li> Having worked behind the camera for over 35 years, and using every brush out there, these are easily comparable!  </li>
            <li> The only reason they don&#x27;t get a 5 star rating is that the handle on the blending brush was loose right out of the package.</li>
            <li> They set a new standard after DECADES of brush use!  </li>
            <li> but it does give you dirtier than an actual new case look.</li>
            <li> and I look forward to seeing what new products they will be coming out with in the future!</li>
            <li> a makeup artist I am constantly trying new brushes.</li>
            <li> Smell kinda strange when you first open them</li>
            <li> I like the brush handles are thick and study, makes it easy to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried at first when my order was cancelled without notifying me but amazon came through as always!</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of brushes for typical make-up application.  </li>
            <li> And the case is large enough that I can fit a few other brushes in too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft enough to not irritate the eczema flareups I occasionally get on my eyelids, dense enough to really pack on the color, and is small enough to work on detailed sections of the lid.</li>
            <li> I was a little more concerned with the blush brush because I&#x27;m used to my old blush brush being round and full.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> generally use MAC brushes with some store bought brushes too.</li>
            <li> I can imagine the stains I&#x27;ll have to deal with in the near future.</li>
            <li> They are so soft, but still manage to properly and evenly distribute make up.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used the one for blush or powder and it worked well.  </li>
            <li> only drawback to these brushes is that the case is white, I really wish they&#x27;d make the case in different colors.</li>
            <li> They are truly for everyone, but I can definitely see a professional makeup artist using these.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is that I wish the eye shadow brush was soft and fuller.</li>
            <li> I use them with my Bare Minerals and the powder</li>
            <li> bristles on these brushes are solid but soft.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the case and removing the individual coverings, I was wowed by how soft the brushes were.</li>
            <li> They have such a high-quality, professional feel.</li>
            <li> I have used them daily for almost a month so far.</li>
            <li> like I said before I don&#x27;t usually use a full face of</li>
            <li> The case is very sturdy, not cheap ,and the brushes are So very soft and there has been no shedding whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these brushes to every woman, especially those with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This brush allowed for the creation of a sharp Cupid&#x27;s bow and did not retain much product after use.</li>
            <li> I only wish there was another big (blush) brush to complete my set -</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the great reviews I read and am not at all disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday and have no troubles, I have no fail out with these</li>
            <li> so much finer than my previous (cheaper) ones.  </li>
            <li> I find that, thanks to this brush, I use less product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and holds the brushes tightly.</li>
            <li> A large fluffy brush works well with translucent powder.  </li>
            <li> They will definitely become an everyday addition to my large brush collection.</li>
            <li> The only major change I would like to see made to this set would be to replace the flat foundation brush with a flat topped kabuki style.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, now I&#x27;m on a search for other brushes by Andre Lorent!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s probably because 1) small, short hairs and tightly held together, so not as fluffy and 2) just more sensitive skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I would have also liked a thin, firm flat brush for blush and bronzer.</li>
            <li> I will look for other brushes made by Andre Lorent to expand and complete my brush collection.</li>
            <li> The only problem I see long term is the case is white.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to women who wear makeup every day and need a long lasting set of brushes!</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again, but I think these will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> but it could get dirty very easily.</li>
            <li> only reason I&#x27;m ranking the flat foundation brush last is because it&#x27;s my personal preference to apply foundation with a sponge to avoid kicking up any dry patches on my eczema-prone skin.</li>
            <li> this product is very different from any other high quality and extreme softness</li>
            <li> No more fumbling around looking for my brushes, saves much needed time.  </li>
            <li> Arent too long or short.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the handle on the big brush was loose when I pulled it out of the container they shipped it in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but stiff enough to properly apply eyeshadow even to the corner of your eyes.  </li>
            <li> After informing the company of the trouble with the powder brush, they sent me a new set.</li>
            <li> That way they last you a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> 5 brush set has every brush she will need and should last her a very long time,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are soooooo soft and are not super dense</li>
            <li> Before she could only use dry.</li>
            <li> I spent several days looking through brushes and while Shany was a close runner-up in terms of price and ratings, the smaller brush sets didn&#x27;t seem to include the essentials.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft, yet firm enough to hold the product for application.  </li>
            <li> My mom likes it so far, the only thing she wishes small brushes to be sold separately (she has no use for big ones)</li>
            <li> Lipstick brush is not very soft.</li>
            <li> The Powder/Blush Brush worked well for applying loose powder foundation and/or blush, as I prefer to use the larger brushes for my foundation applications.</li>
            <li> It is big enough to add some of my other brushes too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with them shedding like other brushes I have used in the past and they are lasting much longer than other more expensive brushes that I have used.  </li>
            <li> I have been using natural brushes for a while but studying up on them a little bit I decide to give a shot to the synthetic ones.</li>
            <li> For me though, the blush brush a little too soft for shaping.</li>
            <li> It allows the liner to be smudged and blended without tugging at the delicate eyelid area - it makes for a very controlled application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brushes were smaller then I expected, hairs falling out of some of them.</li>
            <li> and since I&#x27;m a perfectionist it would take me a REALLY LONG time for me to do but</li>
            <li> well it still takes me a long time</li>
            <li> I can tell these will hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> have them a long time.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and do not apply powders too heavily.  </li>
            <li> For a long time I was all about the MAC brushes, then sigma.</li>
            <li> long they will hold up.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional makeup artist  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking really really long term though.  </li>
            <li> I, also, really support and appreciate small business!</li>
            <li> The case us big enough for other brushes and other makeup pencils (eyeliner, lip liner, or eye brow pencils).</li>
            <li> I wear makeup on a regular basis, mostly due to the nature of my job.  </li>
            <li> I immediately took out my other &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brushes and could tell the difference instantly!</li>
            <li> Use baby shampoo (not much) rinse thoroughly and dry flat.</li>
            <li> but I left the container open for a few days just as the now said and the smell went away.</li>
            <li> They are so soft &amp; the little hairs don&#x27;t shed unlike other brushes I purchased..</li>
            <li> Also the apply an even coat every single time.</li>
            <li> One of my big aversions to actually wearing make up is that I feel like I have such a hard time applying it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are still incredibly soft and fluffy!</li>
            <li> The first version I purchased was broken</li>
            <li> and I had been needing a brush to apply loose powder, so</li>
            <li> (yes, I timed myself once) applying powder foundation, eyebrow definer, blusher and loose powder.</li>
            <li> These brushes definitely rival my previous set from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I basically paid for one and a half brushes that I actually use.</li>
            <li> These are definitely higher quality than your typical drugstore brush, but are considerably less expensive than high end brands.</li>
            <li> The case is white so will quickly get dirty.</li>
            <li> Wish the medium one was a little bit larger for blush and contouring.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brush is a little smaller than I like and the blush brush a little larger, but I can&#x27;t fault the product for that.</li>
            <li> I like how soft the bristles are and how after use they don&#x27;t fall apart or become hard and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> However after 30 min it seemed like the paint partially disappear from 2 items.</li>
            <li> what i expected.</li>
            <li> The cover is fancy looking and thicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> I end up not really using it at all and use the powder brush for everything.  </li>
            <li> The reason for not giving 5 stars is they do have a smell to them, almost a wet paint/ chemical smell.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to purchase a few brushes of various qualities before I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so I expected it to need an \\&quot;airing</li>
            <li> They feel luxurious on my face like I spent a lot of money on them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already cleaned them and there was absolutely no shedding either.</li>
            <li> My old round brush sometimes applied the blush unevenly and makeup didn&#x27;t look great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stiff enough to place the liner well without tugging at my lids.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, upon opening the brushed, you should let them air out for a few hours, I let my brushes air out for 24 hours before use.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the eyeshadow brush is too big for smudging liner but too small to actually apply eyeshadow</li>
            <li> The brushes were so soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it happen with lots of other brushes</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was warned about a finishing smell (other reviews described it as plastic smell) that will go away after 2 days or airing the brushes.</li>
            <li> Other brand brushes were oversized for me.  </li>
            <li> I usually have problems with my blush and powder brush flattening or having stray fibers but these brushes kept their shape after multiple uses.  </li>
            <li> I like that they don&#x27;t cake up with makeup like my other brushes do.</li>
            <li> like my other ones are.</li>
            <li> I can pop off one end and leave the other on the counter to hold all of the brushes like a cup or close the up for storing.</li>
            <li> Hope the seller will have it again so other ladies can get it.</li>
            <li> and I usually use Sigma brushes, which are much more expensive!).</li>
            <li> Hairs don&#x27;t fall off like other brushes do.</li>
            <li> and I can hold other brushes in with it.</li>
            <li> so i dont knownmuch about other brands</li>
            <li> They do have a weird smell at first</li>
            <li> They work extremely well with my makeup.</li>
            <li> recommend for other buyers,&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> Very rough, the eye brakes scratched my eye lids.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes is a little loose where the wood meets the metal...</li>
            <li> They are fluffy and not rough like a lot of the brushes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 4-5 sets of brushes from local beauty supply stores and drug stores.</li>
            <li> I used it with dark eye shadow for smokey eyes.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how they arrived though I believe it was the fault of the carrier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about 9 months and they see average use (3-5x/week).</li>
            <li> So far I have not experienced any shedding.</li>
            <li> They smelled pretty horrible right out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> This makeup brushes leave all my previous sets so far behind.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you, Hands Down, you will not&lt;br /&gt;find</li>
            <li> Undortunately, I lost two of the brushes with all the stress of the wedding, people going up and down...</li>
            <li> Will not consider using any other!</li>
            <li> Extremely well made!  </li>
            <li> each brush slightly differert in softness -</li>
            <li> There was a slight smell on those brushes (the reason why i put 4 star instead of 5) when i took them out of the plastic packaging but</li>
            <li> The brushes have a slight smell to them.</li>
            <li> the smell fades and the brushes had a slight smell to them.</li>
            <li> I do wish the case was in a darker color, maybe gray or black</li>
            <li> I would recommend the brushes, they are well made, they do have a slight odor but that disapated in one day sitting out.</li>
            <li> I received an email stating they may have a slight odor upon opening them</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, can compared to other expensive brands.</li>
            <li> There is a slight &amp;#34;artificial&amp;#34; smell to it, but that goes away with a little airing out.</li>
            <li> I usually use a corrector for under my eyes and in few other dark spot I have.</li>
            <li> I am no makeup expert, not by a long shot, but I &#x27;put on my face&#x27; about once a week, or at least a few times a month.</li>
            <li> They did feel a little prickly on my eyelid</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how little I paid for these.</li>
            <li> IT also came in the coolest little carrying case.</li>
            <li> Although I do wish the eyeshadow brush was a little wider and denser</li>
            <li> Absolutely no shedding!!!  </li>
            <li> Because they actually reached out to me for my feedback whether it be good or bad (and not in an overbearing or annoying manner).</li>
            <li> and after a few minutes i&#x27;m not noticing them anymore.</li>
            <li> I have had the brush set for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> They took me a few days to get used to them, but I would never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few days now</li>
            <li> but it goes away in a few hours,</li>
            <li> I let them air out for a few days before using them today, and the smell was gone.  </li>
            <li> The case is heavy duty, too.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a bit on a heavy side and wil add weight to your carry on.</li>
            <li> I started using these brushes a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> case is not a cheap case either.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours, descriptions were emailed to me.  </li>
            <li> My only.complaint is when you first open the case it smells sooo bad!</li>
            <li> Exactly what i am looking for in a brush because i hate brush that are rough to the skin.</li>
            <li> They smell a little!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing because I had high hopes due to all the glowing reviews here.  </li>
            <li> The brushes did not apply the makeup like the brushes I had in the past.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> No offense, but usually &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The eye shadow brush is a bit on the small side.</li>
            <li> like I usually do)</li>
            <li> I thought the shorter than usual handle would be a problem</li>
            <li> like I have with brushes in the past.</li>
            <li> From what I understand, they are a small company.  </li>
            <li> brushes are very soft at the tips and sturdy at the base, which is hard to find in brushes, and a guarantee that they will hold up for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I hate cheap brushes on my eyelids, because they often feel scratchy and irritating.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set because it&#x27;s so hard to find vegan makeup brushes or cruelty-free makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> The lip brush is so hard that it feels like there is glue on it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a bit too hard for the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> cant complaint</li>
            <li> The packaging is also very convenient, as I now use the base of the container to store the brushes on my vanity.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s a small, family-owned business - go small business owners!!</li>
            <li> No hidden disappointment here!  </li>
            <li> only to be hugely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are very hard</li>
            <li> I am not left with little hairs on my face after applying blush or powder (which is quite annoying!)  </li>
            <li> smaller brushes are, at the moment, worthless to me.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than cleaning lip product that has managed to climb its way up the bristles of a sparse, flimsy brush, after it flopped around, bristles splayed everywhere, during the streaky application.</li>
            <li> I wish there were additional brushes I could buy, but alas...</li>
            <li> I have had this set for about 8 months now and nothing has broken.</li>
            <li> They are seriously the softest brushes I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these brushes were not good for me.  </li>
            <li> YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS LITTLE SET OF BRUSHES.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , just hate that I spent a fortune on one brush which squashed any saving on this buy!!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just one of those people that can&#x27;t stand having crappy or mediocre tools.</li>
            <li> They have all failed me in one way or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are attached firmly to the base of the brush, so no bristles falling out when your appling your makeup.  </li>
            <li> Meh, not impressed.</li>
            <li> The materials are expensive compared to the price and these brushes come with a box to help you keep them in place.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was skeptical about the quality of buying brushes online.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat that price!!!  </li>
            <li> , I almost don&#x27;t want to use them and get them dirty.</li>
            <li> I was afraid there would be a smell, but mine arrived without any smell.</li>
            <li> I got this set on a crazy deal (they were $1).</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the bristles getting bent or dirty.</li>
            <li> Could not get past the awful smell of the leather holder.</li>
            <li> but they were very faint</li>

            <li> These brushes are wonderful.  Great quality and nice application.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, case was very hard to open.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift so they have not been used yet.  However, they are beautiful!  I am so pleased with the quality of the brushes.  The are packaged in a very nice case that I expect to last for years.  I can&#x27;t wait for her to enjoy these beautiful brushes.</li>
            <li> Really nice set and very pretty. All very well made including the case. I&#x27;m really pleased!</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for a week now so I thought it is relevant to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience the smell others were talking about when I first opened. I have been using natural brushes for a while but studying up on them a little bit I decide to give a shot to the synthetic ones. I haven&#x27;t regretted it. They are not soaking up my CC cream as the natural was. First you maybe experience some stiffness but one or two uses and they soften up. It is normal. They won&#x27;t leave streaks and they are good for powdered products such as bronzer and eye shadows too. They pick up enough product and they deliver all of it on your skin and don&#x27;t trap it at all.&lt;br /&gt;Overall five starts and definitely recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;And one important thing for us girls: they look so cute and the case comes handy when I am traveling.</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful!  They are so soft and so nice, I almost don&#x27;t want to use them and get them dirty. I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, feels great. and makeup goes on AWESOME... love this!  Bought two!</li>
            <li> These brushes are such a great purchase! They&#x27;re so soft and you can get flawless coverage.  The case is perfect too it closes secure with snaps and can stand on the counter keeping your brushes displayed while you work your art.  I really think the best part is they donate some of the proceeds to breast cancer research, the brushes are handmade, vegan, and eco-friendly.  I got a personalized email from the co-founder for ordering which is always a nice treat in this day in age.  I highly recommend getting these brushes!</li>
            <li> just one word...PERFECT.....&lt;br /&gt;service amazing, I actually wrote a small suggestion that as long as these are like professional - there should be attached some note which brush is to what....guess what, they replied and I should be getting one soon.&lt;br /&gt;ONCE AGAIN...PERFECT!</li>
            <li> The company has great customer service and really appreciates your feedback.  Unfortunately, these brushes were not good for me.  The eye shadow brush was much too small/short and the blush brush was very large.  The brushes did not apply the makeup like the brushes I had in the past.  I ended up returning them without a hassle!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Highly recommended, I love the fact that is handmade and all natural!!! It&#x27;s a most have!</li>
            <li> I love my brushes!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good for the price!</li>
            <li> These are a great set of makeup brushes for those with sensitive skin.  They feel very light and soft on the skin, they clean up well, and so far I&#x27;ve had zero reactions to the brushes.  I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> I like the case and these are the size brushes that I wanted.</li>
            <li> Beautiful container and good brushes. I do love the colors of the brushes, very classy! Great value for an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product design and material.</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes!!  The case that they come in is beautiful !!!  Great Customer Service!!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for the money. I&#x27;m happy with them!</li>
            <li> Brushes were smaller then I expected, hairs falling out of some of them. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend paying this much for a 5 set piece of brushes, but great traveling case? Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again....</li>
            <li> I bought these for my girlfriend as a present for Valentine&#x27;s day. She loved them! She said they were nice and soft and she really loved the case. The case can actually fit more brushes or other items as well.</li>
            <li> Super gift! Every girl needs her brushes and these are soft, practical and special. And they don&#x27;t shed! I particularly love the case they come in to keep all the brushes handy and looking glamorous on your dressing table. Will buy more for presents!</li>
            <li> I just love my new make-up brushes! They are soft, work perfectly and the container they came in is just fabulous. Knowing that they are made by hand makes them even more special.</li>
            <li> The brushes are of obvious great quality. They don&#x27;t shed and the application of make up is perfect with a lightness that isn&#x27;t overbearing. I do have to say that I am very happy with buying these. My husband picked them out for me on a whim, and he&#x27;s lucky the worked out. One thing - the white case. The case is perfect, but white? It seems they were going after the &amp;#34;hip Apple&amp;#34; thing, but it&#x27;s not working for makeup</li>
            <li> This was given as a birthday gift, and she was very pleased.Thanks for a fine product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;VERY NICE BRUSHES. LADIES I AM POSITIVE YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS LITTLE SET OF BRUSHES.&lt;br /&gt; EVEN THE CASE IS GOOD QUALITY, STURDY AND WELL MADE, TIGHT BRASS SNAPS THAT CLOSE THE CASE. LOOKS LIKE REAL WHITE LEATHER.....A VERY, VERY NICE SET.....&lt;br /&gt;SINCERELY, I AM SOOOO PLEASED WITH MY BRUSHES&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;pj</li>
            <li> Theses are absolutely the best brushes. I have several sets of high end, big name brush sets and these can and should be ranked with the best. They are very natural and soft. The bristles do not shed and are very easy to wash up. Once washed, they return to their original shape and texture. They make for a flawless application of makeup.</li>
            <li> These are fine... But I wish it had a few more in between eye brushes.</li>
            <li> Good looking set. Lipstick brush is not very soft.</li>
            <li> Very good customer service! The brushes are also excellent as well as the container they came in. I&#x27;ve only used the big brushes as of now and they are very good quality, very soft and haven&#x27;t shed. Overall excellent purchase and definitely replaced my old estee lauder brush for good!</li>
            <li> I love them they are beautiful and super soft even on your skin. I am one who is very itchy to the rough cheap brushes. These are amazing! All my friends were in love with them the price is not bad at all. The case is super cute wish the case was black but I cant complain they like hi end brushes</li>
            <li> This makeup brushes leave all my previous sets so far behind. They set a new standard after DECADES of brush use!  You will love them!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great!  Exactly what I was looking for. Great price also!  The case is so pretty!</li>
            <li> These were great! Exactly what I was hoping for. Would def recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Good. One of the brushes is a little loose where the wood meets the metal... Other than that ok.</li>
            <li> This set is my first makeup brush set and I love it. The brushes are so soft and the carrying case is so convenient to fit into a larger size purse.</li>
            <li> i bought them for my wife and she loves them. Delivery was fast and the product is great quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes rock!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re all just the right size and shape that I was looking for! They&#x27;re really pretty looking, too! And honestly the case is a bonus because these are so great. They&#x27;re soft and durable(: I love them!</li>
            <li> The brushes are SO soft, the bristles feel like angel wings on my face as I apply powder. I love the white color and it brightens up my otherwise-dark makeup table. Fantastic product and an incredible value!</li>
            <li> What a great deal for such a beautiful set of brushes in a very handy case! Love these handmade, quality brushes! No shedding and makeup goes on flawlessly! I thank you and my makeup thanks you too!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these brushes! They&#x27;re very soft!</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are good for the money. I love the case. I really wish each brush had written on it what it is used for like most brushes are</li>
            <li> They are really soft and the box is nice. Definitely recommend this set!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!!!  They are gentle on my skin, no bristles left behind, nice and flexible.  The case is compact and keeps me organized!</li>
            <li> Brushes are great! Feel good on my face and hoepfully will last a long time</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived in a timely manner and I was very pleased with the product. I would definitely recommend purchasing this set. They are very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> Loved the set but I would have liked a brush one size larger!!</li>
            <li> Great product and super duper fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I put it in the warm water to clean it up. However after 30 min it seemed like the paint partially disappear from 2 items. This is my concern.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the quality is good, but it does not apply well as I expected . I won&#x27;t suggest , better buy known brand.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love all of the brushes, but bought it just for the pretty case. It&#x27;s perfect for travel and looks nice holding my brushes at home too.</li>
            <li> Very close to pro brushes</li>
            <li> Love it!  They feel awesome!</li>
            <li> Just gorgeous!! Nice feel to the brushes and the case is very nice too. The length of the wooden part of the brushes could be a tid bit longer but overall, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great: sooooo soft!  They work really well, are of a good quality, they look great and the carrying case is quite chic.  Five stars for sure.</li>
            <li> Amazing set of brushes!!</li>
            <li> Just love it :) Though Its smell lil&#x27; strong so I must left the case opened 2 weeks before use.</li>
            <li> Brush set works great. Nice and soft. The price is good.  My other brushes fit in the case too.  Will recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> The brush are super soft, feel nice on skin so far so good.</li>
            <li> Original item. As described.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and am happy with my purchase! They are soft and gentle on the face. Great quality for what you pay for and the delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> Loved the product and the brushes are so soft and work very good .</li>
            <li> Could not get past the awful smell of the leather holder. It should be aired out before they seal it up and ship it. I had to air it out 2 weeks before I could give as a gift. the odor gave me a headache. Brushes look great, however I could not use for myself because of the allergic reaction to whatever they cured the leather with.</li>
            <li> On time delivery!  Great look! Outstanding brushes!  Buy them!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Super soft brush set! Will not consider using any other! Excellent customer service team! Each of the brushes spread makeup evenly and flawlessly! Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I needed to replace an old large brush (for pressed powder and blush) and for the same price as 1 brush at Ulta or MAC I ordered this complete set.  The brushes seem to be of similar quality to my MAC brushes and I am very happy with this purchase.  They have the added bonus of being vegan for those who don&#x27;t want animal hair.  I also received two polite follow up emails regarding satisfaction with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Really great product!!! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy your product, easy to buy, n fast.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous set of brushes I received as a Xmas gift. They are super soft and high quality. I have only used them for a few days so far, but I really love them!</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my fiancee as a gift and she has found them to be amazing and loves them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
            <li> loooooove these brushes they are so soft!!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes! Nice set</li>
            <li> My daughter is an esthetician and I bought these for her for Christmas. She really likes them.</li>
            <li> It´s what i expected. Very good quality, I´m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> When I came across the Amazon reviews for this product. I kept reading about how soft the brushes were and that there were no&lt;br /&gt;reports of hair falling out from washing or applying.  I was still not convinced because each person&#x27;s experience with a product is different.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I received my set two days ago and I am pleasantly surprised by how nice the set looks in the leather case.  I did not notice&lt;br /&gt;any odors from brush set or strong leather smell from case.  I washed the brushes and used them yesterday. The powder brush is very&lt;br /&gt;soft and applies the loose powder nicely.  I was a little more concerned with the blush brush because I&#x27;m used to my old blush brush being round and full.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I LOVE this blush brush! The blush goes on nicely and evenly! My old round brush sometimes applied the blush unevenly and makeup didn&#x27;t look great.&lt;br /&gt;I also used the lip brush, which worked nicely, too! The only brush that I used that might take getting use to are the eye brushes. They did feel a little prickly on my eyelid but it&#x27;s probably because 1) small, short hairs and tightly held together, so not as fluffy and 2) just more sensitive skin around my eyes.  I don&#x27;t really use much eye makeup, so, it won&#x27;t affect me as much.&lt;br /&gt;In general, I am very happy and satisfied with this brush set, so much so, that I am probably going to be ordering more in the future for my sister-in-law&#x27;s and girlfriends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good quality brush set and at a very reasonable price! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The quality is outstanding and soooo very soft!!</li>
            <li> I like the set so much</li>
            <li> Great set great price.....and ️the maker actually cares if we are satisfied with them.....five stars</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter. Gorgeous case. Great brushes</li>
            <li> Ladies, your gonna Love Andre Lorent&#x27;s Makeup Pro brush set.. It comes with 5 different sized brushes in a Beautiful carrying case, the case will come in handy when your traveling, you will never loose you brushes :) The Brushes are durable and soft to the touch they feel so smooth when applying your makeup on your face.  Thank-you so much Andre Lorent,... I&#x27;am loving these Brushes..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in return for my Honest and Unbiased Review....</li>
            <li> Very soft! Better than I expected:)</li>
            <li> Nice brush set and container, delivered timely too.</li>
            <li> Seller was kind enough to email me regarding possible smell of the glue they use. The brushes are very soft and I enjoyed using them this morning.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes I have ever used!  I am not left with little hairs on my face after applying blush or powder (which is quite annoying!)  and my foundation application has never looked more smooth!  (which says a lot since I do not have flawless skin!).  I am so glad I found these brushes!</li>
            <li> High quality, soft brushes. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes I like it! The cover is fancy looking and thicker than I expected. The only issue I have is the bulk and the color - white looks good but it does give you dirtier than an actual new case look. I can imagine the stains I&#x27;ll have to deal with in the near future.</li>
            <li> Brush set is quality set, but there needs to be a separate blush brush. I would not have purchased the set had I realized I would end up at the Lancôme counter buying a blush brush. I let the maker of this product know that I really felt that the blush brush Should be included, but they argued that the powder brush could also be used for blush, but I simply think the powder brush is too large as my cheekbones are not very narrow. I use and like the brushes, just hate that I spent a fortune on one brush which squashed any saving on this buy!!</li>
            <li> I cannot speak on the longevity of these brushes yet because I just received them, but I love them so much that I wanted to post a review right away! I am no professional when it comes to makeup, but these are way better quality than the Sonia kashuk brushes I was using before. They are very soft and apply makeup flawlessly! The brushes use vegan materials and the quality seems great. Also, the seller emails to follow up and make sure you love them! Great customer service!</li>
            <li> Great Brushs. Wish the medium one was a little bit larger for blush and contouring. I end up not really using it at all and use the powder brush for everything.  They are super soft though and do not shed at all.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the white handle came off the large brush after 1 week of use.  It&#x27;s not a big deal I could just glue it back on, sometimes the glue just doesn&#x27;t hold and I&#x27;ve had it happen with lots of other brushes, I just wouldn&#x27;t expect it to happen so quickly. Either way the brush is still usable and since I will be traveling overseas in a couple months I just left it off since it wont fit into my travel bag with the handle on.&lt;br /&gt;The case is sweet also but I don&#x27;t use because it&#x27;s white...hello makeup. And it also doesn&#x27;t fit into my travel bag.  My husband wants it to keep his sunglasses in though. HAHA.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.  If your against animal cruelty and animal testing, then this is for you. They are listed as VEGAN!!!  I really like the fact that I received an email from the company lett me know that there may be a slight smell to the brushes and to air them out first but that that was normal. SO I was given a heads up instead of me asking them why they smeall.  OH and by the way- they DID NOT smell!  Great item, great product and will be buy these as gifts too.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Received right on time. Love the brushes they r so nice soft &amp; nicely shaped. My favorite part is the case, lol, it is so nice.</li>
            <li> These brushes are top notch professional brushes.  Super soft and dense at the same time. I had to get two sets cause I was so impressed with them. This company has really hit the nail on the head. I&#x27;ve used them various times in my youtube videos. This is a purchase you won&#x27;t regret! A++</li>
            <li> Great for painting...my face!!!</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC BRUSHES NICE CASE GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes!!! Good quality and beautiful case!</li>
            <li> Very nicely made. Super soft. Love them!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. No fly away hairs falling out of them, they hold powder nicely and I love the carrying case. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes so far! They&#x27;re so soft and apply my makeup well. The ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the handle on the big brush was loose when I pulled it out of the container they shipped it in. Now I&#x27;m waiting for it to come off so I can super glue it on.</li>
            <li> Great quality and super soft.  They are a tiny bit short but a great set for trave!</li>
            <li> Soft, great quality brushes!</li>
            <li> these brushes are really great,and the case they came in to</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft! I love the quality of them. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter loved the brushes and the excellent case as well</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes as a gift for my niece and she loved them. She says that these bushes are way better than any others she&#x27;s had.. And I can say she has a lot. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> To be honest I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person but I&#x27;m just one of those people that can&#x27;t stand having crappy or mediocre tools. I also don&#x27;t like having a lot of extraneous tools. For instance I went many years with only one kitchen knife, one pan, and one cast iron dutch oven to cook meals. I used my Gerber knife to cut bread and pare fruit. I&#x27;m a fantastic cook by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only okay at putting on makeup. I tried to get away with one brush but that didn&#x27;t fly. I got a bunch of different drugstore quality ones but ick. I found these and--damn, these are good brushes. Putting on makeup has always been a chore and since I&#x27;m a perfectionist it would take me a REALLY LONG time for me to do but now...well it still takes me a long time but now it&#x27;s because I get hypnotized by how nice these brushes feel, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, my makeup looks like it was done by a competent woman and not a manic three-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure someone with more experience will want more brushes (these days I have my trusty old santoku, a nakiri, a filleting, a paring, a serrated bread, and six beautiful steak knives) but for now, this was the perfect basic set for me to start off with. I&#x27;m so glad the set included an angled brush, that is one thing I would never have thought to buy or use on my own. It is so precise! I love precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve preferred black if available but in person the white and copper brown look very beautiful. I&#x27;ve come to appreciate the distinctive appearance of these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is spot on too. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, after doing some research my routine for cleaning my brushes is to swirl them in a mixture of Burt&#x27;s Bees baby shampoo with warm water, rinse out, lay flat to dry.</li>
            <li> Case and brushes were very nice quality.  Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> great product high quality</li>
            <li> soft and very nice packaging and I love the leather. simple beautiful. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying I am extremely impressed by these brushes. I bought them as a gift for mother, because her birthday is coming up and she had mentioned wanting makeup brushes. Last year I was given the Sigma Essentials brush set as a gift, which is currently around $178 here on Amazon, so I know what &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; brushes look and feel like. With that in mind, I&#x27;m also a broke@ss student, lol, so $178 wasn&#x27;t exactly in my budget. I spent several days looking through brushes and while Shany was a close runner-up in terms of price and ratings, the smaller brush sets didn&#x27;t seem to include the essentials. I chose this set because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This set really gives you the bare essentials to achieve a great look. You will use every brush in this set. Includes powder/blush brush, foundation brush, eyeshadow brush, lip color brush, and eyeliner brush. Perfect for the experienced makeup brush user or a novice.&lt;br /&gt;* Looked like great quality. Nice fully brushes and in person, they are soft and feel luxurious to the touch. Also, good size. Not too big or too small and the handles are good quality too. Love the white/bronze color combo. Very stylish!&lt;br /&gt;* The brush cup! Great for protecting your brushes on the go and also for holding them at home. The case is very attractive and well-made.&lt;br /&gt;* OMG, the price! Great value for the quality you get, esp. if you are on a budget. I would certainly buy from this company again at this price point.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just wonderful.. made very well.  The buyer was very helpful.  I had a question about how to care for them; cleaning.  She responded right away.  Use baby shampoo (not much) rinse thoroughly and dry flat.</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous! I agree with the hundreds of other reviewers; these brushes are amazingly soft and nice! I received today and am so far loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be updating my review after a couple months of using this product to see how it holds up.</li>
            <li> Seem like very nice brushes.  I just wasn&#x27;t impressed when the very first time I used the powder brush the handle came out of the metal piece that connects to the brush.  It&#x27;s fixable~</li>
            <li> The brushes are great.  They feel very soft on my face.</li>
            <li> These brushes are beautiful and well-made, and all at an excellent price point.  I&#x27;ve recommended them to several people already.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. I love the largest brush. It is so soft. I use it for my bronzer. Feels like silk on my skin. The next largest brush, I&#x27;ve been trying to use for blush - but it&#x27;s sort of stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller brushes are, at the moment, worthless to me. They do not work with me and my eyeshadow. Maybe I&#x27;m just a novice at nicer brushes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the brushes upon arrival was very minimal and went away quickly. The holder cup is nice as well.</li>
            <li> These arrived, and I was beyond pleased even before I used them. The case is sturdy, attractive and I can tell it will hold up over time. The brushes! WOW! They are perfect. Soft, smartly angled and very well made. While I enjoy make up, I&#x27;m not as creative as my teen, who, of course, wanted to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; these immediately. She&#x27;s done some really cool things with these and has been raving how awesome they are. (mind you, she already has a set of her own that I paid a lot more than these are listed for!!) The small angled brush works great with cream eyeshadow to get it exactly where you want it, even if your using the cream eyeshadow for eyeliner. My set has already been washed a couple of times because of the creamed make up, liquid eyeliner experiment, and the cream glitter being used, and I can tell you that they return to perfect condition after they are dry. (although I am careful to make sure the bristles are smoothed out when they are wet.) PERFECT gift for any gal, who would squeal with delight to get these beauties!!</li>
            <li> love these brushes and the case is a plus!! the brushes are great basic brushes and I highly recommend them!! good quality; sturdy handle (👍)..highly recommend!! for the price u pay; u will get ur money&#x27;s worth!! plus shipping was super fast (2 days)</li>
            <li> Very nice make up brush set in very cute container brushes are very soft love the lip brush . Easy smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Brushes are packaged nicely, washed them before usage and no fall out as of yet. Bristles are soft and gentle when using. As a makeup artist these brushes will be very useful.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m very happy with the brushes. It offers any person who intends to buy a brush. Good price.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it again if I had to.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes! They keep up great with Mac and other high end brushes. I use them everyday and have no troubles, I have no fail out with these and they are great with washing them also. The cute case it comes in helps with traveling also. This was a great deal and I great price, Skip the expensive ones and try these for sure! I got this on an amazon discount. I was not required to leave any kind of feedback but I loved these. there is also no shedding with these brush and they are very soft.  You don&#x27;t need to spend tuns of money on high end brushes, these are great</li>
            <li> After I received my brushes I was pleasantly surprised to be emailed by Emily, the co-founder, to check on how happy I was with my purchase. I loved that!  It was such a personable touch!  I hadn&#x27;t used the brushes yet but I did tell her that I loved the way they look, that they feel super soft, and the container to put them in was pretty.  I used the brushes yesterday and I LOVE them!!!!  They are so soft!!!!  They also applied my product wonderfully with great blending!  My eyes are sensitive so these super soft brushes felt so good on my eyes! So, thank you, Emily, for the great service you gave me and for the great brushes.  I am going to look closer at your website to see if you sell any more types of brushes or any other products I made need because I just love buying from a seller who is true to their product.  Right on!</li>
            <li> My mom likes it so far, the only thing she wishes small brushes to be sold separately (she has no use for big ones)</li>
            <li> Great product! These brushes are great quality and so soft. I liked them so much I bought another set for my mother-in-law</li>
            <li> Wife loved them excellent choice for gift!!  very satisfied</li>
            <li> What a bargain! Love this product and it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and a good price</li>
            <li> Luxurious brushes. I&#x27;m amazed at the quality.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these nice brushes. They&#x27;re soft and full and very useful shapes and sizes (the second largest one is perfect for applying foundation, the little slant brush blends eyeliner perfectly) --and the case is really nice too. Can&#x27;t believe how little I paid for these.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and exceeded my expectations, especially for the price. An excellent buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent, high quality brushes. The case they come is beautiful and well made. The fact that they are vegan and cruelty free is the icing on the cake . Looking forward to buying additional products in the future</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been a week since l have been using these brushes but l like them so far</li>
            <li> Wonderful brushes! Very soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li> Great product!  And container is perfect for traveling. each brush slightly differert in softness - Each perfect for different job</li>
            <li> Very soft. Good quality. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Use it every day.</li>
            <li> I just received my order of the makeup brush set and i love it :) It is very soft to the skin when applied to it. Exactly what i am looking for in a brush because i hate brush that are rough to the skin.I love the container. Color is white, so neat to look at. There was a slight smell on those brushes (the reason why i put 4 star instead of 5) when i took them out of the plastic packaging but its okay, the reason for it was explained in the email sent to me by the company. I checked a lot of makeup brush set online before i finally decided to buy this. Compared the prices and reviews. So far i don&#x27;t have regrets.Price is affordable. The quality of the brush is good. I hope it will last. And what i also like is that the co-founder of Andre Lorent emailed me to asked my feedback about their product. Giving it a personal touch. And i like it. Overall, i&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and the container holds them perfectly. Very excited to take on my trips glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> What great brushes! First of all, they are soft, but  just enough to where they don&#x27;t lose the makeup before it touches your face. They are so gentle on your face, its amazing that they aren&#x27;t made out of real hair! These brushes are definately the basic, essential ones that every lady should own! The case is so well made and makes a perfect storage for them. I would easily pay $40 for JUST the case alone!</li>
            <li> The shipping is pretty fast and packaged very well. When I bought this I was warned about a finishing smell (other reviews described it as plastic smell) that will go away after 2 days or airing the brushes. When i opened my brushes i was expecting the smell but they were very faint and after a few minutes i&#x27;m not noticing them anymore. So overall it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. If you&#x27;re reading reviews of this brushes and factoring that smell.. Don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most of this brush set, aside from the soft brushes, is how elegant they look and would be perfect to give as a gift and for travel. The leather case would protect the brushes during travel. I could even fit in 2 additional eye shadow brushes..but the set is enough for my makeup skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion this brush set is perfect for travel and giving as a gift. The brushes are soft and just perfect in my opinion. I purchased the brushes at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushed because I was looking for a set that had a better container because I travel full-time and wanted something that was durable and that the brushes would not fall out of.  What I didn&#x27;t expect was the quality.  They are extremely soft and the lines are very well-defined.  The other benefit is that the container is large enough to fit some of my other favorite brushes. Very high-quality product !</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes!!! Clean, sophisticated packaging. It applies color nicely and evenly on my face, no weird scent and the bristles are set in nicely. I love the angled brush the best, it&#x27;s firm and great for precision lining. Easy to go case and all the brushes you really need!</li>
            <li> They are soft and apply smooth and evenly. I&#x27;ve been using them for a couple weeks and I haven&#x27;t had any bristles fall out yet. The carrying case is durable and convenient as well.</li>
            <li> Extremely well made!  You will not be disappointed.  Excellent value.  Great for the beginner or professional make-up artist.  The case is a great added bonus as well.</li>
            <li> Item toxic:  Very heavy case and smells like formaldehyde (a common ingredient in China&#x27;s glued products) and is shown to cause cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller:  Great and completely refunded without putting me through the hassle of returning.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush set at a great price.</li>
            <li> The brushes were delivered quickly. Nice holding case. The case is white so will quickly get dirty. A black holding case would have been better. The brushes have a slight smell to them. I will have to wash them to see if the smell goes away. The brushes are soft and no shedding</li>
            <li> I wrote a review for these a while ago but it seems to have been deleted. :/ these are very nice brushes. The container it comes it is super convenient. The brushes are very soft and I am still using them all of the time and they are holding up really well.</li>
            <li> This is a great 5 piece brush set.  I really like the fiber the brushes are made of and appreciate the 100% cruelty-free aspect.  Each brush design holds makeup well which allows me to apply makeup evenly.  I also like the case, its good looking.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes, they are really well made and look beautiful. The case they come in is also really nice. It is compact enough to fit in a makeup bag if needed or large enough to throw in some other makeup essentials and go. I like how soft the bristles are and how after use they don&#x27;t fall apart or become hard and unmanageable. I can see myself using these for a long time as they really hold up well to every day use. I recommend this product to anyone who wants professional quality makeup brushes without the professional price tag, what a great value!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my new makeup brushes and the case they came in makes travel with my makeup a breeze!  I highly recommend these high-end brushes for every kind of makeup!!</li>
            <li> Anybody who has tried countless makeup brushes knows how frustrating it can be to find the RIGHT kind. I&#x27;m so happy that I took a chance with these. They are so soft, but still manage to properly and evenly distribute make up. I was scared that after washing the brushes they would lose their softness - but NOPE! Still wonderful (and I&#x27;ve used them for nearly 3 weeks and washing them 3 times)! I highly recommend this product, now I&#x27;m on a search for other brushes by Andre Lorent!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice and soft. They&#x27;re such an amazing price too. The carrying case is too cute! I didn&#x27;t think the eyeshadow brush was going to be large enough, but I used it this morning and it picks up the color and deposits very well! It&#x27;s a perfect size for my eye shape. I highly recommend this set!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are really great quality, and the case they come in is beautiful! I also love how compact the set is, making it very easy to travel with.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This set has a sleek look perfect size for traveling . Love the soft brush gentle on your skin .</li>
            <li> I used to be a Mary Kay rep and loved their brushes that came in their kit, but so far I really am enjoying these brushes a little bit better.  I do love the carrying/protective case that these brushes come in.  I do wish is was a darker color but appreciate the asthetics of clean white, but I know it won&#x27;t last long being around that much makeup. I have only used them once or twice but so far I love them and would recommend them to the serious makeup guru.</li>
            <li> These are great. Very soft.  They are in a lovely case.  They arrived in great condition.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time.  The brushes are very soft. So far I have only used the one for blush or powder and it worked well.  I think the others will also work well.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Not only they look so nice the, bristles are also very soft and they glide easily. I&#x27;m really thinking of buying more to give away as gifts.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these brushes, they are incredibly soft and work as any other high end brushes without breaking the bank! I definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> This set of brushes really impressed me! I have purchased at least 4-5 sets of brushes from local beauty supply stores and drug stores. They have all failed me in one way or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Andre Lorent set is SOLID! The brushes are all perfectly soft, the weight feels good in your hands, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like they will break apart like the many sets I have tried before. My makeup went on perfect with these today. IT also came in the coolest little carrying case. I figured it would just be for looks but its quality matches the brushes. I could see giving these to bridesmaids or as gifts for many occasions. I really am impressed. Way to go Andre Lorent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also after purchasing I received a letter straight from the co-founder. That is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I have never had such nice makeup brushes.  I can&#x27;t believe they are synthetic, they feel so soft.  I especially like the lip brush, it isn&#x27;t too hard or too soft, and I can apply my lipstick with it easily. I also enjoy the foundation brush, I have never used a foundation brush and found this made application easy and it went on smoothly.  I really love the case, my makeup brushes have always floated freely in my makeup bag and it&#x27;s so nice to have a case that can stand on my vanity and pack up easily!</li>
            <li> These brushes way exceeded my expectations when they arrived. They are simply gorgeous, and especially with the case they come in. I am no makeup expert, not by a long shot, but I &#x27;put on my face&#x27; about once a week, or at least a few times a month. One of my big aversions to actually wearing make up is that I feel like I have such a hard time applying it. The brushes that tend to come with most make up seem so generic to me, I never achieve the same result I envision in my head. These brushes just blew my mind. Soft enough to be pleasant on the skin, and enough &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; to evenly and thoroughly apply a sweep across eyelids or cheeks. The precision brushes are excellent as well. I love that they are Vegan and cruelty free, which leaves them smelling crisp and clean, no trace of a chemical odor. These brushes are clean, soft, precise, and with the beautiful case- they&#x27;re protected! Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!  They apply my makeup flawlessly!!  Everything I had hoped for and more!!</li>
            <li> I am just starting to learn makeup techniques, and these brushes are working really well for me. Great quality for the price!</li>
            <li> These brushes shipped quickly and exceeded my expectations of the product.  I have had the brush set for a few weeks now. Very nice quality soft brushes.  The packaging is also very pretty.  The case it came with is great for traveling.  I especially love the angle brush, perfect for applying eyeliner.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recieved the product very quickly. The seller was very responsive and kept me updated the whole time. I love the brushes and how soft they are. They disperse product evenly and feel great. The case was very cute I love the little snaps</li>
            <li> These brushes are incredibly soft and well made.  The case is very handy for travel or taking your brushes on any trip.  The only problem I see long term is the case is white.  The price is also great!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and apply makeup so evenly. I told my sister-in_law about them and she ordered a set. Please keep in touch as your company adds new products. We are both interested in supporting your family business.</li>
            <li> The shipping came very fast. I enjoyed the product so far. The brushes are soft, can compared to other expensive brands. Reasonable price. you should have it!</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price! This is the second set I bought. Lost my first set! Great for travel.</li>
            <li> Case is really nice and the brushes are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Very good makeup brush.</li>
            <li> I somehow managed to lose my blush brush in my own house (hi, it might be time to clean things) so I bought this as a replacement. I was very happy to discover the high quality of these vegan brushes. No offense, but usually &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; is short cut for &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; but these really are nice. Something you can&#x27;t see in the picture very well is the case is very sturdy and high quality as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting a second set of these for my sister-in-law as a gift.</li>
            <li> These brushes come in a cute container and are the perfect size for me. I not only love the color, but they feel extremely smooth on the skin. They apply product evenly and I am impressed with the quality. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> As many others have stated, the case this come in is just nice and does a good job keeping the brushes together. Hopefully this will help keep me more organized instead of having to sort through my bag for brushes. They are very soft. Not the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever felt, but they are soft and feel nice against the skin. The eyeshadow brush is a little smaller than I like and the blush brush a little larger, but I can&#x27;t fault the product for that. That is personal preference. These are definitely higher quality than your typical drugstore brush, but are considerably less expensive than high end brands. I think it&#x27;s a nice compromise if you want a quality brush without the price tag. Just look closely at the photos and make sure you understand exactly the size of the brushes you are getting to ensure your satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set because it&#x27;s so hard to find vegan makeup brushes or cruelty-free makeup brushes. Considering I spent $12.95 at CVS for just a foundation brush, this set seemed like a good price. However, I was actually really surprised at the quality of this set. The brushes are made very, very well and feel absolutely luscious. Apllication is excellent and smooth. I was expecting the travel case to be somewhat flimsy as most brush cases are, but this is actually more like hard-sided luggage. Very substantial. The case&#x27;s snaps even close with a solid &amp;#34;thunk.&amp;#34; Very, very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes and sooo soft.  I have yet to use them But they look and feel very sturdy.  Case is great and is big enough to hold a few of my other brushes as well.  Was surprised by how quickly it shipped.  Also, company emailed me a few times to see how I liked them and to tell me a bit about them - very nice to see a company that takes pride in their merchandise.  Would most definitely recommend these brushes and buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the softness of these brushes. The powder brush is perfect for blush or face powder. The eye shadow brush is a bit on the small side. It packed on color to the lid, but was not as effective for blending or contouring in the crease. The only major change I would like to see made to this set would be to replace the flat foundation brush with a flat topped kabuki style. I would pay more for that upgrade as the application from the foundation brush is too heavy and streaky. Overall this is a nice set for the price. I would almost give an extra star just for the case!</li>
            <li> Great product and great customer service.  Love them thus far!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the quick shipping and the brush container.  I use four of the five brushes daily,  This set contained all the essentials I needed.  The largest brush is a perfect size for my smaller face.  Other brand brushes were oversized for me.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the brush set. There was no smell to the brushes. They arrived very fast and do a very good job applying your makeup. I also liked they were natural no added color less chemicals added. Creditable</li>
            <li> I feel in love with these makeup brushes they are so soft and make my makeup look amazing!  These are very high quality and will definitely last a while!  The price is great too!</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes. I&#x27;ve never had brushes better than what you can get at Wal-Mart or Target.  I&#x27;m so glad I splurged on these! They took me a few days to get used to them, but I would never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went on a trip home this weekend &amp; got to use the awesome travel case &amp; kept them nice and undamaged.  It looks great on my counter!</li>
            <li> After I ordered the PRO Makeup brush set it arrived in my mail almost instantly.  They are extremely lovely brushes...so much finer than my previous (cheaper) ones.  The order did not include the &amp;#34;brush set guides&amp;#34; (that explain which brush is for what use).  I explained the problem to Andre Lorent&#x27;s co-founder, Ben Cummings, and again the guides were almost instantly in my hands. GREAT customer service, and a great set of makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> Great brushes at an even greater price!</li>
            <li> For $1 u can&#x27;t beat the price... Hairs are soft love this set</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast delivery. Nice to find a vegan product held to such high standards. These were a gift for my wife and she is very pleased with them. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This set is just what I was looking for, all the right size brushs that I need in my makeup bag. The quality is way better than my Aveno brushes that I have been using FOREVER! The fact this product is vegan means so much to me personally. The cute little white leather carrying case is the real bonus to this set, it is so adorable! I travel a ton so this case will be perfect for me when I go on the road. What really impressed me was the personal touch -  the cofounder sent me an email after I ordered to insure my satisfaction with his personal email addresss..WOW! You sure you don&#x27;t get customer service like like anymore these days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving every bit of this set:) I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and was pleasently surprised by the quality for the price!!! They feel like a hardy, quality product (you can definitely tell the difference between cheap quality brushes and these) and perform like it too.  They came in a sleek case that&#x27;s great for traveling and everyday storage.  I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this brush set when I was buying gitfts for my bridesmaids, it would&#x27;ve been perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few days now and I LOVE them. They are some of the softest brushes I have ever owned (and I go through a lot). They apply the makeup evenly and the eyeliner brush does such a clean line - it&#x27;s even better than my favorite Clinique one. The fact that they are vegan is even better. I can tell these will hold up for a long time. The case is great for traveling and closes tightly. This is such a good buy! Also, the customer service is amazing. I own other Andre Lorent products and they have always been awesome to buy from!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!  They are seriously the softest brushes I have ever used!  And they keep their shape very well.  I usually have problems with my blush and powder brush flattening or having stray fibers but these brushes kept their shape after multiple uses.  And not to mention the case they come with is great!  It&#x27;s very sturdy and it&#x27;s actually quite cute!  I would definitely recommend these brushes to every woman, especially those with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> These brushes are the softest makeup brushes I have ever used.  I didn&#x27;t lose any of the makeup when applying.  Each different makeup brush applied the powders, eye shadows, and lip products smoothly and beautifully!  I hope these last a while because these are by far my favorite set of makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>  Love the makeup brushes. The case is very nice and durable. The brushes are soft and feel great while using them.</li>
            <li> I chose these brushes because a friend told me about them, and I didn&#x27;t want to give up&lt;br /&gt;on finding truly excellent brushes. In my search for the right brushes I have spent&lt;br /&gt;a lot more than I spent on these.... and I can tell you, Hands Down, you will not&lt;br /&gt;find better brushes. I consider the brushes one of the most important part of good make-up application&lt;br /&gt;and these brushes are made properly. They all apply the make up FLAWLESSLY and you&lt;br /&gt;will have them a long time. I know they are Vegan and Ecofriendly... that&#x27;s great... but what&#x27;s also&lt;br /&gt;important is that they are obviously well made. If you take care of these brushes by keeping them&lt;br /&gt;clean, they will take care of you..... I promise. Order them right now. They are WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!!! They are made great and are so soft!!!  The carrier that comes with it is super cute I wouldn&#x27;t change anything!  :)</li>
            <li> The brushes are lightweight but very durable and the case is compact yet strong enough to protect the brushes. I will definitely be ordering more of their products!</li>
            <li> At first glance these brushes look VERY nice! They come with a cute little carry case too. They&#x27;re super soft on your face. I like that they don&#x27;t cake up with makeup like my other brushes do. I seem to not use as much make up either... I haven&#x27;t had any brushes lose hairs when I apply make up either.These are very nice brushes without a hefty price tag. This is definitely a great gift set. It would be nice to see the brushes marked also with &#x27;foundation&#x27; &#x27;powder&#x27; &#x27;eyeshadow&#x27; etc like my other ones are. If I gave this as a gift to a non makeup savy person they might not be able to tell what each brush is for. Very happy with these brushes though!</li>
            <li> Very nice case and great quality! Looks beautiful! Brushes are nice and fluffy. Hold make up well. Great gift for someone!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Super soft and apply my bare minerals makeup beautifully. Case is very cute and handy. Live it would defiantly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product, great quality! Very soft brushes and applys makeup great! Definitely will recommend! Awesome value and great packaging! A+</li>
            <li> Love the brushes have used all but two of the brushes so far They are very soft I could compare the foundation brush to my Sephora airbrush 55. These brushes are very convenient &amp; the travel case is extremely cute and nice, very high quality.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying make up brushes and I definitely was not disappointed!  They are truly amazing brushes!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! They are also the perfect size; not too big for traveling, however, they are also not too small for everyday use. The case is awesome as well!</li>
            <li> Just received these from amazon. I am very happy with the quality of these brushes, and love the beautiful case they came in.</li>
            <li> Great product. Brush applies makeup well and feels good on the skin. It&#x27;s nice that the brushes come in a travel case.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are soooo soft and very good quality!</li>
            <li> Good quality, smaller brushes excellent for precision.  Thank you for your attention to detail!!</li>
            <li> wonderful brushes  no hairs left on face  easy to clean</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping also verry soft brushes</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this make-up brush set.  The five brushes it includes are everything needed for my morning routine.  The case they came in is great for travelling and doubles as a brush holder when they are being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are made of high quality material and are incredibly soft and luxurious feeling.  These brushes definitely rival my previous set from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also impressed with the level of customer service I experienced post purchase. I received follow up emails from the co-founder of Andre Lorent to say thank you and ensure the purchasing process went smoothly.  These are great personal touches rarely seen these days.  I highly recommend working with them and purchasing this make-up brush set!</li>
            <li> ! am so glad to have a good quality set brushes for my own (my daughter always steals mine, but the case will keep them out if sight). The brushes are soft and do not apply powders too heavily.  Gor-geous!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and high quality. Comes with a nice selection and a cute case. Good price too.</li>
            <li> This brush set has the perfect collection of basic brushes. I like the brush handles are thick and study, makes it easy to apply makeup. The bristles feel soft and comfortable on my face. So far no shedding and they blend wonderfully. It comes with an great case to hold them in which fits perfectly in your purse or travel bag. Great price for such amazing quality! I love this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I got my brushes yesterday and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I love them! They are very soft. I wanted to try all of them right away, so I did full makeup for a dinner party we had tonight. Here are my thoughts on each one of the brushes:&lt;br /&gt;1. Foundation brush: I don&#x27;t really use a lot of foundation. I usually use a corrector for under my eyes and in few other dark spot I have. I hadn&#x27;t found a brush that was smooth and gentle enough to blend in the corrector until tonight. I am so glad I gave it a try (instead of using my fingers like I usually do) - it blended my corrector right in without washing it away. It was perfect for me! like I said before I don&#x27;t usually use a full face of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;2. Blush brush: I actually have a great blush brush right now and I had been needing a brush to apply loose powder, so I decided to turn this amazing brush into my official powder brush. Again, another super hit! Loved the even distribution without being too thick.&lt;br /&gt;3. Eye shadow brush: Who ever has enough eye shadow brushes? Not me... so I was super happy to add a new one to my collection. It works great. I used it with dark eye shadow for smokey eyes.&lt;br /&gt;4. Liner brush: This is one of my favorites because it make such precise and perfect lines. I hadn&#x27;t been using cream/gel eyeliner for a while because without the perfect brush your perfectly made up eye can turn into a hot mess at the very end. Now I will start practicing more with my cream eyeliner, so I am very excited!&lt;br /&gt;5. Lip brush: Last but not least this brush helps achieve an even color (especially when using intense colors) - I don&#x27;t usually use lip brushes, I prefer to use the lipstick straight up, but one of my favorite lipsticks is running low so this is the perfect tool to use even the last piece of that beautiful color and keep my money in my pocket for a little longer before I have to hit the Chanel counter again :)&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do not have one bad thing to say about this product. I am over themoon with my purchase and I will be buying more soon because I think they&#x27;d make the perfect gift for friends!</li>
            <li> Took advantage of the $1 deal I saw posted on facebook and so glad I did.  The brushed arrived very fast and came in a really nice white leather cylinder case.  Brushes were high quality and really soft. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> These brushes are simply perfect.  They come with a beautiful, white case...verrry cute and a great suprize.  I love the snaps on the side and it makes them perfect for travel.  The brushes themselfs are beyond top quality.  The bristles are attached firmly to the base of the brush, so no bristles falling out when your appling your makeup.  The handles are smooth and comfortable to hold and have good weight: these are not cheap brushes.  They are so soft on your face, as well.  Makeup goes on just the way it should; not the way it does with cheap brushes.  These are buy far the best brushes I have ever owned (and ive owned much more expensive ones). Customer service is beyond great, as well.  This is a company that makes a fantastic product, is proud to make them, and stands behind them every step of the way.  Do yourself a favor and get yourself a set....you wont regret it for one second.</li>
            <li> nice bottle, quality is good.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect and the case keeps them upright with easy open snaps on each side. I love the neutral color of the brushes and handles are white with stamped name of product. Very classy!</li>
            <li> I just received these today and had to rush to try them out.  Having spent hundreds of dollars on makeup brushes through the years, from mid range brands to high end brushes that I have paid as much as 60 dollars APIECE for, I cannot rave enough about the quality and craftsmanship that I have experienced with these brushes.  They are fantastic!  For a truly professional application, you have to give these babies a whirl!  I can&#x27;t wait to start adding more brushes from Andre Lorent.  Highly impressed with the quality, and the companie&#x27;s support of vegan products free of animal cruelty.  Bravo Andre Lorent!!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes. Extremely soft and well made, the carrying case is great too. The customer service was fantastic and at this price you should try them out. I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are SO SOFT! They apply product amazingly and I&#x27;ll definetally be getting more brushes by this company.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of the bristles. Great for sensitive skin. Super cute case. Perfect for a gift or to travel with.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!!!</li>
            <li> These come in a really cute case. The brushes are soft and come in a good array of shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this amazing chance Andre Lorent! I have been wishing to own a new make up brush set but you made it come true at a very friendly price and goes to a charitable organization. More power to your company! :)</li>
            <li> These great quality brushes and worth the money! The overall product was well made, I&#x27;ve found no shedding even after washing. I was afraid there would be a smell, but mine arrived without any smell. The case is perfect for traveling and can fit easily in your travel bags, or just hold your brushes on your vanity. This would make a great gift for someone who is starting out with makeup.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!</li>
            <li> They shipped on time, and the quality is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have to say, I was blown away by the quality of the brushes. When I washed them, they did not shed or lose their form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They felt so soft on the skin that I couldn&#x27;t wait to use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since receiving them a couple of days ago, I have reached for them every time I applied makeup (I am a freelance makeup artist and practice different looks on my own face multiple times a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was particularly impressed with the eyeshadow brush. It&#x27;s soft enough to not irritate the eczema flareups I occasionally get on my eyelids, dense enough to really pack on the color, and is small enough to work on detailed sections of the lid. It has replaced my MAC 239 as my favorite shader brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second favorite brush is, without question, the angled brush. I&#x27;ve tried using it to fill in my brows as well as create sharp winged liner, and was delighted at its versatility. It&#x27;s soft, but not so soft that it doesn&#x27;t hold its shape, making it ideal for any liner or brow gel application that requires precision. It allows the liner to be smudged and blended without tugging at the delicate eyelid area - it makes for a very controlled application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder brush comes in third here. I typically prefer to set my foundation with a kabuki brush rather than a long-handled powder brush, but it handled my NARS Light Reflecting Loose Setting Powder marvelously. I barely had to tap the brush into the well for the powder to quickly adhere to the ultra-soft bristles. I find that, thanks to this brush, I use less product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next pick is the lip brush. One of my biggest qualms when it comes to lip brushes is density. There is nothing worse than cleaning lip product that has managed to climb its way up the bristles of a sparse, flimsy brush, after it flopped around, bristles splayed everywhere, during the streaky application. This brush allowed for the creation of a sharp Cupid&#x27;s bow and did not retain much product after use. I was pleased with how well the brush kept its shape and firmness even after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m ranking the flat foundation brush last is because it&#x27;s my personal preference to apply foundation with a sponge to avoid kicking up any dry patches on my eczema-prone skin. I did, however, use this brush to apply and blend concealer around my nose and under my eyes. The brush blended both cream and liquid formulas flawlessly and left no marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am confident that, when it comes time for me to expand my kit, I will be repurchasing these brushes. They are beautiful, easy to clean, and simplify application. I have nothing but praise for this set!</li>
            <li> These brushes are AMAZING quality!  I own luxury brand brushes and i find myself reaching for these over my Goss brushes.  They are super soft and do not shed.  The case is lovely and looks great sitting on my vanity.  I want some more of these!!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic!!! No fall out!! Great application, easy to wash and fluff back to shape when dry! High recommend these brushes!!</li>
            <li> wonderful set of brushes, super soft and blends make up well. The travel case is quite convenient also... Very happy to have these brushes in my collection.</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality brushes. Love the case it came with.</li>
            <li> Loved tge brushes not only for the price but works well and feels super soft on each and every use</li>
            <li> It was better than expected</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are so soft and easy to use. They have a slight chemical smell, but it wears off quickly. Would definitely buy from this company again!</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft. I absolutely love them so far!</li>
            <li> These are gorgeously crafted brushes. They are dense, super soft and great at applying makeup flawlessly. Easily some of my favorites in my collection of brushes.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality! Super soft.</li>
            <li> I got these with an awesome promo code &amp; the brushes were delivered very fast. They have a nice white holding case . The case smells VERY bad I&#x27;m airing out in hope the smell fades and the brushes had a slight smell to them. I washed them and the smell went away. The brushes are soft and so far no shedding.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and are well made. Yes, they did have a smell at first, but this went away quickly. So far I have not experienced any shedding. They are amazing brushes for a really good price. I really like the look of them too as well as the case they came in. It is big enough to add some of my other brushes too. I can totally recommend these brushes. Quality and price are fantastic and their customor service is superb.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous packaging, super soft and luxurious brushes. The powder brush and the slanted brush are my favorites. The powder brush feels great against the skin and they washed well. The slanted brush is my preferred one for use with gel liners. It&#x27;s stiff enough to place the liner well without tugging at my lids.</li>
            <li> this product is very different from any other high quality and extreme softness</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! They are exceptionally soft and do a fantastic job of picking up powders and blending. I like the stiffness of the lip brush, which makes it easier to apply lip products than a softer brush would. My absolute favorite, however, is the angled brush, which is perfect for apply Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow pomade. I get a flawless, precise line every time. Thank you so much for the opportunity to try your brushes! I have a feeling I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic. So soft and easy to use. I love them. The round container is a good idea if you have to take them  on a trip. A great product at a reasonable price and delivery was really fast. I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I really like this brushes, and would highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to these brushes is that the case is white, I really wish they&#x27;d make the case in different colors. Next time my friends need brushes I&#x27;m going to recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Pretty strong chemical smell upon opening the package but it goes away in a few hours, so nothing to worry about. As for brushes, they are very soft and easy to use. Thank you very much for the great product and timely delivery!</li>
            <li> Highest quality, beyond soft!!! Would expect to pay way more for this quality!!! Cruelty free and high end brushes at this price it can&#x27;t be beat!!! A must have!!!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. Nice case. Love them!</li>
            <li> Having worked behind the camera for over 35 years, and using every brush out there, these are easily comparable!  They are soft, well made and clean with ease!  This 5 brush set will give you a gorgeous makeup application, as they serve every purpose!  And the PRICE can&#x27;t be beat!!  Well DONE!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever felt! I especially like the flat foundation brush, because it&#x27;s a little more dense than my current flat one and smooths out my foundation better. The case they come in is super study too. I also haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding! The only complaint I have is that the eyeshadow brush is too big for smudging liner but too small to actually apply eyeshadow well... Which is why I&#x27;m hoping they release more brushes to buy individually as needed :)</li>
            <li> I just love them!!!good quality</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They are so soft and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding. They did smell strong at first but I left the container open for a few days just as the now said and the smell went away. I love the case too, perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear make up very much. I was looking for some nice brushes for my wedding makeup. The brushes are soft and seem very well made. So far I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> The case is very sturdy, not cheap ,and the brushes are So very soft and there has been no shedding whatsoever. Quality products.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great for all my make-up needs.  I know some have mentioned they smell funny at first, but I am happy to report mine had no odor at all!  Love the case and each brush is used in my make-up routine.</li>
            <li> I adore this set! These are luxuriously soft brushes. I have trouble with hair coming off brushes from sets that are under $100, so the fact that no hair littered my face after using Andre Lorent&#x27;s set absolutely thrills me. Also, the container is so chic and lovely. I am in love with this container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with the basic, fundamental set that everyone needs to apply make-up. If you need explanations for what each brush should be used for, you can go to Andre Lorent&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a huuuuuge plus that the brushes are vegan and cruelty-free. Plus, it&#x27;s a small, family-owned business - go small business owners!! AND a portion of the proceeds is donated to breast cancer charities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait for their skincare line to go live. If their brushes are any indication of the quality of their skincare line, I&#x27;m in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Best Makeup Brushes EVER!!! I have lots of makeup brushes but these ones are the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> Foundation brush is too prickly so I ended up buying another foundation brush after</li>
            <li> Not my kind of brushes, low quality, I got them on sale for $1 so cant complaint but i wouldnt use them, going to gift them, would be great for a beginner. my all time favorite brushes high end are it cosmetics brushes the originals and lowend i would go with ecotools :)</li>
            <li> Very soft. Case is great quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft, and apply product very well! Love them!</li>
            <li> the brushes are in good quality and the case is cute and stylish, exactly of what I was looking for. However, the case smell really plastic when it comes in. You will need to air it out before you use it. Overall, great value and a great gift idea.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. So soft. And the case is large enough that I can fit a few other brushes in too.</li>
            <li> Great quality of brushes!!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I just wish the case was  not white so it didn&#x27;t show dirt as much.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup on a daily basis for work. My brushes needed to be replaced but I was looking to find a high quality set without the $100+ price tag. I was replacing MAC brushes. I came across this set and thought I could give it a chance. All the reviews were great so I thought, why not? I received this two days after I ordered and was blown away by not only the quality of the brushes but the case. The case is amazing and was a great surprise. The brushes blend well and stand up against my old high-end set. I will never again buy any other kind of brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. I used them this morning and they were better tha. Some of my high end brushes!! Thank you.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very sturdy, and very soft. I love the variety. I tried pulling on them as best I could to see if I could get any shedding to happen and I could not, which is great. The reason for not giving 5 stars is they do have a smell to them, almost a wet paint/ chemical smell. And I would have really liked to have a fluffy blending brush in the set.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!  Very soft, and feel wonderful against the face.  Although not made with a natural hair fiber, you wouldn&#x27;t know it.  The quality of these brushes is supurb, no bristles falling out, etc., and I love the case they came in (which could be used for so many other things besides housing the brushes).  This set of brushes would make a wonderful gift for anyone who loves makeup.</li>
            <li> These brushes and the case are really lovely. I bought these to use as demo tools with a new makeup kit, and I ended up keeping them for myself and picking up another cheap set. They really are beautiful, good quality with a very pretty and convenient travel case.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes. They don&#x27;t look or feel cheaply made. So dense and really soft. They do a really nice job of applying my makeup and I love the round case they come in. They are perfect for traveling with. My only complaint is how they arrived though I believe it was the fault of the carrier. The box was completely smashed and wide open. I&#x27;m surprised my brushes were even in there. I&#x27;m sure glad they were though!</li>
            <li> Shipping is very fast and the communication was top notch! This is the first make-up brush set i have ever gotten and will be the last! Thanks so much !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush set. The brushes are high quality and the bristles are soft and dense. I absolutely love the case also. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this beautiful and high quality set.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!  Very happy with my purchase of them.  The bristles are super soft and work wonderfully.  As the seller states when you order these brushes, there is an initial smell to them.  I let them air out for a few days before using them today, and the smell was gone.  The case is very nice and looks good enough to leave out.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and holds the brushes tightly.</li>
            <li> I am kind of a brush junkie, I own many different brushes from different companies. For a long time I was all about the MAC brushes, then sigma. This set is what I would consider a high end quality set, I really love these brushes! There was definately a funky smell when I recieved them, but I actually attribute that to the pleather case not the brushes themselves. I never use my brushes without washing first, these washed and dried nicely with basicly no shedding. Even my MAC brushes shed but not these. I am in love! Will definately try more from this line in the future!</li>
            <li> Great brushes. The eyeshadow brushes are comparable to the ones that come in the Urban Decay Naked Palettes.</li>
            <li> These are really amazing brushes! I thought the shorter than usual handle would be a problem but they are very easy to use. I have washed them a couple times already and have had no shedding or problems at all.  I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes! The quality, feel and presentation are A+ I would highly reccomend these brushes to buyers!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very precise and are a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I gave them as a gift to my daughter. She really liked the quality of the brushes. Time will tell as to&lt;br /&gt;How long they will hold up.</li>
            <li> My new favorite brushes!  Great qualities and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Best brushes ever!  I have paid more for a single brush than this set and these are far better!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush set, especially for the price! They are very dense brushes and transfer the pigment onto my skin without any getting lost in the bristles.</li>
            <li> Very please with this order</li>
            <li> The first version I purchased was broken BUT I was quickly contacted about sending a replacement and received that today. The brushes and set are lovely and the customer service was top notch. The case is very pretty and the brushes work well for their intended use. Nice set.</li>
            <li> These brushes exceeded my expectations! Five stars. I highly recommended buying this brush set to anyone who is considering.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, great quality brush set. Perfect for on the go or traveling. Already spread the word about them to my friends. Love love love!</li>
            <li> This makeup brush set is of great quality and the bristles are the softest I&#x27;ve ever felt! I especially love the eyeshadow brush. I&#x27;d definitely recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> Well made, Works perfect. My wife love it. Everything on time</li>
            <li> This set of brushes are by far one of the nicest I have ever owned!  Very soft and well made.  I love the case they came in.  I would recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> These brushes are excellent quality and the beautiful case doubles as 2 brush holders on my vanity.  I highly recommend buying these.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes! Very soft, no shedding, and a sturdy feel. Very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> Quality brushes, well made and sturdy. The bristles are soft and dense and the carrying case is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes! I can&#x27;t wait to use them. The case is heavy duty, too. Very pleased with this purchase and I cannot wait to try them.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes, adorable case, great price. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> i recieved my brush set and i loved it. the case smells like leather and the brushes are really soft. i&#x27;ve  already started to use them and they havent shed at all. when u first get them the inside of the case smells like new paint from the case but it goes away quickly. i would absolutely get more products from them.</li>
            <li> Amazing! It was so soft and so perfect</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase and oh......I do love these brushes!! I did read some reviews prior to purchasing them and while some consumers reported that their brushes &amp;#34;smelled bad&amp;#34;, I personally did not experience anything unbearable.  While they didn&#x27;t smell like sweet succulent flowers, they also did not smell like a landfill. The white case that the brushes arrived in is just lovely. An added bonus if you ask me!&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived in a timely fashion &amp; I am impressed with the customer service. Why? Because they actually reached out to me for my feedback whether it be good or bad (and not in an overbearing or annoying manner). This shows to me that they value their customers opinion and that they strive to improve their product in an effort to satisfy the needs of their demographic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite brushes. They&#x27;re so soft, have no fall out, and wash nicely. Very, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Got in the mail today so I had these brushes for all of 2 minutes and the larger brush broke before I even had the chance to use it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet but they are soft and look nice and the case is cute. They smelled pretty horrible right out of the packaging. A strong chemical type of smell.</li>
            <li> They are awesome brushes! Just love them!</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes and work well. Great value!</li>
            <li> This set is soft, sturdy, and high quality. I&#x27;m surprised by how gorgeous this set is. I really love them. In the future, I would like to see a darker color offering.</li>
            <li> They feel awesome. Love them. Not a brush guru but they do pick up product well.</li>
            <li> Here is an actual picture of the brushes. Happy with all the brushes! Work great, clean up easily.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft.  Bristles do not poke or hurt your face.  I&#x27;ve not washed them yet, but so far no shedding.</li>
            <li> Motive for buying: I am about to start makeup school and I wanted to purchase a few brushes of various qualities before I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush set is a nice collection that&#x27;s affordable without being cheap. I particularly LOVE the blush/powder brush and sometimes I just rub it over my face to relieve stress... it&#x27;s out-of-control softness feels amazing on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the brushes work really well and the brush fibers provide a nice, quality application. The brush set also comes with a white container that I do not use, but it seems sturdy (albeit prone to dirt buildup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the strong plastic smell when I got the package, although I believe it was mostly from the white container (not the brushes) and dissipated quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I dig the feel of the brushes in my hand/on my face and I think the set comes with a meaningful collection of brushes. I wish there were additional brushes I could buy, but alas...</li>
            <li> Super gift! Every girl needs her brushes and these are soft, practical and special. And they don&#x27;t shed! I particularly love the case they come in to keep all the brushes handy and looking glamorous on your dressing table. Will buy more for presents!</li>
            <li> I have never been a huge makeup brush fan (brushes would fall apart, wouldn&#x27;t blend well, etc.) until I tried these! Amazing! Have only had them about a week but the quality is superior and love the way my makeup looks applied. Great value for your money-love these brushes!</li>
            <li> My brushes came earlier than expected and arrived in great shape! The quality of the brushes is amazing! I can honestly say that the bristles on the brush are beyond soft! I have never felt anything like it. My 6 year old daughter even noticed how soft they are and stole one of the brushes that she rubs on her face continually while watching TV! I have had brushes before that do not apply a product evenly, but these brushes are of excellent quality. My makeup may not be quality brand names but the way that the brushes apply the makeup makes me feel like I am using top quality product! This was the best splurge that I have made for myself in a very long time!</li>
            <li> I love it! The brushes are very good quality and so soft and silky. The case is also very cute and practical. I only wish that they made more types of brushes as well, then my set would be complete.</li>
            <li> The set is amazing. I love the fact that they are Vegan and so beautifully packaged. The brushes are soft and durable. I have a variety of brushes from different price points but I think these are my favorite! In LOVE! A+ transaction from beginning to end.</li>
            <li> Got this on a limited discount &amp; so happy I found them! The case is so cute &amp; durable. Love that it has snaps on each side to keep the case closed. The brushes themselves are very nice quality! The ones I received are more of a travel size (which is perfect since it has the case) but they are so soft, no shedding &amp; great quality! Thank you so much &amp; I look forward to trying out new products from this line! :)</li>
            <li> Definitely nice! Love the brushes and they are thick, cannot beat the price, would buy again and the container is very cute too!</li>
            <li> These are awesome brushes!  They are truly professional quality.  The brushes are extremely soft and the craftsmanship very detailed.  The owner of the company personally replies to any questions or concerns that you might have about the products.  I love my purchase!</li>
            <li> I love my brush set and is perfect for my sensitive skin! I, also, really support and appreciate small business!</li>
            <li> First off, I was blown away with how high quality these brushes were, especially for the price. Second, they arrived in an awesome case which was unexpected. And third, after receiving them, one of the founders of the company wrote me to check and make sure everything was good on my end, very classy move. Definitely a 5 star experience</li>
            <li> Beautiful case soft brushes. No hair fall out. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great set. Brushes are soft and compact for traveling. My only wish would be the case, it&#x27;s a bit on a heavy side and wil add weight to your carry on. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Very affordable. Beautiful, professional quality, super soft. Do not hesitate!</li>
            <li> I really loved these makeup brushes. They&#x27;re really soft and work really good. I also liked the packaging, they are easy to carry around. They do have a smell to them but it goes away by leaving them in the air.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize that the brushes were so short.  But other than that,  I absolutely love these brushes.  They&#x27;re super soft and pick up product very well.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes for the discounted cost I got them for. The case is beautiful as well and I love the foundation brush especially</li>
            <li> I got these for the $1 special, so I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I have been pleasantly surprised. They are amazingly soft, and I look forward to really trying them out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with these brushes.  They are soooooo soft and are not super dense but they pickup a ton of makeup.  The case is cute too.</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes is amazing. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The brushes are great. They are a really good quality. I really like the case they came in also! I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how soft they are and how they apply the makeup with a precise definition. They do have a smell that goes away in one day or so need to let them open to get air. Didn&#x27;t bother about the smell was only for a day or so. No shedding of the brushes also is something definitively amazing! The case is very stylish and pretty. Will recommend your brushes to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved these brushes, they are super soft.</li>
            <li> super soft! i love them !!!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous Brushes. If you are looking for a set of new brushes, pick these up! Even if you arent looking, get them. They are awesome!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are so soft and perfect for putting on makeup with. I love that the come in a beautiful case that keeps your brushes protected and together.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! Very fast shipping and item was exactly as described. I will definitely purchase from this seller again.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The brushes are gorgeously smooth, it feels so nice on your skin. The case is so nice and sturdy, I love it! Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I love this set. The brushes are silky soft and transfer the color really well. The case is great, too. I can pop off one end and leave the other on the counter to hold all of the brushes like a cup or close the up for storing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve been trying to choose new brushes for sometime and this set seemed a great choice. I (always) rinsed them in a mild shampoo water and let them air dry before use.  There was no shedding and they feel very soft against my skin. It&#x27;s also the 1st time I&#x27;m using a brush to apply my foundation (I&#x27;ve tried liquid &amp; mousse) and both go on very easily, using a lot less product. I only wish there was another big (blush) brush to complete my set - I use the largest one for powder ... This would have made it absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these brushes, especially the powder brush and eye shadow brush. They&#x27;re so soft and work beautifully!</li>
            <li> This set is wonderful. The brushes are made well, and the carrying case is perfect. I love these, and they make a wonderful gift too.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best brushes I have ever purchased, especially for the price! I will look for other brushes made by Andre Lorent to expand and complete my brush collection.</li>
            <li> Excellent Brushes. Love them.</li>
            <li> Wow the best make up brushes I have owned so far!! Amazing quality. Applies make-up beautifully. I&#x27;m glad I got one and it happened to be the last one. Hope the seller will have it again so other ladies can get it.</li>
            <li> Good quality, excellent!</li>
            <li> I bought this set to augment and replace a Borghese set that was more than 20 years old. This set is fantastic. The brushes are silky soft, easy to clean, and pick up and release makeup extremely well. The brushes are made very well, and are quite comfortable to hold. I imagine I will be using these for the next 20 years. These brushes are a terrific value, and the customer service is fantastic from this company.</li>
            <li> This brushes are great</li>
            <li> They are super good and super cute. So much that my friend, who was doing my makeup the day of my wedding recommended me to get them (she is an image consultant and makeup professional), and so I did! And we both were very happy with them. Undortunately, I lost two of the brushes with all the stress of the wedding, people going up and down...I call them and they told me they could not sell me only those two, &amp;#34;the brushes only come in this set&amp;#34;. I wish they had that sercice. Other than that I paid for the fast shipping and they were here in two days, which was very convinient because my wedding was the week after that and I didnt want to risk.</li>
            <li> My first impression of these brushes is amazing.  They are dense but not too dense and incredibly soft.  The case is very nice quality.  This particular set contains everything you need to get started with brushes... a foundation brush, powder brush, two eye brushes and a lip brush.  I will DEFINITELY be buying more from this line in the future.</li>
            <li> The brush set came quickly as promised and is of good quality.  I would recommend this product and the packaging is lovely.</li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft  and great quality. great customer service I would buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> They are super soft, sturdy, and affordable!</li>
            <li> these bushes are wonderful.  i would like to order more but without the case.  is that possible</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Very soft.</li>
            <li> Got these for a travel set and they&#x27;re great!! I got them on sale for a really good deal but they&#x27;re worth full price!</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping and the brushes are so soft and great!</li>
            <li> Love the brushes.....The case is beautiful and great when traveling.  The brushes of high quality and work like a charm.  Shipping was fast and courteous service for any problems which I never had.  Love them.</li>
            <li> I have only used these once so far, but I&#x27;m already in love. These brushes are so soft! And they don&#x27;t shed. I&#x27;m just a regular girl who does her own makeup everyday, so I can&#x27;t tell you how they work from a professional point of view. But seeing as how I&#x27;ve been doing my own makeup for about 10 years, I can tell you these are the best I&#x27;ve used. The smell is a bit overpowering at first, but the email from the Co founder said to air them out a couple days and the smell will go away. It&#x27;s only been a day, but I already don&#x27;t smell it as much. I will update my review after longer use :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely the softest and most quality make up brushes I own. The packaging is really attractive and houses the brushes safely. I have to say that I am really impressed with Andre Lorent&#x27;s attitude towards their customers. I have received a couple emails from co-founder Ben, asking how the product was received. It&#x27;s really awesome to see a company care about their customers.</li>
            <li> smooth and soft brush love it!</li>
            <li> The deliver was very print an I&#x27;m very pleased with the pruduct</li>
            <li> The brushes were so soft and subtle. I particularly enjoyed the large powder blush - it gave me such a flawless finish!  I did not experience fall out with any of the brushes and I found that they were right along the lines of what I normally use (and I usually use Sigma brushes, which are much more expensive!). The thing that really put these over the top for me is the case. It&#x27;s SOLID. I travel a lot for work so this is PERFECT! I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brushes and the customer service is fantastic!</li>
            <li> So professional looking and the quality is great</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! They are so soft and well made! No shedding. The case they come with is really neat as well and great to toss into my carry on bag for travel while keeping my brushes safe! I received these at a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> So far these are great. I haven&#x27;t used them much, but I&#x27;ve washed them a couple times and so far there is no shedding and they are really soft. The smell on the brushes came out after I washed them.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes; good quality and easy to clean</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes!! They are some of my favorites so far. I think I&#x27;ll be purchasing a larger set if one becomes available.</li>
            <li> These brushes I bought for my girlfriend. They are truly the best brushes she has had in a LONG time. They are truly for everyone, but I can definitely see a professional makeup artist using these. Very high quality. Hairs don&#x27;t fall off like other brushes do. Also the apply an even coat every single time. I highly recommend you buy something to clean them. That way they last you a VERY long time. Not only were they affordable but the quality is definitely magnificent. No complaints from me. We have recommended these to all her friends and women from her family.</li>
            <li> The quality is amazing. The brushes are very well made and very smooth. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I recieved the set before yesterday. It is saved in a beautiful box/case. The brushes are so nice and their sizes are suitable to handle. The price is v good</li>
            <li> I waited to review these brushes so that I could have the proper time to actually use these and wash them for a month or so and I really love these brushes. So glad I found them. They don&#x27;t shed and they apply makeup perfectly without using a ton of product. I will purchase these as gifts for my friends at Christmas.</li>
            <li> They are super soft!!!</li>
            <li> Just received my brushes. So soft. So pretty. Yes the smell is there but it will fade...it&#x27;s the smell of new brushes. These are definitely on MAC level but without that price. I just got MAC makeup and I refused to buy their brushes. Glad I got these instead.</li>
            <li> Great quality considering the price. None of them have shed yet and I love the case.</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I have been looking for.  It would be really, really, really nice if it came with more brushes in the package. However, the brush holder is very nice and large enough to put other brushes in there. Very pleased with this purchase!  I shopped on-line and in stores until I found the perfect one. I am so glad I decided on this one.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Planning on ordering a bunch as a gift set for friends - these are amazing. I don&#x27;t have a strong new product smell, but if I did I was informed via personal email it would go away and how to take care of it. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this company and Emily - who so kindly emailed me and got my feedback. Small business like this one deserve great recognition. BUY this &amp; you will thank me.</li>
            <li> Brushes are great!  Very light weight and super soft brushes.  The case is of nice quality.  No more fumbling around looking for my brushes, saves much needed time.  These brushes are also very kind to my super sensitive skin.  The only reason they don&#x27;t get a 5 star rating is that the handle on the blending brush was loose right out of the package.</li>
            <li> Great quality!! Very soft brushes and very nice carrying case!</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and container is convenient, so far so good, I&#x27;ve been able to use the brushes to apply makeup with ease</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. Brushes are really soft and dense. The case is bulky, I got rid of that. But otherwise very happy with the brushes themselves!</li>
            <li> These are nice for the money.  Love the holder, too; it holds her mascara also.  Just the right amount of brushes for typical make-up application.  The brushes have a nice feel to them.  Would highly recommend for a personal set.</li>
            <li> These are the best and softest brushes I have ever used! I am completely in love and for the price it&#x27;s basically a steal!! The case us big enough for other brushes and other makeup pencils (eyeliner, lip liner, or eye brow pencils). Definitely a must have!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the case, the brushes are so soft and perfect for day to day use. Will definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Was actually very impressed with the quality given the price. I orderd two sets from two companies and this was the better of the two sets. The case is also well made and easy to travel with</li>
            <li> Make up was applied flawlessly!! LOVED these brushes and how super affordable they are!  I&#x27;m buying another set!</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes and there is room for more brushes in the case.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Soft on the skin and great quality. The holder comes in handy for travelling. Solid buy.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes they were worth every penny :)!</li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft. My skin loves them. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! I Really only use the eye brushes but they work great and are a really good quality.</li>
            <li> GREAT brushes couldnt really ask for more</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, durable sophisticated case.</li>
            <li> soft, very well put together!  easy to clean!  i love the case they came in.  :)  Not only are these brushes amazing, so is the company! They reached out to me to make sure I was 100% satisfied with my purchase! I cannot express how much I love these super soft brushes. Great quality!!</li>
            <li> Meh, not impressed. One of the smaller brushes came covered in glue&#x3D;unusable. The foundation brush is okay, really liked the powder brush. The case is nice. So I basically paid for one and a half brushes that I actually use.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this company.  My case came glued shut so I wrote them and they sent me an entirely new one very quickly and said I could keep the original, which means I got 2 sets of these fabulous brushes! I was never a believer in brushes applying makeup well when you could use your fingers or a sponge, but I am now. I bought these because of the price and am very impressed with them. They are easy to clean and return to their softness after, unlike some brushes who get a little &#x27;wongo&#x27; after cleaning.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This brush set is great! the case was lovely when it arrived and I&#x27;ve really been enjoying using the brushes. The bristles are soft and I haven&#x27;t lost any yet like I have with brushes in the past. I have noticed some reviews that talk about the smell but I did not find it to be particularly strong with the set I got at all and I felt I was able to use them the day after I got them. I really love these and I&#x27;m so happy I picked them up!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! I use them as a professional makeup artist and they work wonders.  They look really professional too abd I love the case its great for travel! They are smooth and feel like high quality.</li>
            <li> Love the container to keep them in ~ think she&#x27;ll be really happy with them!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, sturdy case, plenty of room for extra brushes! The brushes themselves are very soft and the sizes are perfect for light, daily make up</li>
            <li> My first impression of the brushes are how soft they are and how well made they appear to be.</li>
            <li> High end quality brushes.  Love my purchase.  Feel like what professionals use but not at a high price.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Super soft on my skin and don&#x27;t have bristled falling off into my face like many other brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past. I also love the little case they come in, it&#x27;s very convienent for traveling. I got an email from the company saying the brushes may have a smell to them when first opening them (which is normal) but I didn&#x27;t smell anything so that was also a plus!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes, and good customer service.</li>
            <li> On time delivery. The quality of the brushes are excellent. Would recommend........&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Ordered and received my brushes in two days, I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> my favorite brush set</li>
            <li> Nice, soft brushes, quality set!</li>
            <li> great i really like it</li>
            <li> Bought this product online through Amazon as a gift for my 13 year old niece.  She just loves these brushes.  It made for a great gift and a pleasure doing business with the company that makes them !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best brush set I&#x27;ve ever head. So soft and beautiful. Leather box is also very high quality. They are better than I expected. I am not professional in doing makeup but now after received this brushes, I am trying to learn more. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes that I have tried!  They are so soft! I haven&#x27;t had a problem with them shedding like other brushes I have used in the past and they are lasting much longer than other more expensive brushes that I have used.  They are also very easy  to clean. The case is very well made and makes traveling with the brushes very easy.  It also protects them from dirt and damage while also looking very nice on my makeup table.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fabulous!  I have purchased more expensive brushes, because I thought it was the best route to go....only to be hugely disappointed.  So happy with my purchase, and fully intend to buy more brushes in the future!</li>
            <li> Smell kinda strange when you first open them but they are okay.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes! These are just as nice as brushes from a designer makeup counter, but for a fraction of the price! The only thing I would change is that I wish the eye shadow brush was soft and fuller. I still use it for my eye shadow, just not as often. It is good for layering color, but not blending. Otherwise these are excellent brushes. I still give these 5 stars!</li>
            <li> love the vegan brushes.  quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Great Value!!!!!  Nice brushes and an amazing case!</li>
            <li> So I wanted to wait a while to write a review to give this product a fair chance. I LOVE THEM. The brushes are very soft and hold my makeup well. I am an avid user of makeup and I apply professionally as well. I highly recommend. The foundation brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great! I use them with my Bare Minerals and the powder goes on great. Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> They are amazing for the price!</li>
            <li> quality made, looks elegant, no shreds, easily washable, I love it!</li>
            <li> Great investment I&#x27;ve tried many brush sets and they all shed these are very soft and do not shed. Great feedback from seller I will recommend to all my friends... We love makeup!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these makeup brushes!! My makeup looks better than it ever has... Plus, they&#x27;re super soft!(: I would recommend these to anyone who wears makeup</li>
            <li> I bought it for my girlfriend. She told me that the brushes didn&#x27;t work really well with her makeup. The lip brush is so hard that it feels like there is glue on it. The eye shadow brush doesn&#x27;t pick up eye shadow well and it&#x27;s a bit too hard for the delicate eye area. She ended up using only the biggest brush. She used it to contour, but still it doesn&#x27;t pick up bronzer/blush/highlighter well. I gave it two star because at least the case is good. The case is handy. She has been using sephora face brushes and bobbi brown eye brushes and she is looking for something less pricey, but this one is not so satisfying. I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft...</li>
            <li> These are what I have been looking for! They are very soft and I love that they came in a handy case which is very convenient!</li>
            <li> I just love all of these brushes! They are all soft. Reasonably priced therefore, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got the leather case and brushes in the mail and was able to see in person that it was exactly as I hoped. The case is quite big and I can hold other brushes in with it. The brushes themselves are very soft and seem to be great quality-for 20.00 it can&#x27;t be beat. There were mentions of it having a strong smell in other reviews and so I expected it to need an \\&quot;airing out\\&quot; but aside from when I first opened the case there isn&#x27;t any strong smell after the initial opening so that was better than expected.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! so soft and easy to clean. nice little case for them too</li>
            <li> They are useful but on the sm size but for the price I guess is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Great makeup Brush Set, with a lovely case. A great product!</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and work great. The case they come in is perfect and you can add your mascara etc</li>
            <li> These are great soft brushes! Great quality for the price. My only.complaint is when you first open the case it smells sooo bad! It smells like acetone and burnt rubber.  The smell does not come from the brushes but just from the case.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and nice merchant who follows up very well with their customers.</li>
            <li> Really great, pretty much everything I was expecting!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! Very soft and they don&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li> The hair is very intense. I washed before first use. The hair remains puffy and soft after wash. It feels great on face and catches power quite firmly. Good product. If there are more types developed, I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I have this set and mainly use the powder and foundation brushes. While I&#x27;ve had no issues with the powder brush, the foundation brush is constantly shedding and leaving hairs all over my face, etc. I have only had these brushes a couple months and already need to replace the foundation brush. I will not but again!</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are awesome! I was very impressed with the nice case they came in as well as the quality of each brush. And expect ally the price. I purchased a set of MAC makeup brushes for more than double the price of these and these seem to be a much better quality. I am very pleased and will be purchasing more products from this brand.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little set of brushes that meets every need when traveling! The brush bristles are lovely and just the right size!</li>
            <li> The best brushes that I can ask for. The materials are expensive compared to the price and these brushes come with a box to help you keep them in place. Definitely recommended</li>
            <li> Just received my make-up brushed today and im in love they are so soft and the case they come in is of the best quality. Looking forward to using them everyday :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome makeup brush set..the packaging is very good..travelling friendly..really happy  with it..it&#x27;s a must have set.loving this set</li>
            <li> awesome brushes!! they are of great quality &amp; the case is great as well!!</li>
            <li> I started using these brushes a few days ago.  The quality of the brushes is excellent.  The concealer brush is great for applying spot correction.  The eyebrow brush works well.  A large fluffy brush works well with translucent powder.  I would have also liked a thin, firm flat brush for blush and bronzer. I would recommend these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The company is very interested in customer satisfaction and truly aims to please.  To me that is a rare quality in business today</li>
            <li> Perfect!  My favorite brushes!</li>
            <li> these brushes are very soft and light, very well made.</li>
            <li> I night these a couple a weeks ago and so far I really like them. I am not a professional makeup artist  so i dont knownmuch about other brands but I do consider the fact that they are cruelty free, this should be extremely important for everyone who is trying to help the world to be a better place.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service!!, we as well own a family business as well and our customers are a very important part of our success. Thank you Emily  for your quick response on my question regarding a use description for each brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Melissa.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Super soft yet very durable.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my old brushes which were never this soft and gentle to use.  I really love these and the carrying case is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Great product, but over-priced.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best buys i&#x27;ve made on Amazon, these brushes are so soft and my powder foundation glides on.</li>
            <li> Brushes are very hard</li>
            <li> Would recommend, very good quality.</li>
            <li> Love 2 of the brushes... the other three are nothing special.  The case is fantasticfor travelling.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes and especially love the case.  It sits on my counter making brushes easy to retrieve and also cover to protect from hairspray and dust.  Very handy!</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes!</li>
            <li> These brushes are of a fantastic quality. They are the softest brushes I have ever used and do a great job applying my mineral powder.</li>
            <li> Came in leather tube that was glued, could not open</li>
            <li> I love these brushes because they are so soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes was found to be of excellent quality.  They compared to other makeup brushes purchased from Bare Minerals, but more reasonably priced.  They applied the makeup equally and smoothly.  I would highy recommend this set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I love more, the actual brushes, or the cute little case that the brushes come in. These are very well made and don&#x27;t leave bristles on your face while applying your makeup. They are fluffy and not rough like a lot of the brushes I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I plan to purchase more of these as gifts for friends. I would definitely recommend these to women who wear makeup every day and need a long lasting set of brushes!</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I used all of the brushes before posting my review, but I can honestly say this product was worth it after using only 2 of them. Soft is an understatement on how these feel. I hate cheap brushes on my eyelids, because they often feel scratchy and irritating. Not with these. I would pay the price I paid for just the eyeshadow brush alone. The case is durable and looks nice. Definite 5 star product in my opinion. I&#x27;m buying these for my sisters for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Brushes were delivered in an awesome travel case and they apply makeup so beautifully!  My favorite is the contour brush, but again, they all work wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for letting me try these brushes!  :)</li>
            <li> I received these brushes quickly and love them! They look really nice, are so soft, and work well!! The travel case they come in is also really nice!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Great product !!!! Super soft brushes &amp; beautiful case!!!! I would reccomend this to anyone wanting a good brush set!</li>
            <li> I purchased this primarily for the powder brush.  Feels soft and distributes the powder evenly, the only drawback is the brush is bigger than what I expected. Still a good product and love the bonus brushes.</li>
            <li> Lovely quality. Great buy!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft! They feel luxurious on my face like I spent a lot of money on them but I didn&#x27;t! These are great quality, perfect for travel or home.  They are durable brushes and comes in a cool case you can set on your counter or put the top on and throw in your purse.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft! They will definitely become an everyday addition to my large brush collection.</li>
            <li> I got this set on a crazy deal (they were $1). Was so surprised and happy when I received them and saw the quality. These brushes are great! The brushes are soft and pretty dense and they came in a really nice case. I would definitely buy these again! They arrived very quickly and I am very pleased with the purchase. Was a little worried at first when my order was cancelled without notifying me but amazon came through as always!</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these brushes!!  They are amazingly soft. They come in the perfect size for applying my makeup, and I love the eyeliner brush!  The case is beautiful and well made!  The brushes are a little smelly first out of the plastic, but let them air out for a day or two and they are great!  If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality makeup brush, buy these!!!</li>
            <li> These feel great on my face, they&#x27;re super soft. And they come in a great little storage case.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They are super soft, and they are high quality. I appreciate that the bristles are densely packed, so I can pick up a lot of product. They do shed the first couple of times you wash them (but I expect that from most of my brushes). My favorite brush is the powder brush, it gives a beautiful effect!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes, they have a smell when opening it but airing it out for a few days does the trick. Blends my makeup very well and feel better than most professional brushes.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! I love how each brush is so light I feel like when applying my makeup I don&#x27;t have to force the brush to get only in certain areas of my face but I can allow the brush to just do its thing! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love the brushes they are very soft and work amazing, up opening they did have a new brush odor but i let them air out for abt 24hrs and it went away. An amazing buy !!!!</li>
            <li> Soft, luxurious bristles. Beautiful case. Makeup goes on like a dream with these brushes. My new favorite tools</li>
            <li> For the price, you will not find better quality. Had some body shop brushes that I had to replace after they were stolen (gross!) but didn&#x27;t feel like spending a solid hundo. This set matches the quality and was the price of their blusher!</li>
            <li> These seem to be very nice brushes .. so far no shedding, but haven&#x27;t had them long.  They are very soft - a couple of the ones I use for eyes are too soft; I wish they had a little more firmness and less &amp;#34;give&amp;#34;.  The case is very pretty new, but as others have stated the white isn&#x27;t very practical and probably won&#x27;t look nice for long … but it is a quality case.  All in all, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent I feel berry good I lake good broduc thanks</li>
            <li> Loved this product. Arrived promptly and its quality is superior to other brushes that are way more expensive.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great and comes in a nice slick fashionable container. It  makes for a great gift for a young woman starting to wear makeup or someone who is makeup savvy.</li>
            <li> This is a great little kit of brushes. I use BE and they worked perfectly for that. The large brush is comparable to their kabuki...but much more affordable.  The case will be great for travel but for now each side can hold brushes on the counter</li>
            <li> I wear makeup on a regular basis, mostly due to the nature of my job.  As a result, I go through makeup brushes relatively quickly.  They&#x27;re just never the same after you wash them yourself.  So I’ve purchased brushes at high-end makeup counters (Chanel, Bobbi Brown, MAC), as well as local retail stores (Ulta, Sephora).  The high-end makeup brushes are very expense, and the local retail brushes are lower quality.  I found that the Andre Lorent professional makeup brush set gives you the best of both worlds – affordable (local retail prices) with high-end quality!  And the brushes even keep their superior quality after cleaning them!  To top it off, the co-founder of Andre Lorent is extremely responsive to questions about the product – he helped answer some of my initial questions about caring for the brushes, and how best to clean them.</li>
            <li> I ADORE this makeup brush set. My daughter had two dance recitals this weekend, so I had the perfect  chance to really give them a thorough test. The size variety is perfect for every need and the brushes are very high quality. I love that they are cruelty free and the case that they come in is awesome. Totally recommend this set!</li>
            <li> I received my elegant make up brushes last week and just had to write a review!  If I could give 6 stars I would!  I LOVE them.  They were so elegantly packages and the feel of the brushes themselves are heavenly.  I use high end cosmetics and am so glad I FINALLY found the brushes of my dreams!!&lt;br /&gt;The customer services was excellent.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate buying another product from this wonderful company!</li>
            <li> I just received my Andre Lorent Make-up Brush Set and I am once again extremely happy with my purchase from the Andre Lorent Company.&lt;br /&gt;This set is reasonably priced (especially for 5 brushes and a case...you can&#x27;t get this price at the make-up counter!)  and comes in a great package, that is not only aesthetically pleasing, but will be a great case for travel.  The brushes themselves are quality brushes and I like that fact that they are vegan and cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely go back and order these brushes as gifts for friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;I also want to mention that I received an email from the Co-founder of Andre Lorent, Ben Cummings, thanking me for my purchase and making sure that I was completely satisfied with the the product.  What great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> She said it was so cute,&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the quality!&lt;br /&gt;she said these brushes were perfect and very expensive,  her mouth dropped when i told her how much.  she thought i paid double.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this 5 brush set has every brush she will need and should last her a very long time,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is not a cheap case either.  very durable just like the brushes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to purchase this brush set.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was skeptical about the quality of buying brushes online. But wow these brushes are so soft and they come with the most effective brow brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I also love the white container is comes in which makes it so easy for me to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bonus was the great customer service. The owner even emailed me personally to insure I received the product and to offer any further assistance I might need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this are great for brushes on the go- think purse, travel, everywhere! I also think my girlfriends would love this as a birthday gift.</li>
            <li> I saw an ad on Facebook (yes, really) for an amazing deal featured on Amazon for this exact Andrew Lorent Pro Makeup Brush Set. I honestly thought it too good to be true; but nonetheless, I have never had a bad experience ordering from Amazon, so I gave it a go. I am a makeup lover; I tread high and low for great products at reasonable and/or affordable prices! Not only did I get a STEAL of a DEAL with this makeup brush set, but it is absolutely everything it promised it would be. I have very picky skin, i.e. I am prone to breakouts and sensitivity. As you can imagine, finding the right products for me can be a nightmare, and this goes for applicators as well!This kit shipped fast and was in great condition upon receival. I could not be more happy with the brushes and their performance. They are soft, take to makeup superbly, apply to my skin smoothly and provide excellent coverage. Also, the set was packaged in the most adorable, sleek carrying case that I now use as a holder on my bathroom countertop. I was also thrilled because I can  use it as a travel case for my on-the-go lifestyle. The case is not bulky or tacky, it is perfect for any chic and fashion-forward lady. Best of all, the feedback and correspondance from the Andre Lorent  team, which is an independently owned and operated business, was both welcoming and encouraged. They were concerned with my satisfaction every step of the way, and that is something you just don&#x27;t see every day. I would recommend this product and company to anybody 110% and I look forward to seeing what new products they will be coming out with in the future!</li>
            <li> I am someone who loves make-up. I am also particular of the brushes that I use. When I first saw this, it popped on my mind that it might be a good try. This was shipped quickly and when I opened it...I said...&amp;#34;These are amazing brushes&amp;#34;. I so love it. This is a good buy. So ladies and beauty enthusiasts, you def&#x27; wanna get one for yourselves. Thank you also for the seller on this good deal. More to come! :)</li>
            <li> Love Love Loved these brushes! Very high quality! Worth the money! Has great carrying case as well!  Would recommend to everybody.</li>
            <li> I always buy brushes at Sephora or a similar store when I need them, but always wished I had a higher quality set. I was so happy to find this brush set as it is exactly what I was looking for. I love the softness of the brush as well as how easily and well it applies makeup. I love the set combination, exactly what I use on a daily basis. I also just had a laser procedure done and was worried about the brushes being to harsh on my face - they were perfect! I would highly recommend this brush set, I also love the container as I use it as their storage place in my bathroom, it looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes. Very soft. There is a strong smell from the case but I think with time it should go away. Very happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> This is a great set of brushes, they&#x27;re so soft and the bristles don&#x27;t shed as quickly as other brushes I&#x27;ve had. The protective case is also pretty awesome and great for travel so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the bristles getting bent or dirty.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous vegan brush set. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Very nice brush set.  LOVE the storage container.  Great for travel or just use the bottom of the container to store the brushes on the bath room counter.  The brushes are soft and well made.  They are easy to clean.  A nice combination of brushes.  Highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really compare these to other brushes, as this was my first real brush set, but about three days after receiving mine, I ordered a set for my mother. It&#x27;s like being kissed by angel wings, yo.</li>
            <li> i love them, they are great brushes!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews for my wife, she was very pleased with the quality. She stop using her Mac brushes because never stop shedding. I just order two more as gift for my sisters in law too. It&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> I purchased the  Andre Lorent 5-Piece professional brush set in December 2014, but I just got around to using them this month. These brushes are super soft and the carry-case (though I agree with other buyers, should NOT be white), is durable enough to place in your suitcase for travel, which was my main purpose for getting these brushes. The Powder/Blush Brush worked well for applying loose powder foundation and/or blush, as I prefer to use the larger brushes for my foundation applications. The Foundation Brush worked best for me to apply concealer, I&#x27;m not a fan of small Foundation brushes for face make-up applications.  As mentioned in other reviews, upon opening the brushed, you should let them air out for a few hours, I let my brushes air out for 24 hours before use. Overall, the brushes traveled well and are easy to clean. I do wish the case was in a darker color, maybe gray or black</li>
            <li> These brushes are hand made and are so soft.  They spread evenly and are easy to clean. From what I understand, they are a small company.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Love them! Great vegan, cruelty-free alternative to other high-quality make-up brushes. The packaging is also very convenient, as I now use the base of the container to store the brushes on my vanity.</li>
            <li> Love these! I haven&#x27;t had a chance to clean them yet but they are super soft and pick up product very well! Incredibly pleased with my purchase and I highly recommend! The case is fantastic as well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: a year and a half later and these are still in fantastic shape! I have cleaned them many times, and have had no shedding whatsoever and the ferrules still look as nice as the day they arrived! The bristles are still incredibly soft and fluffy! Having the travel case has really come in handy, and has kept the bristles from getting damaged on trips when I need to pack them to come with. I love that it also has room for additional brushes as needed. Still 110% happy that I bought these and have recommended them to many since getting them!</li>
            <li> When I got these brushes, I was sooo excited! ! They are incredibly soft. They do have a weird smell at first but I just aired them out for a couple of days. Highly recommended brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes with a coupon code at a great price! They are super soft and the bristles do not fall out. It comes with a case which is beautiful. I would definitely recommend these prices. They are a must have to any makeup collection!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are better quality than what I had before (which weren&#x27;t too shabby to begin with). I love the biggest brush for applying my face powder...and the case that keeps the brushes standing upright on my dresser or counter.They arrived fast and in tact. I would easily buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I am incredibly happy with my decision to purchase Andre Lorent makeup brushes. I have different sets of makeup brushes from inexpensive to high end. Andre Lorent brushes are inexpensive but comparable to the top makeup brushes available on the beauty market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are incredibly soft - their bristles retain their shape and softness even after washing. If you do notice a plastic smell when you first open your set, air them out well and then wash with gentle baby shampoo. I prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee shampoo as it is natural and does not harm my beautiful brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides being cleaned and retaining their softness, these brushes blend remarkably well. I also must comment on the case included with this set. I would assume a makeup brush case would not receive as much attention as the actual product. However, Andre Lorent has gone above and beyond to cover every detail of this gorgeous set. The brush case is very high end, quality and sturdy. It is very impressive.</li>
            <li> Great brush set, everything applies just as i want it to.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! They are very well made and super soft! Not to mention such a great price for amazing quality!</li>
            <li> Very nice.  There is a slight &amp;#34;artificial&amp;#34; smell to it, but that goes away with a little airing out.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these brushes</li>
            <li> It is awesome!!!! It is soft and very easy to use! I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Very rough, the eye brakes scratched my eye lids. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend much time in front of the mirror to get ready for work every morning. I spend all of 8 minutes (yes, I timed myself once) applying powder foundation, eyebrow definer, blusher and loose powder. Even for someone like me, makeup brushes have to be washed and/or replaced eventually. Since the time for it finally came, I decided to splurge a little on a better and uniform set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I went with this set. The raving reviews are legit! Every brush and the case are gorgeous. I especially appreciate how each brush was wrapped in its own plastic sleeve, and then all the plastic-wrapped brushes were held together in an even larger plastic sleeve for extra protection. Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on these brushes are solid but soft. This set of brushes will last me a while. I will very likely order the same set when the time comes again to replace my brushes. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I love this brush set it is very dense and super soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice to look at and wonderful to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case they come in is elegant and it adds beautifully to the whole set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are very soft at the tips and sturdy at the base, which is hard to find in brushes, and a guarantee that they will hold up for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The products arrived quickly, and so far I have been very pleased with the brushes. They are very soft and makes putting on my makeup much easier!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my brushes and the case they come in is so convenient to put in a purse or even when traveling. I honestly bought the entire set just for the eyebrow brush but I&#x27;m learning to love every single one.</li>
            <li> Nice canister and good brush quality</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older (50s), my skin has become more sensitive to make ups, brushes, etc.  These brushes are so soft I was amazed the first time I swept them across my face and didn&#x27;t feel like they were scratching my face. Love the brush case!  The days of scrounging in the makeup bag for the right brush are over! Great job!</li>
            <li> These are really nice brushes,  so soft and a fair price point. I would recommend the brushes, they are well made, they do have a slight odor but that disapated in one day sitting out. The only complaint or suggestion I would have is that while the case is very well made and quite attractive... it&#x27;s white... a darker color (brown or black) may have been a better choice.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! What a bargain for such a great product. I will be buying more!!!</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft, yet firm enough to hold the product for application.  I have only used once but so far they are great brushes.</li>
            <li> These are the BEST brushes I have ever used. So soft, no chemical smell, and holds up very well through washings!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter.  They are working out and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> It is great quality, looked luxurious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great customer support&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product and packaging looks amazing and makes it easy to store all the brushes.  It is great to travel with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben the co-founder sent me an email letting me know what to expect and to contact him with any questions, I was blown away by  the service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be great to order and give as a gift&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> From the moment I received these make-up brushes, I was impressed before even opening up the case. The brushes come in a sleek white case for protection and are individually wrapped in plastic covers. Upon opening the case and removing the individual coverings, I was wowed by how soft the brushes were. I immediately took out my other &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brushes and could tell the difference instantly! The hairs are securely placed on the handle and the brushes move across your face like silk. The handles are very ergonomic and easy to hold as well. These brushes not only feel good, but they work amazingly as well. My make-up went on flawlessly and the shape of the big brush was perfect for my bronzer. The eye brushes are shaped in such a way that it was easy to apply my eye shadow. Then as a test I decided to do a smoky eye using the smallest brush with my eye shadow and it went on great, staying perfectly close to my lash line. I am VERY impressed with these brushes and the transaction was great. Shortly after I ordered, the seller contacted me via email to say thank you for my business. It felt personal to have that kind of attention as a consumer, especially when it comes to online shopping. I HIGHLY recommend getting a set of the Andre Lorent PRO Makeup Brush Set. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really good service from vendor and nicely presented, the carrying case was a pleasant surprise. For me though, the blush brush a little too soft for shaping.</li>
            <li> Received this great makeup brush set quickly and it was packaged well. I have to agree with most peoples review of the case. It is simply great. This case alone is a treasure, and when you add the high quality brushes, you have the perfect makeup brush kit.&lt;br /&gt;I generally use MAC brushes with some store bought brushes too. With that said, I used all the brushes in the kit this morning. The brushes are extremely soft, yet are stiff enough to allow for good coverage of product. I especially liked the liner brush as it made a nice straight (narrow) line when I applied eyeliner under the lash line. The only brush I would have liked to have seen in the kit (and it&#x27;s my personal thing) is a brush for applying an eye shadow all over the lid. I used the smudging brush, but it would be nice to have that one extra brush. Not a big deal for me as I can put one of my other brushes in the awesome case.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this kit and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how soft these brushes are!  It is a quality set which presents as classy.  When it arrived and I opened the snapped shut case, I loved that the five brushes looked exactly as they present.  No hidden disappointment here!  The case doubles as the brush holder on my vanity as well as my travel pouch.  Either way, I don&#x27;t have to be without these glamorous brushes!  I am by no means &amp;#34;rich,&amp;#34; but these brushes make me feel fancy when I use them.  So soft!  If I didn&#x27;t already have the set, I&#x27;d ask for it for my upcoming birthday!  It&#x27;s a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend buying this product!</li>
            <li> I wear makeup on a regular basis as a result, I go through makeup brushes relatively quickly. They&#x27;re just never the same after you wash them yourself. So I’ve purchased brushes at high-end. The high-end makeup brushes are very expense, and the local retail brushes are lower quality. I found that the Andre Lorent professional makeup brush set gives you the best of both worlds – affordable with high-end quality! And the brushes even keep their superior quality after cleaning them. Great product !!!! Super soft brushes &amp; beautiful case!!!! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good brush set!</li>
            <li> I have and use a lot of different brushes, but these are my new favorite. They are super soft and apply pigment flawlessly. I am an obsessive brush cleaner and these wash very nicely. Would definitely buy again, but I think these will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> So happy with these brushes. They make my makeup application so easy.. They are so soft &amp; the little hairs don&#x27;t shed unlike other brushes I purchased.. They&#x27;re a great price &amp; come in a great leather case, which is great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased a few products from this company &amp; their service is always so professional &amp; they always make sure you&#x27;re 100% satisfied..</li>
            <li> I would recommend to all my family and friends.  Has a professional feel and ease to take with you when in a hurry. Just all around an awesome product.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and apply make up very well. They are sturdy and don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re going to fall apart in a few weeks. :)</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  I had bought a MAC foundation brush but quickly found out that I could not keep dropping $35 on brushes.  I am so happy I found these brushes.  They look beautiful and work wonderfully.  The one I&#x27;ve used most so far is the eyeshadow brush.  I only have an old cheap one to compare it to but it works so much better than my old one.  It&#x27;s soft but stiff enough to properly apply eyeshadow even to the corner of your eyes.  I noticed no smell and the case is a wonderful place to keep your brushes to protect them in your makeup bag.</li>
            <li> very nice brushes and case.  I leave it open and filled with other brushes I have also.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re soft and love the case too!</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and I love the way they apply my  makeup. I was disappointed with the seller becuase I ordered these with a coupon and they cancelled my order because they didn&#x27;t mean to let so many people use it. It&#x27;s not my fault that their coupon code wasn&#x27;t set to limit at a certain number of uses. However, amazon made things right an honored the coupon price and I got an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Love everything about these. The container they come in is fantastic, the bristles are soft and apply make up evenly and beautifully! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wow! Better than Mac... Very soft and I love it! .. I will definitely buy again and the prices was awesome too</li>
            <li> Great product, great customer service. great price! I bought these based on the great reviews I read and am not at all disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the brushes and the case.  The delivery was speedy too.</li>
            <li> The softest brushes ever! I&#x27;m a makeup artist and these are some of the nicest brushes I use!</li>
            <li> Love the brush case. The brushes are so soft and very nice quality. This set will get a lot of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this product while a $1 promotion and I was super surprised on how soft the brushes were. For the regular price of these brushes it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I am really picky about my makeup brushes. These are beyond fabulous!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a makeup artist I am constantly trying new brushes. these are by far one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the powder brush is perfect for blush. I use it for cream and powder blush. applies perfectly and blends nicely.&lt;br /&gt;the foundation brush is perfect for blending. I personally do this to conceal my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;the shader (eyeshadow) brush is perfect for packing color all over the lid. Ive even used it in my crease.&lt;br /&gt;the pencil brush is perfect for highlighting the corners of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;and my all time favorite. the angled brush. OMG this is perfect for applying that winged eye liner. I have never gotten a more perfect, cat eye than I have with this brush, and within minutes!!!! PERFECT! I would love to try more products that this company releases!</li>
            <li> Love them.  Soft and holds the powder well.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these! Says they are incredibly smooth and soft! More than worth it!</li>
            <li> The brushes were packed beautifully in a white leather container. The bristles were very soft and luxurious feeling, but the handles  on all the brushes fell off... I would not recommend this product unless you have a lot of extra time and super glue</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE! I&#x27;m always skeptical of buying brushes online without being able to see the quality first. I&#x27;m so glad that I took a chance on these. I&#x27;ve had these for about 9 months and they see average use (3-5x/week). They are super soft and hold their shape and texture through application &amp; washing (which is more than I can say for some of my other brushes which I&#x27;ve paid $20+ for). Mine didn&#x27;t come with brush use/cleaning instructions, but I just clean them the same way I do all my other brushes. They work extremely well with my makeup. I have a few different brands of foundation brushes and this one actually blends the best of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case has become my brush holder at home and works really well. I didn&#x27;t expect much out of it, but it seems to be made of high quality materials and is constructed well. If we were to travel, it&#x27;d be a nice convenient way to bring my brushes with me. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too keen on was the color as white is super hard to keep clean, but it does look nice sitting on the counter in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> really nice, soft brushes, give a delicate touch of blush, shadow, or bronzer.  great case that protects the brushes, and looks good on the shelf.  quick ship, just as described.  A+</li>
            <li> Wow. All I can say is WOW. These brushes are an absolute MUST HAVE for any makeup lover like myself. The fact that they are hand crafted is a huge plus. Not only that but they are crafted PERFECTLY. I can&#x27;t believe how high quality these brushes are at such a fantastic price. I love the little case they came in. They&#x27;re super soft, they work great, and they&#x27;re priced just right. What more could you ask for? I&#x27;ve already cleaned them and there was absolutely no shedding either. I love these brushes and recommend everyone to try them! *Sample provided for testing and review*</li>
            <li> Great quality, excellent design, soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these brushes! I have sensitive skin and most brush make me blotchy, red, and itchy! Not these brushes! I&#x27;ve finally found brushes I can use on my skin and not have to worry about waiting 30mins to an hour before I can leave the house after applying makeup! I would highly recommend these brushes to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied! Great quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Great quality... The downside? They smell a little!</li>
            <li> Great value and high quality</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are super soft, have a good grip. Arent too long or short. The carrying case while it is super cute and sturdy it only comes in white which doesn&#x27;t bother me much but it could get dirty very easily. Although I do wish the eyeshadow brush was a little wider and denser I love the way it glides eyeshadow on so easily. Overall I love these and they are a great product at a great price. These are definitely good for anyone who is a makeup newbie. I would definitely recommend :-)</li>
            <li> The Brushes was extremely good and was of very good value for money. they are made perfectly, very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;more than satisfied with this product&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend for other buyers,&lt;br /&gt;also like very much the nice condition of the set upon receiving it, nice bag and warping.&lt;br /&gt;quite awesome product.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes within the two days, and I love them. They have such a high-quality, professional feel. I didn&#x27;t know the brushes were handmade; it made me love them more! I also really love the case and its design as I will be traveling soon, and was hoping the case would be travel-friendly and it is! I will definitely be recommending the brushes to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes - perfect for someone who travels for work.</li>
            <li> They are soft and do the job well</li>
            <li> The powder brush broke apart within three uses. Very disappointing because I had high hopes due to all the glowing reviews here.  UPDATE: After informing the company of the trouble with the powder brush, they sent me a new set. I have had this set for about 8 months now and nothing has broken. These brushes are pretty good.</li>
            <li> I need new brushes, I saw these and decided to give them a shot. I absolutely love them!! They are so soft.  Even after washing, amazing!</li>
            <li> arrived in good condition and the brushes are pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with these brushes.  Great value for the money and so very soft.  Absolutely no shedding!!!  The customer service was fantastic.  I received an email from the seller asking for feedback.  I suggested that a description of each brush and it&#x27;s use would be helpful.  Within a few hours, descriptions were emailed to me.  This seller goes above and beyond and also has an amazing product.  Go for it... you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I love this set of brushes.  So soft and dense.  I use them as my travel set.  They stay in my to-go bag so that I always have clean brushes whenever I need to travel at a minutes notice!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Very well made, high quality. Love the case, brushes are super soft, yet durable. I have used them daily for almost a month so far. Excellent customer service, very proactive! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product! Bought these for my girlfriend and she loves them! The quality is great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves these brushes! They&#x27;re really soft and they haven&#x27;t shed this far. She likes the versatility of being able to use liquid or dry foundation. Before she could only use dry. I don&#x27;t think the white case was the best idea but the products inside more than make up for it. I recommend these without hesitation</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes! Im very pleased with the brushes, surprisingly HIGH QUALITY  for the price, I think I will order a few more for my girls as well.  Very elegant, I LOVE IT!!! :) Hard to beat that price!!!  Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Love the brushes.  They work well, the white case is lovely and the price was great!  I received an email stating they may have a slight odor upon opening them but I did not experience that.  Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t know anything about make up, or how to apply it, I did happen upon these brushes and I do think that they are great.  I&#x27;ve only used them on powder makeup and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in applying with these brushes rather than applicators, fingers, or other utensils of choice.  They do a good job of applying easily and smoothly and will probably save you on the cost of makeup in the long-term - I&#x27;m thinking really really long term though.  They are very soft and handle well.  I had to use a knife to open the white case when if first arrived because that thing is childproof like whoa.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> love the brushes and case!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write too many reviews but this one definitely deserves one. I have bought tons of brushes over the years and nothing compares to these. Best brushes ever. I highly recommend. Cruelty free is a plus !</li>
            <li> Gary brush set. incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them! The eyeliner brush is my favorite one, but I love them all! Great quality!</li>
            <li> This set was great quality for the cost. The bristles are soft, and easy to work with. The case is very nice also.</li>
            <li> this brush is amazing I loved good pruduce I&#x27;m happy to my order #1</li>
            <li> Wonderful set of brushes.  Love the convenient carrying case.</li>
