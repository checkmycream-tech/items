            <li>I did, however, send in my warranty card just to be safe in case</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>The reasons why I am glad I purchased this dryer are:    1)</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE WAY IT DRYS MY HAIR.  </li>
            <li>I would rather pay 50-100.00 more and have it made with metal parts.</li>
            <li>almost didn&#x27;t purchase this since some of the reviews suggested that the top helmet wasn&#x27;t too sturdy and had a tendency to break off.  </li>
            <li>I also wanted to add that I recently had my hair cut by a curly hair specialist who does Deva Cuts, and she said that hard-hat dryers like this one are the best thing to use for curly and wavy hair</li>
            <li>That being said, this still works great for drying, and has held up really well.ut have found neither of these areas to be a problem.  </li>

            <li>It uses IONIC heat that is a more efficient heat source that&#x27;s better for the hair and reduces frizz.</li>
            <li>It makes maintaining my hair at home easier and more affordable.  </li>
            <li>THE MOST....</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the way it compacts for travel.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>Way better for my hair that is bleached.</li>
            <li>but I am sure this is a 5 star product.</li>
            <li>This dyer is so much better.</li>
            <li>I love dome driers and</li>
            <li>I do recommend it for any hair texture as it is better tan using a blow drier, styling tools or any sort of heat mechanisms.</li>
            <li>I love that I do not have to go to the salon to do my hair anymore.</li>
            <li>They love drying off from a shower, under this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>It was more like the one at the salon.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product as I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>but i saw alot of comments about the  top flying off and just wanted to say that it does screw on.</li>
            <li>I give it five stars use often love it</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the performance.  </li>
            <li>stand can adjust to many heights.</li>
            <li>, if you want something more durable spend more than 200.00 dollars because that what salon quality hooded dryers cost.</li>

            <li>Just make sure you have a comfy chair</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE how my hair looks now that I use this thing.</li>

            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO UPSET &amp;#60; WITH THIS PRODUCT&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; for the price you should have a better return police ...</li>

            <li>It is so adorable and I love the color.  </li>
            <li>I was scared to purchase this item because of the reviews about the smell of the heat from the dryer and top purple peace breaking.  </li>
            <li>What I love about it is the height adujstment aspect of it, no longer am I fumbling around with a bonnet</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;ll have much more to say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also love the &amp;#34;Purple People Heater&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I am a stylist and this is great, the dryer is very portable and adjustable....</li>

            <li>She loved it better then the one she saw at a retail store for twice as much money.</li>
            <li>It would be better if the head screwed on so its more secure.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, great product would definitely recommend if you don&#x27;t mind keeping your own time.</li>
            <li>Very good price compare to other hair dryers, and is very chic and beautiful</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this hair dryer when I first got this, but I love it!  </li>
            <li>I first used it yesterday (10/30/2011) and I was very pleased with the way it worked.</li>
            <li>The helmet portion is securely attached, and when I wheel it around or move it to the spare bathroom where I store it, I just make sure that I support the helmet portion so that it won&#x27;t snap off.  </li>

            <li>It was easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>my wife is not an easy person to please</li>
            <li>The bonnet is sturdy, and easily moveable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and set up.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble, no tools needed.</li>
            <li>Easy to put together.  </li>
            <li>But it was easy to put together and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble and to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to put together as well.</li>
            <li>This dryer is great and gets super hot which makes for quick drying time however</li>
            <li>we have used duck tape to keep the top from continuing to fall over, what everyone else says is really true, it does break, i would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and this is awesome on keeping the frizz down</li>
            <li>I am new at doing my own hair (I&#x27;ve always gone to a salon), but I love that this dryer is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I used huge jumbo rollers for an easy at-home blow-dry.</li>
            <li>it works fine to me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, easy to assemble, taking five minutes.</li>
            <li>and you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>I love how quickly it dries my hair and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This works quickly and my hair looks healthy</li>
            <li>I love this dryer gets very hot</li>
            <li>This is such a pleasant experience compared to having to stack books under a table top hair dryer, hoping that it won&#x27;t tip over.    </li>
            <li>It drys my hair evenly, quickly, and I get to browse the internet on my ipad since my hands are free :)</li>
            <li>However after a little trial and error, I found the perfect setting that dries my hair without burning my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am glad this hasn&#x27;t hit anyone in the head as the top is quite large.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made a huge difference</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made a huge difference</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of having my own professional dryer.  </li>
            <li>Cheap....</li>
            <li>Cheap....</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair, doesn&#x27;t take all day and is light weight and mobile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also works great for deep conditioning treatments that require the use of heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It seems like it is really secure, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like it is really secure, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has been fabulous for my daughters curly, course, unruly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to rig up some sort of clamp in order to make it secure.</li>
            <li>Totally adjustable and works great.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair fast and effectively.</li>
            <li>I looked at nothing but the comments before purchasing and a lot of people enjoy it also, which made&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really cheap junk.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable stand is so great too, you can sit at your desk, on your bed and even outside!</li>
            <li>Highly worth it :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been fantastic.</li>
            <li>The wheels are cheap and they will not move freely.</li>
            <li>Frizz free blow-dried hair.</li>
            <li>If only the heat setting was variable, this thing would be great.</li>
            <li>and it still works fabulously.</li>
            <li>I have been using this dryer every week for over four months and it still works fabulously.</li>
            <li>So far it works good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good with this model.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The QUEEN better be satisfied FAST</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>When it did work, I was very pleased with the air output, however, for $119.00, I certainly expected to use it more than four times!</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li>If you use it on high You better have a healthy heart or you&#x27;ll die of a heat stroke.</li>
            <li>Just used this dryer for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised at the great job it did.</li>
            <li>It was super easy to install and can be adjusted to any height.</li>
            <li>It looks cool, it works great, but seems fragile.  </li>
            <li>The installation was quick and easy; I even put it together myself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s height is adjustable, price is competitive and it is super easy to assemble and use.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can roll my hair with the large rollers and they fit comfortably under this dryer.</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY MOBLE, STYLISH, AND EASY TO ADJUST.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and arrived double boxed in great condition.</li>
            <li>At first the dryer worked ok.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>it got really hot on the top but no air...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll do the top of my hair first and then just shift forward in my chair and point the hair dryer towards the lower part of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was excited to get a dryer where I did not have to apply \\&quot;exact\\&quot; heat.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still so excited about it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the dryer because once I set my hair whether its twists or rollers,it doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry.</li>
            <li>It gives me great soft curls that i absolutely adore.</li>
            <li>This is a quiet dryer, very attractive, and easy to move around, and the third that I have purchased.</li>
            <li>, I learned that dryers like this Hot Tools one are great for curly/wavy hair, and I definitely agree!</li>
            <li>expected a great product...</li>
            <li>I wear Sisterlocs and my hair is dense and full.  </li>
            <li>The materials aren&#x27;t the most durable and if you bang it around too much you could break it - or if you drop the head of it.</li>
            <li>He made sure that he reviewed the reviews before the purchase and all turned out very good....but</li>
            <li>AND IM STARTING TO THINK THAT THIS DRYER IS NOT TO GOOD</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a pleasure to be able to sit and read or pay bills while my hair dries and it makes it practical to wash it in the morning before work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a clicking sound that it makes that I&#x27;m not crazy about.  </li>
            <li>(1) There is a clicking sound that it makes that I&#x27;m not crazy about.  </li>
            <li>I bought this dryer in a local beauty supply, is a good dryer</li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t last me a good 6 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it five stars because even though the hot setting is very hot, and the lower setting is very cool</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty sturdy and moves easily over the tiles in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I rarely use a dryer of this sort as I prefer to use the more gentle thermo-stimulator  instead.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is necessarily faster or better than going to the hairdresser, just more convenient.</li>
            <li>Quick Apologies for the typos</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be advised this it doesn&#x27;t get very hot</li>
            <li>This dryer gets very hot.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and you can move it with ease.</li>
            <li>I love my new Tourmaline Ionic Dryer, before I bought it</li>
            <li>Will gladly accept a replacement if I don&#x27;t have to pay a return shipment and will give an updated review when my new one comes in.</li>
            <li>It gets super hot, just wish there was an in-between setting as it is either too hot or too cool!</li>
            <li>so far this the first one i own</li>
            <li>it sounds like something is rattling on the inside and its extremely hot!</li>
            <li>This dryer gets salon hot!</li>
            <li>. Pretty!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 7-27-13:  This dryer is still going strong, and I love it for deep conditioning treatments.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 7-27-13:  This dryer is still going strong, and I love it for deep conditioning treatments.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the setting options and the quick dry time.</li>
            <li>The good news is that the hood is large enough to accomodate a roller set.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about receiving this dryer based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The dryer works great just missing something.</li>
            <li>The ionic feature really make my hair look shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>I have tried every setting I can see on the dryer to see if it actually turns the air warm.</li>
            <li>I was able to completely assemble the dryer in minutes.    </li>
            <li>The motor still runs, though loudly, but not with my head in that hood-no more interest in it.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth my money.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it at her house and finally decided to purchase my own.</li>
            <li>This dryer is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I am trying to make it so I can do all of my extra things to make me look nice at home.</li>
            <li>but I could see in her smile as soon as it was put together</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to do their own hair at home.  </li>
            <li>Heater\\&quot; is powerful and keeps my hands-free to check my emails, put on my makeup, do my nails, read a mag, or just relax...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true but it went away after the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this takes up a lot of room and will cause your friends to make fun of you when they see it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, but its kind of big, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels wonderful after using this dryer and it does not take a long time for my hair to dry.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would purchase a hooded dryer, I was originally looking for the smaller version that packs into the size of a briefcase like my mom used in the 60s.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any complains about this product ;)shipped quickly</li>
            <li>It worked fine for 4 months when the high heat setting quit.</li>
            <li>and after I flat iron my hair...it looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>BTW, right now I am drying my hair by angling the dryer head on the edge of the bed and my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>You have to keep getting out to make it just right for you</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about it tipping over or being the right height</li>
            <li>I could never get the right chair height to sit under it.</li>
            <li>I unplugged it and returned it right away.  </li>
            <li>I am sitting under it right now with a roller set.  </li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m under it right now typing this update.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m under it right now typing this update.</li>
            <li>The high heat gets real hot and you would need ear protectors and the low heat is warm.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast and evenly, gets nice and hot, and just looks aesthetically cool overall.</li>
            <li>As mentioned above, I will be sure to update my review once I see how this holds up with more use, but so far it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>As mentioned above, I will be sure to update my review once I see how this holds up with more use, but so far it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>No, I would spend a little more and hope for one that didn&#x27;t have a rattle and did have a more diverse heat choice.  </li>
            <li>I unplugged the dryer and thought maybe if I gave it a few more days that it would magically reset itself....</li>
            <li>I can finally adjust a dryer to fit my height while sitting comfortably in a chair.</li>
            <li>The dryer itself works really well and the high/ionic setting heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is extremely easy to set this up for the first time (it took me less than five minutes), and, once it&#x27;s set up, is very easy to maneuver and adjust so that it is positioned exactly how and where you want it to be.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Very fast.  </li>
            <li>Only \\&quot;knock\\&quot; is that on high heat it is quite warm-</li>
            <li>Pretty colors but</li>
            <li>Also, I had to purchase the ear covers because it does get hot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I finally bought one.</li>
            <li>All of the parts were very easily recognizable in the instruction manual.</li>
            <li>Before (with a table top) it would take close to 30 minutes to get the same results.    </li>
            <li>Broke the first day of use.</li>
            <li>This is my first roll about dryer</li>
            <li>The first time I turned it on it had a rattle and still does.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time after having it for about a week.</li>
            <li>B000Q37M5M Tourmaline Tools 1059 by Hot Tools</li>
            <li>I tried to resolve through Amazon, too, and although I thought I was getting somewhere, customer service did not follow through with what they first said they could do.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first one three years ago</li>
            <li>Using the same products and techniques before drying, I&#x27;ve found that using this Hot Tools dryer leaves me with zero frizz and lovely curls/</li>
            <li>The air only flows from the top, not from all sides like a salon dryer.</li>
            <li>The hood does not attach to the unit, I almost knocked myself out when i went to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I was willing to overlook that,</li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t blow hot air.</li>
            <li>SO THE FIRST TIME I USED IT</li>
            <li>, it gets hot and gets the job done...</li>
            <li>However over time I noticed the heat element changing and it wasn&#x27;t get as HOT as before.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever had an issue with the bonnet head coming off the pole.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what was described</li>
            <li>Did I mention this was my FIRST time using it after purchase?</li>
            <li>The top with the hood only sits on the frame pole.  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer does exactly what they say.</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive at first.</li>
            <li>they are pretty hot.  </li>
            <li>there were a more quiet version, I&#x27;d be all over it</li>
            <li>The bonnet is sturdy, and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time (today) to bleach my hair.  </li>
            <li>Now that I did that, it is really hot.</li>
            <li>Now that I did that, it is really hot.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot.  </li>
            <li>The other issue is that the head is kind of tricky to adjust from underneath.</li>
            <li>Liked the design but had to return because it was extremely noisy.</li>
            <li>the dryer is a little loud, you can&#x27;t really watch a tv show, but you can get some great reading in.  </li>
            <li>The return policy was less than 30 days, and I wouldnt have been able to get a full refund.</li>
            <li>assembly is pretty easy and no tools are really necessary.</li>
            <li>THE MONEY AND SHIPPING WAS PRETTY FAST.</li>
            <li>Helen of Troy does not help what so ever with the warranty, the cost to ship is as much as the dryer costs in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use this dryer mostly for deep conditioning treatments and wet rollers, and love it.</li>
            <li>With the stand, you are able to adjust the height for an adult and then down to a young child very easily.</li>
            <li>Received this item promptly--- Easy to assemble-  I have used it several times with</li>
            <li>I wash my hair, apply my favorite product and sit under the dry anywhere from 10-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I also love how the height is adjustable--I can literally dry my hair while sitting on my couch reading a magazine, quite the luxury.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 11/1/11:  I&#x27;ve had this dryer now for about ten months, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 11/1/11:  I&#x27;ve had this dryer now for about ten months, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>This attachment point is critical in this type of dryer, and should be strong.</li>
            <li>Fits her large rollers with ease.</li>
            <li>I cut off my burnt hair (from the using a hand-held bower dryer) and my new hair is growing in lovely.</li>
            <li>I cut off my burnt hair (from the using a hand-held bower dryer) and my new hair is growing in lovely.</li>
            <li>Long story short, I bought this one where I can comfortably sit at the table, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing at this very moment, drying my hair with this lovely hair dryer and typing this review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing is: When the dryer is on HIGH does not feel HOT, yet it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Very good heating; even distribution, but difficult to hear anything while you are under the dome.  </li>
            <li>The drying time is much faster as it states.  </li>
            <li>I should not have been cheap, and should have just spent the extra hundred on a better dryer.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much up much space and it can be rolled into a closet when you want it out of sight.  </li>
            <li>This thing works very well.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll have the whole helmet in your hands.</li>
            <li>This dryer makes my life so much easier.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, my sister really likes it.</li>
            <li>and it dries fast.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair very well</li>
            <li>Drys very well.</li>
            <li>I was worried that this hood wouldn&#x27;t allow for my entire head to fit in it.</li>
            <li>am very unsatisfied with this dryer and out $100.</li>
            <li>It is much faster and easier than using a blow dryer and diffuser.  </li>
            <li>, ITS ALSO VERY NOSY...</li>
            <li>Recommend highly!</li>
            <li>but this dryer really helps to speed up the process.  </li>
            <li>but is just not going to be as fast and doesn&#x27;t have ions or tourmaline.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It worked FABULOUS for deep conditioning and wave/roller sets.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very often</li>
            <li>if straight) to an 1 1/2 (in rollers).</li>
            <li>I either had to sit hunched on the floor to sit under it or had to sit on several pillows just to fit under it at a table.</li>
            <li>Really too soon to rate</li>
            <li>Its quite and doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses it, not just me.  </li>
            <li>The stand works very well very convenient</li>
            <li>It dries hair relatively fast and although it doesn&#x27;t have &#x27;medium heat&#x27; feature</li>
            <li>The communication was fast, the seller addressed my issues, with professionalism</li>
            <li>Really like this dryer..</li>
            <li>/&gt;me comfortable enough to try it!</li>
            <li>It dries hair really fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the ion setting makes any difference or not haven&#x27;t really had a chance to play with that much.  </li>
            <li>and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li>No tired hands, no tugging and no need to drive to a hair saloon.</li>
            <li>Very easy!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel so comfortable sitting in this chair and double tasking.r for me</li>
            <li>I feel so comfortable sitting in this chair and double tasking.</li>
            <li>I have no Idea if it does what it says because I didn&#x27;t really gauge the before and after.</li>
            <li>my window&amp;#34; ... really ????</li>
            <li>As for the purple top piece i would be careful..</li>
            <li>Now my hair looks good for at least 3 days.</li>
            <li>Before the hand-held dryer, I used to use the table top-bonnet dryer and my hair was soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to assemble but not super sturdy.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not exactly where I want it to be while I&#x27;m drying, I can easily turn around while sitting on my stool and adjust it so that it is right where I want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>While it was easy to assemble, pretty in looks, got under the dryer setting the control first at high speed, got a little too HOT</li>
            <li>There is no setup/takedown fuss: When you&#x27;re done, you simply roll it out of the way, the height of the dryer will not change, which makes it super easy during your next sitting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty loud when it&#x27;s on high, but I think it&#x27;s a fair trade in order to have my hair dry entirely.</li>
            <li>But not so enjoyable experiences with other hooded home dryers let to years of procrastination.</li>
            <li>Other than that, love it.</li>
            <li>If you are like me before buying this dryer, I couldn&#x27;t find a table high enough to fit the table to carry dryers.</li>
            <li>It works really well, fast and high quality.</li>
            <li>It is very quick to dry</li>
            <li>I use this project primary for deep conditioning and quick drying bantu knots or similar styles that didn&#x27;t have a chance to finish drying overnight.  </li>
            <li>However, it dries very well and can do the job without being on high.</li>
            <li>Overall, the dryer works very well, heats quickly and isn&#x27;t too noisy.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, having a high and low heat setting and a high and low speed setting.  </li>
            <li>However, my hair is now mid-back, and it&#x27;s too long to fit under this.</li>
            <li>However, my hair is now mid-back, and it&#x27;s too long to fit under this.</li>
            <li>The low is cool air.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because even though I&#x27;ve only tried it once and had a hard time with the curlers, the product itself was great.</li>
            <li>I like this dryer much better than my previous one and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>The knobs are easy to reach without getting up, so it&#x27;s really not disruptive at all, and I can personalize the amount of heat I want.  </li>
            <li>but if a newer model came out that made less noise, I&#x27;d jump on top of it and hand this version over to my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if a newer model came out that made less noise, I&#x27;d jump on top of it and hand this version over to my mom.     </li>
            <li>Save the money and invest in something more durable, quiet, and with an open face door that allows for easier moving in and out of the dryer.  </li>
            <li>Once you install larger rollers the space shrinks quickly.  </li>
            <li>The only draw back is that I can&#x27;t watch TV while in the dryer because when there are to many electrical things on at the time as the dryer my power goes out.</li>
            <li>But, the heat only comes from the top and relies on the enclosure to bring the heat to the back, front and sides.</li>
            <li>My head with curlers is too big to fit under completely.</li>
            <li>Has a slight rattle sound when I first turn it on</li>
            <li>All of the mechanical stuff is in the top part, so the remaining space inside is rather shallow and flat at the top.</li>
            <li>On High, Ionic Off High.</li>
            <li>Watt High Heat Portable Salon Dryer]]anymore.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>If I put it in high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Touraline Tools 1059.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this well-made, durable hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I cut the dryer on the HIGH heat, with the IONIC setting on.  </li>
            <li>and I am now buying my second one because I broke the first when moving, oops!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 5/13/11:  I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a little over four months, and continue to love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 5/13/11:  I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a little over four months, and continue to love it.  </li>
            <li>Works very well so far....</li>
            <li>so my hair is part natural at the roots and part straight (chemically) on the length.  </li>
            <li>Well, it dries very well if you have 2 hours to sit in front of the TV, however, it&#x27;s EXTREMELY loud.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair much faster than my old hooded dryer.</li>
            <li>I love it for the things this type of dryer offers which is not specific to this actual product:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I rollerset my hair and sat under the dryer for 1 hour instead of my normal 2 hour.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this dryer, but I&#x27;ve listed a few notes for you to help you decide.  </li>
            <li>This dryer does not feel HOT like burning so that is a good thing, I was afraid it might be too hot for me, not hotter than my handheld blow dryer which is also 1875.  </li>
            <li>Not only was I surprised at the speedy turnaround, but this unit works properly and The QUEEN is well pleased.</li>
            <li>I was able to assemble it in less than 15 minutes no tools needed !</li>
            <li>The dryer does not snap on properly and will fall to the ground if you do not pick it up right.</li>
            <li>Also that little issue is not kid friendly so BEWARE! ...</li>
            <li>I did hear that crackling/rattling sound described by the other buyers, but it soon went away.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have the low setting a little warmer because as it stands now, it has no purpose.</li>
            <li>I could never get the legs to stay on and the high level is to hot and low</li>
            <li>Things to be aware of the legs on the bottom of the stand are wide like an office chair so you cannot successfully sit under the dryer while in an office chair because the two sets of legs get in the way of each other, try a folding chair or a kitchen table chair where the legs go straight down</li>
            <li>and I live in MA.</li>
            <li>this new computer is auto correcting</li>
            <li>I live in South Florida so the heat and humidity doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick dry.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair fairly quickly; before I know it, my hair&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li>The settings are basically &amp;#34;too cool&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;scorching&amp;#34; so be prepared to switch back and forth between the two - but otherwise dried my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very loud -</li>
            <li>To purchase another unit, at a higher price and pay shipping for the 3rd time ruled out requesting a refund.</li>
            <li>But if your a natural that&#x27;s looking for a hooded drier and do not want to risk over drying your hair or experiencing heat damage this is for you!.</li>
            <li>&quot; I believe and I do not have a small head -- no problems fitting under the dryer.  </li>
            <li>Got this dryer last week 11/23/2012 used it for the first time tonight 11/27/2012,</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I can sit at the table comfortable not worrying if the bonnet will flop forward down on my face.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>hair turns out super shiny and smooth and no more weird fly-aways at the top of my head anymore!</li>
            <li>I  tie a bun with the rest of my hair on the rear half of my head, and secure it with a prong.</li>
            <li>I just get lots of cool air which eventually drys my hair by the sheer power of it but not quickly enough.</li>
            <li>The dryer can go from low to extremely high heat the minute you turn the dial, and eventhough the dryer becomes extremely hot, it does not dry out your hair!  </li>
            <li>it cuts my drying time in half better then the regular dryers in the salon</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important to get the connections tight before placing the hood on.</li>
            <li>It dried my hair quickly and it feels so soft, i used the ionic setting and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, in my opinion, if you condition or dry your hair a lot!</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast, and continues that same same high speed temperature throughout the sitting.  </li>
            <li>She has thick hair and it dries very nicely and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this dryer for a little over a week, so I will be sure to update my review once I&#x27;ve had it a bit longer.  </li>
            <li>First, it only has two settings; low and high.</li>
            <li>SOFT AND SHINY.</li>
            <li>However, my experience was more like the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>I purchased this dryer to help with the styling of mine and my daughters natural 4b and 4c hair.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is not for ethnic naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely loud, so you cannot listen to the television - even on volume 70.  </li>
            <li>I needed a dryer for myself and my two young daughters.</li>
            <li>Professional Tourmaline Ionic 1875</li>
            <li>It works really well, is sturdy, and makes multi-tasking while drying my hair so simple.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, is sturdy, and makes multi-tasking while drying my hair so simple.  </li>
            <li>This was the bests thing I have ever bought for my 11 year old.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s height adjustable), getting too hot, or taking too long.  </li>
            <li>With the ionic setting my hair dries very fast--I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely loud.</li>
            <li>my 2 yr old son is always trying to play with it and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sturdy and professional item.</li>
            <li>No wasted time.</li>
            <li>, they took action in a way I was not expecting, they adjust my bill by giving me a discount, voluntarily...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had the dryer for almost a year and no problems so far (fingers crossed).</li>
            <li>yes it is too loud to hear the volume from underneath</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft like baby hair.  </li>
            <li>There are different temperature and strength settings, and it works fast and dries evenly.</li>
            <li>My husband fixed it with some sort of glue.</li>
            <li>I would like to give 5 stars, but the construction is all plastic and its too early to judge its durability over time.</li>
            <li>My husband surprised me with this to help in my Curly Girl Method.  </li>
            <li>2nd time the noise got higher and louder and apparently hotter because it melted an inch of the inside grid.  </li>
            <li>Sad as I loved the color combination which would match our salon.</li>
            <li>I love having this at home, no more blow drying for me, now i relax and read while drying my hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given up trying to fit it into a closet of concealed space, and I let mine sit in the bathroom in plain view.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot and the tourmaline helps dry your hair faster.</li>
            <li>SURE IT WOULD TAKE LESS TIME TO DRY WITH A ROLLER SET.  </li>
            <li>It is not tall enough to dry hair while standing though but it quickly adjust to varies sitting heights.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty loud, but that is expected with hair dryers.</li>
            <li>Overall, it worked pretty well, but there were several cons.</li>
            <li>BUT THE MAIN REASON I THOUGHT IT WAS NOT SUCH</li>
            <li>The pole is a bit wobbly because it is top heavy, and after 1 year of light use you can hear the fan is out of round and makes an irritating wobbling sound.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it for when I roller set my hair or deep condition it.  </li>
            <li>The high temp is a smidge too high and the low is too low.  </li>
            <li>high pitch then low as if  &amp;#34;out of control.&amp;#34;  Hmm, fluke, try this again...</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are also a speed (High, Low, off) and heat (high &amp; low) setting.</li>
            <li>The dryer is noisy whether its on high or low speed</li>
            <li>It does not extend high enough for clients to sit in a chair under it.  </li>
            <li>Its not a bad blow dryer it just takes a really long time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>IT DOES A SMALL RATTLE SOUND</li>
            <li>No more crooks in my neck and it allows me to sit comfortably</li>
            <li>but it makes a little more noise than expected.  </li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t have to do it again, unlike the other typical table top hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>They only give you 2 Low &amp; High Low takes to long to dry your hair and the Hot is to hot.</li>
            <li>The only drawback here is that when traveling to different clients you really need them seated before you know what height to adjust the hood</li>
            <li>When I am under it it seems loud, but when I am standing next to it, it isn&#x27;t loud at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell went away and I sat for 30 minutes at low speed and when I turned to high speed, it went completely out after only 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>(In the past, with my handheld bonnet dryer, my ears burned.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>This unit could be better, the high is to hot and the low is cold.</li>
            <li>however, you should treat it gently, the plastic part that holds the head on the metal base breaks easily, is made of a cheap plastic</li>
            <li>There are only 2 heat settings Low &amp; High.  </li>
            <li>It shorted out completely after the next use.</li>
            <li>all of a sudden we hear a loud noise from the hood</li>
            <li>(I had used one of those bonnet-style soft dryers where you connect a handheld hair dryer and try drying your locks that way with mixed success).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long hair and drying it, normally takes between 2-3 hours per salon visit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I could probably find a way to rig it, but it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>For that kind of money and for wanting to go from a blow dryer to this type, I immediately got angry thinking if I keep this piece of junk with the motor clicking like it was</li>
            <li>and it can be a little tricky tightening it at the right level without bumping their head.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly my entire head fits comfortably; not tight at all.</li>
            <li>The only issue is it&#x27;s large and cumbersome which is annoying but worth having and love it.</li>
            <li>So actually there are only 2 heat settings ( Low and High)</li>
            <li>It is SO worth the little bit of extra compared to blow dryers and dryers with bonnet attachments.  </li>
            <li>The hood seems a little top heavy for the stand</li>
            <li>and it seems to get so hot that my hair needs lots of conditioners the next day it not worth the money...</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is a really great solution if you are like me and hate those old school hair dryers that you have to put on the table...</li>
            <li>I have natural African American hair and it works well when I want to make my braid out or roller set</li>
            <li>Well in regards to that it does smell a little funny probably because it has been sitting in a factory</li>
            <li>It turned on blowing hot air for less than a second and then stopped working.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, SUPER FAST SHIPPING!  </li>
            <li>The hood is big enough for the largest roller-set but the lid for the face is hard to adjust to a comfortable angle.</li>
            <li>Only con is the drying time, especially if your used to using the larger professional dryers.</li>
            <li>She has sooo much hair and hates to dry it and won&#x27;t let me dry it for her.</li>
            <li>Too much pressure is placed on the plastic portion as you have to pull down the purple visor or angle the hood.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always purchased the typical table top dryer from beauty stores and just got tired of it not putting out the same constant heat level which left my hair damp in certain areas.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always purchased the typical table top dryer from beauty stores and just got tired of it not putting out the same constant heat level which left my hair damp in certain areas.  </li>
            <li>It usually takes me more than two hours to dry (when two hours are up, the ends are still wet).</li>
            <li>This is probably due to the high amount of electricity it pulls.</li>
            <li>I knew I needed a professional style dryer to dry my curls.</li>
            <li>This is an issue because on low you never dry.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to position behind any chair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t lower the purple hood down enough so my hair wasn&#x27;t drying fast.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t lower the purple hood down enough so my hair wasn&#x27;t drying fast.</li>
            <li>have long straight hair that takes a long time to dry and style.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is heavy and large and will cost well over $30 to ship back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this is neither a good or bad one</li>

            <li> I LOVE THE WAY IT DRYS MY HAIR.  </li>
            <li> I would rather pay 50-100.00 more and have it made with metal parts.</li>
            <li> almost didn&#x27;t purchase this since some of the reviews suggested that the top helmet wasn&#x27;t too sturdy and had a tendency to break off.  </li>
            <li> I also wanted to add that I recently had my hair cut by a curly hair specialist who does Deva Cuts, and she said that hard-hat dryers like this one are the best thing to use for curly and wavy hair</li>
            <li> That being said, this still works great for drying, and has held up really well.ut have found neither of these areas to be a problem.  </li>

            <li> I would recommend this product as I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> but i saw alot of comments about the  top flying off and just wanted to say that it does screw on.</li>

            <li> , I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the performance.  </li>
            <li> stand can adjust to many heights.</li>

            <li> I was scared to purchase this item because of the reviews about the smell of the heat from the dryer and top purple peace breaking.  </li>
            <li> What I love about it is the height adujstment aspect of it, no longer am I fumbling around with a bonnet</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ll have much more to say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> She loved it better then the one she saw at a retail store for twice as much money.</li>
            <li> It would be better if the head screwed on so its more secure.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, great product would definitely recommend if you don&#x27;t mind keeping your own time.</li>
            <li> Very good price compare to other hair dryers, and is very chic and beautiful</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this hair dryer when I first got this, but I love it!  </li>
            <li> I first used it yesterday (10/30/2011) and I was very pleased with the way it worked.</li>
            <li> The helmet portion is securely attached, and when I wheel it around or move it to the spare bathroom where I store it, I just make sure that I support the helmet portion so that it won&#x27;t snap off.  </li>

            <li> This has been fabulous for my daughters curly, course, unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to rig up some sort of clamp in order to make it secure.</li>
            <li> Totally adjustable and works great.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast and effectively.</li>
            <li> I looked at nothing but the comments before purchasing and a lot of people enjoy it also, which made&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really cheap junk.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable stand is so great too, you can sit at your desk, on your bed and even outside!</li>
            <li> Highly worth it :)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been fantastic.</li>
            <li> The wheels are cheap and they will not move freely.</li>
            <li> Frizz free blow-dried hair.</li>
            <li> If only the heat setting was variable, this thing would be great.</li>
            <li> and it still works fabulously.</li>
            <li> I have been using this dryer every week for over four months and it still works fabulously.</li>
            <li> So far it works good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good with this model.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The QUEEN better be satisfied FAST</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> When it did work, I was very pleased with the air output, however, for $119.00, I certainly expected to use it more than four times!</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> If you use it on high You better have a healthy heart or you&#x27;ll die of a heat stroke.</li>
            <li> Just used this dryer for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised at the great job it did.</li>
            <li> It was super easy to install and can be adjusted to any height.</li>
            <li> It looks cool, it works great, but seems fragile.  </li>
            <li> The installation was quick and easy; I even put it together myself.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s height is adjustable, price is competitive and it is super easy to assemble and use.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can roll my hair with the large rollers and they fit comfortably under this dryer.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY MOBLE, STYLISH, AND EASY TO ADJUST.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and arrived double boxed in great condition.</li>
            <li> At first the dryer worked ok.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> it got really hot on the top but no air...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do the top of my hair first and then just shift forward in my chair and point the hair dryer towards the lower part of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was excited to get a dryer where I did not have to apply \\&quot;exact\\&quot; heat.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still so excited about it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the dryer because once I set my hair whether its twists or rollers,it doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> It gives me great soft curls that i absolutely adore.</li>
            <li> This is a quiet dryer, very attractive, and easy to move around, and the third that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> , I learned that dryers like this Hot Tools one are great for curly/wavy hair, and I definitely agree!</li>
            <li> expected a great product...</li>
            <li> I wear Sisterlocs and my hair is dense and full.  </li>
            <li> The materials aren&#x27;t the most durable and if you bang it around too much you could break it - or if you drop the head of it.</li>
            <li> He made sure that he reviewed the reviews before the purchase and all turned out very good....but</li>
            <li> AND IM STARTING TO THINK THAT THIS DRYER IS NOT TO GOOD</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a pleasure to be able to sit and read or pay bills while my hair dries and it makes it practical to wash it in the morning before work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a clicking sound that it makes that I&#x27;m not crazy about.  </li>
            <li> (1) There is a clicking sound that it makes that I&#x27;m not crazy about.  </li>
            <li> I bought this dryer in a local beauty supply, is a good dryer</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t last me a good 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it five stars because even though the hot setting is very hot, and the lower setting is very cool</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty sturdy and moves easily over the tiles in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I rarely use a dryer of this sort as I prefer to use the more gentle thermo-stimulator  instead.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is necessarily faster or better than going to the hairdresser, just more convenient.</li>
            <li> Quick Apologies for the typos</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be advised this it doesn&#x27;t get very hot</li>
            <li> This dryer gets very hot.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and you can move it with ease.</li>
            <li> I love my new Tourmaline Ionic Dryer, before I bought it</li>
            <li> Will gladly accept a replacement if I don&#x27;t have to pay a return shipment and will give an updated review when my new one comes in.</li>
            <li> It gets super hot, just wish there was an in-between setting as it is either too hot or too cool!</li>
            <li> so far this the first one i own</li>
            <li> it sounds like something is rattling on the inside and its extremely hot!</li>
            <li> This dryer gets salon hot!</li>
            <li> . Pretty!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE ON 7-27-13:  This dryer is still going strong, and I love it for deep conditioning treatments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE ON 7-27-13:  This dryer is still going strong, and I love it for deep conditioning treatments.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the setting options and the quick dry time.</li>
            <li> The good news is that the hood is large enough to accomodate a roller set.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about receiving this dryer based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The dryer works great just missing something.</li>
            <li> The ionic feature really make my hair look shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> I have tried every setting I can see on the dryer to see if it actually turns the air warm.</li>
            <li> I was able to completely assemble the dryer in minutes.    </li>
            <li> The motor still runs, though loudly, but not with my head in that hood-no more interest in it.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth my money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it at her house and finally decided to purchase my own.</li>
            <li> This dryer is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to make it so I can do all of my extra things to make me look nice at home.</li>
            <li> but I could see in her smile as soon as it was put together</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to do their own hair at home.  </li>
            <li> Heater\\&quot; is powerful and keeps my hands-free to check my emails, put on my makeup, do my nails, read a mag, or just relax...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true but it went away after the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this takes up a lot of room and will cause your friends to make fun of you when they see it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, but its kind of big, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels wonderful after using this dryer and it does not take a long time for my hair to dry.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would purchase a hooded dryer, I was originally looking for the smaller version that packs into the size of a briefcase like my mom used in the 60s.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complains about this product ;)shipped quickly</li>
            <li> It worked fine for 4 months when the high heat setting quit.</li>
            <li> and after I flat iron my hair...it looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> BTW, right now I am drying my hair by angling the dryer head on the edge of the bed and my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> You have to keep getting out to make it just right for you</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about it tipping over or being the right height</li>
            <li> I could never get the right chair height to sit under it.</li>
            <li> I unplugged it and returned it right away.  </li>
            <li> I am sitting under it right now with a roller set.  </li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m under it right now typing this update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m under it right now typing this update.</li>
            <li> The high heat gets real hot and you would need ear protectors and the low heat is warm.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast and evenly, gets nice and hot, and just looks aesthetically cool overall.</li>
            <li> As mentioned above, I will be sure to update my review once I see how this holds up with more use, but so far it&#x27;s</li>

            <li> No, I would spend a little more and hope for one that didn&#x27;t have a rattle and did have a more diverse heat choice.  </li>
            <li> I unplugged the dryer and thought maybe if I gave it a few more days that it would magically reset itself....</li>
            <li> I can finally adjust a dryer to fit my height while sitting comfortably in a chair.</li>
            <li> The dryer itself works really well and the high/ionic setting heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is extremely easy to set this up for the first time (it took me less than five minutes), and, once it&#x27;s set up, is very easy to maneuver and adjust so that it is positioned exactly how and where you want it to be.  </li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> Very fast.  </li>
            <li> Only \\&quot;knock\\&quot; is that on high heat it is quite warm-</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but</li>
            <li> Also, I had to purchase the ear covers because it does get hot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I finally bought one.</li>
            <li> All of the parts were very easily recognizable in the instruction manual.</li>
            <li> Before (with a table top) it would take close to 30 minutes to get the same results.    </li>
            <li> Broke the first day of use.</li>
            <li> This is my first roll about dryer</li>
            <li> The first time I turned it on it had a rattle and still does.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time after having it for about a week.</li>
            <li> B000Q37M5M Tourmaline Tools 1059 by Hot Tools</li>
            <li> I tried to resolve through Amazon, too, and although I thought I was getting somewhere, customer service did not follow through with what they first said they could do.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first one three years ago</li>
            <li> Using the same products and techniques before drying, I&#x27;ve found that using this Hot Tools dryer leaves me with zero frizz and lovely curls/</li>
            <li> The air only flows from the top, not from all sides like a salon dryer.</li>
            <li> The hood does not attach to the unit, I almost knocked myself out when i went to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I was willing to overlook that,</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t blow hot air.</li>
            <li> SO THE FIRST TIME I USED IT</li>
            <li> , it gets hot and gets the job done...</li>
            <li> However over time I noticed the heat element changing and it wasn&#x27;t get as HOT as before.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever had an issue with the bonnet head coming off the pole.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what was described</li>
            <li> Did I mention this was my FIRST time using it after purchase?</li>
            <li> The top with the hood only sits on the frame pole.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer does exactly what they say.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first.</li>
            <li> they are pretty hot.  </li>
            <li> there were a more quiet version, I&#x27;d be all over it</li>
            <li> The bonnet is sturdy, and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time (today) to bleach my hair.  </li>
            <li> Now that I did that, it is really hot.</li>
            <li> Now that I did that, it is really hot.</li>
            <li> It does not get hot.  </li>
            <li> The other issue is that the head is kind of tricky to adjust from underneath.</li>
            <li> Liked the design but had to return because it was extremely noisy.</li>
            <li> the dryer is a little loud, you can&#x27;t really watch a tv show, but you can get some great reading in.  </li>
            <li> The return policy was less than 30 days, and I wouldnt have been able to get a full refund.</li>
            <li> assembly is pretty easy and no tools are really necessary.</li>
            <li> THE MONEY AND SHIPPING WAS PRETTY FAST.</li>
            <li> Helen of Troy does not help what so ever with the warranty, the cost to ship is as much as the dryer costs in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use this dryer mostly for deep conditioning treatments and wet rollers, and love it.</li>
            <li> With the stand, you are able to adjust the height for an adult and then down to a young child very easily.</li>
            <li> Received this item promptly--- Easy to assemble-  I have used it several times with</li>
            <li> I wash my hair, apply my favorite product and sit under the dry anywhere from 10-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I also love how the height is adjustable--I can literally dry my hair while sitting on my couch reading a magazine, quite the luxury.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE ON 11/1/11:  I&#x27;ve had this dryer now for about ten months, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE ON 11/1/11:  I&#x27;ve had this dryer now for about ten months, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> This attachment point is critical in this type of dryer, and should be strong.</li>
            <li> Fits her large rollers with ease.</li>
            <li> I cut off my burnt hair (from the using a hand-held bower dryer) and my new hair is growing in lovely.</li>
            <li> I cut off my burnt hair (from the using a hand-held bower dryer) and my new hair is growing in lovely.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I bought this one where I can comfortably sit at the table, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing at this very moment, drying my hair with this lovely hair dryer and typing this review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing is: When the dryer is on HIGH does not feel HOT, yet it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Very good heating; even distribution, but difficult to hear anything while you are under the dome.  </li>
            <li> The drying time is much faster as it states.  </li>
            <li> I should not have been cheap, and should have just spent the extra hundred on a better dryer.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much up much space and it can be rolled into a closet when you want it out of sight.  </li>
            <li> This thing works very well.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll have the whole helmet in your hands.</li>
            <li> This dryer makes my life so much easier.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, my sister really likes it.</li>
            <li> and it dries fast.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair very well</li>
            <li> Drys very well.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this hood wouldn&#x27;t allow for my entire head to fit in it.</li>
            <li> am very unsatisfied with this dryer and out $100.</li>
            <li> It is much faster and easier than using a blow dryer and diffuser.  </li>
            <li> , ITS ALSO VERY NOSY...</li>
            <li> Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> but this dryer really helps to speed up the process.  </li>
            <li> but is just not going to be as fast and doesn&#x27;t have ions or tourmaline.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It worked FABULOUS for deep conditioning and wave/roller sets.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often</li>
            <li> if straight) to an 1 1/2 (in rollers).</li>
            <li> I either had to sit hunched on the floor to sit under it or had to sit on several pillows just to fit under it at a table.</li>
            <li> Really too soon to rate</li>
            <li> Its quite and doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses it, not just me.  </li>
            <li> The stand works very well very convenient</li>
            <li> It dries hair relatively fast and although it doesn&#x27;t have &#x27;medium heat&#x27; feature</li>
            <li> The communication was fast, the seller addressed my issues, with professionalism</li>
            <li> Really like this dryer..</li>
            <li> /&gt;me comfortable enough to try it!</li>
            <li> It dries hair really fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the ion setting makes any difference or not haven&#x27;t really had a chance to play with that much.  </li>
            <li> and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li> No tired hands, no tugging and no need to drive to a hair saloon.</li>
            <li> Very easy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel so comfortable sitting in this chair and double tasking.r for me</li>
            <li> I feel so comfortable sitting in this chair and double tasking.</li>
            <li> I have no Idea if it does what it says because I didn&#x27;t really gauge the before and after.</li>
            <li> my window&amp;#34; ... really ????</li>
            <li> As for the purple top piece i would be careful..</li>
            <li> Now my hair looks good for at least 3 days.</li>
            <li> Before the hand-held dryer, I used to use the table top-bonnet dryer and my hair was soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to assemble but not super sturdy.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not exactly where I want it to be while I&#x27;m drying, I can easily turn around while sitting on my stool and adjust it so that it is right where I want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> While it was easy to assemble, pretty in looks, got under the dryer setting the control first at high speed, got a little too HOT</li>
            <li> There is no setup/takedown fuss: When you&#x27;re done, you simply roll it out of the way, the height of the dryer will not change, which makes it super easy during your next sitting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty loud when it&#x27;s on high, but I think it&#x27;s a fair trade in order to have my hair dry entirely.</li>
            <li> But not so enjoyable experiences with other hooded home dryers let to years of procrastination.</li>
            <li> Other than that, love it.</li>
            <li> If you are like me before buying this dryer, I couldn&#x27;t find a table high enough to fit the table to carry dryers.</li>
            <li> It works really well, fast and high quality.</li>
            <li> It is very quick to dry</li>
            <li> I use this project primary for deep conditioning and quick drying bantu knots or similar styles that didn&#x27;t have a chance to finish drying overnight.  </li>
            <li> However, it dries very well and can do the job without being on high.</li>
            <li> Overall, the dryer works very well, heats quickly and isn&#x27;t too noisy.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, having a high and low heat setting and a high and low speed setting.  </li>
            <li> However, my hair is now mid-back, and it&#x27;s too long to fit under this.</li>
            <li> However, my hair is now mid-back, and it&#x27;s too long to fit under this.</li>
            <li> The low is cool air.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because even though I&#x27;ve only tried it once and had a hard time with the curlers, the product itself was great.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer much better than my previous one and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> The knobs are easy to reach without getting up, so it&#x27;s really not disruptive at all, and I can personalize the amount of heat I want.  </li>
            <li> but if a newer model came out that made less noise, I&#x27;d jump on top of it and hand this version over to my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if a newer model came out that made less noise, I&#x27;d jump on top of it and hand this version over to my mom.     </li>
            <li> Save the money and invest in something more durable, quiet, and with an open face door that allows for easier moving in and out of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> Once you install larger rollers the space shrinks quickly.  </li>
            <li> The only draw back is that I can&#x27;t watch TV while in the dryer because when there are to many electrical things on at the time as the dryer my power goes out.</li>
            <li> But, the heat only comes from the top and relies on the enclosure to bring the heat to the back, front and sides.</li>
            <li> My head with curlers is too big to fit under completely.</li>
            <li> Has a slight rattle sound when I first turn it on</li>
            <li> All of the mechanical stuff is in the top part, so the remaining space inside is rather shallow and flat at the top.</li>
            <li> On High, Ionic Off High.</li>
            <li> Watt High Heat Portable Salon Dryer]]anymore.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> If I put it in high</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Touraline Tools 1059.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this well-made, durable hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I cut the dryer on the HIGH heat, with the IONIC setting on.  </li>
            <li> and I am now buying my second one because I broke the first when moving, oops!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE ON 5/13/11:  I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a little over four months, and continue to love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE ON 5/13/11:  I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a little over four months, and continue to love it.  </li>
            <li> Works very well so far....</li>
            <li> so my hair is part natural at the roots and part straight (chemically) on the length.  </li>
            <li> Well, it dries very well if you have 2 hours to sit in front of the TV, however, it&#x27;s EXTREMELY loud.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair much faster than my old hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> I love it for the things this type of dryer offers which is not specific to this actual product:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I rollerset my hair and sat under the dryer for 1 hour instead of my normal 2 hour.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dryer, but I&#x27;ve listed a few notes for you to help you decide.  </li>
            <li> This dryer does not feel HOT like burning so that is a good thing, I was afraid it might be too hot for me, not hotter than my handheld blow dryer which is also 1875.  </li>
            <li> Not only was I surprised at the speedy turnaround, but this unit works properly and The QUEEN is well pleased.</li>
            <li> I was able to assemble it in less than 15 minutes no tools needed !</li>
            <li> The dryer does not snap on properly and will fall to the ground if you do not pick it up right.</li>
            <li> Also that little issue is not kid friendly so BEWARE! ...</li>
            <li> I did hear that crackling/rattling sound described by the other buyers, but it soon went away.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have the low setting a little warmer because as it stands now, it has no purpose.</li>
            <li> I could never get the legs to stay on and the high level is to hot and low</li>
            <li> Things to be aware of the legs on the bottom of the stand are wide like an office chair so you cannot successfully sit under the dryer while in an office chair because the two sets of legs get in the way of each other, try a folding chair or a kitchen table chair where the legs go straight down</li>
            <li> and I live in MA.</li>
            <li> this new computer is auto correcting</li>
            <li> I live in South Florida so the heat and humidity doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quick dry.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fairly quickly; before I know it, my hair&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> The settings are basically &amp;#34;too cool&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;scorching&amp;#34; so be prepared to switch back and forth between the two - but otherwise dried my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very loud -</li>
            <li> To purchase another unit, at a higher price and pay shipping for the 3rd time ruled out requesting a refund.</li>
            <li> But if your a natural that&#x27;s looking for a hooded drier and do not want to risk over drying your hair or experiencing heat damage this is for you!.</li>
            <li> &quot; I believe and I do not have a small head -- no problems fitting under the dryer.  </li>
            <li> Got this dryer last week 11/23/2012 used it for the first time tonight 11/27/2012,</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can sit at the table comfortable not worrying if the bonnet will flop forward down on my face.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> hair turns out super shiny and smooth and no more weird fly-aways at the top of my head anymore!</li>
            <li> I  tie a bun with the rest of my hair on the rear half of my head, and secure it with a prong.</li>
            <li> I just get lots of cool air which eventually drys my hair by the sheer power of it but not quickly enough.</li>
            <li> The dryer can go from low to extremely high heat the minute you turn the dial, and eventhough the dryer becomes extremely hot, it does not dry out your hair!  </li>
            <li> it cuts my drying time in half better then the regular dryers in the salon</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important to get the connections tight before placing the hood on.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair quickly and it feels so soft, i used the ionic setting and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, in my opinion, if you condition or dry your hair a lot!</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast, and continues that same same high speed temperature throughout the sitting.  </li>
            <li> She has thick hair and it dries very nicely and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this dryer for a little over a week, so I will be sure to update my review once I&#x27;ve had it a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> First, it only has two settings; low and high.</li>
            <li> SOFT AND SHINY.</li>
            <li> However, my experience was more like the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer to help with the styling of mine and my daughters natural 4b and 4c hair.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is not for ethnic naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely loud, so you cannot listen to the television - even on volume 70.  </li>
            <li> I needed a dryer for myself and my two young daughters.</li>
            <li> Professional Tourmaline Ionic 1875</li>
            <li> It works really well, is sturdy, and makes multi-tasking while drying my hair so simple.  </li>
            <li> It works really well, is sturdy, and makes multi-tasking while drying my hair so simple.  </li>
            <li> This was the bests thing I have ever bought for my 11 year old.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s height adjustable), getting too hot, or taking too long.  </li>
            <li> With the ionic setting my hair dries very fast--I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely loud.</li>
            <li> my 2 yr old son is always trying to play with it and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sturdy and professional item.</li>
            <li> No wasted time.</li>
            <li> , they took action in a way I was not expecting, they adjust my bill by giving me a discount, voluntarily...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had the dryer for almost a year and no problems so far (fingers crossed).</li>
            <li> yes it is too loud to hear the volume from underneath</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft like baby hair.  </li>
            <li> There are different temperature and strength settings, and it works fast and dries evenly.</li>
            <li> My husband fixed it with some sort of glue.</li>
            <li> I would like to give 5 stars, but the construction is all plastic and its too early to judge its durability over time.</li>
            <li> My husband surprised me with this to help in my Curly Girl Method.  </li>
            <li> 2nd time the noise got higher and louder and apparently hotter because it melted an inch of the inside grid.  </li>
            <li> Sad as I loved the color combination which would match our salon.</li>
            <li> I love having this at home, no more blow drying for me, now i relax and read while drying my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given up trying to fit it into a closet of concealed space, and I let mine sit in the bathroom in plain view.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot and the tourmaline helps dry your hair faster.</li>
            <li> SURE IT WOULD TAKE LESS TIME TO DRY WITH A ROLLER SET.  </li>
            <li> It is not tall enough to dry hair while standing though but it quickly adjust to varies sitting heights.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty loud, but that is expected with hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Overall, it worked pretty well, but there were several cons.</li>
            <li> BUT THE MAIN REASON I THOUGHT IT WAS NOT SUCH</li>
            <li> The pole is a bit wobbly because it is top heavy, and after 1 year of light use you can hear the fan is out of round and makes an irritating wobbling sound.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it for when I roller set my hair or deep condition it.  </li>
            <li> The high temp is a smidge too high and the low is too low.  </li>
            <li> high pitch then low as if  &amp;#34;out of control.&amp;#34;  Hmm, fluke, try this again...</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are also a speed (High, Low, off) and heat (high &amp; low) setting.</li>
            <li> The dryer is noisy whether its on high or low speed</li>
            <li> It does not extend high enough for clients to sit in a chair under it.  </li>
            <li> Its not a bad blow dryer it just takes a really long time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> IT DOES A SMALL RATTLE SOUND</li>
            <li> No more crooks in my neck and it allows me to sit comfortably</li>
            <li> but it makes a little more noise than expected.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t have to do it again, unlike the other typical table top hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> They only give you 2 Low &amp; High Low takes to long to dry your hair and the Hot is to hot.</li>
            <li> The only drawback here is that when traveling to different clients you really need them seated before you know what height to adjust the hood</li>
            <li> When I am under it it seems loud, but when I am standing next to it, it isn&#x27;t loud at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell went away and I sat for 30 minutes at low speed and when I turned to high speed, it went completely out after only 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> (In the past, with my handheld bonnet dryer, my ears burned.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This unit could be better, the high is to hot and the low is cold.</li>
            <li> however, you should treat it gently, the plastic part that holds the head on the metal base breaks easily, is made of a cheap plastic</li>
            <li> There are only 2 heat settings Low &amp; High.  </li>
            <li> It shorted out completely after the next use.</li>
            <li> all of a sudden we hear a loud noise from the hood</li>
            <li> (I had used one of those bonnet-style soft dryers where you connect a handheld hair dryer and try drying your locks that way with mixed success).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long hair and drying it, normally takes between 2-3 hours per salon visit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I could probably find a way to rig it, but it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> For that kind of money and for wanting to go from a blow dryer to this type, I immediately got angry thinking if I keep this piece of junk with the motor clicking like it was</li>
            <li> and it can be a little tricky tightening it at the right level without bumping their head.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly my entire head fits comfortably; not tight at all.</li>
            <li> The only issue is it&#x27;s large and cumbersome which is annoying but worth having and love it.</li>
            <li> So actually there are only 2 heat settings ( Low and High)</li>
            <li> It is SO worth the little bit of extra compared to blow dryers and dryers with bonnet attachments.  </li>
            <li> The hood seems a little top heavy for the stand</li>
            <li> and it seems to get so hot that my hair needs lots of conditioners the next day it not worth the money...</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is a really great solution if you are like me and hate those old school hair dryers that you have to put on the table...</li>
            <li> I have natural African American hair and it works well when I want to make my braid out or roller set</li>
            <li> Well in regards to that it does smell a little funny probably because it has been sitting in a factory</li>
            <li> It turned on blowing hot air for less than a second and then stopped working.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, SUPER FAST SHIPPING!  </li>
            <li> The hood is big enough for the largest roller-set but the lid for the face is hard to adjust to a comfortable angle.</li>
            <li> Only con is the drying time, especially if your used to using the larger professional dryers.</li>
            <li> She has sooo much hair and hates to dry it and won&#x27;t let me dry it for her.</li>
            <li> Too much pressure is placed on the plastic portion as you have to pull down the purple visor or angle the hood.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased the typical table top dryer from beauty stores and just got tired of it not putting out the same constant heat level which left my hair damp in certain areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased the typical table top dryer from beauty stores and just got tired of it not putting out the same constant heat level which left my hair damp in certain areas.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes me more than two hours to dry (when two hours are up, the ends are still wet).</li>
            <li> This is probably due to the high amount of electricity it pulls.</li>
            <li> I knew I needed a professional style dryer to dry my curls.</li>
            <li> This is an issue because on low you never dry.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to position behind any chair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t lower the purple hood down enough so my hair wasn&#x27;t drying fast.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t lower the purple hood down enough so my hair wasn&#x27;t drying fast.</li>
            <li> have long straight hair that takes a long time to dry and style.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is heavy and large and will cost well over $30 to ship back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this is neither a good or bad one</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, full relaxed hair mid back length</li>
            <li> I have natural 3c/4a hair that takes a long time to dry...</li>
            <li> It does not dry evenly, it leaves extra crispy dry pieces of hair, especially when one turns on the \\&quot;ions\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> All in all, this little dryer is decent for the price.</li>
            <li> My hair is mid back length and with the big roller it takes about an hour to dry.</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase this product based solely on the star rating but decided to quickly scan the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Wow!</li>
            <li> I had just washed my hair, I am African-American, so I wrapped my hair to dry, I sat under the dryer on high for about an hour and half and</li>
            <li> I was very upset because I was going out that night and my hair was not fully dried!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this dryer will last long because of this.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s drying my hair to what I like, I haven&#x27;t been using a lot of heat on my hair with my flat iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li> This long drying time made me cut my bra strap hair to short hair (Halle Berry) once before.  </li>
            <li> I know ions combat frizz and  flat irons that have</li>
            <li> Low speed takes a long time too.</li>
            <li> The high heat setting was very hot and the low heat setting was cold.</li>
            <li> The motor is very loud and with the rattle it is a little pesky.  </li>
            <li> not really, both dryers are not working as of that same day of first use for one and the other about a few days later.</li>
            <li> , I can easily alternate the settings while I dry.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s why my rating is 4 stars) but the broken piece doesn&#x27;t really affect anything as far as my needs are concerned.</li>
            <li> A little loud but I&#x27;l;l take it.</li>
            <li> My hair would take 1 1/2 hours to dry sometimes 2 hours depending if I put extra moisturizer on it, since my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying from this seller, not many companies nowadays care for their customer&#x27; satisfaction</li>
            <li> First of all, the high heat setting feels like the depths of Hades and the low heat setting blows cold air on you.  </li>
            <li> I stand corrected when I said in the above cons (#3) that it&#x27;s not very hot</li>
            <li> I stand corrected when I said in the above cons (#3) that it&#x27;s not very hot</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I lasted a few minutes over an hour and a half in it and my hair was actually dry!</li>
            <li> AND ABOUT 15 INCHES LONG</li>
            <li> THE NECK PIECE THAT ATTACHES TO THE LONG STEM COULD BE A BIT STURDIER</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Then I sit under my personal girly time-machine and read a book- for about 20 minutes or do homework, or call my mom or my sister , or drag the machine to front of my mirror and do my make up.</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing because the relative&#x27;s hair I was doing needed a quick dry and we ended up using gold n hot&#x27;s bonnet dryer which worked</li>
            <li> This is only my opinion, but my hair definitely feels a lot less drier now that I&#x27;m using this hair dryer</li>
            <li> This dryer has been a life saver - the ionic setting dries my hair so fast (no more sitting under the dryer for hours!).</li>
            <li> I have long, think, curly hair, and it is dry within 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> that it doesn&#x27;t take as long to dry.  </li>
            <li> that it doesn&#x27;t take as long to dry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got the same dryer the other reviewer returned</li>
            <li> These things need  a Medium heat setting badly, just like most quality hand-held hair dryers have.</li>
            <li> DRY BUT FEELING</li>
            <li> It would take hours under the drier and still would not be dry.  </li>
            <li> She insists on taking a shower at night and her hair won&#x27;t dry by the time she goes to bed.  </li>
            <li> The curls dry without the frizz</li>
            <li> Then I go sit under the dryer for 15 - 20 minutes, and after that it&#x27;s fully dry, and I can remove the clips, and break the gel cast, if I choose.  </li>
            <li> but for me it beats trying to dry my hair with a diffuser which takes forever.</li>
            <li> The airflow is so wonderful/powerful that it will dry your hair EVENLY.  </li>
            <li> I also use Argan oil which makes dry time</li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> It takes about 45 min to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It used to take 1/2 a day for my hair to dry, and all the movement from walking around caused my hair to frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and it takes 50 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> I use it to condition my hair then dry it.</li>

            <li> Within a few weeks I received a standard form letter from Helen of Troy saying the product was on back order, and \\&quot;if</li>
            <li> which is what I use because I don&#x27;t have a choice, is not very high, but I guess that&#x27;s a PRO since too much heat is not good for your hair anyways.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I would say that Helen of Troy is not a reputable company, not at all consumer orientated and diffidently not a company that cares about customer satisfaction.....</li>
            <li> I had to return the first one because the plastic piece that connects the hood to the stand was broken.</li>
            <li> So, I have to keep my head down the entire time, which makes my neck hurt after a while.</li>
            <li> I like how it raises up and down instead of my constantly adjusting the hood.  </li>
            <li> Only two things that could be better though: (1)</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I think this hair dryer is actually gentler than my previous hand held hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black female with type 4 hair relaxed.</li>
            <li> Two heat levels, not really loud, can sit and do other things while hair is drying.</li>
            <li> I also tried a wet wrap once, both time it took my hair about an hour to dry so for me from completely wet hair</li>
            <li> The stand bottom seems a little fragile</li>
            <li> so it was not really portable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no thought was put into designing this unit.</li>
            <li> The company refused to do anything unless I spent another $50 for shipping and repair, with NO guarantee after that.  </li>
            <li> and they still can&#x27;t give me an expected delivery date, just that they have placed an order....</li>
            <li> you will require a longer drying time and even then you will still have some wet patches.  </li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t leave the house with wet hair.</li>
            <li> If you bump it a few times you actually run the risk of damaging it.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m careful not to put weight on it.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, so I bought this hair dryer so that I didn&#x27;t have to go out every day with wet hair.</li>
            <li> The hood opens so you can choose how closed in</li>
            <li> Everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> so just dont be rough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend being careful while assembling.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to stand behind my chair so that I could get a professional deep treatment or hair drying whenever I needed it.  </li>
            <li> I just wrap it, dry it, comb it down and go.</li>
            <li> I am careful to pull it by the lower part of the pole based on the warnings in some of the other ratings.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched all of my hair tools over to ionic tools to give my hair all of the help it needs since I do flat iron everyday and sit under this dryer every two weeks.  </li>
            <li> my hair was dry, no shine, but now my hair is silky, shiny, softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> However this hair dryer does dry my hair in less time then</li>
            <li> I saw several posts about pieces breaking easily or odd little things like that.</li>
            <li> NOT LIKE OTHER DRYERS LEAVING YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> Other than these two issues</li>
            <li> Other than that, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Beware if you purchase this product or any other for that matter that is under the parent company Helen of Troy.</li>
            <li> Other than that this does the job.</li>
            <li> I chose this model because the stand pole looked heavier than others and because it could be compacted shorter for travel due to the two height adjusters.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t leave one corner of your hair damp while other corners are untouched.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that it works so well for my curls.</li>
            <li> dryer has the ionic setting, but I&#x27;m not sure if it actually makes a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> all the other hairdryers I have tried before.</li>
            <li> so it was pretty difficult</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and usually use a Pibbs style professional dryer for about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> The round hood is a little deceiving because the actual surface underneath is flatter than stationary dryers.</li>
            <li> After four years, not one of the parts have broken; it still seems as if it&#x27;s new.  </li>
            <li> Now I spent less time drying my hair.</li>
            <li> The one problem that I had with my first one is that I was a little careless and moved it by picking it up and not supporting the head...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no louder than the average hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Not worth spending $100.00 on this dryer.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, the legs kept falling off as we moved it around.</li>
            <li> I styled my girls hair wet, using twist and loc gel, then dried under the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I used massive curlers (I think 2 inches?) and have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s given me the option of continuing to grown my hair down</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s given me the option of continuing to grown my hair down</li>
            <li> When I am short of time to put in rollers on all of my hair,or if I am plain just lazy, i  put the rollers on just  the front half of my head.</li>
            <li> NOT, well needless to say this product was sent back to the seller after only one use..</li>
            <li> I decided to do half hour increments because of this.</li>
            <li> Of course, after the summer this will be less of a problem.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately i bought this dryer for my salon that did not open until recently.</li>
            <li> It drys my hair in less time than the ones at the hair salon and leaves my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li> Both of those times have been literally cut in half for my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> Less heat damage.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had it about a month and a half working good,&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> Dries hair while you read or mess around online.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll need earphones for volume, but I usually just check e-mail, surf the web or turn on closed caption.  </li>
            <li> I used to spend close to an hour drying my long thick curly hair with a handheld dryer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, I have really long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> so after spending A$107 ... for this dryer , that I use ( once a week , because I have thick and long hair )</li>
            <li> I would sip my tea as my long, thick, course hair dried.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little longer.</li>
            <li> A little bulky I know</li>
            <li> Also, I have to move around a little to get to the lower part of my hair.  </li>
            <li> both of which are large and awkwardly shaped.</li>
            <li> This was very convenient to have on cold NJ mornings.  </li>
            <li> IT DRIED MY HAIR</li>
            <li> a few weeks apart.</li>
            <li> Havent had any trouble with it at all</li>
            <li> It has fallen off  in my hands a few times now, while adjusting the height.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i have been trying to figure out what works for my hair without having to apply harsh heat tools.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Have owned it a few months with no heat problems.</li>
            <li> a waste</li>
            <li> So my money was wasted.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I am not sure if a piece was missing when I bought it, but I put it together</li>
            <li> is not hot enough, almost cold.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS ... waste of your hard earned money</li>
            <li> in fact I&#x27;m actually not sure how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li> AND USUALLY IT TAKES AN HOUR FOR IT</li>
            <li> What a waste of a lot of money!  </li>
            <li> I usually set it up, though, at my vanity and check email or do work on my laptop while my hair is drying.  </li>
            <li> I consider this a small drawback and recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> 5 months seems like too short a time for it to be useless.  </li>
            <li> No more plastic bonnets with rotted out smelly elastic.  </li>
            <li> only real negative is that the roller base is big, but it needs to be for stability and the wheels are necessary for portability.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually go to the beauty shop</li>
            <li> As I was attaching the legs, a small plastic part of the wheel lock (lever) broke off in my hand.</li>
            <li> Right after assembling this dryer, the small plactic part that holds the dryer head to the base snapped.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is less than shoulder length, but is really thick and difficult to dry.  </li>
            <li> I am looking at a salon style with sturdier base, large round hood and air coming from all sides.</li>
            <li> This plastic post, which is weakened by the holes drilled through it for the three attachment rivets, is poorly designed and too weak to handle the torque created by the weight of the dry head.  </li>
            <li> ALITTLE HARD AND BRITTLE.</li>
            <li> Basically its hard to store or transport.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard not to have frizz.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!!!</li>
            <li> THEN, the heater broke and now I only have cold air.</li>
            <li> People have complained about the smoky smell.</li>
            <li> Used it for 20 minutes and it only blew cold air.</li>
            <li> The design is poor and the pole to keep it up is too heavy for the knob that holds it in place</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS MEDIUM THICK</li>
            <li> It dries my wife&#x27;s thick hair faster than a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> is very noisy which is annoying</li>
            <li> I use to have hair past my shoulders and now I had to cut it up to the bottom of my neck!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can no longer return it to Amazon since it&#x27;s past their window for returns.  </li>
            <li> and I think it is cutting down on the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair which has been relaxed/permed, no dyes/colors.  </li>
            <li> and I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> and occasionally it just falls apart at the bottom where the plastic legs snap into the base.</li>
            <li> It is poorly weighted and poorly designed in my opinion.</li>
            <li> base finally gave way and one of the legs broke off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer sleepy and tired after getting up from under the dryer.  </li>
            <li> Also got tired of the necks breaking from the continuous use of setup/takedowns.  </li>
            <li> Also got tired of the necks breaking from the continuous use of setup/takedowns.  </li>
            <li> broken with in a month....</li>
            <li> My hair was \\&quot;done\\&quot; in approximately 25 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously changed my life!</li>
            <li> the base on the stool and the base of the dryer are too big to get close to each other,</li>
            <li> No good!</li>
            <li> The base and stand should probably be a little sturdier.</li>
            <li> Am I doing something wrong???</li>
            <li> POOR craftmanship!</li>
            <li> but the materials or design are flawed in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was using one of those high-powered, expensive hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> I would be afraid to buy this lest I end up among the unfortunate lot.</li>
            <li> The hood attaches to the base by sliding a black plastic tube over the metal base post.</li>
            <li> Broke within a few months (the plastic part that connects the hood to the stand) and awful customer service from the distributor \\&quot;Helen of Troy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Now she doesn&#x27;t wake up with crazy hair.</li>
            <li> waste of money...would not tell my worst hater about this.hate</li>
            <li> hate it mad..</li>
            <li> So disappointed...</li>
            <li> Very disappointing :(</li>
            <li> it hate it ..</li>
            <li> Kinda flimsy in the plastic base.</li>
            <li> Once you assemble the base .....</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;ll end up with too pieces you have to store the head and the base.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I bump into it and the head will fall off the base, but it hasn&#x27;t broke yet.</li>
            <li> so disappointed in the quality of this dryer!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible!</li>
            <li> then it turns off leaving my clients with a BAD HAIR DAY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Piece of crap !</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> sunday it made an awful noice  </li>
            <li> This is the worst portable hair dryer.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Distributes heat evenly and is not too noisy. My hair is mid back length and with the big roller it takes about an hour to dry.</li>
            <li> This dryer are very excellent it gets extremely hot! I will recommend it to any hair stylist or barber..  you can also use it home for personal needs it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> Cheap....Cheap....Cheap. Pretty colors but Cheaply made!!!</li>
            <li> Broke within a few months (the plastic part that connects the hood to the stand) and awful customer service from the distributor \\&quot;Helen of Troy\\&quot;. I refused to give them another penny for shipping and repair so I got a connector from Lowes to hold the hood onto the stand.  THEN, the heater broke and now I only have cold air. It took over 6 weeks to receive the order (they indicated it was in stock) BUT they CHARGED my credit card the day I placed the order. DO NOT BUY THIS DRYER OR ANY PRODUCT FROM HELEN OF TROY!</li>
            <li> I HAVE TO SAY, THIS IS A NICE AND STURDY STAND UP DRYER. I JUST RECEIVED IT LAST WEEK AND I USED IT TWICE. IT DRIED MY HAIR IN 20MINS TOPS. PLUS IT GOT TO THE ROOTS WERE MY HAIR IS THE THICKEST. AFTER I WAS DONE, I FELT MY HAIR WHICH WAS SOOO.... SOFT AND SHINY. NOT LIKE OTHER DRYERS LEAVING YOUR HAIR DRY BUT FEELING ALITTLE HARD AND BRITTLE. NOT THIS DRYER!! IT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY AND SHIPPING WAS PRETTY FAST. ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION. THANKS AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of good reviews and a lot of not so great ones too befor I bought this product. But this is neither a good or bad one in fact I&#x27;m actually not sure how I feel about this product. I love it for the things this type of dryer offers which is not specific to this actual product:&lt;br /&gt;1. standing dryer with adjustable height settings&lt;br /&gt;2. wheels for easy portability&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there seems to be a lot of air flow but no actual heat. I have tried every setting I can see on the dryer to see if it actually turns the air warm. I just get lots of cool air which eventually drys my hair by the sheer power of it but not quickly enough. Where&#x27;s the heat? Am I doing something wrong??? Can anyone help me?</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got this for me as a birthday gift. I first used it yesterday (10/30/2011) and I was very pleased with the way it worked. I did hear that crackling/rattling sound described by the other buyers, but it soon went away. I must admit I love the color. It is very very appealing and it very easy to use. Its a great choice.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about receiving this dryer based on the positive reviews. However, my experience was more like the negative reviews. At first the dryer worked ok. The design is poor and the pole to keep it up is too heavy for the knob that holds it in place so it was not really portable. The high heat setting was very hot and the low heat setting was cold. After the 6th use sparks started to fly from the unit when on high heat. It shorted out completely after the next use. The return policy was less than 30 days, and I wouldnt have been able to get a full refund. Not worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer to help with the styling of mine and my daughters natural 4b and 4c hair.  I am so happy with the dryer because once I set my hair whether its twists or rollers,it doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry. the dryer is a little loud, you can&#x27;t really watch a tv show, but you can get some great reading in.  Also, I had to purchase the ear covers because it does get hot.  However after a little trial and error, I found the perfect setting that dries my hair without burning my skin.  I would definitely recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. It&#x27;s a quick dry. Easy to put together. And cute! : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can easily position it around a chair and do work, read, or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I knew I needed a professional style dryer to dry my curls. But not so enjoyable experiences with other hooded home dryers let to years of procrastination. I finally decided to get a dryer for those \\&quot;my curls need to look perfect\\&quot; days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I finally bought one. And I am happier I bought the one I did. : )</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before I purchased and I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.  So far it works good.  I did, however, send in my warranty card just to be safe in case I had to have it repaired.  The drying time is much faster as it states.  It&#x27;s easy to assemble and store.  I rollerset my hair and sat under the dryer for 1 hour instead of my normal 2 hour.  It works for me.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is  a review update 7 years later ... Save the money and invest in something more durable, quiet, and with an open face door that allows for easier moving in and out of the dryer.  Once you install larger rollers the space shrinks quickly.  This dryer is great and gets super hot which makes for quick drying time however the mobility of the dryer is NOT AT ALL FUNCTIONAL!  The dryer has roller wheels that are detachable so after which falls apart on you so easily.  I would not purchase this dryer only for that purpose but if you think you can get around that issue then go for it.  Also that little issue is not kid friendly so BEWARE! ...</li>
            <li> This dryer is not for ethnic naturally curly hair.  It does not dry evenly, it leaves extra crispy dry pieces of hair, especially when one turns on the \\&quot;ions\\&quot;.  Additionally, the plastic piece that holds the dryer head to the pole broke within 3 months of non-heavy use (and, no, it was not dropped).  It is extremely loud, so you cannot listen to the television - even on volume 70.  I should not have been cheap, and should have just spent the extra hundred on a better dryer.  BTW, right now I am drying my hair by angling the dryer head on the edge of the bed and my shoulders.  Sigh.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much up much space and it can be rolled into a closet when you want it out of sight.  The best part is that it does a great job drying your hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer is adequate at best.  The hood is big enough for the largest roller-set but the lid for the face is hard to adjust to a comfortable angle.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is everything I have been looking for in a hair dryer! I needed a dryer for myself and my two young daughters. The reasons why I am glad I purchased this dryer are:    1) With the stand, you are able to adjust the height for an adult and then down to a young child very easily. This is such a pleasant experience compared to having to stack books under a table top hair dryer, hoping that it won&#x27;t tip over.    2)Easy assembly. All of the parts were very easily recognizable in the instruction manual. I was able to completely assemble the dryer in minutes.    3) I styled my girls hair wet, using twist and loc gel, then dried under the hair dryer. The shine was incredible! And it only took literally MINUTES! Before (with a table top) it would take close to 30 minutes to get the same results.    The features say there are 4 heat settings. The settings are Ionic On Low, Ionic Off Low, Ionic On High, Ionic Off High. So actually there are only 2 heat settings ( Low and High) then you can turn the Ion on or off switch.    The wheels move easily and 2 wheels can lock into place just as stated in the description.    I can&#x27;t say enough about this salon quality hair dryer.</li>
            <li> No good! Broke the first day of use. The sleeve that mounts the head piece to the stand is made of cheap thin plastic. Absolutely no thought was put into designing this unit. POOR craftmanship!</li>
            <li> Excellent, i have sensitive  skin, doesn&#x27;t burn my skin and my hair.  And dries my hair quickly and effectively without a lot of heat. Very good price compare to other hair dryers, and is very chic and beautiful</li>
            <li> This is my first roll about dryer so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  It is easy to assemble. The first time I turned it on it had a rattle and still does.  The high temp is a smidge too high and the low is too low.  There needs to be a medium heat.  The motor is very loud and with the rattle it is a little pesky.  The good news is that the hood is large enough to accomodate a roller set. It is very easy to adjust the height.  The dryer rolls from point A to point B quite easily.  Would I purchase this one again?  No, I would spend a little more and hope for one that didn&#x27;t have a rattle and did have a more diverse heat choice.  I have purchased a variety from Amazon and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This thing works very well. It&#x27;s easy to assemble and sturdy. I only have two problems with it. First, it only has two settings; low and high. This is an issue because on low you never dry. If you use it on high You better have a healthy heart or you&#x27;ll die of a heat stroke. The other issue is that the head is kind of tricky to adjust from underneath. You have to keep getting out to make it just right for you or you&#x27;ll have the whole helmet in your hands. Unless of course you have someone else adjust it for you. Other than these two issues it&#x27;s very effective and does it&#x27;s job. Not so shabby for the price. I gave it for out of five stars.</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase this product based solely on the star rating but decided to quickly scan the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Wow! I would be afraid to buy this lest I end up among the unfortunate lot. So, I will not be purchasing this product</li>
            <li> This product is horrible! I used it for the first time after having it for about a week. I had just washed my hair, I am African-American, so I wrapped my hair to dry, I sat under the dryer on high for about an hour and half and the next thing I know the dryer turns off! I thought that maybe it had some sort of automatic turn off, well it didnt! I was very upset because I was going out that night and my hair was not fully dried! I had to pull out my trusty hand dryer and finish drying my hair. I unplugged the dryer and thought maybe if I gave it a few more days that it would magically reset itself....NOT, well needless to say this product was sent back to the seller after only one use..DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for my salon studio because of the excellent price. I rarely use a dryer of this sort as I prefer to use the more gentle thermo-stimulator  instead. Anyhow, I am not sure if a piece was missing when I bought it, but I put it together and occasionally it just falls apart at the bottom where the plastic legs snap into the base. I am glad this hasn&#x27;t hit anyone in the head as the top is quite large. It is poorly weighted and poorly designed in my opinion. I am considering supergluing the entire bottom together, which would make it no longer portable, but could fix the problem.</li>
            <li> This thing is great. Two heat levels, not really loud, can sit and do other things while hair is drying.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THE DRYER ABOUT FIVE MONTHS AGO.  I LOVE THE WAY IT DRYS MY HAIR.  I AM A SISTER WITH A PERM.  I WRAP MY HAIR THEN I SIT UNDER THE DRYER AND USUALLY IT TAKES AN HOUR FOR IT TO DRY/WITH THAT STYLE.  I HAVE YET TO ROLLER SET MY HAIR AND USE THIS DRYER BUT IM SURE IT WOULD TAKE LESS TIME TO DRY WITH A ROLLER SET.  *MY HAIR IS MEDIUM THICK AND ABOUT 15 INCHES LONG* IT IS VERY MOBLE, STYLISH, AND EASY TO ADJUST.  AS ONE VIEWER MENTIONED, IT DOES A SMALL RATTLE SOUND BUT IT DOESNT BOTHER ME.  I USE IT TWICE A MONTH.  THE NECK PIECE THAT ATTACHES TO THE LONG STEM COULD BE A BIT STURDIER SO THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE HEAD IS SUPPORTED BY THE BODY OF THE DRYER. I WOULD RECCOMEND IT TO EVERYONE.</li>
            <li> I had to return the first one because the plastic piece that connects the hood to the stand was broken. I don&#x27;t think this dryer will last long because of this.  I would rather pay 50-100.00 more and have it made with metal parts.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels wonderful after using this dryer and it does not take a long time for my hair to dry.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this hair dryer.  It worked wonderfully well for about 12 times.  Now it smells like burning wires and won&#x27;t work [[ASIN:B000Q37M5M Tourmaline Tools 1059 by Hot Tools Professional Tourmaline Ionic 1875 Watt High Heat Portable Salon Dryer]]anymore.  All efforts to go through warranty were unsuccessful.  The company refused to do anything unless I spent another $50 for shipping and repair, with NO guarantee after that.  I tried to resolve through Amazon, too, and although I thought I was getting somewhere, customer service did not follow through with what they first said they could do. What a waste of a lot of money!  Do not buy this product!!  The rating should be a 0!!!</li>
            <li> I wear Sisterlocs and my hair is dense and full.  It would take hours under the drier and still would not be dry.  This dryer makes my life so much easier.  It dries my hair, doesn&#x27;t take all day and is light weight and mobile. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I used to spend close to an hour drying my long thick curly hair with a handheld dryer.  Now I can sit with the purple people heater for 25 minutes and get great results.  I purchased my first one three years ago and I am now buying my second one because I broke the first when moving, oops! I love how quickly it dries my hair and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This works quickly and my hair looks healthy but it&#x27;s very loud - it sounds like something is rattling on the inside and its extremely hot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this dryer for a little over a week, so I will be sure to update my review once I&#x27;ve had it a bit longer.  For now I just want to say that I love this device!  It makes drying your hair so easy, and it makes for frizz-free hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this dryer since I&#x27;ve recently started coaxing out the waves and curls in my hair.  Using a diffuser on the end of my blowdryer has helped bring out the curl, but I get impatient with drying, and end up moving the blowdryer around too much, which leads to frizz.  Based on research I did online, I learned that dryers like this Hot Tools one are great for curly/wavy hair, and I definitely agree! Using the same products and techniques before drying, I&#x27;ve found that using this Hot Tools dryer leaves me with zero frizz and lovely curls/waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely easy to set this up for the first time (it took me less than five minutes), and, once it&#x27;s set up, is very easy to maneuver and adjust so that it is positioned exactly how and where you want it to be.  If it&#x27;s not exactly where I want it to be while I&#x27;m drying, I can easily turn around while sitting on my stool and adjust it so that it is right where I want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer mentioned that you could do makeup while using this, and I had been hoping to do the same so I could save time with my morning routine.  I&#x27;ve found that I can apply my foundation, blush, etc. while under this dryer, but because I have to get in close to my makeup mirror to do my eye makeup, I can&#x27;t sit under the dryer while doing my eyes.  I usually set it up, though, at my vanity and check email or do work on my laptop while my hair is drying.  It&#x27;s great for multitasking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works great for deep conditioning treatments that require the use of heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost didn&#x27;t purchase this since some of the reviews suggested that the top helmet wasn&#x27;t too sturdy and had a tendency to break off.  I had also been worried about it being unstable, but have found neither of these areas to be a problem.  The helmet portion is securely attached, and when I wheel it around or move it to the spare bathroom where I store it, I just make sure that I support the helmet portion so that it won&#x27;t snap off.  It seems like it is really secure, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one side of the helmet/hood portion is the phrase \\&quot;Purple people heater,\\&quot; which cracks me up each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m really glad I got this!  As mentioned above, I will be sure to update my review once I see how this holds up with more use, but so far it&#x27;s fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 5/13/11:  I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a little over four months, and continue to love it.  It works really well, is sturdy, and makes multi-tasking while drying my hair so simple.  I really recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 7/13/11:  This is still working great, with no problems at all!  I also wanted to add that I recently had my hair cut by a curly hair specialist who does Deva Cuts, and she said that hard-hat dryers like this one are the best thing to use for curly and wavy hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 11/1/11:  I&#x27;ve had this dryer now for about ten months, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  It works perfectly, and is still sturdy and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 7-27-13:  This dryer is still going strong, and I love it for deep conditioning treatments.  However, my hair is now mid-back, and it&#x27;s too long to fit under this.

            <li> Bought this hair dyer for my sister as a birthday present. She loved it better then the one she saw at a retail store for twice as much money. She said she love the size of it. Fits her large rollers with ease.</li>
            <li> This was the bests thing I have ever bought for my 11 year old.  She has sooo much hair and hates to dry it and won&#x27;t let me dry it for her. She insists on taking a shower at night and her hair won&#x27;t dry by the time she goes to bed.  She loves to sit under the drier when we get our hair done and our hair stylist suggested this.  She loves thed dryer.  She will sit under it and read a book or play with her DS or even watch TV.  She can use it anywhere because it is on wheels.  What a life saver.  Now she doesn&#x27;t wake up with crazy hair.</li>
            <li> We bought this for Mom. Roller sets are her &#x27;thing&#x27;. This dries faster than &#x27;shop&#x27; dryers. Her &#x27;hairdresser&#x27; and Mom love this product.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that reaches my hips. I fit perfectly well into the bonnet, even with my super-duper jumbo rollers.It usually takes me more than two hours to dry (when two hours are up, the ends are still wet). This dryer definitely does the job. The first time I used it, I lasted a few minutes over an hour and a half in it and my hair was actually dry! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Only two things that could be better though: (1) The bonnet cannot be adjusted to a different angle. So, I have to keep my head down the entire time, which makes my neck hurt after a while. I decided to do half hour increments because of this. (2) It&#x27;s pretty loud when it&#x27;s on high, but I think it&#x27;s a fair trade in order to have my hair dry entirely. Other than that, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This item is excellent. I bought it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. it is mobile and easy to put away and more importantly, It works well.</li>
            <li> From the description, it sounded as though it had 5 heat settings, but they&#x27;re combining heat temp with air speed.  There are only 2 heat settings Low &amp; High.  These things need  a Medium heat setting badly, just like most quality hand-held hair dryers have.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my sister who is a hair stylist. It arrived without damages even though it came all the way from California to Toronto, Canada. The materials aren&#x27;t the most durable and if you bang it around too much you could break it - or if you drop the head of it. Otherwise, my sister really likes it. She simply sits under it while watching TV and hasn&#x27;t had problems with it burning her scalp or anything like that. Considering it&#x27;s not the most expensive one out there I think you definitely pay for what you get and it&#x27;s not a rip off in any way. Good for beginners</li>
            <li> This started burning and giving off burning odors the second time we used it.  The company refunded our money with no problem. Sad as I loved the color combination which would match our salon.</li>
            <li> Just used this dryer for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised at the great job it did. It dried my hair quickly and it feels so soft, i used the ionic setting and it really makes a difference. I like this dryer much better than my previous one and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. I have curly hair and this is awesome on keeping the frizz down and it dries fast. got to love saving time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer the end of October 2009. It worked fine for 4 months when the high heat setting quit. Finally after another 2 months of drying my hair on \\&quot;low\\&quot; I returned it to Helen of Troy at the cost of $20. Within a few weeks I received a standard form letter from Helen of Troy saying the product was on back order, and \\&quot;if available\\&quot; it could be replaced with a comparable unit; (course there isn&#x27;t such an item so that option was out)...or I could request a refund. To purchase another unit, at a higher price and pay shipping for the 3rd time ruled out requesting a refund. So I&#x27;m still waiting....I called Helen of Troy again, this makes the 6th time in 3 months and they still can&#x27;t give me an expected delivery date, just that they have placed an order....I would say that Helen of Troy is not a reputable company, not at all consumer orientated and diffidently not a company that cares about customer satisfaction.....Beware if you purchase this product or any other for that matter that is under the parent company Helen of Troy.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to stand behind my chair so that I could get a professional deep treatment or hair drying whenever I needed it.  It is SO worth the little bit of extra compared to blow dryers and dryers with bonnet attachments.  The only thing that I have to do is plug it in, turn it on, and that&#x27;s it.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about it tipping over or being the right height (it&#x27;s height adjustable), getting too hot, or taking too long.  With the ionic setting my hair dries very fast--I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I got my dryer on the specified deliver date about a month ago and am very happy with my purchase. It dries my hair very well and I fit in it perfectly with my rollers, which was my number one factor when I was shopping around for a dryer. It was super easy to install and can be adjusted to any height. It&#x27;s pretty loud, but that is expected with hair dryers. The only draw back is that I can&#x27;t watch TV while in the dryer because when there are to many electrical things on at the time as the dryer my power goes out. This is probably due to the high amount of electricity it pulls. I consider this a small drawback and recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> This drier just doesn&#x27;t heat enough to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the price range it&#x27;s great.  This is definitely not a salon grade/quality drier but for at home it gets the job done and it&#x27;s standing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be advised this it doesn&#x27;t get very hot you will require a longer drying time and even then you will still have some wet patches.  But if your a natural that&#x27;s looking for a hooded drier and do not want to risk over drying your hair or experiencing heat damage this is for you!.</li>
            <li> This has been fabulous for my daughters curly, course, unruly hair. I shower her in the morning and twist it up in a claw clip and put her under the dryer to play on her iPad for 20 minutes. The curls dry without the frizz and she doesn&#x27;t leave the house with wet hair. The only issue is it&#x27;s large and cumbersome which is annoying but worth having and love it.</li>
            <li> Received this item promptly--- Easy to assemble-  I have used it several times with good results- Seems to make hair very shiny and it looks better after drying-- Adjustable hood makes it very comfortable- I either use my computer or read while drying my hair-  Only \\&quot;knock\\&quot; is that on high heat it is quite warm- Of course, after the summer this will be less of a problem.  I am very satisfied with this product- and the price was outstanding-</li>
            <li> Right after assembling this dryer, the small plactic part that holds the dryer head to the base snapped.  This plastic post, which is weakened by the holes drilled through it for the three attachment rivets, is poorly designed and too weak to handle the torque created by the weight of the dry head.  This attachment point is critical in this type of dryer, and should be strong.</li>
            <li> Drys very well. I have long thick hair and usually use a Pibbs style professional dryer for about 40 minutes. I have to be under this dryer for about an hour and 30 minutes so it&#x27;s a little longer. I was worried that this hood wouldn&#x27;t allow for my entire head to fit in it. I use jumbo 2 inch and 3 inch rollers. Surprisingly my entire head fits comfortably; not tight at all. This dryer gets very hot. I think it&#x27;s a great dryer. Only con is the drying time, especially if your used to using the larger professional dryers. Other than that this does the job.</li>
            <li> This dryer is beautiful! I just used it for the first time, and it works great. My only concern is that the stand leans with the weight of the bonnet. The base and stand should probably be a little sturdier. I hope it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;The base finally gave way and one of the legs broke off. I&#x27;m sure I could probably find a way to rig it, but it&#x27;s not worth the trouble. I used it about 5 times in the couple of months before it broke. Overall, it worked pretty well, but there were several cons. 1. The air only flows from the top, not from all sides like a salon dryer. If you have long hair, this is not for you. 2. The hood is not as spacious as it looks from the outside. All of the mechanical stuff is in the top part, so the remaining space inside is rather shallow and flat at the top. I have big dense Afro hair that fills the hood, so it gets flattened and the air doesn&#x27;t flow well through it. For these reasons, I would not buy this model again. I am looking at a salon style with sturdier base, large round hood and air coming from all sides.</li>
            <li> It dries my wife&#x27;s thick hair faster than a blow dryer.  Her hair is less than shoulder length, but is really thick and difficult to dry.  This device is the fastest hair dryer she has ever used.  Highly recommended.  It uses IONIC heat that is a more efficient heat source that&#x27;s better for the hair and reduces frizz.</li>
            <li> The hood does not attach to the unit, I almost knocked myself out when i went to use it for the first time. unfortunately i bought this dryer for my salon that did not open until recently. Helen of Troy does not help what so ever with the warranty, the cost to ship is as much as the dryer costs in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;I am very unsatisfied with this dryer and out $100.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this dryer.  First of all, the high heat setting feels like the depths of Hades and the low heat setting blows cold air on you.  I was willing to overlook that, but then my low heat setting blew a fuse or something, so now it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I ended up giving it away.    Very disappointing :(</li>
            <li> Works great, feet don&#x27;t stay attached.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and I love this hair dryer for diffusing!  It is much faster and easier than using a blow dryer and diffuser.  It was also easy to assemble.  I also use it for deep conditioning treatments!</li>
            <li> My fiance has purchased two of these dryers for me approx. a few weeks apart. He made sure that he reviewed the reviews before the purchase and all turned out very good....but not really, both dryers are not working as of that same day of first use for one and the other about a few days later. Both time of usage my clients were sitting under them drying and all of a sudden we hear a loud noise from the hood then it turns off leaving my clients with a BAD HAIR DAY!!!!!! NEVER AGAIN....</li>
            <li> I really liked this dryer. But when I went to use it today... it wouldn&#x27;t blow hot air. it got really hot on the top but no air... I&#x27;m returning it and getting my money back... So disappointed... Buyer Beware...</li>
            <li> The top falls off easy when you move or adjust it. The dryer works great just missing something. I am a licensed cosmologist so convenience is key.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  It makes maintaining my hair at home easier and more affordable.  This was one of my best investments!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is amazing! It was easy to assemble and fits easily into a corner of the house.  I have long hair and drying it, normally takes between 2-3 hours per salon visit.  This dryer lives up to the expectation that it cuts the drying time by 50% The dryer can go from low to extremely high heat the minute you turn the dial, and eventhough the dryer becomes extremely hot, it does not dry out your hair!  Ionic is the way to go. Excellent product, fast ship, easy assembly.    Happy HairStyling!</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD THIS DRYER FOR A COUPLE WEEKS AND HAVE USED IT TWICE... I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE MY HAIRDRESSER USES A SIMILAR HOODED DRYER AT HER SALON SO I DECIDED TO PURCHASE ONE FOR THE WEEKS I DON&#x27;T GO TO THE SALON... SO THE FIRST TIME I USED IT I HAD TO SIT UNDER THE DRYER FOR AN HOUR AND IM STARTING TO THINK THAT THIS DRYER IS NOT TO GOOD, ITS ALSO VERY NOSY... I WILL KEEP TRYING IT TO SEE IF ITS JUST ME... BUT THE MAIN REASON I THOUGHT IT WAS NOT SUCH A GOOD DRYER IS BECAUSE AT THE SALON MY HAIR DRIES IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES AND 45 THE MOST.... SO IDK</li>
            <li> I knew what I was getting before I purchased it...My daughter has one identical to this one...I love it, it gets hot and gets the job done...Good Investment!</li>
            <li> I used it for a while and it seems to get so hot that my hair needs lots of conditioners the next day it not worth the money...</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and my friend loves it!  She has thick hair and it dries very nicely and less frizzy. Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in October and by March (5 months later), it started sparking.  Of course, I refused to use it again for fear of a fire starting.  Unfortunately, I can no longer return it to Amazon since it&#x27;s past their window for returns.  5 months seems like too short a time for it to be useless.  I&#x27;m looking into contacting the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It looks cool, it works great, but seems fragile.  If you bump it a few times you actually run the risk of damaging it.  The pole is a bit wobbly because it is top heavy, and after 1 year of light use you can hear the fan is out of round and makes an irritating wobbling sound.  Otherwise the performance is very good.</li>
            <li> high pitch then low as if  &amp;#34;out of control.&amp;#34;  Hmm, fluke, try this again...2nd time the noise got higher and louder and apparently hotter because it melted an inch of the inside grid.  The motor still runs, though loudly, but not with my head in that hood-no more interest in it.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for the portable benefits. It is lightweight and easy to transport. I chose this model because the stand pole looked heavier than others and because it could be compacted shorter for travel due to the two height adjusters. I am pleased with the way it compacts for travel. The hood seems a little top heavy for the stand so it&#x27;s important to get the connections tight before placing the hood on. The only drawback here is that when traveling to different clients you really need them seated before you know what height to adjust the hood and it can be a little tricky tightening it at the right level without bumping their head. The round hood is a little deceiving because the actual surface underneath is flatter than stationary dryers. The stand bottom seems a little fragile so I&#x27;m careful not to put weight on it. Overall, the dryer works very well, heats quickly and isn&#x27;t too noisy. It was shipped quickly and arrived double boxed in great condition. So far, so good with this model.</li>
            <li> This unit could be better, the high is to hot and the low is cold.</li>
            <li> I have natural 3c/4a hair that takes a long time to dry...but this dryer really helps to speed up the process.  This hairdryer is a really great solution if you are like me and hate those old school hair dryers that you have to put on the table... I could never get the right chair height to sit under it. This hair dryer is really simple to put together... and then you can watch a movie with subtitles or surf the internet while it works...    The one problem that I had with my first one is that I was a little careless and moved it by picking it up and not supporting the head... it snapped off and I had to get another one... so just be careful and know that the best way to move this around is by rolling it...     Happy hair drying!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got the same dryer the other reviewer returned but this was defective.  It turned on blowing hot air for less than a second and then stopped working. I tried various outlets thinking the circuit breaker may have tripped over the next 15 minutes.  The last time I turned it on, it had a red ring around it that lit up like an electric stove does when it is cooking and it started to catch fire.  I unplugged it and returned it right away.  I am glad I bought it on Amazon.  This was very disappointing because the relative&#x27;s hair I was doing needed a quick dry and we ended up using gold n hot&#x27;s bonnet dryer which worked well btw but is just not going to be as fast and doesn&#x27;t have ions or tourmaline.</li>
            <li> Have 1 already and love it</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;m trying to limit the heat damage on my relaxed hair by skipping the blow dryer. Assembly was simple, my hair dries quickly, only con is I can&#x27;t use my drafting stool with it, the base on the stool and the base of the dryer are too big to get close to each other, oh well. Other than that, love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this dryer, looks great, works great! I also love that it says &amp;#34;The Purple People Heater&amp;#34; on it, very cute!!!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer except for the noise. If I put it in high it&#x27;s extremely loud. However, it dries very well and can do the job without being on high. It was definitely worth my money.</li>
            <li> I love love love this dryer! My mom has it and I&#x27;ve been using it at her house and finally decided to purchase my own. This dryer has been a life saver - the ionic setting dries my hair so fast (no more sitting under the dryer for hours!). I just wrap it, dry it, comb it down and go. Because it&#x27;s drying my hair to what I like, I haven&#x27;t been using a lot of heat on my hair with my flat iron or curling iron. It&#x27;s seriously changed my life!</li>
            <li> I have had a good experience with this hair dryer since I received it.  It was easy to assemble, and it is sturdy and of good quality.  I am careful to pull it by the lower part of the pole based on the warnings in some of the other ratings.  I&#x27;m giving it five stars because even though the hot setting is very hot, and the lower setting is very cool, I can easily alternate the settings while I dry. The knobs are easy to reach without getting up, so it&#x27;s really not disruptive at all, and I can personalize the amount of heat I want.  I have long, think, curly hair, and it is dry within 20 minutes.  It&#x27;s really a pleasure to be able to sit and read or pay bills while my hair dries and it makes it practical to wash it in the morning before work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been following the Devachan method for about six months, so I haven&#x27;t used a regular blow dryer in that time and had been air drying my hair.  This dryer is such a great convenience!  I come out of the shower, squeeze out the excess water, flip over and put in the gel, then flip back and put in my clips.  Then I go sit under the dryer for 15 - 20 minutes, and after that it&#x27;s fully dry, and I can remove the clips, and break the gel cast, if I choose.  No frizz, no drippy hair getting gel on my shirt - just great looking waves and curls. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, so I bought this hair dryer so that I didn&#x27;t have to go out every day with wet hair. It works great. A little bulky I know but for me it beats trying to dry my hair with a diffuser which takes forever. 10 minutes under the dryer and I am good to go. I highly recommend the Touraline Tools 1059.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, full relaxed hair mid back length and this dryer is great! I use the 2 inch magnetic roller for roller setting and my hair drys in an hour and fifteen minutes which is great. The same amount of time if I was in a salon! This dryer gets salon hot! I was concerned about the sturdiness but no issues my 2 yr old son is always trying to play with it and yet again no issues . I was able to assemble it in less than 15 minutes no tools needed !</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer 1yr ago. It worked FABULOUS for deep conditioning and wave/roller sets.  I used it max every 2weeks. I actually feel it worked better than most experienced salon dryers. However over time I noticed the heat element changing and it wasn&#x27;t get as HOT as before. The dryer still dries my hair just takes LOOOoooonger.....Considering buying another but doing my homework on comparables.</li>
            <li> This works awesome and dries the hair very well. Havent had any trouble with it at all and it can be minimozed so stores easily in the garage</li>
            <li> I have owned this hair dryer for 4 years now, never having ANY problems with it.  I mainly use it for when I roller set my hair or deep condition it.  I love the fact that it is portable and not heavy/bulky, so I take it to whatever room is convenient for me at the time. The installation was quick and easy; I even put it together myself.  It dries my hair fairly quickly; before I know it, my hair&#x27;s dry.  I am sitting under it right now with a roller set.  It&#x27;s no louder than the average hair dryer.  It is very easy to use, having a high and low heat setting and a high and low speed setting.  After four years, not one of the parts have broken; it still seems as if it&#x27;s new.  It stores easily out of the way.  The height is adjustable as well.  I highly recommend this well-made, durable hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a quiet dryer, very attractive, and easy to move around, and the third that I have purchased. This is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever had an issue with the bonnet head coming off the pole. I&#x27;ll have to rig up some sort of clamp in order to make it secure. It has fallen off  in my hands a few times now, while adjusting the height. And always when a client was under it!</li>
            <li> This dryer is worth every penny.  It drys my hair in less time than the ones at the hair salon and leaves my hair shiny.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complains about this product ;)shipped quickly I am very enjoy to use this product thank you very much</li>
            <li> I got this dryer a year ago and still works really good. I don&#x27;t use it very often but it&#x27;s really good I do recommend it</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my decision, it works great haven&#x27;t had any problems and was really easy to put together</li>
            <li> Awesome, this dryer has made doing my hair so much easier! Love it! No more crooks in my neck and it allows me to sit comfortably</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer on Jan. 25th of this year, so I&#x27;ve used it for about 9 months now...every two weeks.  I have very thick hair which has been relaxed/permed, no dyes/colors.  I absolutely love this dryer, but I&#x27;ve listed a few notes for you to help you decide.  This is a big investment, so I just wanted to help answer some questions for you that I&#x27;d had when I was researching the best dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this dryer:&lt;br /&gt;(1) It&#x27;s so easy to move around. The wheels make it a dream to move from room to room.  The wheels also have locks on them, which is also an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;(2) It heats up very fast, and continues that same same high speed temperature throughout the sitting.  The airflow is so wonderful/powerful that it will dry your hair EVENLY.  It won&#x27;t leave one corner of your hair damp while other corners are untouched.&lt;br /&gt;(3) The adjustable height is one of the best features...once you adjust it...you won&#x27;t have to do it again, unlike the other typical table top hair dryers.  There is no setup/takedown fuss: When you&#x27;re done, you simply roll it out of the way, the height of the dryer will not change, which makes it super easy during your next sitting.&lt;br /&gt;(4) The Ionic feature dries hair faster.  Before, using the standard tabletop dryer...my hair would (no kidding) take about 1 hour (if straight) to an 1 1/2 (in rollers). This long drying time made me cut my bra strap hair to short hair (Halle Berry) once before.  Both of those times have been literally cut in half for my shoulder length hair.  I&#x27;m no longer sleepy and tired after getting up from under the dryer.  I also use Argan oil which makes dry time even less.&lt;br /&gt;(5) The Ionic feature keeps my hair healthy.  I absolutely love the way my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dryer after sitting under this dryer.  The moisture is retained in my hair...and after I flat iron my hair...it looks amazing.  I&#x27;ve switched all of my hair tools over to ionic tools to give my hair all of the help it needs since I do flat iron everyday and sit under this dryer every two weeks.  It&#x27;s made a huge difference, I love the feel of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about this dryer:&lt;br /&gt;(1) There is a clicking sound that it makes that I&#x27;m not crazy about.  I&#x27;ve learned to tune it out...but if a newer model came out that made less noise, I&#x27;d jump on top of it and hand this version over to my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This is the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve always purchased the typical table top dryer from beauty stores and just got tired of it not putting out the same constant heat level which left my hair damp in certain areas.  Also got tired of the necks breaking from the continuous use of setup/takedowns.  I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;d be without it...it&#x27;s given me the option of continuing to grown my hair down my back now that it doesn&#x27;t take as long to dry.  I&#x27;m a very happy customer!!!!day and sit under this dryer every two weeks.  It&#x27;s made a huge difference, I love the feel of it!

            <li> Great! Was exactly what was described</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day. Way better for my hair that is bleached. Less heat damage.</li>
            <li> Very good heating; even distribution, but difficult to hear anything while you are under the dome.  Otherwise it is just great!</li>
            <li> Works very well so far....just used it once.</li>
            <li> This is awesome! I love that I can roll my hair with the large rollers and they fit comfortably under this dryer. The ionic feature really make my hair look shiny and smooth. It&#x27;s a sturdy and professional item. I recommend it!!! Excellent choice!</li>
            <li> Dries hair while you read or mess around online. It&#x27;s loud so listening to music or watching TV without closed captions on isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d advise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about time someone made a dryer that can be used at home. If you are like me before buying this dryer, I couldn&#x27;t find a table high enough to fit the table to carry dryers. I either had to sit hunched on the floor to sit under it or had to sit on several pillows just to fit under it at a table. I can finally adjust a dryer to fit my height while sitting comfortably in a chair. The temperature is adjustable for what you need. All I can say is &amp;#34;THANK YOU!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Really too soon to rate but I am sure this is a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> When I turned it on, it smelled like it was burning and that was with low speed.  The smell went away and I sat for 30 minutes at low speed and when I turned to high speed, it went completely out after only 10 minutes.  Did I mention this was my FIRST time using it after purchase?</li>
            <li> I love my new Tourmaline Ionic Dryer, before I bought it my hair was dry, no shine, but now my hair is silky, shiny, softer and less frizzy. Now I spent less time drying my hair. I recommend this!!!!</li>
            <li> Piece of crap ! Dont waste your money!&lt;br /&gt;First Time I Turned it On Button Would NOT Turn off</li>
            <li> Liked the design but had to return because it was extremely noisy.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for my salon. I had a Italian made dryer that cost over $400. This dyer is so much better. The cost is great. It gets very hot and you can move it with ease. Its quite and doesn&#x27;t take up much room. Great buy...</li>
            <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;First of i would like to say that i have a course hair texture and i have been trying to figure out what works for my hair without having to apply harsh heat tools. This item was given to me on Christmas of 2009 and i have used it on regular occasions but not enough to judge the durability. Other than that it works so well for my curls. It gives me great soft curls that i absolutely adore. I love dome driers and so far this the first one i own and it is still going good. I do recommend it for any hair texture as it is better tan using a blow drier, styling tools or any sort of heat mechanisms.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! It gets super hot, just wish there was an in-between setting as it is either too hot or too cool! But I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I love that I do not have to go to the salon to do my hair anymore. I am trying to make it so I can do all of my extra things to make me look nice at home. This one is suppose to be good for curly hair, thats why I bought it.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses it, not just me.  They love drying off from a shower, under this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and good prices .</li>
            <li> Its not a bad blow dryer it just takes a really long time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that stable.  The top with the hood only sits on the frame pole.  I had one before and gave it to my daughter.  It was more like the one at the salon.</li>
            <li> Product co. Changed est. Delivery date after it was paid for! I immediately emailed my displeasure, everything went well after that</li>
            <li> Arrived in great condition. Very pleased with the setting options and the quick dry time. I would recommend this product as I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used mine yet but i saw alot of comments about the  top flying off and just wanted to say that it does screw on.</li>
            <li> The stand works very well very convenient&lt;br /&gt;heat well quiet I give it five stars use often love it&lt;br /&gt;would recommend</li>
            <li> we have used duck tape to keep the top from continuing to fall over, what everyone else says is really true, it does break, i would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It is very quick to dry and I have very thick hair. 20-30 minutes and I am good. A little loud but I&#x27;l;l take it. I read some reviews that it might just stop working one day so I hope that doesn&#x27;t happen. I have used it 4 times on myself and daughters since my purchase 1 month ago.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had it about a month and a half working good,&lt;br /&gt;great quality and will recommend to any one who need it!</li>
            <li> So far, so great! Dries fast and evenly, gets nice and hot, and just looks aesthetically cool overall. Love it!</li>
            <li> broken with in a month....waste of money...would not tell my worst hater about this.hate it hate it ..hate it mad..</li>
            <li> Kinda flimsy in the plastic base.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer because I use home perms and it suits my purposes perfectly.  No more plastic bonnets with rotted out smelly elastic.  Totally adjustable and works great.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job.  Very fast.  I can set a read a book while my hair dries.  No wasted time.</li>
            <li> The dryer woks pretty good , I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the performance.  It dries hair relatively fast and although it doesn&#x27;t have &#x27;medium heat&#x27; feature it works fine to me.  I had an issue with this item and contacted the seller with my concerns.  The communication was fast, the seller addressed my issues, with professionalism, they took action in a way I was not expecting, they adjust my bill by giving me a discount, voluntarily... I highly recommend buying from this seller, not many companies nowadays care for their customer&#x27; satisfaction</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast and effectively. I have natural African American hair and it works well when I want to make my braid out or roller set dry fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer has the ionic setting, but I&#x27;m not sure if it actually makes a difference in my hair. I know ions combat frizz and  flat irons that have tourmaline ions work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also a speed (High, Low, off) and heat (high &amp; low) setting. The high heat gets real hot and you would need ear protectors and the low heat is warm.  The dryer is noisy whether its on high or low speed so if you wanna watch TV you have to turn up to volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand can adjust to many heights. I can sit on the floor, sit in a chair or stool and the dryer can adjust. You might have to play with the height adjustments to get it just right and then mark it with tape. Also the purple visors are adjustable which helps conform to different shape heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it only gets 4 stars because of it&#x27;s portability and  storability. Once you assemble the base ..... you wont want to disassemble it. So you&#x27;ll end up with too pieces you have to store the head and the base. both of which are large and awkwardly shaped. Basically its hard to store or transport. I&#x27;ve given up trying to fit it into a closet of concealed space, and I let mine sit in the bathroom in plain view. Another thing, the head just slides onto the stand. It would be better if the head screwed on so its more secure. Sometimes, I bump into it and the head will fall off the base, but it hasn&#x27;t broke yet.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer does exactly what they say. My hair would take 1 1/2 hours to dry sometimes 2 hours depending if I put extra moisturizer on it, since my hair is dry.  However this hair dryer does dry my hair in less time then all the other hairdryers I have tried before. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received this for Christmas this year after having this in my Amazon wish list for over a year.  So far I am very happy with it.  I have used it 3-4 times.  It was easy to assemble.  I like how it raises up and down instead of my constantly adjusting the hood.  When I am under it it seems loud, but when I am standing next to it, it isn&#x27;t loud at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely feel like it dries my hair faster and I think it is cutting down on the frizz.</li>
            <li> Really like this dryer.. I looked at nothing but the comments before purchasing and a lot of people enjoy it also, which made&lt;br /&gt;me comfortable enough to try it!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would purchase a hooded dryer, I was originally looking for the smaller version that packs into the size of a briefcase like my mom used in the 60s.  However, when I saw those options and their prices ($50-80) I started to research hooded dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hot Tools Purple People Heater is perfect for me.  It&#x27;s height is adjustable, price is competitive and it is super easy to assemble and use.  It has low/high and 2 heat settings with an ionic option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long straight hair that takes a long time to dry and style.  I use this every morning that I go to the gym before work as I can apply my makeup while drying my hair, this dryer is wonderful for multitasking!  Also I find myself setting my hair in rollers more often because the dryer does a great job of locking in those curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real negative is that the roller base is big, but it needs to be for stability and the wheels are necessary for portability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is manageable and I only wish I&#x27;d purchased this sooner!</li>
            <li> my wife is not an easy person to please but I could see in her smile as soon as it was put together she loved this dryer.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works well but the materials or design are flawed in my opinion. The hood attaches to the base by sliding a black plastic tube over the metal base post. Too much pressure is placed on the plastic portion as you have to pull down the purple visor or angle the hood. The plastic tube on mine split in about 2 months which is out of the Amazon 30 day return policy. I was led to Helen of Troy who warranties the dryer for one year. They will replace my hair dryer if I ship it back to Texas and I live in MA. The packaging is heavy and large and will cost well over $30 to ship back.&lt;br /&gt;My advise is to buy the dryer locally in case you ever need to use the one year warranty.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer in a local beauty supply, is a good dryer however, you should treat it gently, the plastic part that holds the head on the metal base breaks easily, is made of a cheap plastic therefore I had to repair it myself buying a metal strap and is still unstable, is very noisy which is annoying but it does the job, if you want something more durable spend more than 200.00 dollars because that what salon quality hooded dryers cost.</li>
            <li> I just love love love this hooded dryer! I rave about it all the time. I was apprehensive at first. I saw several posts about pieces breaking easily or odd little things like that. But I made the plunge and I&#x27;m happy I did. I use it all the time and I&#x27;ve had the dryer for almost a year and no problems so far (fingers crossed).</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. It works really well, fast and high quality. Just make sure you have a comfy chair and you&#x27;re set.</li>
            <li> Really cheap junk.  Not worth spending $100.00 on this dryer. Spend $200.00 or more and get a good one. The motor burned out in 4 months used it 6 times.</li>
            <li> It is every thing I wanted but it makes a little more noise than expected.  It dries hair really fast and I would recommend it to anyone&lt;br /&gt;who needs a good home drier.  I usually go to the beauty shop but now I save money doing my hair at home.  I have used this drier&lt;br /&gt;for about two weeks.  I tried the portable drier with a bonnet but didn&#x27; like it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the Price</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in July 2014.  Arrived quickly, packaging was perfect, assembly was incredibly easy.  I use this product once a month.  I am african american with shoulder length hair.  At the time of purchase I was 3 months out from discontinuing relaxers so my hair is part natural at the roots and part straight (chemically) on the length.  I use this project primary for deep conditioning and quick drying bantu knots or similar styles that didn&#x27;t have a chance to finish drying overnight.  I&#x27;ve don&#x27;t the roller set once with the big red rollers -1-1/2\\&quot; I believe and I do not have a small head -- no problems fitting under the dryer.  I also tried a wet wrap once, both time it took my hair about an hour to dry so for me from completely wet hair the drying time is the same one hour I spend under the dryer at the dominican salons and they are pretty hot.  This dryer does not feel HOT like burning so that is a good thing, I was afraid it might be too hot for me, not hotter than my handheld blow dryer which is also 1875.  I don&#x27;t know if this is necessarily faster or better than going to the hairdresser, just more convenient. I don&#x27;t know if the ion setting makes any difference or not haven&#x27;t really had a chance to play with that much.  Things to be aware of the legs on the bottom of the stand are wide like an office chair so you cannot successfully sit under the dryer while in an office chair because the two sets of legs get in the way of each other, try a folding chair or a kitchen table chair where the legs go straight down so you can put the lets of the drying under the chair.  When using on the computer or watching tv yes it is too loud to hear the volume from underneath so you&#x27;ll need earphones for volume, but I usually just check e-mail, surf the web or turn on closed caption.  I am new at doing my own hair (I&#x27;ve always gone to a salon), but I love that this dryer is easy to use.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to do their own hair at home.  Quick Apologies for the typos this new computer is auto correcting and I didn&#x27;t go back to check until after this posted.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s light, easy to assemble, taking five minutes. The bonnet is sturdy, and easily moveable. It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this hair dryer when I first got this, but I love it!  I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for almost 1 year now.  My hair drying time has become a way for me to work on my computer with catching up on emails or paying bills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I think this hair dryer is actually gentler than my previous hand held hair dryer.  I was using one of those high-powered, expensive hair dryers.  This is only my opinion, but my hair definitely feels a lot less drier now that I&#x27;m using this hair dryer mostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I have really long thick hair.  It takes about 45 min to dry my hair.  Also, I have to move around a little to get to the lower part of my hair.  I&#x27;ll do the top of my hair first and then just shift forward in my chair and point the hair dryer towards the lower part of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair turns out super shiny and smooth and no more weird fly-aways at the top of my head anymore!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because even though I&#x27;ve only tried it once and had a hard time with the curlers, the product itself was great. I used massive curlers (I think 2 inches?) and have thick curly hair so it was pretty difficult but I still look forward to trying it next time (with smaller rollers!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot Tools always impresses me with their products. The adjustable stand is so great too, you can sit at your desk, on your bed and even outside! If you are hesitating don&#x27;t! Highly worth it :)</li>
            <li> My hair grew back after some years of over processing and exercise so I was excited to get a dryer where I did not have to apply \\&quot;exact\\&quot; heat.  Well, it dries very well if you have 2 hours to sit in front of the TV, however, it&#x27;s EXTREMELY loud.  I cannot hear anything that is going on around me.&lt;br /&gt;If there were a more quiet version, I&#x27;d be all over it but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this item if you have an infant or a toddler around as you would not be able to hear them!</li>
            <li> My favorite buy of the year!  I was on the fence about buying this for about a year. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE how my hair looks now that I use this thing. I have curly hair. It&#x27;s so hard not to have frizz. However, with this dryer....NO FRIZZ!  I wash my hair, apply my favorite product and sit under the dry anywhere from 10-20 minutes. It used to take 1/2 a day for my hair to dry, and all the movement from walking around caused my hair to frizz. I live in South Florida so the heat and humidity doesn&#x27;t help. Using this dryer, though, makes all the difference. Now my hair looks good for at least 3 days. It&#x27;s awesome!!!  I get compliments on all the time now. Got this a couple of months ago and I&#x27;m still so excited about it.</li>
            <li> Used twice, smokes and burning smell.  Its been a year sine purchase.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item on 9/26.  I got it on 9/29.  Needless to say, SUPER FAST SHIPPING!  I wanted a sit-under dryer that was portable and could get the job done.  (I had used one of those bonnet-style soft dryers where you connect a handheld hair dryer and try drying your locks that way with mixed success).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I did the research on this one, I decided to make a go for it.  And I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The assembly is pretty easy and no tools are really necessary. (Just make sure to re-read the directions if something is not working out or making sense).  The legs (with wheels attached) snap on very easily.  The stand is telescope-like and adjustable for different heights.  (You might want to have a chair handy to see what height works with the dryer.  That way you can adjust it one time and be done.)  The bonnet is sturdy, and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time (today) to bleach my hair.  I cut the dryer on the HIGH heat, with the IONIC setting on.  My hair was \\&quot;done\\&quot; in approximately 25 minutes.  My hair feels soft like baby hair.  No frizz, no fuzz.  I look like a stepped out of a salon, but I just sat in the comfort of my living room and watched TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is: When the dryer is on HIGH does not feel HOT, yet it gets the job done.  Your ears should not burn with this item.  (In the past, with my handheld bonnet dryer, my ears burned.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. Would recommend this to everyone .</li>
            <li> This is a great at home alternative to drying hair.  It allows it to retain it&#x27;s moisture.  10 minutes and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li> I love it so I bought another one for my daughter....</li>
            <li> Im so disappointed in the quality of this dryer! Dryer stopped working after 4 uses! When it did work, I was very pleased with the air output, however, for $119.00, I certainly expected to use it more than four times!</li>
            <li> I use this dryer mostly for deep conditioning treatments and wet rollers, and love it. It&#x27;s easy to use and set up. The hood opens so you can choose how closed in you want to be :). There are different temperature and strength settings, and it works fast and dries evenly. I also love how the height is adjustable--I can literally dry my hair while sitting on my couch reading a magazine, quite the luxury. I&#x27;ll update if I have any problems, but I&#x27;ve had it for two months now and it&#x27;s been fantastic. Well worth the money, in my opinion, if you condition or dry your hair a lot!</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble, no tools needed. I love having this at home, no more blow drying for me, now i relax and read while drying my hair!</li>
            <li> Easy to put together.  Started using it for my curly hair wash and go in place of a diffuser.  Also use it for deep condition treatments.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Gets very hot!!! Low speed takes a long time too. Overall it&#x27;ll get the job done, just consult the heat sensitivity with your client before using.</li>
            <li> Awful! AwfulI!AWFUL!!!!!  I used the dryer maybe 5 times and then put it in the trash where it belong. I could never get the legs to stay on and the high level is to hot and low is not hot enough, almost cold.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my daughter who just finished beauty school.  It works well and we use it all the time. Have owned it a few months with no heat problems. My only complaint, the legs kept falling off as we moved it around. My husband fixed it with some sort of glue. No problems now.</li>
            <li> the pole broke after 2 weeks the dryer was OK at best had to buy a c clamp to fix it&lt;br /&gt;what a waste</li>
            <li> For the price, it is pretty good. But, the heat only comes from the top and relies on the enclosure to bring the heat to the back, front and sides. The wheels are cheap and they will not move freely. The dryer does not snap on properly and will fall to the ground if you do not pick it up right. All in all, this little dryer is decent for the price. The thing I love most about it is the name &amp;#34;The Purple People Heater.&amp;#34; Gotta love it!!</li>
            <li> Very good dryer and easy to assemble. I would like to give 5 stars, but the construction is all plastic and its too early to judge its durability over time.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these from my hairdresser several years ago and loved it then, love it now!  This \\&quot;Purple People Heater\\&quot; is powerful and keeps my hands-free to check my emails, put on my makeup, do my nails, read a mag, or just relax...</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I adjusted it to a height such that I can sit on the floor and not need a chair. I have it in a corner in my walk in closet works perfect for me. I used huge jumbo rollers for an easy at-home blow-dry. When I am short of time to put in rollers on all of my hair,or if I am plain just lazy, i  put the rollers on just  the front half of my head. I  tie a bun with the rest of my hair on the rear half of my head, and secure it with a prong. Then I sit under my personal girly time-machine and read a book- for about 20 minutes or do homework, or call my mom or my sister , or drag the machine to front of my mirror and do my make up. Voila!  Frizz free blow-dried hair. No tired hands, no tugging and no need to drive to a hair saloon.</li>
            <li> I could not imagine getting a salon-type hair drying for such a low price, but here it is!</li>
            <li> Dryer needs a variable heat setting function. They only give you 2 Low &amp; High Low takes to long to dry your hair and the Hot is to hot. If only the heat setting was variable, this thing would be great.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of having my own professional dryer.  I just wish it had a timer, that would make it perfect for me.  Otherwise, great product would definitely recommend if you don&#x27;t mind keeping your own time.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer! Works great. Dries my hair much faster than my old hooded dryer. I also love the ability to adjust the height of the hood. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking for a good dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black female with type 4 hair relaxed. I&#x27;m done burning and drying my hair out with a hand-held dryer. I will keep the hand-held dryer for when I go to the beach. My hair is breaking more than ever because I switched to a hand held dryer. I use to have hair past my shoulders and now I had to cut it up to the bottom of my neck! Before the hand-held dryer, I used to use the table top-bonnet dryer and my hair was soft and healthy. The only problem was the bonnet would flop forward and whack me in the face. Long story short, I bought this one where I can comfortably sit at the table, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing at this very moment, drying my hair with this lovely hair dryer and typing this review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Pretty! I like the purple bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;2. I like the fact that I can sit at the table comfortable not worrying if the bonnet will flop forward down on my face.&lt;br /&gt;3. I feel very comfortable. I believe that&#x27;s my biggest PRO!&lt;br /&gt;4. It took me about 6 minutes to put it together out of the box. Very easy!&lt;br /&gt;5. On the side, it says, &amp;#34;Purple People Heater&amp;#34; named after the &amp;#34;flyer purple people eater&amp;#34; and a logo of the actual character.....cute!&lt;br /&gt;6. Ion setting is great for dryer the hair faster.&lt;br /&gt;7. Will not burn out my hair so that I can grow it longer again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Storage?&lt;br /&gt;2. It only has two settings low or high&lt;br /&gt;3. The &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; which is what I use because I don&#x27;t have a choice, is not very high, but I guess that&#x27;s a PRO since too much heat is not good for your hair anyways.&lt;br /&gt;4. The low is cool air. It would have been nice to have the low setting a little warmer because as it stands now, it has no purpose. It would have been great for conditioning the hair.&lt;br /&gt;5. People have complained about the smoky smell. It&#x27;s true but it went away after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;6. I keep it at low speed to prevent burning out the motor. because I read some reviews saying that it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;7.  It takes longer than my hand-held. My hand-held took 20 minutes, this one takes an hour for me (it depends on the hair type).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there it is. Seven PROS and seven cons. My question is: What is the durability of this product after paying $125? I guess I will eventually see and give you all an update in the upcoming months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOUR MONTH LATER UPDATE: July 12, 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this dryer every week for over four months and it still works fabulously. I&#x27;m under it right now typing this update. I cut off my burnt hair (from the using a hand-held bower dryer) and my new hair is growing in lovely. No burnt ends. It&#x27;s about 3 inches longer. I&#x27;m excited! I stand corrected when I said in the above cons (#3) that it&#x27;s not very hot.. That was a mistake on my part. I didn&#x27;t lower the purple hood down enough so my hair wasn&#x27;t drying fast. Now that I did that, it is really hot. Not too hot, but perfect! My hair is shoulder length and it takes 50 minutes to dry.I love the fact that it&#x27;s light-weight and transportable. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better dryer. I use it to condition my hair then dry it. I feel so comfortable sitting in this chair and double tasking.r for me (it depends on the hair type).  So there it is. Seven PROS and seven cons. My question is: What is the durability of this product after paying $125? I guess I will eventually see and give you all an update in the upcoming months.  FOUR MONTH LATER UPDATE: July 12, 2015  I have been using this dryer every week for over four months and it still works fabulously. I&#x27;m under it right now typing this update.

            <li> My husband surprised me with this to help in my Curly Girl Method.  I love how it helps add volume to my hair!</li>
            <li> Everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I have no Idea if it does what it says because I didn&#x27;t really gauge the before and after. But it was easy to put together and it arrived on time. My head with curlers is too big to fit under completely. But in the end my hair is noticeably straighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/12/2013 Update I can no longer use this dryer because it keeps turning off the power in the house. So my money was wasted.</li>
            <li> so after spending A$107 ... for this dryer , that I use ( once a week , because I have thick and long hair )&lt;br /&gt;last sunday it made an awful noice  , my husband jumped up and turned it off ( he is an electrican )&lt;br /&gt;and found by moving the hood part that 2 screws and a washer feel out... I have used this only 4 times and rolled it into a spear bedroom so it would not fall or get bumped into ..... and now I can&#x27;t use it or even return it ... missed &amp;#34; my window&amp;#34; ... really ????&lt;br /&gt;SO UPSET &amp;#60; WITH THIS PRODUCT&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; for the price you should have a better return police ... JUST SAYING .... expected a great product... DON&#x27;T BUY THIS ... waste of your hard earned money</li>
            <li> I love this dryer gets very hot I am a stylist working at home it cuts my drying time in half better then the regular dryers in the salon</li>
            <li> Works well but feel it it&#x27;snot too sturdy</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble and to use. i love it.</li>
            <li> Just got my dryer yesterday and I plan on using it tonight!  It is so adorable and I love the color.  I was scared to purchase this item because of the reviews about the smell of the heat from the dryer and top purple peace breaking.  Well in regards to that it does smell a little funny probably because it has been sitting in a factory but i think over time it should go away.  As for the purple top piece i would be careful..it does seem to be a bit on the fragile side so just dont be rough and you should be fine.  What I love about it is the height adujstment aspect of it, no longer am I fumbling around with a bonnet dryer(like the ones you have to sit on a table).  I am very comfortable and happy.  It even has a one year warranty so you can get it repaired, if it breaks.  I will update my review if I have the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I am very happy that I spent the money..it seemed expensive but you are getting what you pay for :).</li>
            <li> This was very convenient to have on cold NJ mornings.  I would sip my tea as my long, thick, course hair dried.  The settings are basically &amp;#34;too cool&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;scorching&amp;#34; so be prepared to switch back and forth between the two - but otherwise dried my hair nicely.  This is very easy to move around and the pole is adjustable - but this takes up a lot of room and will cause your friends to make fun of you when they see it.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer! It&#x27;s sturdy, but its kind of big, but I don&#x27;t mind. It gets really hot and the tourmaline helps dry your hair faster.</li>
            <li> Got this dryer last week 11/23/2012 used it for the first time tonight 11/27/2012, I&#x27;M PISSED! While it was easy to assemble, pretty in looks, got under the dryer setting the control first at high speed, got a little too HOT so I lowered the speed to LOW and to my surprise it starting CLICKING! WHAT???? Are you kidding me?! For that kind of money and for wanting to go from a blow dryer to this type, I immediately got angry thinking if I keep this piece of junk with the motor clicking like it was it wouldn&#x27;t last me a good 6 months. I immediately notified the seller of a return authorization. Will gladly accept a replacement if I don&#x27;t have to pay a return shipment and will give an updated review when my new one comes in. But for now it is what it is and I&#x27;m not a happy customer. The QUEEN better be satisfied FAST or I&#x27;ll have much more to say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK it&#x27;s 12/7/2012 and I received my replacement unit last night. Not only was I surprised at the speedy turnaround, but this unit works properly and The QUEEN is well pleased. I was also refunded shipping costs which I was also impressed with, thank you very much! I will continue to shop from this company you all have been excellent with customer service.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this dryer after reading some of the unfavorable reviews but I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far. I can&#x27;t vouch for the longevity yet, time will tell. It was very easy to assemble but not super sturdy. I&#x27;d recommend being careful while assembling. As I was attaching the legs, a small plastic part of the wheel lock (lever) broke off in my hand. I was bummed (that&#x27;s why my rating is 4 stars) but the broken piece doesn&#x27;t really affect anything as far as my needs are concerned. The dryer itself works really well and the high/ionic setting heats up quickly. Has a slight rattle sound when I first turn it on but it&#x27;s not bothersome in my opinion. This dryer is perfect for my deep conditioning treatments and the adjustable height is nice. Makes it easy to position behind any chair. Also love the &amp;#34;Purple People Heater&amp;#34; logo - cute!</li>
            <li> This compact dryer gets the job done.  It&#x27;s pretty sturdy and moves easily over the tiles in my bathroom.  It is not tall enough to dry hair while standing though but it quickly adjust to varies sitting heights.  Easy to put together as well.</li>
            <li> So far so good I like this dryer a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of months now, and I use it 1-2 times a week.  It drys my hair evenly, quickly, and I get to browse the internet on my ipad since my hands are free :)</li>
            <li> Great Price. All I need is a chair. lol It works great just like the pros. Works inside of home in can use home outlets.</li>
            <li> I am a stylist and this is great, the dryer is very portable and adjustable.... Ladies you will love it!</li>
            <li> This is the worst portable hair dryer.  It does not get hot.  Used it for 20 minutes and it only blew cold air. It does not extend high enough for clients to sit in a chair under it.  Very disappointed.</li>
