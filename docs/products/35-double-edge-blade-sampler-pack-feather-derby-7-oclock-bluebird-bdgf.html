    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I can tell you that it is the best value and without doubt the best shave you will get!</li>
            <li>A 5 pack came with my Edwin Jagger and after shaving with Meijer brand DE blades and than getting this pack, I think they are the best for my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price for the selection?</li>
            <li>Good selection,Great price,very happy.</li>
            <li>A good buy that will save you tons versus mega razors or disposable razors.</li>
            <li>I specifically chose this one because it had both Derby and Feather which I heard nothing but good things about.</li>
            <li>man am I glad I did buy a sampler pack!</li>
            <li>A nice assortment of razors.</li>
            <li>There are better samplers out there for the beginner in DE shaving, but it still has some good brands.</li>
            <li>All of the blades are quality blades although each person will have their own preference.</li>
            <li>I found the Feather blades to be awesome, they work great and are extremely sharp.</li>
            <li>Yes, there are many good reviews for Derby&#x27;s(mostly) and they are a fine blade just not for me, thus a sampler pack will do anyone justice.     </li>
            <li>I started with the  Merkur blade that came with the Merkur 180, got a great first shave ever.</li>
            <li>Make sure your beard is prepared, you use a brush, some type of cream, soap, lather up and shave away.</li>
            <li>then I switched to the 7AM blade in the sampler pack and got a better shave.</li>
            <li>This performed about the same as the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather was the best.  </li>
            <li>I love this assortment.</li>
            <li>I was most eager to try</li>
            <li>In fact, It feels like I had to do more passes on the Feathers than the Derbys.</li>
            <li>I personally love the Feather and the 7O&#x27;Clock blades.</li>
            <li>Obviously, not knowing what blades would be better for my skin, sampler packs are the best way to go.</li>
            <li>I have to do more passes over my face with those Derby blades</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t say one is best overall</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with the Feather hi-stainless blades...</li>
            <li>Some of the blades are ok, some not.</li>
            <li>They fit great in the razor and they appear to be high quality.</li>
            <li>Now, after reading about the Derby&#x27;s I expected the best shave of my life to come when I switched yesterday.</li>
            <li>They are good, but I don&#x27;t think I will need to buy anymore for 10 years haha.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can try this many razors so affordably and not get stuck with a large inventory of something i don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>The blade just didn&#x27;t fit my skin type.</li>
            <li>This is the bast way to cheaply see which blades work for you.</li>
            <li>This is a good way to try different blades.</li>
            <li>but I will say the Feathers give me the best shave with the least amount of irritation.</li>
            <li>Still 5 stars due to convenience of a variety pack and great quality blades.</li>
            <li>so I could try out several different brands and figure out what was the best blade for me.</li>
            <li>What can you say about a package like this other than I liked most but not all.  </li>
            <li>Tried the Bluebirds first and was not a fan, but the Feathers have been fantastic.</li>
            <li>Read other reviews and websites, learn, most importantly take your TIME, and enjoy!     </li>
            <li>So far I like the Feather and Blue Birds the best as they handle different growths the most consistently.</li>
            <li>Every kind of blade is different for everyone</li>
            <li>Enjoy the new world of DE/wet shaving!</li>
            <li>Now having had these blades for a little over a month, I am pleased to say that I have never felt better about a purchase than I have with this one.</li>
            <li>Great way to try out several different blades without taking a bite out of your wallet.</li>
            <li>My only thinking is that I probably should have bought more of a sampler pack, but it seems that I can work with what I have.</li>
            <li>Like many, I bought this sampler pack to get exposure to the different kinds of DE razor blades on the market.</li>
            <li>I was so glad that I could purchase a variety pack to try out different blades.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Package arrived with all items as exactly describe in the listing.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to try as many new blades as possible.</li>
            <li>Gillette was a pleasant surprise even though it only lasted for 4 shaves before I started to feel it drag</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bluebird is kind of an odd one, but it is very well-liked.</li>
            <li>This is a great little sample kit to try out a handful of different blades.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get that much closer a shave than the Derbys.</li>
            <li>Cant tell difference between the feather blades and 7o clock stainless blades.</li>
            <li>Wet shaving noobs, this is a pretty good package.&lt;br /&gt;Derby is a pretty forgiving blade, and 7 oclock slightly sharper, and feather is on the extreme side of sharpness, so you can gradually change over to sharper and sharper blades as you develop more</li>
            <li>However, the Derby Extras handle thick, three day old growth remarkably well.</li>
            <li>The main reason that you are looking at this review is to decide if you want to buy a sampler pack.</li>
            <li>Although, I mainly bought it to try the Feather blades &#x3D;</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just wanting to try a few different brands, this is a good start.  </li>
            <li>thought I would like the Derby a little more than I did.  </li>
            <li>Live and learn...    </li>
            <li>While most sample packs are expensive, and offer little difference, this package worked nicely, offering a wide array of blades, all of which I&#x27;ve read have stunning reviews.</li>
            <li>Look for other reviews I have coming soon enough with more detail.     </li>
            <li>If you have just started wet shaving and want to check out a few different blade types this is a great way to do it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So, to say the least, I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy the 100 pack as some people did thinking it would be the end all.</li>
            <li>if you find that you really like Derby or Blue Bird, bit if you don&#x27;t your kinda stuck with the rest of them.</li>
            <li>It offers a selection to try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this was a decent sampling and got me some needed experience with different brands.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how different each blade is.</li>
            <li>I barely got a close shave with them and wasn&#x27;t not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though the yellow one seems to have the same name as the black ones, my boyfriend and I agreed that the black ones were WAY better than the yellows.  </li>
            <li>Being new to shaving with single edge razors</li>
            <li>As yet I haven&#x27;t gotten around to using the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to someone that is new to single edge shaving?  </li>
            <li>and I mostly shave in the shower and usually shave everyday.    </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s the only blade to ever give me little nicks and drags in certain areas on my face.</li>

            <li> Only complaint with this specific purchase is that there are duplicates of blade type, I would have rather had 7 different types of blades since I was new to safety razors</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was not very fond of the Blue Bird at all - gave me razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler pack back in July along with other shaving supplies as I&#x27;ve just this year started using a DE razor.</li>
            <li> The Gillette blades aren&#x27;t too bad either, better than some low end ones I&#x27;ve bought from the store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> shave every day and have a pretty tough beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Derby came in second on the list, but from now on I&#x27;ll probably just stick to the Feather blades in the black box.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this sampler is that it has few blade types, though it has a lot of each type which is a plus</li>
            <li> I will tell other friends about wishstar and his selection of prouducts.no</li>
            <li> They are both close sharp shaves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard and only shave every few days since my beard growth isn&#x27;t crazy fast either.</li>
            <li> I will try a few others, but for now, my go-to razor will be Derbys.</li>
            <li> Actually it was the worst.</li>
            <li> Just a bad shave.</li>
            <li> do know that Bluebird and 7 O&#x27;clock were awful.</li>
            <li> But the Derby blades are terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a good way to try different blades. I was surprised at how different each blade is.</li>
            <li> I am keeping this rather short as I am just learning about DE shaving. I can tell you that it is the best value and without doubt the best shave you will get! I am amazed from the start. Read other reviews and websites, learn, most importantly take your TIME, and enjoy!     Make sure your beard is prepared, you use a brush, some type of cream, soap, lather up and shave away. You will never cut yourself with the proper time allowed and and treatment. I have sensitive skin so anyone reading can know from the start and I mostly shave in the shower and usually shave everyday.    The main reason that you are looking at this review is to decide if you want to buy a sampler pack. If you have read any DE reviews about razors or blades it probably has led you to here as you shop around. Simple answer, Buy one. It does not have to be this one, but buy one!    Here is why. I started with the  Merkur blade that came with the Merkur 180, got a great first shave ever. I used that blade for 4 days then I switched to the 7AM blade in the sampler pack and got a better shave. Used that for a week. Now, after reading about the Derby&#x27;s I expected the best shave of my life to come when I switched yesterday. Actually it was the worst. No cuts or burns. Just a bad shave. Simple enough the blade just isn&#x27;t for me. So, to say the least, I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy the 100 pack as some people did thinking it would be the end all. The blade just didn&#x27;t fit my skin type. Yes, there are many good reviews for Derby&#x27;s(mostly) and they are a fine blade just not for me, thus a sampler pack will do anyone justice.     My only thinking is that I probably should have bought more of a sampler pack, but it seems that I can work with what I have. Actually the reason I bought a smaller sampler pack was because I felt when I got to the Derby&#x27;s I would end there, or the Feathers of course. I will let you know about the Feathers when I get to those. Live and learn...    Look for other reviews I have coming soon enough with more detail.     Enjoy the new world of DE/wet shaving!</li>
            <li> Good selection,Great price,very happy.I will tell other friends about wishstar and his selection of prouducts.no one is paying me to say this.</li>
            <li> A nice assortment of razors. The feathers are my favorites but I&#x27;m not a fan of the Gillettes. A good buy that will save you tons versus mega razors or disposable razors.</li>
            <li> There are better samplers out there for the beginner in DE shaving, but it still has some good brands. The only problem with this sampler is that it has few blade types, though it has a lot of each type which is a plus if you find that you really like Derby or Blue Bird, bit if you don&#x27;t your kinda stuck with the rest of them. Then again I know it&#x27;s all personal preference...</li>
            <li> What can you say about a package like this other than I liked most but not all.  That is not a detriment to this pack at all as it is designed for you to try multiple brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave every day and have a pretty tough beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not very fond of the Blue Bird at all - gave me razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette was a pleasant surprise even though it only lasted for 4 shaves before I started to feel it drag and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would like the Derby a little more than I did.  This performed about the same as the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather was the best.  I have used it for 6 days and it has just started to feel like its time to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather is the winner and will be my next bulk purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this assortment. Being new to shaving with single edge razors I love the fact that I can try this many razors so affordably and not get stuck with a large inventory of something i don&#x27;t like. I am going though the packages one at a time as opposed to using a different blade each week. I figured this way it would be easier to rate them over different conditions as I don&#x27;t shave every day as a matter of course. So I get to sample them handling heavier growth or daily growth depending on my work schedule and client calls. So far I like the Feather and Blue Birds the best as they handle different growths the most consistently. However, the Derby Extras handle thick, three day old growth remarkably well. As yet I haven&#x27;t gotten around to using the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to someone that is new to single edge shaving?  Absolutely. Great price for the selection? Yes indeed.</li>
            <li> Like many, I bought this sampler pack to get exposure to the different kinds of DE razor blades on the market. For me the winner is Derby. A 5 pack came with my Edwin Jagger and after shaving with Meijer brand DE blades and than getting this pack, I think they are the best for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feather blades I was most eager to try and I didn&#x27;t get that much closer a shave than the Derbys. In fact, It feels like I had to do more passes on the Feathers than the Derbys. It also seemed like the Feathers were a hair too short for my safety razor, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do know that Bluebird and 7 O&#x27;clock were awful. I barely got a close shave with them and wasn&#x27;t not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this was a decent sampling and got me some needed experience with different brands. I will try a few others, but for now, my go-to razor will be Derbys.</li>
            <li> I was so glad that I could purchase a variety pack to try out different blades. All of the blades are quality blades although each person will have their own preference. I personally love the Feather and the 7O&#x27;Clock blades. They are both close sharp shaves. Only complaint with this specific purchase is that there are duplicates of blade type, I would have rather had 7 different types of blades since I was new to safety razors and I wanted to try as many new blades as possible. Still 5 stars due to convenience of a variety pack and great quality blades.</li>
            <li> It offers a selection to try. Still trying them out.</li>
            <li> This is a great little sample kit to try out a handful of different blades.  If you have just started wet shaving and want to check out a few different blade types this is a great way to do it.</li>
            <li> Bought these so I could try out several different brands and figure out what was the best blade for me. Tried the Bluebirds first and was not a fan, but the Feathers have been fantastic. Great way to try out several different blades without taking a bite out of your wallet.</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler pack back in July along with other shaving supplies as I&#x27;ve just this year started using a DE razor. Obviously, not knowing what blades would be better for my skin, sampler packs are the best way to go. I specifically chose this one because it had both Derby and Feather which I heard nothing but good things about. Although, I mainly bought it to try the Feather blades &#x3D;P&lt;br /&gt;And man am I glad I did buy a sampler pack! I found the Feather blades to be awesome, they work great and are extremely sharp. The Gillette blades aren&#x27;t too bad either, better than some low end ones I&#x27;ve bought from the store.&lt;br /&gt; But the Derby blades are terrible! I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard and only shave every few days since my beard growth isn&#x27;t crazy fast either. But those Derby blades gave me the most uncomfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I actually prefer the Wilkinson Sword brand over those cause they actually feel like they have an edge and aren&#x27;t as abrasive on my skin. I have to do more passes over my face with those Derby blades so irritated skin is unavoidable. Also, it&#x27;s the only blade to ever give me little nicks and drags in certain areas on my face. In total, I&#x27;ve only used two blades.&lt;br /&gt;So besides me ranting about Derby, I recommend buying sampler packs because YMMV.</li>
            <li> This is the bast way to cheaply see which blades work for you. Every kind of blade is different for everyone so I won&#x27;t say one is best overall but I will say the Feathers give me the best shave with the least amount of irritation.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just wanting to try a few different brands, this is a good start.  I&#x27;m in love with the Feather hi-stainless blades... Even though the yellow one seems to have the same name as the black ones, my boyfriend and I agreed that the black ones were WAY better than the yellows.  Derby came in second on the list, but from now on I&#x27;ll probably just stick to the Feather blades in the black box.</li>
            <li> my Husband loves these blades.  He has tried a couple of them since I ordered them for him.  They fit great in the razor and they appear to be high quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I wanted to try some different blades. They are good, but I don&#x27;t think I will need to buy anymore for 10 years haha.</li>
            <li> Some of the blades are ok, some not.</li>
            <li> This sample pack had various blade styles to chose from and met all of my expectations.  It has definable given me the blade I will use for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Cant tell difference between the feather blades and 7o clock stainless blades. Package arrived with all items as exactly describe in the listing.</li>
            <li> While most sample packs are expensive, and offer little difference, this package worked nicely, offering a wide array of blades, all of which I&#x27;ve read have stunning reviews. Now having had these blades for a little over a month, I am pleased to say that I have never felt better about a purchase than I have with this one. I concurently bought another sample pack, and the buyer even combined shipping, to save delivery charges. I would buy here over and over!</li>
            <li> Wet shaving noobs, this is a pretty good package.&lt;br /&gt;Derby is a pretty forgiving blade, and 7 oclock slightly sharper, and feather is on the extreme side of sharpness, so you can gradually change over to sharper and sharper blades as you develop more skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bluebird is kind of an odd one, but it is very well-liked.</li>
