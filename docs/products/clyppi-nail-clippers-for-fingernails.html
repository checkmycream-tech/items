            <li>For that reason alone, I felt good about having ordered the &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a good pair of fingernail clippers and wanted to buy some German-made ones.  </li>
            <li>This feels so good on my hands, no poking or pinching when trying to use it.</li>
            <li>Good steel just lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good, but nothing like the originals.</li>
            <li>It’s so good</li>
            <li>Grip on clippers was good.</li>
            <li>And it is a good nail clipper for men as well as women because it is not too “girly”.</li>
            <li>Good stocking stuffer for the men on my list.</li>
            <li>Good profile on the edge which helps me cut on scratchy parts of my cuticles.</li>
            <li>As a nail clipper it&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li>Being a good person, I wanted to hurry and try the clippers and write a review, however I had just gotten a pedicure and manicure two days ago.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t fair to try a fingernail clipper on a toenail, but it worked fantastically.  </li>
            <li>Good product---good service</li>
            <li>I loved these while they lasted.  </li>
            <li>You can buy a good one too from the store with 7-8 bucks .</li>
            <li>made and good quality.</li>
            <li>Good clippers.</li>
            <li>so I could have a good set of emergency clippers to replace some crappy ones that I already had.  </li>
            <li>Matte finish is gorgeous</li>
            <li>I had received the toenail clippers for review, and knew once I loved those I knew that I had to also do a review for fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li>I like the clippers, they do a good job.</li>
            <li>The integral nail file is good too.</li>
            <li>Used twice, loved it.  </li>
            <li>good clippers.</li>
            <li>I am a toolmaker by trade, so I know good tools when I use them...</li>
            <li>My husband wanted a really good pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>I had a nice cheapie that worked great</li>
            <li>Love a good tool!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this clipper is beautifully crafted with great fit and finish.</li>
            <li>It is the best nail clipper I ever have, but it will be perfect if it has a hole to attach to a key chain.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.  </li>
            <li>did receive the Clyppi nail clippers, tried them and am very satisfied with the results.</li>

            <li>It looks amazing.</li>
            <li>These things are simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>I must say that this company has amazing customer service.</li>
            <li>They worked great until they broke after 8 months of light use by one person.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic nail clipper and you will be happy when you purchase it.</li>
            <li>The vendor/seller is a great communicator and my transaction went really smooth and this is what Amazon purchases should be about.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest</li>
            <li>I really believe this is the best nail clipper I have ever owned!    </li>
            <li>The nail must then be filed to keep it from &#x27;catching&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>but would be nice touch...</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best nail clipper!!!</li>
            <li>Has a nice and sleek design.</li>
            <li>I recieved my order and asked how I liked the Clyppi ).</li>
            <li>I liked the quality</li>
            <li>But, I am satisfied and want to still give them a good review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Aa nicely engineered grooming tool.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered the Clyppi because I liked the name and it looked like a nice design.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making an excellent product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li>They look nice but in my opinion the quality of those that I received aren&#x27;t up to the standards of $1 store clippers.</li>
            <li>Plus, it has a nice form factor, which is always nice to see.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to get a nice fingernail clipper to see if there was any difference compared to drugstore clippers.  </li>
            <li>I really needed some clippers for my fingernails that would do an excellent cut.  </li>
            <li>The customer service and follow-up communications are both efficient and courteous.</li>
            <li>If that makes any kind of sense..  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best nail clipper I have owned.</li>
            <li>nice touch.</li>
            <li>very* pricey or not the greatest in quality...</li>
            <li>Nice finger clipper.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely the best fingernail clippers that I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent clipper and very well made.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer sent me an email asking how I liked them, when I mentioned it they immediately sent me a replacement set without me</li>
            <li>Really nice design as well.</li>
            <li>The Clyppi gives a nice, even cut on thicker nails as well.</li>
            <li>These work incredibly well and knowing this, are worth the price.</li>
            <li>Good nail clippers, much better department store standby.  </li>
            <li>We really liked the built in file.&lt;br /&gt;Ill</li>
            <li>He liked that the metal didn’t flex.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t get some nice clippers before.  </li>
            <li>Nice Job.</li>
            <li>Both are excellent clippers and deserving of their high ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Clyppi is great, easy to use and a very precise cutter.  </li>
            <li>I love to do things for myself and what better way than to have your nails and toes nice and neat!</li>
            <li>In particular, the area that is pressed to make it cut the nail is perfectly designed for the thumb to perform the task.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing innovative or exceptional about them.  </li>
            <li>They are sharp and cut perfectly and best of all are easily handled.</li>
            <li>Clyppi is my new best friend.</li>
            <li>I have used my new Clyppie nail clippers for about a week now and am very impressed with the precision with which they cut.</li>
            <li>Your personalized emails are most impressive and appreciated.</li>
            <li>As soon as I purchased these I received an email from the maker saying how much I was going to love these clippers, that they were the best around.</li>
            <li>I get great control and can trim my fast-growing nails evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li>Very strong.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and handle.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The design of the device makes it very easy to do the job that it was designed.  </li>
            <li>Super adorable and functional clippers!!  </li>
            <li>This one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far, a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>These are by far the BEST clippers I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>With my die grinder, I sharpened my 15 year old drug store clippers and they work superbly.</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>the good Trim ones were still available.</li>
            <li>The Clyppi was by far the best.</li>
            <li>My clippers always leave my nails smooth and give me a good edge.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best clippers I have owned.  </li>
            <li>Took a chance on the Clyppi based on great average user rating (Amazon) and I must admit these are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality well worth the money</li>
            <li>Clean, crisp cut, best one I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold, trim cleanly, - love them!</li>
            <li>Nice, clean cuts!</li>
            <li>Pretty happy with the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the idea of supporting people who develop a great product rather than</li>
            <li>I purchased the Clyppi for toe nails first and after using them and how great they were-</li>
            <li>I am very happy that there is a lifetime guarantee on the Clyppi Fingernail clippers, they are extremely well made, but it is good to know that they are replaceable should there ever be a problem.  </li>
            <li>These nail clippers are pretty great.</li>
            <li>Great product, costs a little more than most but ease of operation and excellent design make this a five star product.</li>
            <li>This is one fine product!</li>
            <li>Also clipping is very comfortable, but the nail file needs improvement.</li>
            <li>It gives a very precise cut, even on toenails, for which it is not designed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light despite the size.</li>
            <li>They are very precise and sharper</li>
            <li>Very smooth cuts.  </li>
            <li>These are all small criticisms of a great nail clipper which fulfills its intended use with great aplomb!</li>
            <li>Nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;The new clipper is amazing a lives up to all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yours had a good review and price, so I tried a pair and was very satisfied, super sharp, and very good alignment!!</li>
            <li>Really good nail clippers, they cut easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>The top of the handle is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love the &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I bought two more sets to give as Christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t find it 3 times better than ones sold in drug stores for 3-5 bucks</li>
            <li>Worked great in the beginning but dulled rather fast</li>
            <li>The placement of the built-in file is perfect and provides extra grip at the tip of my thumb.</li>
            <li>I felt so confident using the Clyppi fingernail trimmers</li>
            <li>I was able to use them on my toddler as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these clippers.</li>
            <li>I love the Clyppi nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>Make more items :)</li>
            <li>Outstanding construction.</li>
            <li>These clippers work fabulously, and they feel nice in my hand.  </li>
            <li>1000 times better than anything I can purchase at drug or grocery store.</li>
            <li>While the materials, design and concept are undeniable superb, the engineering could use a second look.  </li>
            <li>I used it once - did a nice job of precisely trimming my nails as advertised.  </li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m ordering more Clyppi nail clippers for family.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>I love the clipper.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t think of ever using a better pair of nail clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve literally never used a better nail clipper in my life.  </li>
            <li>I received the Clyppi clippers (cute name) and have already used them on my toenails.</li>
            <li>and I’m glad I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Then I realized that it would be more convenient to have one in my bathroom upstairs</li>
            <li>and I love having them.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for Men with big hands ..</li>
            <li>It clips finger and toe nails nice and smoothly.</li>
            <li>I would gladly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I enjoy products that do the job without breaking and this passes the test!</li>
            <li>I bought 2 more.  </li>
            <li>I also realized after receiving them that they have a nail file built in where you see the rectangle on top.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I’m going to order some more to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li>I love using it, but it needs a bit more space between the top of the file and the hinge.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>also love the way the nail file is built into the handle.</li>
            <li>It is so much more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and they are a better size for both my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer proactively contacted me to inquire how I was enjoying the product.</li>
            <li>For years I have used drugstore clippers and been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Clyppi for my husband who is always “complaining” that we need better fingernail clippers as a Fathers Day gift.</li>
            <li>I hope to love them for years.</li>
            <li>The lever arm seems more bent up for added leverage.  </li>
            <li>buying more for gifts.</li>
            <li>If it would have been even half-inch longer it would make even better for holding to clip nails.</li>
            <li>It cuts quick and clean and has a great file incorporated into the clipper handle.</li>
            <li>Love the clipper.  </li>
            <li>But they are still much better than any others I had.</li>
            <li>I decided to check Amazon, and from the many nail clippers offered, I choose to order Clyppi.  </li>
            <li>These are the best and the difference is obvious.</li>
            <li>For the cost, I was expecting more; something a lot better, and that&#x27;s not what these are.  </li>
            <li>Would be just the slightest bit better with grip pads and a cuticle device added.</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 more sets..</li>
            <li>Better than others?</li>
            <li>but I love quality and that&#x27;s what the these are.</li>
            <li>These are better.  </li>
            <li>Love the grip and they don&#x27;t slip out of your hand.  </li>
            <li>Keegan Allen&#x27;s Clyppi is 2X better, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>now that my wife found them, i&#x27;ll undoubtedly be buying more.</li>
            <li>Great for the whole household, including youngsters learning to clip nails.</li>
            <li>More marketing than any revolutionary tech.</li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent product.</li>
            <li>They are fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, I guess.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;~They are sturdy &amp; stylish</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the ease and comfort of it since sometimes I have arthritic discomfort in my hands.</li>
            <li>I just bought two more sets as birthday gifts.</li>
            <li>Finally, I decided to go to Google \\&quot;best fingernail clipper\\&quot; and arrived at Amazon&#x27;s number one item: Clyppi.</li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>You can buy cheaper, I&#x27;m sure, but this is a well-made item.</li>
            <li>The problem is that the top and bottom blades do not meet correctly and as a result they tear more than cut and leave my nails more jagged and torn than neatly clipped.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a wonderful product for those that have disabilities.</li>
            <li>AND most guys I know just grab a clipper</li>
            <li>These are way better than the cheap over the counter kind that you buy at the drug store.</li>
            <li>So much better than the drug store variety.</li>
            <li>Was really hoping that this would be a great clipper</li>
            <li>The Clyppi is a much better product</li>
            <li>The top piece popped off one time</li>
            <li>clippers but prefer these &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34; ones because I have a better grip with them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more of these for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>its OK,</li>
            <li>Fantastic clippers!  </li>
            <li>So glad I no longer have to worry about that.  </li>
            <li>I shall be ordering more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am SO glad that I purchased these clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not an engineer, so I&#x27;m not quite sure, what they have done that makes them work better, but they truly do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered the smaller fingernail clippers, and I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>They were made in Germany perhaps 50 or more years</li>
            <li>The Clyppi Clippers are smooth!</li>
            <li>I can say my husband is very happy after trying the second pair of clippers!  </li>
            <li>That was also solved, we got to keep the sent in error second pair of fingernail clippers (that DO work wonderfully!), got a refund on the never sent toenail clippers, AND they are sending out the pair of toenail clippers for free!  </li>
            <li>I love the Clippers.</li>
            <li>I received my Clyppi about a week ago, and I love it.</li>
            <li>and we all love them.</li>
            <li>Plan to buy more for Christmas gifts for all my friends and family.</li>
            <li>Glad I discovered this nail clipper.</li>
            <li>It is so refreshing to purchase a product that exceeds my expectations for quality.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased I am going to purchase two more sets for my daughters.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>We both are pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Thank you. :)</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase a couple more pair.</li>
            <li>My mother who is 99 might even be able to use them..</li>
            <li>Considering how many times you&#x27;ll use this over time, this is cheap!</li>
            <li>The leaf thickness makes the cutters look more like quality chisel points than dinky nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;it was outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I am more than pleased that it is all</li>
            <li>you pay for (mostly).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found you - I just wish it would have been sooner.</li>
            <li>MY HUSBAND&#x27;S FAVORITE.  </li>
            <li>already have one, and I ordered two more</li>
            <li>husband was very impressed with the larger clippers.  </li>
            <li>They assured me that all of the reviews were authentic and furthermore that I must have received a defective clipper.  </li>
            <li>though there could be none better than Amazon</li>
            <li>As you have no doubt heard, many so-called &amp;#34;customer reviews&amp;#34; are, in fact, company employees and/or PR departments submitting reviews.</li>
            <li>He came in the next day and said these are the greatest clippers he has ever used.</li>
            <li>Also it would be better</li>
            <li>I wonder how many years it took for the manufacturer to figure that one out.</li>
            <li>These are ok</li>
            <li>Good leverage, clean edge, easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>Just couldn’t find that magic again.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my way to buy 5 more.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>The recipients were pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>Having had them for over 6 months at this point I am satisfied and would order them again.</li>
            <li>I figured if I&#x27;d invest some money in a pair they would be good ones, and I do think I made the right choice with Clyppi.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited about this CLYPPI clipper, they are amazingly sturdy.</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>They looked like good high quality clippers that could clip my toes and fingernails, a nice hybrid size.</li>
            <li>These nail clippers provide a really nice clean cut every time.  </li>
            <li>Nice clean cuts.</li>
            <li>I was fooled by the clever product description and great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Littl high in price, but the ergonomics are great.</li>
            <li>At last a strong, beautiful, truly functional nail clipper!</li>
            <li>Great clippers, easy for very arthritic hands to use.</li>
            <li>These made a very clean cut which didn&#x27;t require filing.</li>
            <li>It is really&lt;br /&gt;sharp and cuts the fingernails very cleanly.</li>
            <li>sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product, I plan on getting several more for our family too!</li>
            <li>All opinions are true and my own.</li>
            <li>I am 80 years old and have never ever experienced such a marvelous clipper.</li>
            <li>clippers had a great reviews and even though a little pricey so happy I bought them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice product – arrived quickly, high quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see how these fare!</li>
            <li>They are shaped so I was able to lift the nail to clip it and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My nails are quite strong and I’ve not used a clipper that handles the job better than this one.</li>
            <li>I have a KAI clipper which I like a lot too, but haven&#x27;t been able to find easy, so I opted for the Clyppi based on the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>I guess...not super thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed with their feel to start with, solid and smooth.</li>
            <li>Gave a nice, clean, easy cut like I&#x27;ve never seen before.</li>
            <li>CLEAN CUT!  </li>
            <li>They give a nice clean, smooth cut.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use; make a quick crisp cut; and are actually attractive.  </li>
            <li>Please read all the features listed in the description-they are truthful and accurate.  </li>
            <li>You received a corrected and more accurate review</li>
            <li>(Suggestion to whoever designed Clyppi: make the hole in the lever fit more snugly with the pin.)</li>
            <li>It was so flimsy that the lever would pop off if you didn&#x27;t center it perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Clyppi clippers for about a week and so far, I am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>Many products today lack the quality of yesteryear, but Clyppi has done well by offering a product that excels at its job and feels comfortable when in use.  </li>
            <li>They work perfectly, and do not leave rough edges, snags, or chipped areas.  </li>
            <li>So much better quality than the cheap drug store clippers.</li>

            <li>Seems to be a great clipper so far.</li>
            <li>I let go of the baby nail clippers for my two children and just used these because they were more precise and quicker to use.  </li>
            <li>(even if it wasn’t quite as comfortable and effortless) for many years...</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t require much pressure to cut a fingernail and have a textured section to help get a good grip.  </li>
            <li>The fit and finish is superb, and I like the leverage that a long handle provides.</li>
            <li>The feel really good and cut very well.</li>
            <li>I love how easy and comfortable it is to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size, and is sharp so there is no breaking or tearing nails.  </li>

            <li>Four stars for being easy to use after having had thumb/wrist surgery.  </li>
            <li>so maybe it won&#x27;t warp as easily.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are easy to hold and seem sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I have really strong finger nails and the Clyppi</li>
            <li>This sure isn&#x27;t going to work on my toenails, whereas the $3 special from the drugstore can.  </li>

            <li>Nice clean cut, I like these very much.</li>
            <li>well made and does its job perfectly, but could be a little cheaper</li>
            <li>but this is a superb little instrument.  </li>
            <li>these seem to be great little clippers - if they stand the test of time then I&#x27;ll only have wonderful things to say about them</li>

            <li>gives it a secure feel.</li>
            <li>I don’t know if it’s possible to add a nail file to the Clyppi, but I think it would be great if you could.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great Product overall.</li>
            <li>The clippers fit your hand comfortably and the cut is clean and easy to do, even if you do not have a lot of hand strength.</li>
            <li>The way they are designed my thumb rests comfortably in an indent that makes the clippers fit well in my hand.</li>
            <li>One bizarre thing,,,,,they don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34; name on it, so</li>
            <li>I liked them so much</li>
            <li>It cuts cleanly and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This will sound cliche, but it&#x27;s the truth --</li>

            <li>The Clyppi has a nice texture to it and has a weight to it that makes it feel really sturdy.</li>
            <li>you WILL need a nail file or emery board to get a smooth clip job</li>
            <li>Well worth the money over cheap ones you get in drugstores!</li>
            <li>Clippers work smoothly and expertly.  </li>
            <li>I replaced a cheap clipper, because I could not get leverage to operate it.</li>
            <li>What I like about the clipper is how light weight and sturdy it is.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;~There is a built-in emory board that doubles as a fantastic grip while trimming&lt;br</li>
            <li>Liked it so much</li>
            <li>It is precisely what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>I saw her struggling with a cheap pair from Wal-Mart and, after doing some research about your product, I decided to order your clippers.</li>
            <li>These are great, definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>(Doesn&#x27;t cut cuticle skin as well as the cheap ones.)  </li>

            <li>These are different, great cut.</li>
            <li>Cuts cleanly and easily</li>

            <li>Beyond that, the people who make the product seem really invested in it, and I appreciate that kind of care.</li>
            <li>Cuts cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li>if there would be an area I needed to smooth out, I could just use the file that is so conveniently located on the top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with the cheap drugstore nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>After years of using cheap quality nail clippers and toe clippers, I decided to make a change and picked up these Clyppi nail clippers after seeing the reviews.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Not only is the clipper extremely good; the customer service is even better.</li>
            <li>The cleaning tool commonly found on most clippers would be the perfect addition.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my new clyppi.</li>

            <li>worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>The quality of this product is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Original Review (10/6/14):  </li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>Contrary to some of the dissenting reviews, I found that it provides for a very smooth, clean cut, that is far better than the cheaper $.99 grocery store options.  </li>
            <li>The fit easily in my travel case and cut evenly and smoothly the first time, every time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, In short, I&#x27;m pleased with the Clyppi, despite the absence of a feature to clean under my fingernails, they work flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Great look, sharp cut &amp; easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Clean cuts.</li>
            <li>A clipper to handle the hardest nails with a clean cut edge.</li>
            <li>Splits nails doesn&#x27;t clip cleanly.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use the nail file for filing but to clean our nails.</li>
            <li>It clipped cleanly without causing breakage or tearing.</li>
            <li>But this clipper cut cleanly every time.</li>
            <li>The&lt;br /&gt;Clyppi did that for me with a clean cut on the nails.</li>
            <li>I work in the automotive profession and like to keep my nails trimmed very short and these clippers are by far the best I&#x27;ve used .</li>
            <li>Clean cuts and no snags, etc.  </li>
            <li>It cuts so cleanly that the nail doesn&#x27;t go flying across the room when you cut it.  </li>
            <li>Yours cuts so cleanly that my nails feel like I&#x27;ve filed them.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even have to file afterwards because the cut is so clean.</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t clip off cuticles cleanly like it does the nails.</li>
            <li>There is no pointy file piece under the flipup part to clean under nails.  </li>
            <li>It cuts with ease and leaves a clean cut.  </li>
            <li>and they cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>These clippers clip my husband&#x27;s and boys&#x27; fingernails accurately, quickly, and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The stainless steel construction is much sturdier than your run of the mill clippers and it just looks good too.</li>
            <li>They cut my fingernails cleanly and with minimum effort.  </li>
            <li>This can be the only explanation for the near insanely wonderful reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>I had purchased many cheap fingernail clippers over the years and this was absolutely what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The clippers work very well - much better than the cheap ones from the drug store I have been using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the Clyppi fingernail clippers once so far, and they are WONDERFUL!  </li>
            <li>These clipper are nice and sharp and gives a nice clean cut.  </li>
            <li>already own a fantastic pair of clippers that I got maybe 22 years ago from a random beach gift shop, that still work great, but I don&#x27;t know what brand they are, so I can&#x27;t get more of them.  </li>
            <li>Someone did it right!</li>
            <li>They look cool but they are really no that great.  </li>
            <li>Cuts cleanly and quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a truly precise clipper and completely worth the money.</li>
            <li>True to its description.</li>
            <li>After trying out various manufacturers, I got one of these and was delighted.</li>
            <li>its quality is surprisingly way above my expectation on a clip.</li>
            <li>The most gentle nail clipper that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>So many clippers cut like scissors instead of offering one straight cut like the Clyppi.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t justify the premium price when there are many stainless quality options for 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li>Wish I&#x27;d gotten the toenail size, but as good as these seem to be I&#x27;ll likely wind up with those, too.</li>
            <li>The clippers are very well made and I love the attention to detail your company has put into them.</li>
            <li>so much so that I just ordered two more.  </li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of the darned things that I&#x27;ve bought hoping</li>
            <li>I am really surprised how nice the filing pad works though.  </li>
            <li>This will make all of your wildest dreams come true</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one who would&#x27;ve thought there was a difference between nail clippers, but this one really does seem to be better.  </li>
            <li>Glad I ordered and tried one-- works really well.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and good craftsmanship, I love it.</li>
            <li>I have used this clipper several times already and am impressed with how easy it is to use when I clip left or right fingernails.</li>
            <li>and i strongly recommend who are interested for quality goods.</li>
            <li>He also purchased due to the great reviews that he had read about your product.</li>
            <li>Great product, sharp and compact.</li>
            <li>Really serious and dedicated to create the best finger nail clipper, I&#x27;d say they are there already.</li>
            <li>These are seriously the best nail clippers that I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Seriously the best clippers we&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>but this product should be worth the price, it gives you clean cut.</li>
            <li>I ordered and the item came quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li>so quickly nail clipping is over before he can complain.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t only use for nails, but for fly making and fishing, so this set is of real quality.</li>
            <li>5 stars for the exceptional personal touch to the buying experience.</li>
            <li>Truthfully the main reason I was looking to replace the one I had</li>
            <li>finally I have found me a pair of wonderful clippers that when these wear out I will only get this brand.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product; I&#x27;m going back to buy another one now.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to cut to the quick.  </li>
            <li>A quick swipe with a file cures that.  </li>
            <li>Broke but quickly replaced</li>
            <li>I want them short for the wonderful journey left in front of me.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied and highly recommend this clipper.</li>
            <li>Both were very unique designs with striking visual impact.  </li>
            <li>Used a couple times and it is without a doubt a much better quality of product than the normal clippers bought at competitors stores.  </li>
            <li>This is the first pair of clippers I have felt comfortable using without needing to soften my fingernails before using.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re able to be precise in clipping because of the gripping part that keeps your grip from slipping.  </li>
            <li>large surface area to easily grab on to when clipping finger nails or toe nails.</li>
            <li>It is the smoothest, cleanest cut I have experienced with any nail clipper, hands down.  </li>
            <li>He also liked the clean cut edge he was left</li>
            <li>These nail clippers are very sharp and work great.</li>
            <li>Works great and very sharp.</li>
            <li>I just received my order for my new CLYPPI FINGERNAIL TRIMMERS and was EXTREMELY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li>They immediately sent me a new item and followed up to make sure the product arrived.</li>
            <li>I think these are great clippers however less than 6 months after purchasing and having used them</li>
            <li>I ordered the Clyppi for my parents and they really like how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li>This is a very well designed nail clipper and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Feels as if they are ergonomically designed- easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging &amp; fast</li>
            <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d expect for a tool of this quality!</li>
            <li>The Clyppi is the first nail clipper I’ve ever used that doesn’t jump out of my hand whenever it feels like it!</li>
            <li>Just like a hot knife through butter!</li>
            <li>The first one we received must have been a fluke!  </li>
            <li>Only better than a Clyppi is two Clyppis!</li>
            <li>Will definitely make sure I try not to lose this one!</li>
            <li>It delivers the same kind of precise cut without any ragged edges, that of course, is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>I have finally found a clipper that works easily and smoothly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had a chance to use my new Clyppi twice so far, but am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need great nail clippers, I&#x27;m no hand model or anything, and I&#x27;m certainly no expert on beauty products, but for my simple needs these nail clippers are average at best.</li>
            <li>Makes crisp and clean cuts.  </li>
            <li>Great little nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Well worth the higher price!</li>
            <li>Great little fingernail clipper, heavier gauge steel than dollar store/pharmacy/etc.</li>
            <li>It is easier for her to hold, applies a little more pressure and is nice and</li>
            <li>Everything breaks eventually, and I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t be my last either, but I&#x27;ve gone through designs of both high and low quality, often at much higher prices, and Clyppi has exceeded my expectations for ease of use, attractive design, and comfortable feel in the hand.</li>
            <li>Great clippers - heavy and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Well designed with stainless steel, not the cheap junk metal used by drugstore clippers.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and powerful.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>So I bought a second one, after noting that they came with a file, and I keep it handy and use it all the time.</li>
            <li>Worth every dime.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement for my Japanese Parada clipper and liked what I had heard about yours.</li>
            <li>There is no comparison out there and well worth</li>
            <li>I have purchased these again - because they are worth it.</li>
            <li>Oh well it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are nicer and smoother than your run-of-the-mill, but not $14 worth-</li>
            <li>Wow these could not have come at a better time.</li>
            <li>Plus, the co-founder of Clyppi wrote to me personally to ask how I liked this product.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Powerful precision in a nail clipper?</li>
            <li>They are worth the money for me.  </li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s a sign of the times, but it is rare to find a product that works the way it should, and this does.</li>
            <li>i like it, but for $15, it isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>She is still fiercely independent and insists on clipping her own nails.</li>
            <li>She clipped her own nails with total ease while I observed.</li>
            <li>so here was a success.  </li>
            <li>Found my old pair from many years ago and like the old ones much better.</li>
            <li>worth $15 .</li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>To be fair the old pair is old.</li>
            <li>It has a life time warranty which you rarely see these days</li>
            <li>The price is well worth it in my estimation.</li>
            <li>While you probably don&#x27;t think that a device like a nail clipper could make your life better, sometimes you just get pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>None of them cut worth a darn.  </li>
            <li>There are so many poorly made products out there, this is a welcome relief.</li>
            <li>Good weight, not too heavy but not too light either, and</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them once since I just received them, but so far they appear to be a great product.</li>
            <li>So when I lost them, I got these, also on Amazon and so far, they are much better.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, they don&#x27;t clip well, if you look closely the top and bottom over-lap rather than come to a good cutting edge.</li>
            <li>I would like to find a man sized, easy to grip, high quality fingernail clipper with a finger nail cleaner&amp;#34;  Someone listened to me.</li>
            <li>Not your average clipper, the kind you used for years and years,  This one gets the job done easily and correctly.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re extremely sturdy and well-made, they cut&lt;br /&gt;cleanly, and I love the idea of the file being on the top instead of a slide out</li>
            <li>They are more stylish than any other clipper I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>Cuts MUCH more precisely and easily than any clipper I have ever had before due to the good ergonomics and very sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>Sharp clean lines, and the brushed finish is more pleasing to me even on chrome clippers that are in good shape.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really had a chance to use them very much, though I can definitely see they produce a much more precise, clean and effortless cut than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;built in&#x27; nail file built is ever so handy and much superior to the traditional fold out style on average clippers.</li>
            <li>Oh they look quite nice with a very modern aesthetic, but that is the only thing about them that one can compliment.  </li>
            <li>All of my crummy Revlon clippers are going right in the trash, where they belong.</li>
            <li>Just the right size.</li>
            <li>looking for a nail clipper that allowed  me to cut the nails on my right hand since</li>
            <li>Just go right ahead and buy these clippers right now.  </li>
            <li>and they are so right</li>
            <li>I made my purchase of the Clyppi for my aging mother who suffered a stroke 8 years ago and is paralyzed on her right side.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ok, so fingernail clippers are just fingernail clippers, right??  </li>
            <li>The woman who said she no longer had to file her nails was right on point</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m goon to order another one right away to have when I misplace this one.</li>
            <li>They were right.</li>
            <li>You can feel the quality right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>My Clyppi fingernail clippers arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>I like them for their clean cut, but not so much for the close cut.</li>
            <li>Comfortable design for a steady grip.</li>
            <li>Feels better in the hand and more efficient than the average clipper.</li>
            <li>This is a great little item!</li>
            <li>These work a little better than the generic kind you find in drug stores, but not that much better.  </li>
            <li>Nice clean sharp cut.</li>
            <li>These fingernail clippers are made of high quality steel that is also ergonomically designed to fit the shape of your hand.  </li>
            <li>end of the handles flare OUT slightly at the end for more gripping surface area</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not that it really matters, but they do have a cool, machined look to them.</li>
            <li>I ended up putting on a small split-ring, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I have not tried all the other brands to say if any other are as good, but I can tell you that we are VERY pleased with these.  </li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting something a little better, when compared to the dollar store clippers it seems it should be more curved.</li>
            <li>I did try out my Clyppi nail clipper and am pleased that it cuts sharply and easily.  </li>
            <li>I can grip the clippers easily - the width of the handles is much better than other clippers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Adjectives to describe them are: sharp, stylish, sturdy, strong ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I understand what&#x27;s so great about these nail clippers that they came up first in my search results for customer reviews.</li>
            <li>The Clyppi is easy to use and cuts completely through every time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the Clyppi so much I bought a 2nd one just in case</li>
            <li>These are the only ones I&#x27;ve ever found that cut clean and easy.</li>
            <li>I spent many years going through cheap clippers that chip or tear my nails.  </li>
            <li>Sent the above feedback and got a great response back!</li>
            <li>Nice modern design but simple.</li>
            <li>This is the first clipper they&#x27;ve ever tried that had such a good spring action.  </li>
            <li>The cutters mate perfectly when closed and they are the first pair ever to not get jammed by a dime when pocket carried with lose</li>
            <li>Very high quality clippers!</li>
            <li>it very much a quality tool.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The Clyppis are rock solid, made out of nicely finished stainless steel, easy to handle, and have a broad end that allows you to get plenty of leverage.</li>
            <li>The stainless steel construction seems a lot sturdier and won&#x27;t start peeling off like the plating on other clippers, and it just looks good.  </li>
            <li>New nail clipper model incorporates user feedback from original version -</li>
            <li>I was really impressed that it was so clean cutting</li>
            <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t say they entirely suitable for large handed individuals such as myself.  </li>
            <li>Even though a little pricey, it&#x27;s better than having to purchase several in order to get a good cut.  </li>
            <li>Clyppi Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper really is the ultra cool precision tool.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Finally, I decided to respond because I love</li>
            <li>Does exactly what is designed to do.  </li>
            <li>Today was the first time I had used them as I gave them for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered two more for my wife and daughter plus will probably buy one of the toenail clippers as well - even considering buying a 3rd fingernail clipper to keep at work.    </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Your Clyppi nail clipper is vastly superior to the standard design: more comfortable feel, easier to use, sharper and more exact cutting.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought didn’t have the nail file on it</li>
            <li>Really like it!</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>These clippers are better than any found in our local stores.</li>
            <li>My nails actually seem to feel cleaner because of the better quality cut.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the brushed nickel look</li>
            <li>Quite better than the 2nd rate stuff from our eastern hemisphere friends.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It is head and shoulders above both the dollar store cheapies, as well as most anything you could get in a grocery store or drug store.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>So this is my first Amazon review.</li>
            <li>Looked like it would work well and seemed to work well at first.</li>
            <li>The brushed finish is quite refreshing</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I finally used the Clyppi and I love how it feels in my hand and how it clips my nails.</li>
            <li>However, the cut isn&#x27;t any more precision than the local drugstore&#x27;s name brand clippers.</li>
            <li>For the increased cost, I think I would prefer something manufactured in the USA or that had a more functional design than the clippers theyusually sell at the local grocery store.</li>
            <li>Worlds better than my former clippers.</li>
            <li>which I really like !</li>
            <li>I was pretty amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re definitely better off buying this than the $2 one at the local convenience store.</li>
            <li>We are &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; citizens with&lt;br /&gt;some physical limitations and are definitely pleased to have found these clippers.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start this off by saying these are not my first nail clippers.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>first time i managed to cut my finger nails without looking like</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t find any that were higher quality, despite some that had a higher price.</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>This is the first high-end nail clipper I&#x27;ve used, so I can&#x27;t compare to the extremely expensive stuff from Solingen and the like, but I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I am going to order 5 more to give as gifts next Christmas.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I expected it to be much sharper and perform much better than the drugstore brands available to me.</li>
            <li>But overall I am pleased.</li>
            <li>The first Clyppi that arrived had a flaw.</li>
            <li>I am convinced I will never find the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; pair of clippers but these are pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>so much eaiser clipping my nails!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes the job much faster!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s higher price, but in the end decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li>This one is noticeably higher quality with thicker steel throughout.</li>
            <li>Most of all, Clyppi is built to last.</li>
            <li>and now he wants me to get him one!  </li>
            <li>This thing is really well made!  </li>
            <li>I took a chance with Clyppi, and I should have just bought this one first.</li>
            <li>I just used mine for the first time tonight -</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have owned a Clyppi.  </li>
            <li>I gave these their first clip and</li>
            <li>An absolute must buy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You won&#x27;t go wrong with either, but if are looking for the best, go for the Seki.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I can actually cut my fingernails with the Clyppi which I havent been able to for a while.</li>
            <li>so I decided to pay more and see if I get a different result.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier with these babies!</li>
            <li>This is the first pair of higher priced clippers for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many clippers over the years that don&#x27;t last even 3 months</li>
            <li>Having said all that, it does not slide along one&#x27;s nails as easily as the polished ones do, but I think with a little more use, I&#x27;ll get accustomed to that.  </li>
            <li>this is a good tool,  quality made and very sharp!</li>
            <li>Super high quality material.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding, very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and more comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t need a new pair of toenail clippers, I liked the fingernail version enough that I went ahead and completed the set.  </li>
            <li>; I did not realize that this kind of tool could be vastly improved, but it can, and these clippers are vastly better than any other clipper I ever labored to use.</li>
            <li>Very little pressure is required to obtain a nice clean trim.</li>
            <li>I have arthritis and was having trouble with regular clippers, but these are easy to use and cut nice and clean.</li>
            <li>The weight feels right, and the hidden nail file is actually a nice addition too.</li>
            <li>Easy and very comfortable to use, sharp enough to cut your finger nails clean.</li>
            <li>I had to look awhile, but the other nice thing about this one is that it has a nail file, too.</li>
            <li>They are nice and sharp and hope they stay that way.</li>
            <li>It is so nice and sharp</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp, and feels like a well designed tool.</li>
            <li>Nice clippers, I have been searching for something that stays sharp, and well aligned.</li>
            <li>Again the blades are nice and sharp and cut evenly.  </li>
            <li>It is really sharp and precise; also, easy to hold onto - it’s not slippery.</li>
            <li>I already ordered two more pairs - one for my brother and another for some other lucky soul.</li>
            <li>I’ll just have to have my old pair of clippers handy for that part of the job in the future.</li>
            <li>I particularly like its sleek and classy design which makes it easy to manipulate and pleasing to the eye.</li>
            <li>(Say that last sentence really fast, 10 times.)  :-)  </li>
            <li>Since my own biological clock is ticking, I’m anticipating needing a pair of these for myself in the near future, as arthritis in my hands is already beginning to plague me.</li>
            <li>I feel that a lot of companies these days go out of their way to reinvent a common household product, slap a brand name on it, and make sure it is better than their competition.  </li>
            <li>As a guitarist I need to keep my nails trimmed very short, and the Clyppi does an excellent job; it is sharp, it requires very little effort, and produces a very precise cut.  </li>
            <li>I love and I mean love those Clyppi nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>My husband goes through nail clippers like you would not believe and also gets frustrated when they don&#x27;t fit in his large hands, but he thought these were great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my new Clyppi once and it is sharp and more ergonomic.comfortable than the cheap drug store/vending machine/discount store ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sharp, precise, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll pretty much be swapping out every bathroom, car, or keychain set of clippers with this brand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to squeeze so hard for a nice, clean cut.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s well designed and constructed, but, it pretty much just cuts nails.  </li>
            <li>I would say the Clyppi clippers pretty much do that and do it well.  </li>
            <li>After my last cheap, local pharmacy-bought clippers broke, I decided to see if there was a better product out there.</li>
            <li>I think the file on the top of the handle is really too short to be of much use.</li>
            <li>Having a small file built into the lever I find superior to having to have a separate file attached to the clippers.  </li>
            <li>too small and can&#x27;t believe all the good reviews-</li>
            <li>The nail file area does a good job of filing, but too small to be practical.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This clipper feels very smooth and cuts precisely with a minimum of applied force - no more slips.</li>
            <li>These are well designed being easy to hold are very sharp making a crisp, clean cut on the fingernail.  </li>
            <li>All the high quality clippers I&#x27;ve seen do not seem to have a fold out finger nail cleaner that most low end clippers have.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and sharp.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and effective.</li>
            <li>the clipper is very well made, very sharp, and easy for precise cut.</li>
            <li>but I easily put it back together.  </li>
            <li>Clearly the product has tremendous attributes and is a quality product.</li>
            <li>I bought this clipper for my husband as he is very particular about the way his nails are cut.</li>
            <li>He could trim all his fingers easily and the way the clippers don&#x27;t have to be squeezed low, he never felt he was going to drop them and had no discomfort using them.</li>
            <li>It clips very well and feels good in my hand while still being small and compact.  </li>
            <li>Pure speculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I certainly would not hesitate to recommend Clyppi on both counts without any reservation.</li>
            <li>clean and sharp and comfortable to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super Sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Many clippers I have used are dull at the start and also don&#x27;t clip as easily.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on these, they are not worth two bucks, as a matter of fact the cheap ones from the drugstore work better than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very well designed, very sharp clippers, nice upgrade from department store clippers.  </li>
            <li>It also has a scraper on the top half to remove unwanted edges in freshly cut nails.  </li>
            <li>And if I do have to file, there is a really cute little file built into the clyppi which is very effective despite its small size.</li>
            <li>Filer is very fine and sharp.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and easy to grip!</li>
            <li>Terrific product and works fine.  </li>
            <li>Awesome clippers, they are sharp and have a nice sharp angle on the lever arm making nail cutting more convenient.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Very high quality construction</li>
            <li>#34;I consider your clipper to be very high quality.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product and vendor very highly.</li>
            <li>Nice little clipper, clips well when used by either hand.</li>
            <li>it had the kind of swing-out nail file with the little hook at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many nail clippers I have bought in the past and discarded, because they didn&#x27;t cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>Fortunately there is an abrasive surface on the top that you can use to smooth out or buff down any sharp or ragged edges.  </li>
            <li>My primary problem with most nail clippers is that the back ends are most often somewhat pointed and the natural pushing of the clipper onto the nail generally inflicts pain on the other hand...</li>
            <li>I had such an amazing experience that I decided to finally write a review aver being a shopper since the dawn of the internet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Made of stainless steel, the trimmers are manufactured with quality metal.</li>
            <li>so I thanks you for that.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand all the superlative reviews --</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>There is so much &#x27;beefiness&#x27; to the front of the clipper that I can&#x27;t get a close trim.  </li>
            <li>If you are in any way thinking &amp;#34;this is too much for a nail clipper!&amp;#34;-</li>
            <li>so I didn’t really use it much as I always use a file when clipping my nails.</li>
            <li>So much for quality.</li>
            <li>Very tiny..Difficult to use..</li>
            <li>This clipper is so much easier to use that others that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>These are the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>I recommend whole heartedly..</li>
            <li>I really like the Clyppi.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>Really well made and engineered.  </li>
            <li>and I really like its craftsmanship and quality.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>That said they are very well made.  </li>
            <li>I can really get my fingers &amp; thumb into each cut as a result of the added leverage and strength.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really need to file afterwards.</li>
            <li>so it really helps that these clippers are much easier to handle.</li>
            <li>It did not take much force to break the thing.</li>
            <li>When I received it I gave it a try and really like it.  </li>
            <li>you really do not see that feature on many clippers.</li>
            <li>The nail clipper is sleek and very well made.</li>
            <li>Maybe, I don&#x27;t really know.</li>
            <li>The emery board in the lever is attached with some sort of glue and it doesn&#x27;t hold very well</li>
            <li>yet.&lt;br /&gt;The company was very gracious and helpful.</li>
            <li>However, I couldn&#x27;t find any for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The clippers do what they are supposed to do very well--they don&#x27;t chew up your fingernails like some others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much easier to grip than cheaper clippers.  </li>
            <li>You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>The reviews for the Clyppi were encouraging and the price was reasonable if it lived up to the expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to neatly trim both the nails and the cuticles with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>A lifetime investment that is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>And these clippers are the real deal.</li>
            <li>Now my wife wants one.</li>
            <li>Precise clipping as described - FINALLY!</li>
            <li>This product is very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making a quality product.</li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t sip out of place and they cut very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making an exemplary product.</li>
            <li>The cutting ability is perfect also.  </li>
            <li>I really like Clyppi Clippers.  </li>
            <li>Very well built.</li>
            <li>Would HIGHLY recommend these clippers!</li>
            <li>and I like how much neater my fingernails look.</li>
            <li>No big deal for cheap clippers but I</li>
            <li>It is also way much overpriced .</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to make it a lot easier to use.  </li>
            <li>This nail clipper is very well built.  </li>
            <li>Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper]]</li>
            <li>These cut much nicer, and no need to file!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>He really likes these clippers but has one suggestion.</li>
            <li>Thanks -</li>
            <li>helps when gripping the clippers and helps to prevent them from slipping..  </li>
            <li>Thanks Clyppi for teaching me</li>
            <li>but I prefer the curved clipper to the straight clipper.</li>
            <li>They are very well made.</li>
            <li>Suffice it to say I will order the toenail clippers as soon as my cart has enough in it to get free shipping.</li>
            <li>But any price for these Clyppis is too much, and I&#x27;m returning them.  </li>
            <li>It cuts very well.</li>
            <li>And a nail file integrated with the lever handle, and it&#x27;s much &amp;#34;grittier&amp;#34; than others.</li>
            <li>This is a keeper and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these clippers!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference a real metal clipper made.  </li>
            <li>These clippers really do appear to have had some thought and engineering placed into their development and construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>Very well.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely.  </li>
            <li>Quality of materials, build, finish and sharpness of cutting edges are all excellent.</li>
            <li>B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clippers]].  </li>
            <li>I have RA in my hands so they dont work very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the Clyppi, and I&#x27;m planning on buying a couple of others as a backup for me and one for my husband.</li>
            <li>These nail clippers cut my nails in one cut, straight across.  </li>
            <li>The file is really a joke</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>I play guitar, so I have to cut my fingernails a lot as well as very close.  </li>
            <li>After a pair I dearly loved and had for&lt;br /&gt;years finally broke, I had been unable to find any clippers that I liked, even&lt;br /&gt;big</li>
            <li>They are not cheap, but so far they have been as good as billed.</li>
            <li>The Clyppi is a lot better than the old set of clippers I had, which literally fell apart in my hand last time I used them.</li>
            <li>I  really wasn&#x27;t impressed with its cutting ability.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2 of these only to find that both done an excellent job of crushing the nails rather than cutting them.</li>
            <li>These are nice quality, but the opening is two narrow for my nails.</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>Only con is that the blades aren&#x27;t as sharp as the &amp;#34;Seki.&amp;#34;  But still gives a clean cut first time, most of the time.</li>
            <li>Absolute, complete GARBAGE!!!  </li>
            <li>This a fantastic little device that is well worth what I paid for it!</li>
            <li>used the new Clyppi for the first time this morning and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why we’ve fallen in love with this nail clipper so quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just used my new Clyppi for the first time.</li>
            <li>We live in a hot and humid climate and have to buy these often.  </li>
            <li>Though price is little higher compared to others available in market but worth to get one for those who are not compromosing on quality.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Lightweight and more compact than other clippers.  </li>
            <li>; They work well, but they don&#x27;t even have the tool that most other do to dig dirt out from under the nail.</li>
            <li>Looks like the clipper will work well - certainly better than any other clipper we&#x27;ve had/</li>
            <li>This is in no way a better fingernail clipper than any other you find in the supermarket for 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li>MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER CLIPPERS</li>
            <li>It has an abrasive finish on both sides and seems to be more abrasive on one side than on the other.</li>
            <li>The only improvement that we would like is an attachment that would serve to clean our finger nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using cheap plastic ones for a long time, and I can tell these clippers are much nicer.  </li>
            <li>, the cut is really so clean clippers are not really necessary.</li>
            <li>These clippers are beautifully made and managed to trim my teenage sons thick nails with ease.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need heavy pressure and they are very easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>However, after the third or fourth use, the top piece of the clipper broke right off near the pin that connects the clipper.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long they will last, but so far I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Had gone through many pairs of the kind you buy in drugstores, all I have tried including the big brands are of poor quality.  </li>
            <li>Not your average fingernail clipper, for sure.</li>
            <li>As I approach my 90th birthday I find that some appendages do not perform in the spontaneous way of the past.</li>
            <li>Very different from regular clippers; more sturdy, better design, and sharp blade.</li>
            <li>Cuts nail easily, but leaves edges jagged and rough.</li>
            <li>(like super short - I guess you could say &amp;#34;guitar player short&amp;#34;, but I don&#x27;t play the guitar).  </li>
            <li>My favorite clippers prior to these (made in Korea and given to me by my father back in the &#x27;80&#x27;s) have gone on &amp;#34;walk-a-bout&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>a buyer the product came quick and as described, overall this family couldn’t be happier with Clyppi!</li>
            <li>I decided it was time for a decent clipper so am trying the Clyppi.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more in the future as they are now my favorites.</li>
            <li>The Clyppi uses surface features on both the lever and main body, as you can see in the photos, to aid in keeping it well gripped while trimming.  </li>
            <li>I have bought several pairs for myself (office, briefcase, car, bathroom, etc.........and plan to purchase several more as stocking stuffers.  </li>
            <li>Great for arthritic hands - even on gross thick toenails.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I didn&#x27;t read the description adequately, but they were much smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>Much better then a more expensive one I purchased from amazon that was made in Japan.</li>
            <li>Most of all, Clyppi is built to last, not be replaced constantly when it falls apart, peels, or just doesn&#x27;t get the job done anymore.</li>
            <li>The angle of the lever is a little higher, which also makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is a little larger then the cheap type, making it easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine, sharp instrument but the opening leaves too little room to get the whole top of the fingernail in.</li>
            <li>I think these clippers are high quality</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Yes, I would highly recommend this Nail Clipper.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Clyppi  nail clipper and would purchase it again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had high quality nail clippers before, but lost them.  </li>
            <li>and you can tell that the craftsmanship is of HIGH QUALITY.</li>
            <li>This clipper met my high expectations.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a clipper.</li>
            <li>I also highly praise the customer service I received from Clyppi.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to friends and family.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these clippers to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend them</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I really am enjoying your new Clyppi and am actually considering getting several to use as gifts.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this  for my teenage son who strong, fast growing nails that constantly needs clipped for sports.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and give a very clean cut.  </li>
            <li>They are by far the nicest set of clippers I’ve ever used!!</li>
            <li>Good feel in the hands when going for those tough to get out nails.</li>
            <li>They are sharp, cut well and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is also sharp, which can clip my nails and hang nail easily.</li>
            <li>Comparing them to my other nail clippers, the metal seems nicer and probably won&#x27;t rust as easy.</li>
            <li>Time will tell how these will hold up to normal use but from my impression, it&#x27;s a confident little piece of gear.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves them and says he has finally found a clipper that is sharp, sturdy and easy to handle!</li>
            <li>Strong, sharp and sturdy.</li>
            <li>They are a high quality tool, sturdily built, and I expect these to last a long time, provided I don&#x27;t lose them :).</li>
            <li>It apparently has better leverage with the sharper blades for clean, easy cutting.  </li>
            <li>Not so great, too expensive.</li>
            <li>Wow this is just a really well made product.</li>
            <li>and they really did not do the professional cut</li>
            <li>This clipper has a wide lever that is comfortable to my fingers.</li>
            <li>So far they work very well.</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t make clean snips on dry nails.  </li>
            <li>It cut my nails much easier than my old clippers.  </li>
            <li>Yes I am a women and no their not thick from abuse.  </li>
            <li>There was not a negative review to be found.</li>
            <li>well worth the extra coin.</li>
            <li>These are okay nail clippers, but it&#x27;s sorely missing the tool for cleaning under the nail.</li>
            <li>I find that the handle angle is too steep (65 degrees vs a normal 40 degrees)</li>
            <li>The clippers grip is wider than a normal pair and maybe a tad longer.</li>
            <li>It is very well made, sharp and ergonomically friendly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the extra.</li>
            <li>these kind of dishonest hurts Amazon&#x27;s reputation.  </li>
            <li>Too small to cut my nails conveniently, which to be fair, size is probably listed, but still, the pictures looked like it was the larger clipper size.</li>
            <li>, I am able to slide it down a millimeter or two with my thumb, but I am unwilling to see if it comes off completely at this time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are sharp and work well, but I really miss having a fingernail file that you can clean your fingernails out with.</li>
            <li>Cuts my nails very cleanly and with little effort.</li>
            <li>These make a quick, easy, sharp cut on dry nails.  </li>
            <li>2-sided nail file that is large enough to be practical (and also very effective) as well as a pointed fingernail cleaner (which I personally find much less useful, but other might like).  </li>
            <li>I can even clip my nails with my left hand (I&#x27;m right handed).</li>
            <li>I have reduced strength in my right hand and could not us a regular pair of fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li>They are slightly more expensive than the cheap grocery store ones, but definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>It’s so sharp (therefore, accurate) that I don’t even need to use a nail file.</li>
            <li>I have used other nail clippers and they are cheaply made .</li>
            <li>This one is sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li>I find it sharp, smooth and painless.</li>
            <li>Sharp, and does the job smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a nail clipper that is sharp, precise and durable.</li>
            <li>It’s sharp, comfortable, and effortless.  </li>
            <li>Really well built, and they both fit in your hands exactly right and are sharp enough that they effortlessly clip like no other.</li>
            <li>I recommend these clippers, and when I need new ones I will order Clyppi Fingernail Clippers again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my new Clyppi for about a week.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Similar in price, new kid on the block</li>
            <li>Just received my New &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for months, now, and it still feels brand new.</li>
            <li>opened up my new clyppi this evening.  </li>
            <li>The new one now has a swing out</li>
            <li>I have received my new clyppi fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li>It is very sharp and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and very sharp.</li>
            <li>I needed very sharp and easy to use clipper.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, hold and less pressure to squeeze</li>
            <li>The design, material, and feel of the clippers are nice but the cut actually left my nails in need of a nail file (not a smooth finish cut).</li>
            <li>Like the packaging and product description too it really adds to the overall experience , I plan on buying another set or two , thanks</li>
            <li>The actual cut, it&#x27;s nice and firm...  </li>
            <li>The filing area is much sharper than you normally see on a clipper, but it is so short and so far in from the edge that it isn&#x27;t very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m counting on the stainless steel to help these maintain a clean cut and last a long time.</li>
            <li>is $26 - compared that to the $3 or 4 for the usual nail clippers I&#x27;ve bought most of my life.</li>
            <li>NO DEAD SPOTS!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I carry mine in my pocket and use it pretty regularly.  </li>
            <li>When he tried them for the first time his only words were, &amp;#34;Wow.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old and have never before used a nail clipper that was this light and as sharp .</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It has actually been the first even cut my nails</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find a decent nail clipper and have tried several previously.  </li>
            <li>One of the first times using these on regular fingernails</li>
            <li>The only thing that worried me at first was whether I&#x27;d be able to put a small chain or ring in the slotted end of the handle.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>These clippers are so sharp and offer significant leverage that I don&#x27;t need to do that.  </li>
            <li>While using it just for the second time after I first bought the handle just snapped.  </li>
            <li>The first set I got had a slight manufacturing issue and the blades where not aligned quite right.  </li>
            <li>AS other reviewers have mentioned, Clyppi cuts clean without needing an emery board touch up.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and clean cuts, almost effortless.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly sharp for a clean cut.</li>
            <li>Cuts sharply and cleanly.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended - I would rate this a very his 9.25 to 9.75 out of ten</li>
            <li>Very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>The Clyppi is very sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li>Oddly, for me, they seem light.  </li>
            <li>I am disabled and have loss of coordination, this nail clipper is easy to grip and allows me to get the job done.</li>
            <li>The brushed metal looks nice, the problem is that the friction between the metal show wears quickly and initially makes it more difficult to open and twist lever back.</li>
            <li>(Though I likely will never have to purchase another pair if the initial quality impressions hold true)</li>
            <li>believe this is the first time after several years and thousands of purchases that I  feel completely ripped-off by a product sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li>They make a sharp, clean cut on my fingernails and, as just stated, no dead spots.  </li>
            <li>He liked the fact that they actually cut as most of the ones that he has tired only half cut as there was not enough spring in the clip to make a clean cut.  </li>
            <li>Funny how little things like this make live so much easier!</li>
            <li>Arrived today and snapped in half during the first use!!  </li>
            <li>When I first got it I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be powerful enough (since it looks pretty small in size)</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t have any idea how bad the cheap junk sold in most stores was!</li>
            <li>A word of caution, these things are really sharp, and will cut pretty much anything you manage to get into the opening.</li>
            <li>I suggested a slightly bigger &#x27;clip&#x27; for people like me with large fingers and nails and learned a toenail clipper is on the way.</li>
            <li>, on the smaller clipper your name in visible but there is no marking on the large clipper.  </li>
            <li>I love them, they&#x27;re exactly what I was missing in every other clipper I had tried.</li>
            <li>They are super sharp and cut my nails effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality, and should last forever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various clippers to cut my tough fingernails but this product finally worked to my great satisfaction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent as much as $45 trying to find a good nail clipper (I have tough nails).  </li>
            <li>They are very sharp and leave a clean edge.</li>
            <li>Not cheap, but they are accurate.  </li>
            <li>Clearly they are not.</li>
            <li>matt stainless steel finish is classy and it didn’t slip out of my hands the way my last nail clipper did – drove me</li>
            <li>I have been using some old clippers, Wilkinson Sword brand, that I purchased in England; let us say they have lost their edge.</li>
            <li>I had ordered the Clyppi to use on my 89 year old dads toes.  </li>
            <li>look to be solid stainless steel</li>
            <li>They like it so much they are ordering the larger size as well.</li>
            <li>Much smoother and sharper than regular clippers.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what was so aggravating about using my old clippers.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps a hole near the bottom to carry on a keychain.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if I would go as far as &amp;#34;the best.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Of course, have the money afford a once a week professional manicure with cuticle nippers and of course a pedicure?  </li>
            <li>nowhere near precision cut versus the Clyppis.&lt;br /&gt;Sekis</li>
            <li>As a former cosmetologist I highly recommend  the CLYPPI!</li>
            <li>completely recommend this brand of fingernail clippers and would not hesitate purchasing again</li>
            <li>they clip well and shape my nails really well, definitely get them!!</li>
            <li>The Clyppi fingernail clipper is by far the sharpest fingernail clipper we have ever used.</li>
            <li>Received the items (2 purchased) early and used one immediately.</li>
            <li>One wouldn&#x27;t think there could be so much difference in a simple clipper</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t possibly be this much stronger.  </li>
            <li>Promptly after writing a dissatisfied review, the co-founder of the company contacted me directly to rectify the situation.  </li>
            <li>Workmanship above par, very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t break, but this far exceeded any expectation I might have had.</li>
            <li>I may be buying at least one more.</li>
            <li>They now look as if I have had a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>They do not cut as well as the old Trim nail clippers you can pickup for around $1.00 at any drugstore.</li>
            <li>Because of that I my toes looked beach ready for a recent vacation.  </li>
            <li>You see I grow natural nails.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li>the only &#x27;complaint&#x27; i have is that someone from Clyppi emailed me like 3 times to find out how I liked them...............</li>
            <li>At least the Clyppi has a nice rounded back end...</li>
            <li>I have thick nails and most clippers hack them to ragged pieces.  </li>
            <li>They are thin and good enough to get me a magazine layout if I wanted--</li>
            <li>some very less expensive cutters have sleeves that go over top and botttom phalanges , this is a nice touch that I would recommend for the manufacturer</li>
            <li>Ergonomically correct (nice wide end on thumb side), sharp, and proper curvature on the blade.  </li>
            <li>The jaw design of these antiques is unique in that the cutting edge is driven more like pliers than by the cam action of yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are solid, sharp, and fit in your hand.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference from other nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Clippers are easy to use and don&#x27;t slip off your fingers like small ones</li>
            <li>worthy of all the hype, and certainly not worth the price</li>
            <li>Good quality but a little too small for a me.</li>
            <li>I read the many reviews on this and decided to invest in a high quality nail clipper but instead got a nail clipper that is even worse than the 99 cents one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid product, much better than the standard crappy ones I had previously.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Clyppi, for taking your customer service seriously. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>HOWEVER when I attempted to fold it into the original flat configuration, the handle jammed to the side on the pivot</li>
            <li>Most of the clippers I have used in the past were too short</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit skeptical that it would be any better than the brand I was using, however it did what it promised.</li>
            <li>main comment for the future is that it should come with a removable cover to catch the clippings.</li>
            <li>I have big hands, and big feet, therefore big nails, and they grow quickly.</li>
            <li>the handle broke off completely - using only normal pressure.  </li>
            <li>My judgement of this product is versus my gold standard - Revlon classic nail clipper and metal nail filer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does look and feel like a really cool little gadget</li>
            <li>The price is high for nail clippers but they will be the last you ever buy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended over the regular store bought clippers.</li>
            <li>Clyppi has a high enough handle, allowing it to provide plenty of leverage, so it does not &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; in use.</li>
            <li>These clippers are noteworthy in only one way -- their unjustifiable high price.</li>
            <li>Some of the new clippers I&#x27;ve seen recently are designed to apply the clipping force in the direction of that natural push of the clipper on the nail...</li>
            <li>I am never using a different pair of clippers again, and like a previous poster had hoped for, I also hope that a companion upsized toe nail clipper version is made available.</li>
            <li>I always put nail clippers into key chain and hook into a string, so it will not be misplaced at home, to be easily found.</li>
            <li>but it seems the options at a market or a general store were pretty limited.</li>
            <li>Personally I would have preferred a more traditional design wherein the fingernail cleaner is simply a sharp triangle at the end of the file rather than the current implementation of an angled edge -</li>
            <li>It clips cleanly, no ragged edges and quickly.</li>
            <li>I cannot stand to have long fingernails, so I cut them pretty much every other day.</li>
            <li>A new paradigm in personal care.  </li>
            <li>two days later I had a brand new pair sent to</li>
            <li>my husband puts these through hell with his claw feet and they still look new... will repurchase when my husband finally destroys these one of these days...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps mine is defective, I will send it back and maybe try a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping they stay sharp for a long time to come; if so they are worth the price!</li>
            <li>really appreciate Amazon sells such varieties of obscure products.&lt;br /&gt;Unable to actually use their products, sight</li>
            <li>I am very fussy about keeping my nails short For 40+ years I&#x27;ve owned some German clippers made by INOX.</li>
            <li>Although pretty much like every other standard nail clipper, it&#x27;s sharp and seems to be made of stainless steel (non-austenitic since it&#x27;s magnetic)...</li>
            <li>he says they are much easier to operate than some of the more expensive ones I have given him.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally strong nails that I keep a little long.  </li>
            <li>No other nail clipper comes close to this nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>No other &amp;#34;complaints&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They were sharp for the first 5-6 times I used them then they dulled out a bit.</li>
            <li>At first, I was a bit hesitant to buy it due to</li>
            <li>If they could only make a version that doesn&#x27;t make a loud clicking noise with each cut I make on my nails, I&#x27;m in cubicle land at work!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very sharp and cuts right through my fingernails with no effort.  </li>
            <li>They cut clean without any jagged edges and with very little effort.</li>
            <li>I also like the size, not too big or small, which is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, and very easy to operate because of the wide lever - so much better than those old-style clippers with the silly pointed lever.</li>
            <li>Cuts clean with little to no emery filing necessary.  </li>
            <li>I like that this product cut evenly, cleanly and with a small amount of applied pressure.  </li>
            <li>They are extremely sharp and the tiny nail file, which I dismissed as a joke, is quite useful.</li>
            <li>I bought them for my husband who has incredibly thick fingernails, figuring if these are meant for toenails they should work fine.</li>
            <li>These clippers are far better than any other clippers I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, especially for people that have difficulty using the smaller clippers.</li>
            <li>The real test, however, will be how long they last.</li>
            <li>The CLYPPI nail clippers actually do meet the expectations they built up in their product description by far.</li>
            <li>I was replacing an old clipper I have been carrying around in my travel bag for years that just about tore off my thumbnail the last time I used it.</li>
            <li>This is just a regular nail clipper; like to any old clipper one might get in supermarkets and drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing fancy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>About ten years ago, I bought my adult children each a set of the INOX clippers.</li>
            <li>was it never opened far enough.</li>
            <li>and I really like the thumb piece being wide rather than tapered.  </li>
            <li>It by far beats any of the clippers I have tried from the local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>The design of these clippers is the same old design used since the 1950&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>At first look and feel you can tell these are not your &#x27;average&#x27; nail clippers.</li>
            <li>This is far easier to use than standard devices.</li>
            <li>That is apparent just looking at them.  </li>
            <li>The wide lever and body also make it much easier to grasp,</li>
            <li>Only 1 month old.  </li>
            <li>No rough scratchy patches and</li>
            <li>As usual Amazon issued a full refund.</li>
            <li>Quite expensive for its kind.</li>
            <li>These are well made clippers with a good cutting edge.</li>
            <li>I like this, as it probably means keeping a good cutting edge longer.  </li>
            <li>So nice for my poor, arthritic hands!  </li>
            <li>Did its job cutting my nails properly which makes a pleasant change</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact I cut the nails on my left hand with my new Clyppi&#x27;s and the nails on my right hand with some ordinary ones I picked up from Riteaid.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and create a very clean cut with little pressure applied.  </li>
            <li>They are extremely durable providing a clean, sharp cut each and every time of use.</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t dulled and are small enough for my nails and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>Now to not loose the nail clipper like my others.</li>
            <li>it is sturdy, sharp and stainless.  </li>
            <li>They are very well designed and sharp.  </li>
            <li>It is very well designed and executed from an ergonomic point of view and is extremely sharp as well.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t like any other clipper I&#x27;ve used and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>These are very nice/ sharp clippers.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t require as much of a  squeeze of the lever as the other clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hopeful that they will continue to perform at a high level and last an exceptionally long time...</li>
            <li>Between the brushed stainless steel, file and wide design</li>
            <li>I find these (Clyppi) to give a much smoother cut then the Seki which left my nails with a rough edge.</li>
            <li>A must buy if you are tired of cheapie drugstore clippers functioning poorly and even breaking more easily than in our parent&#x27;s times.</li>
            <li>No sharp edges that need extra clipping or filing.</li>
            <li>Extremely sharp, smooth cutting, and easy to use with no discomfort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE - I have now been using these clippers for several weeks and, although I am still happy with their precision cutting ability, I am a bit dissatisfied with the emery \\&quot;board\\&quot; because it does not extend to the edge of the lever arm but rather sits as a \\&quot;pad\\&quot; in the arm&#x27;s center.</li>
            <li>to your average drug store branded clippers, I find I absolutely *</li>
            <li>It left my fingernails ragged and sharp, and I couldn&#x27;t get a straight cut to save my life.  </li>
            <li>and yet I could not cut a thumbnail using all my strength, and only barely cut fingernails.  </li>
            <li>I like the clippers just not sure they are worth $15.</li>
            <li>the small patch of file is hardly worth having.</li>
            <li>The clippers were sharp, fit easily into the hand, and required only the slightest pressure for cutting.  </li>
            <li>, I had a tendency to clip a little too short at first.</li>
            <li>The Clyppi is easy to hold while cutting and cuts sharp and clean.</li>
            <li>I like how the material is very sturdy and very sharp.  </li>
            <li>So clean, in fact, that the nail edge is a little sharp.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for anyone who has arthritis, neuropathy or any other issue that impedes hand function.</li>
            <li>They have a high quality feel to them and seem to be extremely well made.  </li>
            <li>He found it much easier to use, his fingers don’t slip and it takes less finger strength to make the cut.  </li>
            <li>So the most logical explanation is this nail clipper just wasn&#x27;t of high quality and is just like any other nail clipper, in this case even worse than the 99 cents, which as least lasted longer than this.  </li>
            <li>and i now have both the small and large ones of these!</li>
            <li>so more sturdy, have a 50% taller opening (making nail positioning that much easier) and are a couple of dollars less expensive (at the time of this review</li>
            <li>I really wish it had the little file/hook attachment that swiveled out</li>
            <li>Crisp, clean cutting sets these clippers apart from the crowd.  </li>
            <li>Because the Clyppi was so expensive, and had so many good reviews, I thought there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;d be as bad as the dollar emergency clippers I already had.  </li>

            <li> I just used the Clyppi and I have to say I am most impressed.</li>
            <li> most perfect nail clipper EVER&amp;#62;\</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are nice clippers!  </li>
            <li> Looks good with great tactile feedback.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend your using them to cut fishing line when replaces a lure as they are too good, but would work great for this also but over kill.</li>
            <li> At best, most of them leave ragged nail edges.  </li>
            <li> Nice work!  </li>
            <li> Seller communication, shipping are excellent but the product itself is not user friendly!</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and the best I have had.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly and came in a great package!</li>
            <li> The Clyppi is easily the best nail clipper I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for an effective, upscale, and appealing nail clipper, the Clyppi is a great choice!</li>
            <li> glass smooth, perfectly aligned, and cuts like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> It is so good that I just ordered the toenail clipper.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product complimented by fantastic customer service.</li>
            <li> Good balance.  </li>
            <li> Quality product for a good price.</li>

            <li> They are as good as they say.</li>
            <li> Good file.</li>
            <li> For that reason alone, I felt good about having ordered the &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a good pair of fingernail clippers and wanted to buy some German-made ones.  </li>
            <li> This feels so good on my hands, no poking or pinching when trying to use it.</li>
            <li> Good steel just lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good, but nothing like the originals.</li>
            <li> It’s so good</li>
            <li> Grip on clippers was good.</li>
            <li> And it is a good nail clipper for men as well as women because it is not too “girly”.</li>
            <li> Good stocking stuffer for the men on my list.</li>
            <li> Good profile on the edge which helps me cut on scratchy parts of my cuticles.</li>
            <li> As a nail clipper it&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li> Being a good person, I wanted to hurry and try the clippers and write a review, however I had just gotten a pedicure and manicure two days ago.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t fair to try a fingernail clipper on a toenail, but it worked fantastically.  </li>
            <li> Good product---good service</li>
            <li> I loved these while they lasted.  </li>
            <li> You can buy a good one too from the store with 7-8 bucks .</li>
            <li> made and good quality.</li>
            <li> Good clippers.</li>
            <li> so I could have a good set of emergency clippers to replace some crappy ones that I already had.  </li>
            <li> Matte finish is gorgeous</li>
            <li> I had received the toenail clippers for review, and knew once I loved those I knew that I had to also do a review for fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li> I like the clippers, they do a good job.</li>
            <li> The integral nail file is good too.</li>
            <li> Used twice, loved it.  </li>
            <li> good clippers.</li>
            <li> I am a toolmaker by trade, so I know good tools when I use them...</li>
            <li> My husband wanted a really good pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> I had a nice cheapie that worked great</li>
            <li> Love a good tool!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this clipper is beautifully crafted with great fit and finish.</li>
            <li> It is the best nail clipper I ever have, but it will be perfect if it has a hole to attach to a key chain.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  </li>
            <li> did receive the Clyppi nail clippers, tried them and am very satisfied with the results.</li>

            <li> We love your clippers!</li>
            <li> Appears to be nice, need more time to see the quality!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product worth the money.</li>
            <li> It looks amazing.</li>
            <li> These things are simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> I must say that this company has amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> They worked great until they broke after 8 months of light use by one person.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic nail clipper and you will be happy when you purchase it.</li>
            <li> The vendor/seller is a great communicator and my transaction went really smooth and this is what Amazon purchases should be about.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest</li>
            <li> I really believe this is the best nail clipper I have ever owned!    </li>
            <li> The nail must then be filed to keep it from &#x27;catching&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> but would be nice touch...</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best nail clipper!!!</li>
            <li> Has a nice and sleek design.</li>
            <li> I recieved my order and asked how I liked the Clyppi ).</li>
            <li> I liked the quality</li>
            <li> But, I am satisfied and want to still give them a good review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Aa nicely engineered grooming tool.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered the Clyppi because I liked the name and it looked like a nice design.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making an excellent product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li> They look nice but in my opinion the quality of those that I received aren&#x27;t up to the standards of $1 store clippers.</li>
            <li> Plus, it has a nice form factor, which is always nice to see.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get a nice fingernail clipper to see if there was any difference compared to drugstore clippers.  </li>
            <li> I really needed some clippers for my fingernails that would do an excellent cut.  </li>
            <li> The customer service and follow-up communications are both efficient and courteous.</li>
            <li> If that makes any kind of sense..  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best nail clipper I have owned.</li>
            <li> nice touch.</li>
            <li> very* pricey or not the greatest in quality...</li>
            <li> Nice finger clipper.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the best fingernail clippers that I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent clipper and very well made.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer sent me an email asking how I liked them, when I mentioned it they immediately sent me a replacement set without me</li>
            <li> Really nice design as well.</li>
            <li> The Clyppi gives a nice, even cut on thicker nails as well.</li>
            <li> These work incredibly well and knowing this, are worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good nail clippers, much better department store standby.  </li>
            <li> We really liked the built in file.&lt;br /&gt;Ill</li>
            <li> He liked that the metal didn’t flex.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t get some nice clippers before.  </li>
            <li> Nice Job.</li>
            <li> Both are excellent clippers and deserving of their high ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Clyppi is great, easy to use and a very precise cutter.  </li>
            <li> I love to do things for myself and what better way than to have your nails and toes nice and neat!</li>
            <li> In particular, the area that is pressed to make it cut the nail is perfectly designed for the thumb to perform the task.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing innovative or exceptional about them.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and cut perfectly and best of all are easily handled.</li>
            <li> Clyppi is my new best friend.</li>
            <li> I have used my new Clyppie nail clippers for about a week now and am very impressed with the precision with which they cut.</li>
            <li> Your personalized emails are most impressive and appreciated.</li>
            <li> As soon as I purchased these I received an email from the maker saying how much I was going to love these clippers, that they were the best around.</li>
            <li> I get great control and can trim my fast-growing nails evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li> Very strong.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and handle.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The design of the device makes it very easy to do the job that it was designed.  </li>
            <li> Super adorable and functional clippers!!  </li>
            <li> This one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far, a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> These are by far the BEST clippers I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> With my die grinder, I sharpened my 15 year old drug store clippers and they work superbly.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> the good Trim ones were still available.</li>
            <li> The Clyppi was by far the best.</li>
            <li> My clippers always leave my nails smooth and give me a good edge.  </li>
            <li> These are by far the best clippers I have owned.  </li>
            <li> Took a chance on the Clyppi based on great average user rating (Amazon) and I must admit these are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality well worth the money</li>
            <li> Clean, crisp cut, best one I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold, trim cleanly, - love them!</li>
            <li> Nice, clean cuts!</li>
            <li> Pretty happy with the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the idea of supporting people who develop a great product rather than</li>
            <li> I purchased the Clyppi for toe nails first and after using them and how great they were-</li>
            <li> I am very happy that there is a lifetime guarantee on the Clyppi Fingernail clippers, they are extremely well made, but it is good to know that they are replaceable should there ever be a problem.  </li>
            <li> These nail clippers are pretty great.</li>
            <li> Great product, costs a little more than most but ease of operation and excellent design make this a five star product.</li>
            <li> This is one fine product!</li>
            <li> Also clipping is very comfortable, but the nail file needs improvement.</li>
            <li> It gives a very precise cut, even on toenails, for which it is not designed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very light despite the size.</li>
            <li> They are very precise and sharper</li>
            <li> Very smooth cuts.  </li>
            <li> These are all small criticisms of a great nail clipper which fulfills its intended use with great aplomb!</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;The new clipper is amazing a lives up to all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yours had a good review and price, so I tried a pair and was very satisfied, super sharp, and very good alignment!!</li>
            <li> Really good nail clippers, they cut easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> The top of the handle is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Love the &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought two more sets to give as Christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t find it 3 times better than ones sold in drug stores for 3-5 bucks</li>
            <li> Worked great in the beginning but dulled rather fast</li>
            <li> The placement of the built-in file is perfect and provides extra grip at the tip of my thumb.</li>
            <li> I felt so confident using the Clyppi fingernail trimmers</li>
            <li> I was able to use them on my toddler as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love these clippers.</li>
            <li> I love the Clyppi nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> Make more items :)</li>
            <li> Outstanding construction.</li>
            <li> These clippers work fabulously, and they feel nice in my hand.  </li>
            <li> 1000 times better than anything I can purchase at drug or grocery store.</li>
            <li> While the materials, design and concept are undeniable superb, the engineering could use a second look.  </li>
            <li> I used it once - did a nice job of precisely trimming my nails as advertised.  </li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m ordering more Clyppi nail clippers for family.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> I love the clipper.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t think of ever using a better pair of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally never used a better nail clipper in my life.  </li>
            <li> I received the Clyppi clippers (cute name) and have already used them on my toenails.</li>
            <li> and I’m glad I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> Then I realized that it would be more convenient to have one in my bathroom upstairs</li>
            <li> and I love having them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for Men with big hands ..</li>
            <li> It clips finger and toe nails nice and smoothly.</li>
            <li> I would gladly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy products that do the job without breaking and this passes the test!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more.  </li>
            <li> I also realized after receiving them that they have a nail file built in where you see the rectangle on top.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I’m going to order some more to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li> I love using it, but it needs a bit more space between the top of the file and the hinge.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> also love the way the nail file is built into the handle.</li>
            <li> It is so much more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and they are a better size for both my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer proactively contacted me to inquire how I was enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> For years I have used drugstore clippers and been satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Clyppi for my husband who is always “complaining” that we need better fingernail clippers as a Fathers Day gift.</li>
            <li> I hope to love them for years.</li>
            <li> The lever arm seems more bent up for added leverage.  </li>
            <li> buying more for gifts.</li>
            <li> If it would have been even half-inch longer it would make even better for holding to clip nails.</li>
            <li> It cuts quick and clean and has a great file incorporated into the clipper handle.</li>
            <li> Love the clipper.  </li>
            <li> But they are still much better than any others I had.</li>
            <li> I decided to check Amazon, and from the many nail clippers offered, I choose to order Clyppi.  </li>
            <li> These are the best and the difference is obvious.</li>
            <li> For the cost, I was expecting more; something a lot better, and that&#x27;s not what these are.  </li>
            <li> Would be just the slightest bit better with grip pads and a cuticle device added.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 more sets..</li>
            <li> Better than others?</li>
            <li> but I love quality and that&#x27;s what the these are.</li>
            <li> These are better.  </li>
            <li> Love the grip and they don&#x27;t slip out of your hand.  </li>
            <li> Keegan Allen&#x27;s Clyppi is 2X better, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> now that my wife found them, i&#x27;ll undoubtedly be buying more.</li>
            <li> Great for the whole household, including youngsters learning to clip nails.</li>
            <li> More marketing than any revolutionary tech.</li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> They are fantastic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, I guess.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;~They are sturdy &amp; stylish</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the ease and comfort of it since sometimes I have arthritic discomfort in my hands.</li>
            <li> I just bought two more sets as birthday gifts.</li>
            <li> Finally, I decided to go to Google \\&quot;best fingernail clipper\\&quot; and arrived at Amazon&#x27;s number one item: Clyppi.</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> You can buy cheaper, I&#x27;m sure, but this is a well-made item.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the top and bottom blades do not meet correctly and as a result they tear more than cut and leave my nails more jagged and torn than neatly clipped.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a wonderful product for those that have disabilities.</li>
            <li> AND most guys I know just grab a clipper</li>
            <li> These are way better than the cheap over the counter kind that you buy at the drug store.</li>
            <li> So much better than the drug store variety.</li>
            <li> Was really hoping that this would be a great clipper</li>
            <li> The Clyppi is a much better product</li>
            <li> The top piece popped off one time</li>
            <li> clippers but prefer these &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34; ones because I have a better grip with them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more of these for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> its OK,</li>
            <li> Fantastic clippers!  </li>
            <li> So glad I no longer have to worry about that.  </li>
            <li> I shall be ordering more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am SO glad that I purchased these clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not an engineer, so I&#x27;m not quite sure, what they have done that makes them work better, but they truly do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the smaller fingernail clippers, and I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> They were made in Germany perhaps 50 or more years</li>
            <li> The Clyppi Clippers are smooth!</li>
            <li> I can say my husband is very happy after trying the second pair of clippers!  </li>
            <li> That was also solved, we got to keep the sent in error second pair of fingernail clippers (that DO work wonderfully!), got a refund on the never sent toenail clippers, AND they are sending out the pair of toenail clippers for free!  </li>
            <li> I love the Clippers.</li>
            <li> I received my Clyppi about a week ago, and I love it.</li>
            <li> and we all love them.</li>
            <li> Plan to buy more for Christmas gifts for all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Glad I discovered this nail clipper.</li>
            <li> It is so refreshing to purchase a product that exceeds my expectations for quality.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased I am going to purchase two more sets for my daughters.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> We both are pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you. :)</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase a couple more pair.</li>
            <li> My mother who is 99 might even be able to use them..</li>
            <li> Considering how many times you&#x27;ll use this over time, this is cheap!</li>
            <li> The leaf thickness makes the cutters look more like quality chisel points than dinky nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;it was outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I am more than pleased that it is all</li>
            <li> you pay for (mostly).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found you - I just wish it would have been sooner.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND&#x27;S FAVORITE.  </li>
            <li> already have one, and I ordered two more</li>
            <li> husband was very impressed with the larger clippers.  </li>
            <li> They assured me that all of the reviews were authentic and furthermore that I must have received a defective clipper.  </li>
            <li> though there could be none better than Amazon</li>
            <li> As you have no doubt heard, many so-called &amp;#34;customer reviews&amp;#34; are, in fact, company employees and/or PR departments submitting reviews.</li>
            <li> He came in the next day and said these are the greatest clippers he has ever used.</li>
            <li> Also it would be better</li>
            <li> I wonder how many years it took for the manufacturer to figure that one out.</li>
            <li> These are ok</li>
            <li> Good leverage, clean edge, easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Just couldn’t find that magic again.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my way to buy 5 more.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> The recipients were pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> Having had them for over 6 months at this point I am satisfied and would order them again.</li>
            <li> I figured if I&#x27;d invest some money in a pair they would be good ones, and I do think I made the right choice with Clyppi.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited about this CLYPPI clipper, they are amazingly sturdy.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> They looked like good high quality clippers that could clip my toes and fingernails, a nice hybrid size.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers provide a really nice clean cut every time.  </li>
            <li> Nice clean cuts.</li>
            <li> I was fooled by the clever product description and great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Littl high in price, but the ergonomics are great.</li>
            <li> At last a strong, beautiful, truly functional nail clipper!</li>
            <li> Great clippers, easy for very arthritic hands to use.</li>
            <li> These made a very clean cut which didn&#x27;t require filing.</li>
            <li> It is really&lt;br /&gt;sharp and cuts the fingernails very cleanly.</li>
            <li> sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product, I plan on getting several more for our family too!</li>
            <li> All opinions are true and my own.</li>
            <li> I am 80 years old and have never ever experienced such a marvelous clipper.</li>
            <li> clippers had a great reviews and even though a little pricey so happy I bought them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice product – arrived quickly, high quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see how these fare!</li>
            <li> They are shaped so I was able to lift the nail to clip it and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My nails are quite strong and I’ve not used a clipper that handles the job better than this one.</li>
            <li> I have a KAI clipper which I like a lot too, but haven&#x27;t been able to find easy, so I opted for the Clyppi based on the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> I guess...not super thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed with their feel to start with, solid and smooth.</li>
            <li> Gave a nice, clean, easy cut like I&#x27;ve never seen before.</li>
            <li> CLEAN CUT!  </li>
            <li> They give a nice clean, smooth cut.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use; make a quick crisp cut; and are actually attractive.  </li>
            <li> Please read all the features listed in the description-they are truthful and accurate.  </li>
            <li> You received a corrected and more accurate review</li>
            <li> (Suggestion to whoever designed Clyppi: make the hole in the lever fit more snugly with the pin.)</li>
            <li> It was so flimsy that the lever would pop off if you didn&#x27;t center it perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Clyppi clippers for about a week and so far, I am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> Many products today lack the quality of yesteryear, but Clyppi has done well by offering a product that excels at its job and feels comfortable when in use.  </li>
            <li> They work perfectly, and do not leave rough edges, snags, or chipped areas.  </li>
            <li> So much better quality than the cheap drug store clippers.</li>
            <li> OK, these clippers are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re better quality than the cheap pair</li>

            <li> Seems to be a great clipper so far.</li>
            <li> I let go of the baby nail clippers for my two children and just used these because they were more precise and quicker to use.  </li>
            <li> (even if it wasn’t quite as comfortable and effortless) for many years...</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t require much pressure to cut a fingernail and have a textured section to help get a good grip.  </li>
            <li> The fit and finish is superb, and I like the leverage that a long handle provides.</li>
            <li> The feel really good and cut very well.</li>
            <li> I love how easy and comfortable it is to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size, and is sharp so there is no breaking or tearing nails.  </li>

            <li> I have really strong finger nails and the Clyppi</li>

            <li> The clippers fit your hand comfortably and the cut is clean and easy to do, even if you do not have a lot of hand strength.</li>
            <li> The way they are designed my thumb rests comfortably in an indent that makes the clippers fit well in my hand.</li>
            <li> One bizarre thing,,,,,they don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34; name on it, so</li>

            <li> It cuts cleanly and is easy to use.  </li>

            <li> The Clyppi has a nice texture to it and has a weight to it that makes it feel really sturdy.</li>
            <li> you WILL need a nail file or emery board to get a smooth clip job</li>
            <li> Well worth the money over cheap ones you get in drugstores!</li>
            <li> Clippers work smoothly and expertly.  </li>
            <li> I replaced a cheap clipper, because I could not get leverage to operate it.</li>
            <li> What I like about the clipper is how light weight and sturdy it is.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;~There is a built-in emory board that doubles as a fantastic grip while trimming&lt;br</li>
            <li> Liked it so much</li>
            <li> It is precisely what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I saw her struggling with a cheap pair from Wal-Mart and, after doing some research about your product, I decided to order your clippers.</li>
            <li> These are great, definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> (Doesn&#x27;t cut cuticle skin as well as the cheap ones.)  </li>

            <li> These are different, great cut.</li>
            <li> Cuts cleanly and easily</li>

            <li> Beyond that, the people who make the product seem really invested in it, and I appreciate that kind of care.</li>
            <li> Cuts cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li> if there would be an area I needed to smooth out, I could just use the file that is so conveniently located on the top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the cheap drugstore nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> After years of using cheap quality nail clippers and toe clippers, I decided to make a change and picked up these Clyppi nail clippers after seeing the reviews.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Not only is the clipper extremely good; the customer service is even better.</li>
            <li> The cleaning tool commonly found on most clippers would be the perfect addition.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>

            <li> Contrary to some of the dissenting reviews, I found that it provides for a very smooth, clean cut, that is far better than the cheaper $.99 grocery store options.  </li>
            <li> The fit easily in my travel case and cut evenly and smoothly the first time, every time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, In short, I&#x27;m pleased with the Clyppi, despite the absence of a feature to clean under my fingernails, they work flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Great look, sharp cut &amp; easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Clean cuts.</li>
            <li> A clipper to handle the hardest nails with a clean cut edge.</li>
            <li> Splits nails doesn&#x27;t clip cleanly.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use the nail file for filing but to clean our nails.</li>
            <li> It clipped cleanly without causing breakage or tearing.</li>
            <li> But this clipper cut cleanly every time.</li>
            <li> The&lt;br /&gt;Clyppi did that for me with a clean cut on the nails.</li>
            <li> I work in the automotive profession and like to keep my nails trimmed very short and these clippers are by far the best I&#x27;ve used .</li>
            <li> Clean cuts and no snags, etc.  </li>
            <li> It cuts so cleanly that the nail doesn&#x27;t go flying across the room when you cut it.  </li>
            <li> Yours cuts so cleanly that my nails feel like I&#x27;ve filed them.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even have to file afterwards because the cut is so clean.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t clip off cuticles cleanly like it does the nails.</li>
            <li> There is no pointy file piece under the flipup part to clean under nails.  </li>
            <li> It cuts with ease and leaves a clean cut.  </li>
            <li> and they cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> These clippers clip my husband&#x27;s and boys&#x27; fingernails accurately, quickly, and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The stainless steel construction is much sturdier than your run of the mill clippers and it just looks good too.</li>
            <li> They cut my fingernails cleanly and with minimum effort.  </li>
            <li> This can be the only explanation for the near insanely wonderful reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> I had purchased many cheap fingernail clippers over the years and this was absolutely what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The clippers work very well - much better than the cheap ones from the drug store I have been using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Clyppi fingernail clippers once so far, and they are WONDERFUL!  </li>
            <li> These clipper are nice and sharp and gives a nice clean cut.  </li>
            <li> already own a fantastic pair of clippers that I got maybe 22 years ago from a random beach gift shop, that still work great, but I don&#x27;t know what brand they are, so I can&#x27;t get more of them.  </li>
            <li> Someone did it right!</li>
            <li> They look cool but they are really no that great.  </li>
            <li> Cuts cleanly and quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a truly precise clipper and completely worth the money.</li>
            <li> True to its description.</li>
            <li> After trying out various manufacturers, I got one of these and was delighted.</li>
            <li> its quality is surprisingly way above my expectation on a clip.</li>
            <li> The most gentle nail clipper that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> So many clippers cut like scissors instead of offering one straight cut like the Clyppi.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t justify the premium price when there are many stainless quality options for 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d gotten the toenail size, but as good as these seem to be I&#x27;ll likely wind up with those, too.</li>
            <li> The clippers are very well made and I love the attention to detail your company has put into them.</li>
            <li> so much so that I just ordered two more.  </li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of the darned things that I&#x27;ve bought hoping</li>
            <li> I am really surprised how nice the filing pad works though.  </li>
            <li> This will make all of your wildest dreams come true</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one who would&#x27;ve thought there was a difference between nail clippers, but this one really does seem to be better.  </li>
            <li> Glad I ordered and tried one-- works really well.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and good craftsmanship, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this clipper several times already and am impressed with how easy it is to use when I clip left or right fingernails.</li>
            <li> and i strongly recommend who are interested for quality goods.</li>
            <li> He also purchased due to the great reviews that he had read about your product.</li>
            <li> Great product, sharp and compact.</li>
            <li> Really serious and dedicated to create the best finger nail clipper, I&#x27;d say they are there already.</li>
            <li> These are seriously the best nail clippers that I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Seriously the best clippers we&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> but this product should be worth the price, it gives you clean cut.</li>
            <li> I ordered and the item came quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> so quickly nail clipping is over before he can complain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t only use for nails, but for fly making and fishing, so this set is of real quality.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the exceptional personal touch to the buying experience.</li>
            <li> Truthfully the main reason I was looking to replace the one I had</li>
            <li> finally I have found me a pair of wonderful clippers that when these wear out I will only get this brand.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product; I&#x27;m going back to buy another one now.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to cut to the quick.  </li>
            <li> A quick swipe with a file cures that.  </li>
            <li> Broke but quickly replaced</li>
            <li> I want them short for the wonderful journey left in front of me.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied and highly recommend this clipper.</li>
            <li> Both were very unique designs with striking visual impact.  </li>
            <li> Used a couple times and it is without a doubt a much better quality of product than the normal clippers bought at competitors stores.  </li>
            <li> This is the first pair of clippers I have felt comfortable using without needing to soften my fingernails before using.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re able to be precise in clipping because of the gripping part that keeps your grip from slipping.  </li>
            <li> large surface area to easily grab on to when clipping finger nails or toe nails.</li>
            <li> It is the smoothest, cleanest cut I have experienced with any nail clipper, hands down.  </li>
            <li> He also liked the clean cut edge he was left</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are very sharp and work great.</li>
            <li> Works great and very sharp.</li>
            <li> I just received my order for my new CLYPPI FINGERNAIL TRIMMERS and was EXTREMELY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> They immediately sent me a new item and followed up to make sure the product arrived.</li>
            <li> I think these are great clippers however less than 6 months after purchasing and having used them</li>
            <li> I ordered the Clyppi for my parents and they really like how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li> This is a very well designed nail clipper and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Feels as if they are ergonomically designed- easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging &amp; fast</li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect for a tool of this quality!</li>
            <li> The Clyppi is the first nail clipper I’ve ever used that doesn’t jump out of my hand whenever it feels like it!</li>
            <li> Just like a hot knife through butter!</li>
            <li> The first one we received must have been a fluke!  </li>
            <li> Only better than a Clyppi is two Clyppis!</li>
            <li> Will definitely make sure I try not to lose this one!</li>
            <li> It delivers the same kind of precise cut without any ragged edges, that of course, is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a clipper that works easily and smoothly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a chance to use my new Clyppi twice so far, but am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need great nail clippers, I&#x27;m no hand model or anything, and I&#x27;m certainly no expert on beauty products, but for my simple needs these nail clippers are average at best.</li>
            <li> Makes crisp and clean cuts.  </li>
            <li> Great little nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Well worth the higher price!</li>
            <li> Great little fingernail clipper, heavier gauge steel than dollar store/pharmacy/etc.</li>
            <li> It is easier for her to hold, applies a little more pressure and is nice and</li>
            <li> Everything breaks eventually, and I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t be my last either, but I&#x27;ve gone through designs of both high and low quality, often at much higher prices, and Clyppi has exceeded my expectations for ease of use, attractive design, and comfortable feel in the hand.</li>
            <li> Great clippers - heavy and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Well designed with stainless steel, not the cheap junk metal used by drugstore clippers.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and powerful.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> So I bought a second one, after noting that they came with a file, and I keep it handy and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Worth every dime.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for my Japanese Parada clipper and liked what I had heard about yours.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison out there and well worth</li>
            <li> I have purchased these again - because they are worth it.</li>
            <li> Oh well it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are nicer and smoother than your run-of-the-mill, but not $14 worth-</li>
            <li> Wow these could not have come at a better time.</li>
            <li> Plus, the co-founder of Clyppi wrote to me personally to ask how I liked this product.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Powerful precision in a nail clipper?</li>
            <li> They are worth the money for me.  </li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a sign of the times, but it is rare to find a product that works the way it should, and this does.</li>
            <li> i like it, but for $15, it isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> She is still fiercely independent and insists on clipping her own nails.</li>
            <li> She clipped her own nails with total ease while I observed.</li>
            <li> so here was a success.  </li>
            <li> Found my old pair from many years ago and like the old ones much better.</li>
            <li> worth $15 .</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> To be fair the old pair is old.</li>
            <li> It has a life time warranty which you rarely see these days</li>
            <li> The price is well worth it in my estimation.</li>
            <li> While you probably don&#x27;t think that a device like a nail clipper could make your life better, sometimes you just get pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> None of them cut worth a darn.  </li>
            <li> There are so many poorly made products out there, this is a welcome relief.</li>
            <li> Good weight, not too heavy but not too light either, and</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them once since I just received them, but so far they appear to be a great product.</li>
            <li> So when I lost them, I got these, also on Amazon and so far, they are much better.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, they don&#x27;t clip well, if you look closely the top and bottom over-lap rather than come to a good cutting edge.</li>
            <li> I would like to find a man sized, easy to grip, high quality fingernail clipper with a finger nail cleaner&amp;#34;  Someone listened to me.</li>
            <li> Not your average clipper, the kind you used for years and years,  This one gets the job done easily and correctly.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely sturdy and well-made, they cut&lt;br /&gt;cleanly, and I love the idea of the file being on the top instead of a slide out</li>
            <li> They are more stylish than any other clipper I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> Cuts MUCH more precisely and easily than any clipper I have ever had before due to the good ergonomics and very sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> Sharp clean lines, and the brushed finish is more pleasing to me even on chrome clippers that are in good shape.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had a chance to use them very much, though I can definitely see they produce a much more precise, clean and effortless cut than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;built in&#x27; nail file built is ever so handy and much superior to the traditional fold out style on average clippers.</li>
            <li> Oh they look quite nice with a very modern aesthetic, but that is the only thing about them that one can compliment.  </li>
            <li> All of my crummy Revlon clippers are going right in the trash, where they belong.</li>
            <li> Just the right size.</li>
            <li> looking for a nail clipper that allowed  me to cut the nails on my right hand since</li>
            <li> Just go right ahead and buy these clippers right now.  </li>
            <li> and they are so right</li>
            <li> I made my purchase of the Clyppi for my aging mother who suffered a stroke 8 years ago and is paralyzed on her right side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok, so fingernail clippers are just fingernail clippers, right??  </li>
            <li> The woman who said she no longer had to file her nails was right on point</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m goon to order another one right away to have when I misplace this one.</li>
            <li> They were right.</li>
            <li> You can feel the quality right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> My Clyppi fingernail clippers arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> I like them for their clean cut, but not so much for the close cut.</li>
            <li> Comfortable design for a steady grip.</li>
            <li> Feels better in the hand and more efficient than the average clipper.</li>
            <li> This is a great little item!</li>
            <li> These work a little better than the generic kind you find in drug stores, but not that much better.  </li>
            <li> Nice clean sharp cut.</li>
            <li> These fingernail clippers are made of high quality steel that is also ergonomically designed to fit the shape of your hand.  </li>
            <li> end of the handles flare OUT slightly at the end for more gripping surface area</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not that it really matters, but they do have a cool, machined look to them.</li>
            <li> I ended up putting on a small split-ring, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have not tried all the other brands to say if any other are as good, but I can tell you that we are VERY pleased with these.  </li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting something a little better, when compared to the dollar store clippers it seems it should be more curved.</li>
            <li> I did try out my Clyppi nail clipper and am pleased that it cuts sharply and easily.  </li>
            <li> I can grip the clippers easily - the width of the handles is much better than other clippers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Adjectives to describe them are: sharp, stylish, sturdy, strong ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I understand what&#x27;s so great about these nail clippers that they came up first in my search results for customer reviews.</li>
            <li> The Clyppi is easy to use and cuts completely through every time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the Clyppi so much I bought a 2nd one just in case</li>
            <li> These are the only ones I&#x27;ve ever found that cut clean and easy.</li>
            <li> I spent many years going through cheap clippers that chip or tear my nails.  </li>
            <li> Sent the above feedback and got a great response back!</li>
            <li> Nice modern design but simple.</li>
            <li> This is the first clipper they&#x27;ve ever tried that had such a good spring action.  </li>
            <li> The cutters mate perfectly when closed and they are the first pair ever to not get jammed by a dime when pocket carried with lose</li>
            <li> Very high quality clippers!</li>
            <li> it very much a quality tool.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The Clyppis are rock solid, made out of nicely finished stainless steel, easy to handle, and have a broad end that allows you to get plenty of leverage.</li>
            <li> The stainless steel construction seems a lot sturdier and won&#x27;t start peeling off like the plating on other clippers, and it just looks good.  </li>
            <li> New nail clipper model incorporates user feedback from original version -</li>
            <li> I was really impressed that it was so clean cutting</li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t say they entirely suitable for large handed individuals such as myself.  </li>
            <li> Even though a little pricey, it&#x27;s better than having to purchase several in order to get a good cut.  </li>
            <li> Clyppi Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper really is the ultra cool precision tool.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Finally, I decided to respond because I love</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is designed to do.  </li>
            <li> Today was the first time I had used them as I gave them for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered two more for my wife and daughter plus will probably buy one of the toenail clippers as well - even considering buying a 3rd fingernail clipper to keep at work.    </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Your Clyppi nail clipper is vastly superior to the standard design: more comfortable feel, easier to use, sharper and more exact cutting.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought didn’t have the nail file on it</li>
            <li> Really like it!</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> These clippers are better than any found in our local stores.</li>
            <li> My nails actually seem to feel cleaner because of the better quality cut.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the brushed nickel look</li>
            <li> Quite better than the 2nd rate stuff from our eastern hemisphere friends.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is head and shoulders above both the dollar store cheapies, as well as most anything you could get in a grocery store or drug store.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> So this is my first Amazon review.</li>
            <li> Looked like it would work well and seemed to work well at first.</li>
            <li> The brushed finish is quite refreshing</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I finally used the Clyppi and I love how it feels in my hand and how it clips my nails.</li>
            <li> However, the cut isn&#x27;t any more precision than the local drugstore&#x27;s name brand clippers.</li>
            <li> For the increased cost, I think I would prefer something manufactured in the USA or that had a more functional design than the clippers theyusually sell at the local grocery store.</li>
            <li> Worlds better than my former clippers.</li>
            <li> which I really like !</li>
            <li> I was pretty amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re definitely better off buying this than the $2 one at the local convenience store.</li>
            <li> We are &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; citizens with&lt;br /&gt;some physical limitations and are definitely pleased to have found these clippers.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this off by saying these are not my first nail clippers.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> first time i managed to cut my finger nails without looking like</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t find any that were higher quality, despite some that had a higher price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> This is the first high-end nail clipper I&#x27;ve used, so I can&#x27;t compare to the extremely expensive stuff from Solingen and the like, but I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am going to order 5 more to give as gifts next Christmas.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I expected it to be much sharper and perform much better than the drugstore brands available to me.</li>
            <li> But overall I am pleased.</li>
            <li> The first Clyppi that arrived had a flaw.</li>
            <li> I am convinced I will never find the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; pair of clippers but these are pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> so much eaiser clipping my nails!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes the job much faster!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s higher price, but in the end decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li> This one is noticeably higher quality with thicker steel throughout.</li>
            <li> Most of all, Clyppi is built to last.</li>
            <li> and now he wants me to get him one!  </li>
            <li> This thing is really well made!  </li>
            <li> I took a chance with Clyppi, and I should have just bought this one first.</li>
            <li> I just used mine for the first time tonight -</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have owned a Clyppi.  </li>
            <li> I gave these their first clip and</li>
            <li> An absolute must buy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You won&#x27;t go wrong with either, but if are looking for the best, go for the Seki.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I can actually cut my fingernails with the Clyppi which I havent been able to for a while.</li>
            <li> so I decided to pay more and see if I get a different result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier with these babies!</li>
            <li> This is the first pair of higher priced clippers for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many clippers over the years that don&#x27;t last even 3 months</li>
            <li> Having said all that, it does not slide along one&#x27;s nails as easily as the polished ones do, but I think with a little more use, I&#x27;ll get accustomed to that.  </li>
            <li> this is a good tool,  quality made and very sharp!</li>
            <li> Super high quality material.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding, very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and more comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t need a new pair of toenail clippers, I liked the fingernail version enough that I went ahead and completed the set.  </li>
            <li> ; I did not realize that this kind of tool could be vastly improved, but it can, and these clippers are vastly better than any other clipper I ever labored to use.</li>
            <li> Very little pressure is required to obtain a nice clean trim.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and was having trouble with regular clippers, but these are easy to use and cut nice and clean.</li>
            <li> The weight feels right, and the hidden nail file is actually a nice addition too.</li>
            <li> Easy and very comfortable to use, sharp enough to cut your finger nails clean.</li>
            <li> I had to look awhile, but the other nice thing about this one is that it has a nail file, too.</li>
            <li> They are nice and sharp and hope they stay that way.</li>
            <li> It is so nice and sharp</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp, and feels like a well designed tool.</li>
            <li> Nice clippers, I have been searching for something that stays sharp, and well aligned.</li>
            <li> Again the blades are nice and sharp and cut evenly.  </li>
            <li> It is really sharp and precise; also, easy to hold onto - it’s not slippery.</li>
            <li> I already ordered two more pairs - one for my brother and another for some other lucky soul.</li>
            <li> I’ll just have to have my old pair of clippers handy for that part of the job in the future.</li>
            <li> I particularly like its sleek and classy design which makes it easy to manipulate and pleasing to the eye.</li>
            <li> (Say that last sentence really fast, 10 times.)  :-)  </li>
            <li> Since my own biological clock is ticking, I’m anticipating needing a pair of these for myself in the near future, as arthritis in my hands is already beginning to plague me.</li>
            <li> I feel that a lot of companies these days go out of their way to reinvent a common household product, slap a brand name on it, and make sure it is better than their competition.  </li>
            <li> As a guitarist I need to keep my nails trimmed very short, and the Clyppi does an excellent job; it is sharp, it requires very little effort, and produces a very precise cut.  </li>
            <li> I love and I mean love those Clyppi nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> My husband goes through nail clippers like you would not believe and also gets frustrated when they don&#x27;t fit in his large hands, but he thought these were great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my new Clyppi once and it is sharp and more ergonomic.comfortable than the cheap drug store/vending machine/discount store ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sharp, precise, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll pretty much be swapping out every bathroom, car, or keychain set of clippers with this brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to squeeze so hard for a nice, clean cut.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s well designed and constructed, but, it pretty much just cuts nails.  </li>
            <li> I would say the Clyppi clippers pretty much do that and do it well.  </li>
            <li> After my last cheap, local pharmacy-bought clippers broke, I decided to see if there was a better product out there.</li>
            <li> I think the file on the top of the handle is really too short to be of much use.</li>
            <li> Having a small file built into the lever I find superior to having to have a separate file attached to the clippers.  </li>
            <li> too small and can&#x27;t believe all the good reviews-</li>
            <li> The nail file area does a good job of filing, but too small to be practical.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This clipper feels very smooth and cuts precisely with a minimum of applied force - no more slips.</li>
            <li> These are well designed being easy to hold are very sharp making a crisp, clean cut on the fingernail.  </li>
            <li> All the high quality clippers I&#x27;ve seen do not seem to have a fold out finger nail cleaner that most low end clippers have.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and effective.</li>
            <li> the clipper is very well made, very sharp, and easy for precise cut.</li>
            <li> but I easily put it back together.  </li>
            <li> Clearly the product has tremendous attributes and is a quality product.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper for my husband as he is very particular about the way his nails are cut.</li>
            <li> He could trim all his fingers easily and the way the clippers don&#x27;t have to be squeezed low, he never felt he was going to drop them and had no discomfort using them.</li>
            <li> It clips very well and feels good in my hand while still being small and compact.  </li>
            <li> Pure speculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I certainly would not hesitate to recommend Clyppi on both counts without any reservation.</li>
            <li> clean and sharp and comfortable to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super Sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Many clippers I have used are dull at the start and also don&#x27;t clip as easily.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these, they are not worth two bucks, as a matter of fact the cheap ones from the drugstore work better than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very well designed, very sharp clippers, nice upgrade from department store clippers.  </li>
            <li> It also has a scraper on the top half to remove unwanted edges in freshly cut nails.  </li>
            <li> And if I do have to file, there is a really cute little file built into the clyppi which is very effective despite its small size.</li>
            <li> Filer is very fine and sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and easy to grip!</li>
            <li> Terrific product and works fine.  </li>
            <li> Awesome clippers, they are sharp and have a nice sharp angle on the lever arm making nail cutting more convenient.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Very high quality construction</li>
            <li> #34;I consider your clipper to be very high quality.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product and vendor very highly.</li>
            <li> Nice little clipper, clips well when used by either hand.</li>
            <li> it had the kind of swing-out nail file with the little hook at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many nail clippers I have bought in the past and discarded, because they didn&#x27;t cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> Fortunately there is an abrasive surface on the top that you can use to smooth out or buff down any sharp or ragged edges.  </li>
            <li> My primary problem with most nail clippers is that the back ends are most often somewhat pointed and the natural pushing of the clipper onto the nail generally inflicts pain on the other hand...</li>
            <li> I had such an amazing experience that I decided to finally write a review aver being a shopper since the dawn of the internet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Made of stainless steel, the trimmers are manufactured with quality metal.</li>
            <li> so I thanks you for that.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand all the superlative reviews --</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> There is so much &#x27;beefiness&#x27; to the front of the clipper that I can&#x27;t get a close trim.  </li>
            <li> If you are in any way thinking &amp;#34;this is too much for a nail clipper!&amp;#34;-</li>
            <li> so I didn’t really use it much as I always use a file when clipping my nails.</li>
            <li> So much for quality.</li>
            <li> Very tiny..Difficult to use..</li>
            <li> This clipper is so much easier to use that others that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> I really like them.</li>
            <li> I recommend whole heartedly..</li>
            <li> I really like the Clyppi.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Really well made and engineered.  </li>
            <li> and I really like its craftsmanship and quality.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> That said they are very well made.  </li>
            <li> I can really get my fingers &amp; thumb into each cut as a result of the added leverage and strength.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really need to file afterwards.</li>
            <li> so it really helps that these clippers are much easier to handle.</li>
            <li> It did not take much force to break the thing.</li>
            <li> When I received it I gave it a try and really like it.  </li>
            <li> you really do not see that feature on many clippers.</li>
            <li> The nail clipper is sleek and very well made.</li>
            <li> Maybe, I don&#x27;t really know.</li>
            <li> The emery board in the lever is attached with some sort of glue and it doesn&#x27;t hold very well</li>
            <li> yet.&lt;br /&gt;The company was very gracious and helpful.</li>
            <li> However, I couldn&#x27;t find any for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The clippers do what they are supposed to do very well--they don&#x27;t chew up your fingernails like some others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much easier to grip than cheaper clippers.  </li>
            <li> You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The reviews for the Clyppi were encouraging and the price was reasonable if it lived up to the expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to neatly trim both the nails and the cuticles with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> A lifetime investment that is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> And these clippers are the real deal.</li>
            <li> Now my wife wants one.</li>
            <li> Precise clipping as described - FINALLY!</li>
            <li> This product is very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making a quality product.</li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t sip out of place and they cut very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making an exemplary product.</li>
            <li> The cutting ability is perfect also.  </li>
            <li> I really like Clyppi Clippers.  </li>
            <li> Very well built.</li>
            <li> Would HIGHLY recommend these clippers!</li>
            <li> and I like how much neater my fingernails look.</li>
            <li> No big deal for cheap clippers but I</li>
            <li> It is also way much overpriced .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to make it a lot easier to use.  </li>
            <li> This nail clipper is very well built.  </li>
            <li> Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper]]</li>
            <li> These cut much nicer, and no need to file!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> He really likes these clippers but has one suggestion.</li>
            <li> Thanks -</li>
            <li> helps when gripping the clippers and helps to prevent them from slipping..  </li>
            <li> Thanks Clyppi for teaching me</li>
            <li> but I prefer the curved clipper to the straight clipper.</li>
            <li> They are very well made.</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say I will order the toenail clippers as soon as my cart has enough in it to get free shipping.</li>
            <li> But any price for these Clyppis is too much, and I&#x27;m returning them.  </li>
            <li> It cuts very well.</li>
            <li> And a nail file integrated with the lever handle, and it&#x27;s much &amp;#34;grittier&amp;#34; than others.</li>
            <li> This is a keeper and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these clippers!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference a real metal clipper made.  </li>
            <li> These clippers really do appear to have had some thought and engineering placed into their development and construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Very well.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely.  </li>
            <li> Quality of materials, build, finish and sharpness of cutting edges are all excellent.</li>
            <li> B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clippers]].  </li>
            <li> I have RA in my hands so they dont work very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the Clyppi, and I&#x27;m planning on buying a couple of others as a backup for me and one for my husband.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers cut my nails in one cut, straight across.  </li>
            <li> The file is really a joke</li>
            <li> They work very well.</li>
            <li> I play guitar, so I have to cut my fingernails a lot as well as very close.  </li>
            <li> After a pair I dearly loved and had for&lt;br /&gt;years finally broke, I had been unable to find any clippers that I liked, even&lt;br /&gt;big</li>
            <li> They are not cheap, but so far they have been as good as billed.</li>
            <li> The Clyppi is a lot better than the old set of clippers I had, which literally fell apart in my hand last time I used them.</li>
            <li> I  really wasn&#x27;t impressed with its cutting ability.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these only to find that both done an excellent job of crushing the nails rather than cutting them.</li>
            <li> These are nice quality, but the opening is two narrow for my nails.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> Only con is that the blades aren&#x27;t as sharp as the &amp;#34;Seki.&amp;#34;  But still gives a clean cut first time, most of the time.</li>
            <li> Absolute, complete GARBAGE!!!  </li>
            <li> This a fantastic little device that is well worth what I paid for it!</li>
            <li> used the new Clyppi for the first time this morning and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why we’ve fallen in love with this nail clipper so quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used my new Clyppi for the first time.</li>
            <li> We live in a hot and humid climate and have to buy these often.  </li>
            <li> Though price is little higher compared to others available in market but worth to get one for those who are not compromosing on quality.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Lightweight and more compact than other clippers.  </li>
            <li> ; They work well, but they don&#x27;t even have the tool that most other do to dig dirt out from under the nail.</li>
            <li> Looks like the clipper will work well - certainly better than any other clipper we&#x27;ve had/</li>
            <li> This is in no way a better fingernail clipper than any other you find in the supermarket for 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER CLIPPERS</li>
            <li> It has an abrasive finish on both sides and seems to be more abrasive on one side than on the other.</li>
            <li> The only improvement that we would like is an attachment that would serve to clean our finger nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheap plastic ones for a long time, and I can tell these clippers are much nicer.  </li>
            <li> , the cut is really so clean clippers are not really necessary.</li>
            <li> These clippers are beautifully made and managed to trim my teenage sons thick nails with ease.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need heavy pressure and they are very easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> However, after the third or fourth use, the top piece of the clipper broke right off near the pin that connects the clipper.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long they will last, but so far I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Had gone through many pairs of the kind you buy in drugstores, all I have tried including the big brands are of poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Not your average fingernail clipper, for sure.</li>
            <li> As I approach my 90th birthday I find that some appendages do not perform in the spontaneous way of the past.</li>
            <li> Very different from regular clippers; more sturdy, better design, and sharp blade.</li>
            <li> Cuts nail easily, but leaves edges jagged and rough.</li>
            <li> (like super short - I guess you could say &amp;#34;guitar player short&amp;#34;, but I don&#x27;t play the guitar).  </li>
            <li> My favorite clippers prior to these (made in Korea and given to me by my father back in the &#x27;80&#x27;s) have gone on &amp;#34;walk-a-bout&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> a buyer the product came quick and as described, overall this family couldn’t be happier with Clyppi!</li>
            <li> I decided it was time for a decent clipper so am trying the Clyppi.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more in the future as they are now my favorites.</li>
            <li> The Clyppi uses surface features on both the lever and main body, as you can see in the photos, to aid in keeping it well gripped while trimming.  </li>
            <li> I have bought several pairs for myself (office, briefcase, car, bathroom, etc.........and plan to purchase several more as stocking stuffers.  </li>
            <li> Great for arthritic hands - even on gross thick toenails.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I didn&#x27;t read the description adequately, but they were much smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> Much better then a more expensive one I purchased from amazon that was made in Japan.</li>
            <li> Most of all, Clyppi is built to last, not be replaced constantly when it falls apart, peels, or just doesn&#x27;t get the job done anymore.</li>
            <li> The angle of the lever is a little higher, which also makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is a little larger then the cheap type, making it easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine, sharp instrument but the opening leaves too little room to get the whole top of the fingernail in.</li>
            <li> I think these clippers are high quality</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would highly recommend this Nail Clipper.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the Clyppi  nail clipper and would purchase it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had high quality nail clippers before, but lost them.  </li>
            <li> and you can tell that the craftsmanship is of HIGH QUALITY.</li>
            <li> This clipper met my high expectations.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a clipper.</li>
            <li> I also highly praise the customer service I received from Clyppi.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend them</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really am enjoying your new Clyppi and am actually considering getting several to use as gifts.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this  for my teenage son who strong, fast growing nails that constantly needs clipped for sports.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and give a very clean cut.  </li>
            <li> They are by far the nicest set of clippers I’ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> Good feel in the hands when going for those tough to get out nails.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, cut well and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is also sharp, which can clip my nails and hang nail easily.</li>
            <li> Comparing them to my other nail clippers, the metal seems nicer and probably won&#x27;t rust as easy.</li>
            <li> Time will tell how these will hold up to normal use but from my impression, it&#x27;s a confident little piece of gear.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves them and says he has finally found a clipper that is sharp, sturdy and easy to handle!</li>
            <li> Strong, sharp and sturdy.</li>
            <li> They are a high quality tool, sturdily built, and I expect these to last a long time, provided I don&#x27;t lose them :).</li>
            <li> It apparently has better leverage with the sharper blades for clean, easy cutting.  </li>
            <li> Not so great, too expensive.</li>
            <li> Wow this is just a really well made product.</li>
            <li> and they really did not do the professional cut</li>
            <li> This clipper has a wide lever that is comfortable to my fingers.</li>
            <li> So far they work very well.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t make clean snips on dry nails.  </li>
            <li> It cut my nails much easier than my old clippers.  </li>
            <li> Yes I am a women and no their not thick from abuse.  </li>
            <li> There was not a negative review to be found.</li>
            <li> well worth the extra coin.</li>
            <li> These are okay nail clippers, but it&#x27;s sorely missing the tool for cleaning under the nail.</li>
            <li> I find that the handle angle is too steep (65 degrees vs a normal 40 degrees)</li>
            <li> The clippers grip is wider than a normal pair and maybe a tad longer.</li>
            <li> It is very well made, sharp and ergonomically friendly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the extra.</li>
            <li> these kind of dishonest hurts Amazon&#x27;s reputation.  </li>
            <li> Too small to cut my nails conveniently, which to be fair, size is probably listed, but still, the pictures looked like it was the larger clipper size.</li>
            <li> , I am able to slide it down a millimeter or two with my thumb, but I am unwilling to see if it comes off completely at this time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are sharp and work well, but I really miss having a fingernail file that you can clean your fingernails out with.</li>
            <li> Cuts my nails very cleanly and with little effort.</li>
            <li> These make a quick, easy, sharp cut on dry nails.  </li>
            <li> 2-sided nail file that is large enough to be practical (and also very effective) as well as a pointed fingernail cleaner (which I personally find much less useful, but other might like).  </li>
            <li> I can even clip my nails with my left hand (I&#x27;m right handed).</li>
            <li> I have reduced strength in my right hand and could not us a regular pair of fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li> They are slightly more expensive than the cheap grocery store ones, but definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It’s so sharp (therefore, accurate) that I don’t even need to use a nail file.</li>
            <li> I have used other nail clippers and they are cheaply made .</li>
            <li> This one is sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li> I find it sharp, smooth and painless.</li>
            <li> Sharp, and does the job smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a nail clipper that is sharp, precise and durable.</li>
            <li> It’s sharp, comfortable, and effortless.  </li>
            <li> Really well built, and they both fit in your hands exactly right and are sharp enough that they effortlessly clip like no other.</li>
            <li> I recommend these clippers, and when I need new ones I will order Clyppi Fingernail Clippers again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my new Clyppi for about a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Similar in price, new kid on the block</li>
            <li> Just received my New &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months, now, and it still feels brand new.</li>
            <li> opened up my new clyppi this evening.  </li>
            <li> The new one now has a swing out</li>
            <li> I have received my new clyppi fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and very sharp.</li>
            <li> I needed very sharp and easy to use clipper.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, hold and less pressure to squeeze</li>
            <li> The design, material, and feel of the clippers are nice but the cut actually left my nails in need of a nail file (not a smooth finish cut).</li>
            <li> Like the packaging and product description too it really adds to the overall experience , I plan on buying another set or two , thanks</li>
            <li> The actual cut, it&#x27;s nice and firm...  </li>
            <li> The filing area is much sharper than you normally see on a clipper, but it is so short and so far in from the edge that it isn&#x27;t very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m counting on the stainless steel to help these maintain a clean cut and last a long time.</li>
            <li> is $26 - compared that to the $3 or 4 for the usual nail clippers I&#x27;ve bought most of my life.</li>
            <li> NO DEAD SPOTS!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I carry mine in my pocket and use it pretty regularly.  </li>
            <li> When he tried them for the first time his only words were, &amp;#34;Wow.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and have never before used a nail clipper that was this light and as sharp .</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It has actually been the first even cut my nails</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find a decent nail clipper and have tried several previously.  </li>
            <li> One of the first times using these on regular fingernails</li>
            <li> The only thing that worried me at first was whether I&#x27;d be able to put a small chain or ring in the slotted end of the handle.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> These clippers are so sharp and offer significant leverage that I don&#x27;t need to do that.  </li>
            <li> While using it just for the second time after I first bought the handle just snapped.  </li>
            <li> The first set I got had a slight manufacturing issue and the blades where not aligned quite right.  </li>
            <li> AS other reviewers have mentioned, Clyppi cuts clean without needing an emery board touch up.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and clean cuts, almost effortless.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly sharp for a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Cuts sharply and cleanly.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended - I would rate this a very his 9.25 to 9.75 out of ten</li>
            <li> Very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> The Clyppi is very sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li> Oddly, for me, they seem light.  </li>
            <li> I am disabled and have loss of coordination, this nail clipper is easy to grip and allows me to get the job done.</li>
            <li> The brushed metal looks nice, the problem is that the friction between the metal show wears quickly and initially makes it more difficult to open and twist lever back.</li>
            <li> (Though I likely will never have to purchase another pair if the initial quality impressions hold true)</li>
            <li> believe this is the first time after several years and thousands of purchases that I  feel completely ripped-off by a product sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li> They make a sharp, clean cut on my fingernails and, as just stated, no dead spots.  </li>
            <li> He liked the fact that they actually cut as most of the ones that he has tired only half cut as there was not enough spring in the clip to make a clean cut.  </li>
            <li> Funny how little things like this make live so much easier!</li>
            <li> Arrived today and snapped in half during the first use!!  </li>
            <li> When I first got it I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be powerful enough (since it looks pretty small in size)</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t have any idea how bad the cheap junk sold in most stores was!</li>
            <li> A word of caution, these things are really sharp, and will cut pretty much anything you manage to get into the opening.</li>
            <li> I suggested a slightly bigger &#x27;clip&#x27; for people like me with large fingers and nails and learned a toenail clipper is on the way.</li>
            <li> , on the smaller clipper your name in visible but there is no marking on the large clipper.  </li>
            <li> I love them, they&#x27;re exactly what I was missing in every other clipper I had tried.</li>
            <li> They are super sharp and cut my nails effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality, and should last forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various clippers to cut my tough fingernails but this product finally worked to my great satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent as much as $45 trying to find a good nail clipper (I have tough nails).  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp and leave a clean edge.</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but they are accurate.  </li>
            <li> Clearly they are not.</li>
            <li> matt stainless steel finish is classy and it didn’t slip out of my hands the way my last nail clipper did – drove me</li>
            <li> I have been using some old clippers, Wilkinson Sword brand, that I purchased in England; let us say they have lost their edge.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the Clyppi to use on my 89 year old dads toes.  </li>
            <li> look to be solid stainless steel</li>
            <li> They like it so much they are ordering the larger size as well.</li>
            <li> Much smoother and sharper than regular clippers.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what was so aggravating about using my old clippers.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps a hole near the bottom to carry on a keychain.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if I would go as far as &amp;#34;the best.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Of course, have the money afford a once a week professional manicure with cuticle nippers and of course a pedicure?  </li>
            <li> nowhere near precision cut versus the Clyppis.&lt;br /&gt;Sekis</li>
            <li> As a former cosmetologist I highly recommend  the CLYPPI!</li>
            <li> completely recommend this brand of fingernail clippers and would not hesitate purchasing again</li>
            <li> they clip well and shape my nails really well, definitely get them!!</li>
            <li> The Clyppi fingernail clipper is by far the sharpest fingernail clipper we have ever used.</li>
            <li> Received the items (2 purchased) early and used one immediately.</li>
            <li> One wouldn&#x27;t think there could be so much difference in a simple clipper</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t possibly be this much stronger.  </li>
            <li> Promptly after writing a dissatisfied review, the co-founder of the company contacted me directly to rectify the situation.  </li>
            <li> Workmanship above par, very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t break, but this far exceeded any expectation I might have had.</li>
            <li> I may be buying at least one more.</li>
            <li> They now look as if I have had a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> They do not cut as well as the old Trim nail clippers you can pickup for around $1.00 at any drugstore.</li>
            <li> Because of that I my toes looked beach ready for a recent vacation.  </li>
            <li> You see I grow natural nails.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> the only &#x27;complaint&#x27; i have is that someone from Clyppi emailed me like 3 times to find out how I liked them...............</li>
            <li> At least the Clyppi has a nice rounded back end...</li>
            <li> I have thick nails and most clippers hack them to ragged pieces.  </li>
            <li> They are thin and good enough to get me a magazine layout if I wanted--</li>
            <li> some very less expensive cutters have sleeves that go over top and botttom phalanges , this is a nice touch that I would recommend for the manufacturer</li>
            <li> Ergonomically correct (nice wide end on thumb side), sharp, and proper curvature on the blade.  </li>
            <li> The jaw design of these antiques is unique in that the cutting edge is driven more like pliers than by the cam action of yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are solid, sharp, and fit in your hand.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference from other nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Clippers are easy to use and don&#x27;t slip off your fingers like small ones</li>
            <li> worthy of all the hype, and certainly not worth the price</li>
            <li> Good quality but a little too small for a me.</li>
            <li> I read the many reviews on this and decided to invest in a high quality nail clipper but instead got a nail clipper that is even worse than the 99 cents one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid product, much better than the standard crappy ones I had previously.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Clyppi, for taking your customer service seriously. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> HOWEVER when I attempted to fold it into the original flat configuration, the handle jammed to the side on the pivot</li>
            <li> Most of the clippers I have used in the past were too short</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical that it would be any better than the brand I was using, however it did what it promised.</li>
            <li> main comment for the future is that it should come with a removable cover to catch the clippings.</li>
            <li> I have big hands, and big feet, therefore big nails, and they grow quickly.</li>
            <li> the handle broke off completely - using only normal pressure.  </li>
            <li> My judgement of this product is versus my gold standard - Revlon classic nail clipper and metal nail filer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does look and feel like a really cool little gadget</li>
            <li> The price is high for nail clippers but they will be the last you ever buy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended over the regular store bought clippers.</li>
            <li> Clyppi has a high enough handle, allowing it to provide plenty of leverage, so it does not &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; in use.</li>
            <li> These clippers are noteworthy in only one way -- their unjustifiable high price.</li>
            <li> Some of the new clippers I&#x27;ve seen recently are designed to apply the clipping force in the direction of that natural push of the clipper on the nail...</li>
            <li> I am never using a different pair of clippers again, and like a previous poster had hoped for, I also hope that a companion upsized toe nail clipper version is made available.</li>
            <li> I always put nail clippers into key chain and hook into a string, so it will not be misplaced at home, to be easily found.</li>
            <li> but it seems the options at a market or a general store were pretty limited.</li>
            <li> Personally I would have preferred a more traditional design wherein the fingernail cleaner is simply a sharp triangle at the end of the file rather than the current implementation of an angled edge -</li>
            <li> It clips cleanly, no ragged edges and quickly.</li>
            <li> I cannot stand to have long fingernails, so I cut them pretty much every other day.</li>
            <li> A new paradigm in personal care.  </li>
            <li> two days later I had a brand new pair sent to</li>
            <li> my husband puts these through hell with his claw feet and they still look new... will repurchase when my husband finally destroys these one of these days...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps mine is defective, I will send it back and maybe try a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping they stay sharp for a long time to come; if so they are worth the price!</li>
            <li> really appreciate Amazon sells such varieties of obscure products.&lt;br /&gt;Unable to actually use their products, sight</li>
            <li> I am very fussy about keeping my nails short For 40+ years I&#x27;ve owned some German clippers made by INOX.</li>
            <li> Although pretty much like every other standard nail clipper, it&#x27;s sharp and seems to be made of stainless steel (non-austenitic since it&#x27;s magnetic)...</li>
            <li> he says they are much easier to operate than some of the more expensive ones I have given him.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally strong nails that I keep a little long.  </li>
            <li> No other nail clipper comes close to this nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> No other &amp;#34;complaints&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They were sharp for the first 5-6 times I used them then they dulled out a bit.</li>
            <li> At first, I was a bit hesitant to buy it due to</li>
            <li> If they could only make a version that doesn&#x27;t make a loud clicking noise with each cut I make on my nails, I&#x27;m in cubicle land at work!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very sharp and cuts right through my fingernails with no effort.  </li>
            <li> They cut clean without any jagged edges and with very little effort.</li>
            <li> I also like the size, not too big or small, which is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, and very easy to operate because of the wide lever - so much better than those old-style clippers with the silly pointed lever.</li>
            <li> Cuts clean with little to no emery filing necessary.  </li>
            <li> I like that this product cut evenly, cleanly and with a small amount of applied pressure.  </li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp and the tiny nail file, which I dismissed as a joke, is quite useful.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my husband who has incredibly thick fingernails, figuring if these are meant for toenails they should work fine.</li>
            <li> These clippers are far better than any other clippers I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, especially for people that have difficulty using the smaller clippers.</li>
            <li> The real test, however, will be how long they last.</li>
            <li> The CLYPPI nail clippers actually do meet the expectations they built up in their product description by far.</li>
            <li> I was replacing an old clipper I have been carrying around in my travel bag for years that just about tore off my thumbnail the last time I used it.</li>
            <li> This is just a regular nail clipper; like to any old clipper one might get in supermarkets and drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing fancy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> About ten years ago, I bought my adult children each a set of the INOX clippers.</li>
            <li> was it never opened far enough.</li>
            <li> and I really like the thumb piece being wide rather than tapered.  </li>
            <li> It by far beats any of the clippers I have tried from the local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> The design of these clippers is the same old design used since the 1950&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> At first look and feel you can tell these are not your &#x27;average&#x27; nail clippers.</li>
            <li> This is far easier to use than standard devices.</li>
            <li> That is apparent just looking at them.  </li>
            <li> The wide lever and body also make it much easier to grasp,</li>
            <li> Only 1 month old.  </li>
            <li> No rough scratchy patches and</li>
            <li> As usual Amazon issued a full refund.</li>
            <li> Quite expensive for its kind.</li>
            <li> These are well made clippers with a good cutting edge.</li>
            <li> I like this, as it probably means keeping a good cutting edge longer.  </li>
            <li> So nice for my poor, arthritic hands!  </li>
            <li> Did its job cutting my nails properly which makes a pleasant change</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact I cut the nails on my left hand with my new Clyppi&#x27;s and the nails on my right hand with some ordinary ones I picked up from Riteaid.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and create a very clean cut with little pressure applied.  </li>
            <li> They are extremely durable providing a clean, sharp cut each and every time of use.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t dulled and are small enough for my nails and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> Now to not loose the nail clipper like my others.</li>
            <li> it is sturdy, sharp and stainless.  </li>
            <li> They are very well designed and sharp.  </li>
            <li> It is very well designed and executed from an ergonomic point of view and is extremely sharp as well.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t like any other clipper I&#x27;ve used and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> These are very nice/ sharp clippers.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t require as much of a  squeeze of the lever as the other clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hopeful that they will continue to perform at a high level and last an exceptionally long time...</li>
            <li> Between the brushed stainless steel, file and wide design</li>
            <li> I find these (Clyppi) to give a much smoother cut then the Seki which left my nails with a rough edge.</li>
            <li> A must buy if you are tired of cheapie drugstore clippers functioning poorly and even breaking more easily than in our parent&#x27;s times.</li>
            <li> No sharp edges that need extra clipping or filing.</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp, smooth cutting, and easy to use with no discomfort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE - I have now been using these clippers for several weeks and, although I am still happy with their precision cutting ability, I am a bit dissatisfied with the emery \\&quot;board\\&quot; because it does not extend to the edge of the lever arm but rather sits as a \\&quot;pad\\&quot; in the arm&#x27;s center.</li>
            <li> to your average drug store branded clippers, I find I absolutely *</li>
            <li> It left my fingernails ragged and sharp, and I couldn&#x27;t get a straight cut to save my life.  </li>
            <li> and yet I could not cut a thumbnail using all my strength, and only barely cut fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I like the clippers just not sure they are worth $15.</li>
            <li> the small patch of file is hardly worth having.</li>
            <li> The clippers were sharp, fit easily into the hand, and required only the slightest pressure for cutting.  </li>
            <li> , I had a tendency to clip a little too short at first.</li>
            <li> The Clyppi is easy to hold while cutting and cuts sharp and clean.</li>
            <li> I like how the material is very sturdy and very sharp.  </li>
            <li> So clean, in fact, that the nail edge is a little sharp.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them for anyone who has arthritis, neuropathy or any other issue that impedes hand function.</li>
            <li> They have a high quality feel to them and seem to be extremely well made.  </li>
            <li> He found it much easier to use, his fingers don’t slip and it takes less finger strength to make the cut.  </li>
            <li> So the most logical explanation is this nail clipper just wasn&#x27;t of high quality and is just like any other nail clipper, in this case even worse than the 99 cents, which as least lasted longer than this.  </li>
            <li> and i now have both the small and large ones of these!</li>
            <li> so more sturdy, have a 50% taller opening (making nail positioning that much easier) and are a couple of dollars less expensive (at the time of this review</li>
            <li> I really wish it had the little file/hook attachment that swiveled out</li>
            <li> Crisp, clean cutting sets these clippers apart from the crowd.  </li>
            <li> Because the Clyppi was so expensive, and had so many good reviews, I thought there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;d be as bad as the dollar emergency clippers I already had.  </li>
            <li> The only down side was that there’s no nail file with the pointy end that I normally use to remove dirt from the corners of my nails.</li>
            <li> They open wide enough to comfortably clip a couple of the nails that have a curve to them, and no more ragged edges!</li>
            <li> Sharp cut, good grip, doesn&#x27;t twist to slip while cutting (like all the others).  </li>
            <li> The file is tiny and hard to get a good rhythm, they leave my nails with sharp points because they don&#x27;t have a wide enough arch and are too small for my toes.</li>
            <li> Previous clippers get dull after about 6 months; these are such  fine metal</li>
            <li> Cutting a nail with Clyppi feels almost effortless, and the lever does not give the sensation that it is digging into the pieces it pushes on, and the brushed coating only shows minor points of wear at the edges after a week&#x27;s use catching up for the absence of its predecessor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> again a relief as I have very large hands and thick</li>
            <li> Frustrated with my normal nail clippers one day, I looked on amazon and sure enough their is the solution to my problem.</li>
            <li> I have a 30 year old clipper made in Germany by J. A. Henckels that I measure all other cutters by.</li>
            <li> However, their performance is not good enough to merit the high price for such a small device that doesn&#x27;t have anything special about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them a few times since purchase and the quality is obvious and much higher than the products sold in walmart and other local stores.</li>
            <li> Came apart after a little over a year which is better than any other pair of nail clippers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> In Hawaii that usually means it rusts more slowly.  </li>
            <li> but I wish that there would have been a leather case that holds both small and large clippers.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and cuts nails very thoroughly and efficiently with no snags or rough edges.  </li>
            <li> It requires very little pressure to readily cut the nail.</li>
            <li> Typically, I will only cut my nails after a shower while my nails are still soft.  </li>
            <li> I have some nerve damage from a broken wrist but the clippers made it easy to clip my nails with minimal pressure.</li>
            <li> I like the small rectangular stainless steel area for filing nails.</li>
            <li> Now that the handle jam issue is off the table, this device will be a long lasting appliance.     </li>
            <li> It will last a long time...</li>
            <li> Time will tell as to how long they last.  </li>
            <li> have purchased different kinds before from large department stores and drug stores , they were either hard to use or will pull while clipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In use, the Clyppi cut through my somewhat tough nails with far less effort than standard clippers, so much so that I barely had any discomfort using my ailing left thumb.  </li>
            <li> I think they will last a really long time!  </li>
            <li> smaller and more expensive than other options,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After ordering, I found that the company that made this is very passionate about their product and Amazon, so I&#x27;m actually writing a review of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 11 year old who has trouble with our regular nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> Not as heavy duty as I expected and don&#x27;t expect much from the built in file.</li>
            <li> Was a little unsure about paying this much for a finger nail clipper, but was amazed at how sharp it is.  </li>
            <li> and I was suddenly aware of the years and years of using cheap, poorly designed and poorly made clippers.</li>
            <li> Of course, the usual clippers didn&#x27;t work very well, or of for that matter, work very long before they break.</li>
            <li> while i&#x27;ve only used them once, it only took one time of use to understand the difference between these any any other cheapo clippers from Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> Your product cuts as well and a little easier than the old pair.</li>
            <li> Really neat little clippers!!</li>
            <li> Most nail clippers crack my fingernails as they&#x27;re cutting, so I have to try to cut away</li>
            <li> For me the cutting edge needed to be a bit more curved</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wide enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it will slip out of your hand.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> once I return to the States.&lt;br /&gt;- four star rating and not five because I haven&#x27;t used them over a long period of time...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like buying any tool ---&amp;#62; The way these are made compares to chromed pot metal clippers makes me think these are gonna be around for a long time.</li>
            <li> I should be using it often and, hopefully, for a long time.</li>
            <li> These did not come for so long I reordered.  </li>
            <li> it was smaller than I expected....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unmarked on where it is manufactured which&lt;br /&gt;I found strange.  </li>
            <li> But, it isn&#x27;t just the Clyppi, but it seems all Fingernail clippers, the mouths don&#x27;t seem to be wide enough for me to insert my nail...  </li>
            <li> There are no jagged or sharp edges left after trimming, each uses gives a clean, even cutting and the results after the first few uses have been pleasing.</li>
            <li> Extra sharp clipping edges slice right through my tough nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We were looking for some fingernail clippers that were sharp and easy to handle, as the cheaper variety were too small and usually dull.  </li>
            <li> the nail file Is much nicer than the nasty ones on most such clippers, but it is located in a place that frankly baffles me; i cannot see how one could possibly use it with the angle at which it is mounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super sharp on my tough as nails nails.</li>
            <li> they have a lifetime warranty and the people behind this product care about customer service ( They even sent me a personal email to make certain</li>
            <li> Reasonably sharp but no discernable advantage over the standard clippers.  </li>
            <li> They are definitely more expensive than your average store-bought model, though I expected premium performance to coincide with the price.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this clipper and at same time I ordered a Seki clipper which also cut well and were sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a bit pricey and at this price I do wish they came with a simple case or cover to protect them and keep them sharp.</li>
            <li> When others cheapo failed it&#x27;s time to spend a little more.</li>
            <li> These are unlike any other clippers I&#x27;ve used- very solid</li>
            <li> Very solidly made and sharp.  </li>
            <li> We have no problems with those other than the women in our house constantly misplace clippers.</li>
            <li> Of course, It as well as other things are LIKELY to be user error...</li>
            <li> I purchased 5 different brands and compared them with each other and the ones I already owned.</li>
            <li> Finally a pair of sharp clippers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid and sharp.</li>
            <li> They actually have some weight to them due to the thickness of the steel.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had these a long time ago!  </li>
            <li> Compared to any other nail clippers I&#x27;ve used, Clyppi requires far less force to clip through a nail.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are expensive, for nail clippers, but god damn to they make a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to older folks with delicate skin as well as mom&#x27;s for their kids.  </li>
            <li> I hate to admit it, but I bought these to clip my cats&#x27; claws because what was available locally went dull too quickly.</li>
            <li> you barely have to push it down!</li>
            <li> Bought this one, AND its true, With this nail clipper, cuts so perfectly, no need to file the nail afterwards.  </li>
            <li> but I was so disappointed in the nail clippers I had been using that I decided to run my own test.</li>
            <li> 5/8&amp;#34; wide for the cutter and the length of the clipper is 3 1/4&amp;#34; long.  </li>
            <li> it is nice to have the greater leverage that they supply for tough nails, but the design just doesn&#x27;t work for me, making it difficult to manipulate them And to see what i&#x27;m cutting.</li>
            <li> Due to basal joint arthritis in both thumbs, with left thumb being far worse making trimming my nails on the right hand a very painful experience with even the sharpest drugstore clippers I have found, I went shopping for a better nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> Clyppi is a high quality product, the cutting edge is very sharp, and the clippers are just the right size.</li>
            <li> Especially when I was clipping my dominant hand (holding the clippers with my other hand) - most clippers are painful for me to use like that.  </li>
            <li> And they are wider than ordinary nail clippers, which could be good or bad.  </li>
            <li> They cut well, but are smaller than my previous clippers I was trying to replace.</li>
            <li> I think it’s because it is so small but has such a big attitude!  </li>
            <li> The lever is easy to rotate into the cutting position, yet is tight enough to stay put when pocket</li>
            <li> must* file my fingernails after using Clyppi clippers, as they are left with a very sharp, rough edge after being trimmed.  </li>
            <li> These are expensive (for nail clippers) but they are very precise, sharp and the small nail file that is built into the handle works like a champ.  </li>
            <li> I refer to my fingers, stiff with arthritis, slow in almost everything except growing fingernails long and fast.</li>
            <li> I think these clippers should be a little larger for men&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> That tiny little nail file inserted into the handle just doesn&#x27;t do it for me -</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re all use to, but I wish they were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> My old clipper was getting dull, so grabbed this off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Well I can’t believe how they fit my hand and feel when cutting.  </li>
            <li> I think this clipper is money well spent.</li>
            <li> Minimal filing.</li>
            <li> - the ONLY drawback is that they&#x27;re not cheap.</li>
            <li> They work as expected.</li>
            <li> (I was going through the regular store ones a few times a year...</li>
            <li> Does not leave rough edges on nails</li>
            <li> For the price I expected something hardy, but these are skimpy.</li>
            <li> After owning them for only a few days, there appears to already be scuff marks where the metal of the lever meets the metal of the clippers.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful in trimming your nails with these precision cutters, you don&#x27;t even need a file, but there is one onboard if you need it.</li>
            <li> all the&lt;br /&gt;cracked parts as I&#x27;m finishing up each finger (and it never really works).</li>
            <li> I spent hours with Amazon catalogs, then ordered a Clyppi.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t say that these are worth the money, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> They seem to cut closer than I expected, but I learned how to use them &amp; they work well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few years ago when it did not have a fold out nail cleaner/file and wrote the following review:  &amp;</li>
            <li> post back after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> if the file could swing out while the clipper is in the closed position, thereby making it a bit easier to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few different brand nail clippers in the stores and</li>
            <li> Nothing more irritating than a jagged or broken nail and not have a quality device to correct things.</li>
            <li> In the past it seemed like the little ones that you see everywhere were almost impossible to get a good grip on.</li>
            <li> For all you know, you&#x27;re buying a $15.00 Chinese product that should be less then $3.00 at a drug store!</li>
            <li> The only thing that kept them from being 5 stars is that I find the space for my nails between the blades to be a little tighter than I&#x27;ve had on other clippers.</li>
            <li> I was a little more cautious cutting my nails because you can tell when you set the clippers to the ends of your fingers that it feels a little different than the typical pair of nail clippers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly no expert on metals though</li>
            <li> sharp and cutting edge is smooth.</li>
            <li> Too small hard to handle with my large hands</li>
            <li> Cutting through my nails is clean, with absolutely no tearing.</li>
            <li> Cuts sharply without leaving rough edges.</li>
            <li> My old pair were very small at one end and used to hurt my fingers when I squeezed them together.  </li>
            <li> Despite the fact that they&#x27;ve become a mite dull from abuse over the years, they still cut well, but they&#x27;re too small and the ergonomics aren&#x27;t very well suited for for my aging hands.  </li>
            <li> It does a clean job cutting my nails, doesn&#x27;t leave any jagged edges</li>
            <li> Clean cutting, doesn’t leave jagged nail edges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible for the lever to fall out of alignment with the pin that attaches it to the base, but only when the lever is flipped over in a very particular way (i.e. when the lever is inverted prior to storage of the clipper).</li>
            <li> I bought Seiki nail clippers from Amazon back in 2011 and was somewhat disappointed that they did not cut as cleanly as I had expected.</li>
            <li> Not only that but very little effort is required to cut through the sturdiest of nails.</li>
            <li> But I paid just short of $15 - still not cheap but a lot less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally sick of buying brand new, right out of the package nail clippers with dead spots.  </li>
            <li> The edge of the Clyppi was so sharp I didn&#x27;t need to file my nails after trimming, which I almost always have to with others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Quality made and sharp</li>
            <li> Clyppi is noted to be sharp -</li>
            <li> They are well made, and sharp as heck.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s unwieldy, especially for someone with small hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned anything other than drug store nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bend the nail or flex like practically every other nail clipper out there.  </li>
            <li> Cuts smoother than any other clipper I have ever used.</li>
            <li> then other&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Usually, they don&#x27;t cut well because the clipping edges don&#x27;t line up and meet properly</li>
            <li> I gave the other one I ordered to my wife and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> It does the job but such a small area makes it a chore</li>
            <li> Sharp and cut well.</li>
            <li> Since time is short I usually do my nails and toes at home.</li>
            <li> ; satisfactorily sharp</li>
            <li> The steel is still sharp after all these years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to trim your cuticles with these as they&#x27;re so sharp, you can cut yourself without even noticing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL</li>
            <li> one is extremely sharp, does not pull.</li>
            <li> Too small for my larger fingers.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and cut well.</li>
            <li> Although it is counterintuitive, I&#x27;m also finding that the clipper is too sharp.  </li>
            <li> The sharp edge catches on the underside of the nail when I&#x27;m trying to insert it or re-position it.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are well made and sharp.</li>
            <li> Add to it that I have never had clippers this sharp.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this retailer and product to other.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and cut with ease.</li>
            <li> They are as sharp as a Seki Edge</li>
            <li> With other nail clippers there was always some roughness after the job was done.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other clippers, it stays put in my hands when I&#x27;m using it, meaning it does not slip and slide in my fingers.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of the cheap nail clippers &amp; especially of how difficult they were to grip.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend a clyppi for any one need a sharp fingernail clipper.</li>
            <li> Having had reconstructive thumb surgery on one hand and ulnar nerve and carple tunnel release on the other hand I have some strength issues in my thumbs,.</li>
            <li> I just threw all my other finger nail clippers in the trash.</li>
            <li> They have stayed sharp and cut well, have owned them for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s substantial and sharp.  </li>
            <li> They are precision sharp nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> This clipper is sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and doesn&#x27;t leave your nails sharp or with rough edges.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> It can be fixed by popping the lever back into alignment, but this is rather difficult to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Physical examination of the Clyppi shows that is 100% brushed stainless steel construction with the sharpest cutting edge of any clippers I have when viewed under 30X magnification.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of the drug store brands that are never sharp for very long.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrific, Stainless Steel, very sharp cutting.</li>
            <li> I was really looking for quality clippers as I found the other ones were difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The angle between the base and the lever is greater than that of any other clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no mechanism to hold the lever in place when the trimmers are closed as seen on other clippers, meaning the lever is never securely in place.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> There is certainly nothing wrong with these clippers.</li>
            <li> It takes so little effort, have to be careful where you place the clipper on your nail</li>
            <li> It is very sharp, perhaps too sharp.  </li>
            <li> The only problem we encountered was the size of the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; on the fingernail clippers:  it was just a little small for his thumbnail, so he uses the toenail clippers for his thumb.  </li>
            <li> I have arthritis in may hands making it hard to hold traditional clippers.</li>
            <li> My regular drug store fingernail clipper was getting dull</li>
            <li> file area is tiny, and hard to access,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> chipped and damaged and hard to hold - had to take it back-</li>
            <li> Not worth buying at all...</li>
            <li> These are average clipper therefore over priced.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the toe nails out, my fingernails are probably tougher and shaped funkier than the average fingernail...  </li>
            <li> Their quality is average.  </li>
            <li> I like to keep my finger nails short and trim them at least once a week.</li>
            <li> If forced to suggest an improvement, I guess I&#x27;d say to add an extra fingernail cleaner blade with an integrated nail file.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few different brands at the local stores, All of them were poor quality.  </li>
            <li> The longer base gives you more leverage to clip with and the clipper stays put in your hand.</li>
            <li> They are durable and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the finish peeling, flaking, rusting or otherwise breaking down.</li>
            <li> My thumb tends to slide down the lever because of the angle.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and it is sharp!</li>
            <li> Hide them because other family members will want to steal them!</li>
            <li> I like the sharp cut!</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and ergonomic.</li>
            <li> The file is very small but works well enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> Very sharp clipper.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very sharp tho</li>
            <li> Very sharp cutters.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, leaves no jagged edges.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t make my fingernails peel, which is a typical concern for me.</li>
            <li> less than 10 times the handle snapped.  </li>
            <li> maybe half that max.</li>
            <li> I keep them hidden</li>
            <li> You have to learn a technique of continuing a cut as you start in or you will end up with a slight jagged edge.  </li>
            <li> They are slightly heavier (32 grams vs. 25 grams)</li>
            <li> He said they are hidden from anyone finding them because they will be gone.</li>
            <li> I had an expensive nail clipper that was made in France and marketed by a high priced knife company, which I used for years, even though it hurt my finger and thumb every time I pressed to clip a nail.</li>
            <li> I was tired of purchasing nail clippers from the market that barely work</li>
            <li> Very sharp and made from heavy duty materials.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; m currently going through cancer treatments, so my hands are particularly weak.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, nicel little clipper.</li>
            <li> On other clippers, there is usually a nail file.  </li>
            <li> The nail file is a little inaccessible, but I don&#x27;t use it for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> I searched online and didn&#x27;t find any kits, so I purchased these separately, the price separately was a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I have had the worst luck with fingernail clippers, but my husband and I both love these!</li>
            <li> They clip easily - little pressure needed - and as a bonus, evenly.</li>
            <li> A little pricey.</li>
            <li> Sharp and small.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a little carrying pouch for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little notch indentation,</li>
            <li> but I have a little sapphire nail file I keep in the house for that purpose and besides</li>
            <li> Used a little oil and helps.</li>
            <li> The file, when I can actually hit the small area with my nail, works well to fix the sharp points the clippers leave behind, and the clippers cut through nails like butter.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d pony up the extra money and try something decent, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Study and sharp!!</li>
            <li> where bigger than expected and the file part is useless</li>
            <li> You really 100% don&#x27;t have to file your nails after cutting.</li>
            <li> Predictable in how it cuts as well.</li>
            <li> Oh.....I tired to send an email to the address on the package and it bounced back.  </li>
            <li> Handle broke off after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money,terrible clippers.</li>
            <li> What I have trouble with - and the reason for 3 stars....</li>
            <li> I suspect there will be a few pairs of Clyppis in Christmas stockings this year.</li>
            <li> Read my full review here: [...]</li>
            <li> I never knew what I was missing out on until I used these.</li>
            <li> After using this clipper for a few months, I have come to the conclusion that they are &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> No jagged nails left behind.  </li>
            <li> I have been using nail clippers from the department store, and now I realize what I’ve been missing.  </li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble clipping my finger nails as I suffer from peripheral naropathy.</li>
            <li> Also, the fairly narrow lever on my clippers hurt my fingers when I applied pressure.</li>
            <li> Got these a few months ago and they work well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $5 on something that&#x27;s junk and just going to break.</li>
            <li> My wife and I were tired of the drugstore clippers that never seemed to feel solid in the hand or cut that well and often seemed to come apart.  </li>
            <li> As a guy with large hands, typical clippers are about 1 inch long and the bane of my existence as a necessary evil.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp!</li>
            <li> Well made and very sharp !</li>
            <li> Fingernail clippers cuts clean and fits well in hand, a little disappointed in the small area for the nail file.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly wider than what I&#x27;ve used in the past, making it easier on me.</li>
            <li> I have already hidden them from everyone else in the house!</li>
            <li> all jagged and sharp, hardly any filing needed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a diabetic for 40 years, so I have to be very careful with products used in dealing with the delicate skin of the hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> After cutting with these I barely have to take a file and even off any rough edges they trim that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt; that I need to tame to do my journey&lt;</li>
            <li> that just because something is expensive doesn&#x27;t mean that it is high quality.</li>
            <li> The Clyppi Fingernail Clippers are a little longer and wider than the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a nail clipper that would be easier to use than the little ones that I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate cheap clippers that bend, don&#x27;t cut well and are hard to hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The standard drugstore-type clippers are clumsy and poorly made.  </li>
            <li> I feel this makes use of the file a bit more awkward to avoid cutting oneself with the pointed angled edge.  </li>
            <li> She is 90 and was having a hard time trimming her nails with her little cheapy nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> File is small and not very effective.  </li>
            <li> Thought I would take a chance on an expensive pair of clippers, since I have no doubt spent 5 times this on other devices.</li>
            <li> Anyway, solidly made and sharp cutting edge.</li>
            <li> This means I have very little feeling in my hands.</li>
            <li> When this happens, the lever gets jammed and the clipper is essentially broken.</li>
            <li> My one quibble is that the blades are too small for toe nails.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s the material they are made out of or the design or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and maybe it&#x27;s just how my fingers are, but it&#x27;s difficult to cut my fingernails nails SHORT -</li>
            <li> On the third use the handle broke off making them useless.</li>
            <li> No more mashed fingernails in my house.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slip when cutting like my old clippers used to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure why they did that?  </li>
            <li> No more raggedy edges or split nails.  </li>
            <li> I am a diabetic, and being so, small tears and cuts into my nail bed can lead to unwanted infections.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with keeping my fingernails short.</li>
            <li> No more sock snags no more glove snags in the winter time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the purpose of the raised area where your thumb sits since it doesn&#x27;t add an anti-slide feature.  </li>
            <li> They are helpful for me when clipping nails on my small kids.  </li>
            <li> None of the clippers I have used in the past comes even close in comparison.</li>
            <li> In its current configuration it is essentially useless for filing nails unless the nails extend beyond the end of the finger.</li>
            <li> So, I usually use toe nail clippers for EVERYTHING....</li>
            <li> Also, the &amp;#34;nail file&amp;#34; is so small</li>
            <li> This is a bit small for my liking.</li>
            <li> There are, as others have written, no better clipper on the market today; and believe me I think I have tried them all.  </li>
            <li> Wimpy small filing area</li>
            <li> One smart design feature is the cutting edges get substantially closer together when you fold the lever down for storage, which both protects the edges from getting dulled by coins or keys in pants pockets, etc., and reduces the likelihood of the edges cutting or scratching other things (like pants pockets) inadvertently.</li>
            <li> So far I like the wide clipper lever and wider base.</li>
            <li> either the lever would break off or they would dull quicky due to my tough nails)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have small hands, &amp; feet, &amp; have a hard time with nail clippers.</li>
            <li> too small and too hard to operated</li>
            <li> I never thought I would care about fingernail clippers, but I got tired of just smashing my fingernails down each time I trimmed them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The are a little tough to hold onto, at times.  </li>
            <li> so I can keep one at the office and one in my travel kit, because if I have just one, Ill probably loose</li>
            <li> However, the finish is rough, with unpleasantly textured surfaces, and sharp edges.</li>
            <li> In the meantime I can hardly recommend this product for the reason stated.    </li>
            <li> matte finish doesn&#x27;t allow for any slippage even when squeezing hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been long frustrated at the trend of declining quality in other nail clippers I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I have has a mushy, dull cut and</li>
            <li> Dull, dull clippers.  </li>
            <li> Hardly went through my nail.  </li>
            <li> the cutter halves aren&#x27;t going to shift around during a hard clip like some of the cheapo brands do.  </li>
            <li> I’ve purchased several other cheapies at the checkout aisle and have been disappointed every time.  </li>
            <li> Keegan offered me a precision instrument to cut through the tangle of hard as nails&lt;</li>
            <li> Other clippers I&#x27;ve used seem to crush down on the nail before finally cutting it, making for a ragged cut.  </li>
            <li> I have thick toenails that are hard to cut.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old clipper was till I used the clyppi.</li>
            <li> is not what I expected from an expensive nail</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not loving it.  </li>
            <li> i find these clumsy to use.</li>
            <li> Below you will find a rather scathing one star review I recently wrote.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kinda awkward to hold actually.</li>
            <li> Cutting edge misaligned (perhaps mine is defective - sending it back - off about 1/5mm</li>
            <li> - the measure is how well does the firm stand behind the product?</li>
            <li> My nails aren&#x27;t abnormally thick</li>
            <li> Alas, I lost or misplaced it</li>
            <li> It cuts quicky and requires very little pressure!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed - something sharp with some leverage for ease-of-use because I have weakness and numbness in one hand which was making things rather difficult.</li>
            <li> He used to have to take a shower before clipping his nails to make them softer - no more!</li>
            <li> The sharp cutting edges also mean very little pressure is needed, a relief since I have the beginnings of arthritis in my thumb joints.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very small.  </li>
            <li> I had several fingernail clippers, but pressing the levers had become painful and hard to control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost some strength in my hands and it made clipping my fingernails with a regular drug store nail clipper nearly impossible.  </li>
            <li> Seriously you have a winner here.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, $15 for nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying nail clippers only to have them split my nails or fall awkwardly out of my hand during use.  </li>
            <li> neat thing for me is that it nearly impossible to cut them too short by mistake.  </li>
            <li> They seriously work that well.</li>
            <li> I suffer from limited finger movement pared with numb fingers that don’t seem to always go where I want them too.</li>
            <li> It needs to be wider till the edges and little bit longer as filing the edges of nail is bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I do not have particularity thick or tough nails</li>
            <li> There its nothing worse than dull clippers.  </li>
            <li> Also, ergonomically they are not good for me.</li>
            <li> Plus, they are crazy sharp.</li>
            <li> and/or the handle levers are weak and can&#x27;t provide sufficient force to cut.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the B-holes who are for some reason being negative!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed and currently does not find value (cost vs benefit).</li>
            <li> pros,&lt;br /&gt;they do cut tough nails with ease</li>
            <li> I have fairly tough nails.</li>
            <li> have nails tough as nails.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because I had two surgery because of not clean cutting in the corner of the nails,this seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> This made clipping the the nails on the other hand almost impossible.  </li>
            <li> I have been frustrated with the quality of nail clippers in US stores, I shop at the military exchanges as well.</li>
            <li> The emery board embedded in the lever is poorly placed.</li>
            <li> The seller e-mail and mailed me asking for a review which really annoyed me that I bought their product but did not give them permission to spam me.</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying the cheapo clippers at drug stores.</li>
            <li> Purchased July 7.&#x60;14 broken yesterday, not 3 months .</li>
            <li> Poor manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> – nail clippers usually make me crazy cutting half way through my nails and leaving them jagged so that they get caught in everything!</li>
            <li> After buying several at the drug store that just dont work, and then purchasing a very expensive pair from brookstone, where the cutting edges dont stay aligned when you apply pressure to make the cut, I started looking at reviews online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The edges line up beautifully (no ripping or tearing 😊)</li>
            <li> Clyppi has a wider base and the grooves helps to keep my fingers from slipping.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad pair, but this isn&#x27;t a complex machine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the dollar store, but have to concede that one of the worst products I ever got there was a nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> I understand that anything mechanical can fail</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I was a bit wary but that was put to rest when I received my Clyppis.  </li>
            <li> The clippers work, but are to expensive for what they are.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Bit expensive but its well made</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands and have been unable to find a clipper that does not hurt to use.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Give it a try; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Some are almost useless.</li>
            <li> - these are the worst (hands-down) clippers I have ever owned - even the generic grocery store brand</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s virtually useless.  </li>
            <li> never equalled, and now unfortunately junk.</li>
            <li> so getting them around a curved nail is difficult.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, some of those are either *</li>
            <li> Although a bit expensive</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> but I have a difficult time using them.</li>
            <li> how lousy my clippers were.  </li>
            <li> So, again I apologize and thank you for proving me wrong.</li>
            <li> Because of this my nails feel really weird and undesirable.</li>
            <li> I have very hard toe nails that usually look horrible after trimming.  </li>
            <li> If you buy them and do become unhappy with them, they have a LIFETIME GUARENTEE, so how can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> Alas, both disappointed me.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it would be a terrible slight if I did not mention the Clippy customer support.  </li>
            <li> This makes it slightly awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> Handle snapped off cutting fingernails - not a strenuous task!.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> handle broke off while cutting fingernail</li>
            <li> This requires some finesse to avoid clipping your skin while trying to file your nails after cutting and makes the thing awkward to hold while doing so.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Cutting edges of his brand&#x27;s clyppi.....</li>
            <li> They are awkward to hold.  </li>
            <li> They are awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Because of that, I&#x27;ve lost a lot of strength and function in my fingers, and clipping my nails has been nearly impossible.  </li>
            <li> bad quality.</li>
            <li> was also disappointed to find out that this was made in China.</li>
            <li> Recieved e-mails to rate this item as 5 stars :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this nail clipper.</li>
            <li> This is probably the cleanest cutting clipper I have used to date!  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I wasn’t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The hunt continues ... :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> and it was a piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> put crap out on the market.  </li>
            <li> At worst, they squash the nail apart rather than cutting.  </li>
            <li> I hate, hate, hate, crappy nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how awful drug store clippers are until you use these.</li>
            <li> Clyppi is having a bad day I guess!!</li>
            <li> I hate when they cut but not all the way through and the nail hangs on!!!!  </li>
            <li> Terrible product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I did try out my Clyppi nail clipper and am pleased that it cuts sharply and easily.  I bought two more sets to give as Christmas gifts.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Pretty happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t find it 3 times better than ones sold in drug stores for 3-5 bucks though.&lt;br /&gt;Its well made and does its job perfectly, but could be a little cheaper</li>
            <li> Great clipper. Sharp, precise, and comfortable. What else need be said?</li>
            <li> Worked great in the beginning but dulled rather fast</li>
            <li> Best clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Super high quality material.  Not a lot of effort required to cut.  Predictable in how it cuts as well.</li>
            <li> It is the best nail clipper I ever have, but it will be perfect if it has a hole to attach to a key chain. I always put nail clippers into key chain and hook into a string, so it will not be misplaced at home, to be easily found.</li>
            <li> Clyppi Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper really is the ultra cool precision tool. The Clyppi fingernail clippers exceeds my expectations with both function and style. Made of stainless steel, the trimmers are manufactured with quality metal. They are durable and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the finish peeling, flaking, rusting or otherwise breaking down. The edge of the Clyppi was so sharp I didn&#x27;t need to file my nails after trimming, which I almost always have to with others I&#x27;ve used. It also didn&#x27;t make my fingernails peel, which is a typical concern for me. The placement of the built-in file is perfect and provides extra grip at the tip of my thumb. Between the brushed stainless steel, file and wide design I felt so confident using the Clyppi fingernail trimmers I was able to use them on my toddler as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.</li>
            <li> glass smooth, perfectly aligned, and cuts like a million bucks. I had to look awhile, but the other nice thing about this one is that it has a nail file, too.</li>
            <li> Clippi clippers are efficient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Too small hard to handle with my large hands</li>
            <li> Love these clippers. I have small hands, &amp; feet, &amp; have a hard time with nail clippers. I can even clip my nails with my left hand (I&#x27;m right handed). I&#x27; m currently going through cancer treatments, so my hands are particularly weak. Very happy with the way this clipper performs.</li>
            <li> where bigger than expected and the file part is useless</li>
            <li> I love the Clyppi nail clipper.  I&#x27;ve lost some strength in my hands and it made clipping my fingernails with a regular drug store nail clipper nearly impossible.  The Clyppi works great!  It apparently has better leverage with the sharper blades for clean, easy cutting.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> Great product, Clean cuts and easy to use with the wide satin finish &amp;#34;presser&amp;#34; handle. A tool for cleaning finger nails would add to the Clyppi&#x27;s usefulness, but 5 stars for Clyppi as is.</li>
            <li> Best fingernail clippers ever!  Sharp, strong, and excellent quality and very user friendly.</li>
            <li> We love these clippers!  I bought these plus the toenail clippers size for my husband&#x27;s Christmas stocking.  They are easy to use; make a quick crisp cut; and are actually attractive.  The only problem we encountered was the size of the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; on the fingernail clippers:  it was just a little small for his thumbnail, so he uses the toenail clippers for his thumb.  As you can see, you&#x27;ll just have to buy both pairs like I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many pairs of nail clippers over the years, and Clyppi is much higher quality than any of them. That being said, Clyppi still has some issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Compared to any other nail clippers I&#x27;ve used, Clyppi requires far less force to clip through a nail. This is the best thing about Clyppi.&lt;br /&gt;- The blades are very sharp. They don&#x27;t show any signs of dulling after clipping all fingernails and toenails ~10 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The angle between the base and the lever is greater than that of any other clippers I&#x27;ve used. This makes it slightly awkward to hold. My thumb tends to slide down the lever because of the angle.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s possible for the lever to fall out of alignment with the pin that attaches it to the base, but only when the lever is flipped over in a very particular way (i.e. when the lever is inverted prior to storage of the clipper). When this happens, the lever gets jammed and the clipper is essentially broken. It can be fixed by popping the lever back into alignment, but this is rather difficult to do. (Suggestion to whoever designed Clyppi: make the hole in the lever fit more snugly with the pin.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received my Clyppi and I love it! After a pair I dearly loved and had for&lt;br /&gt;years finally broke, I had been unable to find any clippers that I liked, even&lt;br /&gt;big brand names. SInce I was pretty devasted to lose my favorite pair (and I&lt;br /&gt;complained a bit), my wonderful husband decided to Google &amp;#34;best clippers in the&lt;br /&gt;world&amp;#34;, these came up. There was not a negative review to be found. He was sold&lt;br /&gt;and ordered them from Amazon. They&#x27;re extremely sturdy and well-made, they cut&lt;br /&gt;cleanly, and I love the idea of the file being on the top instead of a slide out&lt;br /&gt;piece. I never used those anyway. Finally, I decided to respond because I love&lt;br /&gt;the idea of supporting people who develop a great product rather than big&lt;br /&gt;corporations. Your personalized emails are most impressive and appreciated. Keep&lt;br /&gt;up the great work!! Make more items :)</li>
            <li> Nice little clipper, clips well when used by either hand.</li>
            <li> Cut fingers and toes very nicely. Great product</li>
            <li> Great fingernail clipper. Outstanding construction.</li>
            <li> These clippers work fabulously, and they feel nice in my hand.  Very pleased.  All of my crummy Revlon clippers are going right in the trash, where they belong.</li>
            <li> I think this clipper is money well spent. I like the non-slip material and the thumb area gives it a secure feel. It&#x27;s wide enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it will slip out of your hand. I was tired of the drug store brands that are never sharp for very long.</li>
            <li> The clippers are working well.  Seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> I am disabled and have loss of coordination, this nail clipper is easy to grip and allows me to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Really good nail clippers, they cut easily and smoothly. No need to even use the filer.</li>
            <li> 1000 times better than anything I can purchase at drug or grocery store. Clean cuts. Minimal filing. Great product.</li>
            <li> Clyppi nail clippers are the best clippers! You don&#x27;t realize how awful drug store clippers are until you use these. They cut clean without any jagged edges and with very little effort. The price is high for nail clippers but they will be the last you ever buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the dollar store, but have to concede that one of the worst products I ever got there was a nail clipper.  It was so flimsy that the lever would pop off if you didn&#x27;t center it perfectly.  So when we were offered this product for review we gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the sturdiest and shrarpest clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  My one quibble is that the blades are too small for toe nails.</li>
            <li> Thought I would take a chance on an expensive pair of clippers, since I have no doubt spent 5 times this on other devices. I suffer from limited finger movement pared with numb fingers that don’t seem to always go where I want them too. So far I like the wide clipper lever and wider base. They seemed well designed so I thanks you for that.</li>
            <li> did receive the Clyppi nail clippers, tried them and am very satisfied with the results. I have been using some old clippers, Wilkinson Sword brand, that I purchased in England; let us say they have lost their edge. Your clippers seem to cut my nails without splintering them.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  The company contacted me and promptly sent a replacement.  I understand that anything mechanical can fail - the measure is how well does the firm stand behind the product? In this case the replacement is superb - best nail clipper I have ever used. Now that the handle jam issue is off the table, this device will be a long lasting appliance.     ORIGINAL REVIEW  While the materials, design and concept are undeniable superb, the engineering could use a second look.  I used it once - did a nice job of precisely trimming my nails as advertised.  HOWEVER when I attempted to fold it into the original flat configuration, the handle jammed to the side on the pivot and I have repeatedly tried to re-engage into the correct centered position.  I have written to Clyppi and we will see how they respond. In the meantime I can hardly recommend this product for the reason stated.    Oh.....I tired to send an email to the address on the package and it bounced back.  Go figure. Clyppi is having a bad day I guess!!</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are very sharp and work great. Only they are slippery. Had to put some shrink tubing on the lever to keep the Mrs. happy.</li>
            <li> Quality made and sharp</li>
            <li> Great product.  Sturdy and powerful.  It also has a scraper on the top half to remove unwanted edges in freshly cut nails.  Very great feedback as well and customer response.  Really serious and dedicated to create the best finger nail clipper, I&#x27;d say they are there already.</li>
            <li> Works well, well made sturdy</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is designed to do.  Clips right through nails and definitely better than the run of the mill ones.</li>
            <li> Terrific product and works fine.  There&#x27;s a nail file surface on the clipper handle, but I wish it had a separate file, or pointed edge somewhere for under finger nail mainentance.  Very high quality, and should last forever.</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers ever.  That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I love and I mean love those Clyppi nail clippers.  They do not slide out of your hand even your non dominant hand.  I am not sure if it&#x27;s the material they are made out of or the design or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I bought them on a whim because I needed something on Amazon to put me over $25 to have something else included in shipping but now I&#x27;m ordering more Clyppi nail clippers for family.  Seriously you have a winner here.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  Reasonably sharp but no discernable advantage over the standard clippers.  No design improvement.  File is small and not very effective.  Handle broke off after a few uses.  I really don&#x27;t understand all the superlative reviews -- at it&#x27;s best, before breaking, there was nothing about these nail clippers to deserve the superlatives or the steep price.</li>
            <li> great clippers that only need an extension piece to clean under your nails...</li>
            <li> Best clippers I have ever had-including zwilling from Germany</li>
            <li> I had ordered the Clyppi to use on my 89 year old dads toes.  Today was the first time I had used them as I gave them for Christmas.  They are amazing!  Absolutely loved them!  They are shaped so I was able to lift the nail to clip it and so easy to use.  Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great pair of clippers used them as soon as I received them didn&#x27;t leave my nails all jagged and sharp, hardly any filing needed these are great so fare</li>
            <li> Works great.  Worth the price given it is sturdy, sharp and stainless.  In Hawaii that usually means it rusts more slowly.  Good product, clever packaging.  I hope you sell a lot of them!</li>
            <li> Very good quality,the best that I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I really believe this is the best nail clipper I have ever owned!    Of course that comes with a price - list price is $26 - compared that to the $3 or 4 for the usual nail clippers I&#x27;ve bought most of my life. But I paid just short of $15 - still not cheap but a lot less. Of course, the usual clippers didn&#x27;t work very well, or of for that matter, work very long before they break. The Clyppi&#x27;s are guaranteed for **LIFE**!!!    Now all I have to do is not lose them - LOL!!    I&#x27;ve already ordered two more for my wife and daughter plus will probably buy one of the toenail clippers as well - even considering buying a 3rd fingernail clipper to keep at work.    This a fantastic little device that is well worth what I paid for it! HIGHLY recommended - I would rate this a very his 9.25 to 9.75 out of ten - the ONLY drawback is that they&#x27;re not cheap.</li>
            <li> I used to use Revlon nail clippers but saw these clippers on sale they do a great job honestly better than Revlon and Revlon is a premium brand these clippers also feel premium and effortlessly clip</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine, sharp instrument but the opening leaves too little room to get the whole top of the fingernail in. You have to snip at the nail in bits. Otherwise, nicel little clipper.</li>
            <li> broke in a month. junk</li>
            <li> I love the clipper. It looks amazing. Also clipping is very comfortable, but the nail file needs improvement. It needs to be wider till the edges and little bit longer as filing the edges of nail is bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent as much as $45 trying to find a good nail clipper (I have tough nails).  This one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far, a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  A clipper to handle the hardest nails with a clean cut edge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid product, much better than the standard crappy ones I had previously. The weight feels right, and the hidden nail file is actually a nice addition too. Can&#x27;t think of ever using a better pair of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money,terrible clippers. Splits nails doesn&#x27;t clip cleanly.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  May 2017:  Handle snapped off cutting fingernails - not a strenuous task!.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t look to be solid stainless steel or if it is, a very low grade.  So I&#x27;ve changed the star to 1.  Amazon took care of my refund as Clyppi promotes a lifetime warranty.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;After using these for a couple months, I can now leave a review.  Clyppi is noted to be sharp - I&#x27;ll agree - they cut great.  What I have trouble with - and the reason for 3 stars.... and maybe it&#x27;s just how my fingers are, but it&#x27;s difficult to cut my fingernails nails SHORT - (like super short - I guess you could say &amp;#34;guitar player short&amp;#34;, but I don&#x27;t play the guitar).  There is so much &#x27;beefiness&#x27; to the front of the clipper that I can&#x27;t get a close trim.  And they are wider than ordinary nail clippers, which could be good or bad.  I like them for their clean cut, but not so much for the close cut.</li>
            <li> Your Clyppi nail clipper is vastly superior to the standard design: more comfortable feel, easier to use, sharper and more exact cutting. I&#x27;ve been ordering additional clippers for family members!</li>
            <li> Great clippers! Strong, sharp and sturdy. Easy to use and hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally never used a better nail clipper in my life.  If you are in any way thinking &amp;#34;this is too much for a nail clipper!&amp;#34;- well think again- while i&#x27;ve only used them once, it only took one time of use to understand the difference between these any any other cheapo clippers from Walgreens.  They are well made, and sharp as heck.  Also, the customer service and communication was prompt and friendly.</li>
            <li> I received the Clyppi clippers (cute name) and have already used them on my toenails. They are by far the nicest set of clippers I’ve ever used!! The only down side was that there’s no nail file with the pointy end that I normally use to remove dirt from the corners of my nails. I’ll just have to have my old pair of clippers handy for that part of the job in the future. I don’t know if it’s possible to add a nail file to the Clyppi, but I think it would be great if you could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I think they’re great and I’m glad I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  This is the third Clyppi that I’ve bought and I love them. The first one I bought didn’t have the nail file on it so I didn’t really use it much as I always use a file when clipping my nails. So I bought a second one, after noting that they came with a file, and I keep it handy and use it all the time. Then I realized that it would be more convenient to have one in my bathroom upstairs AND another one downstairs so I could use them when needed, so bought the next pair. I think these clippers are high quality and I love having them.</li>
            <li> Very nice product – arrived quickly, high quality. Really like it!</li>
            <li> Very strong.  Don&#x27;t think it will break anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent nail clipper and extremely attentive customer service!</li>
            <li> Gift for my husband - he says they are much easier to operate than some of the more expensive ones I have given him.  Speedy delivery as well.</li>
            <li> Works OK, but really uncomfortable to use. The two parts are at a 60% angle so it&#x27;s unwieldy, especially for someone with small hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They need to go back to the drawing board on this brand.</li>
            <li> As soon as I purchased these I received an email from the maker saying how much I was going to love these clippers, that they were the best around. On the third use the handle broke off making them useless. So much for quality. As usual Amazon issued a full refund.</li>
            <li> too small and too hard to operated</li>
            <li> awesome things... works well</li>
            <li> Cuts nail easily, but leaves edges jagged and rough. The nail must then be filed to keep it from &#x27;catching&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;This is not what I expected from an expensive nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I was also disappointed to find out that this was made in China. This was not mentioned in the description of the item on Amazon&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li> They work as expected. It&#x27;s been three months since I bought them, gift to my brother.. he&#x27;s always asking for nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Once, I saw his nail clipper and the blades were chipped. So, I was hoping this would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, have been using it for months now and the blade is still solid. Almost don&#x27;t have to file nails after being cut, it&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost. ;)&lt;br /&gt;My dad has a pair from Japan, that&#x27;s perfect! You really 100% don&#x27;t have to file your nails after cutting. lol if this clippy provided such a smooth cut, I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars. But, this is still very good.</li>
            <li> I have neuropathy from chemotherapy.  Because of that, I&#x27;ve lost a lot of strength and function in my fingers, and clipping my nails has been nearly impossible.  These clippers are perfectly designed. They are easy to hold and don&#x27;t require a lot of strength to squeeze them to clip the nail.  I highly recommend them for anyone who has arthritis, neuropathy or any other issue that impedes hand function. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Outstanding, very sharp and precise. Wish I&#x27;d had these decades ago, in lieu of cheapo ones in drug stores.</li>
            <li> Makes crisp and clean cuts.  Filer is very fine and sharp.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Very tiny..Difficult to use..Price does not reflect usefulness. Recieved e-mails to rate this item as 5 stars :(</li>
            <li> These are some great clippers,  I bought them as a stocking stuffer for my husband because the kids are always taking his from him.  He loves these; they cut precisely, easily, and cleanly and have a unique look.  Ergonomic and cuts easily. Highly recommended over the regular store bought clippers.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have tried numerous different nail clippers.  I recently ordered the Clyppi Fingernail Clippers for my husband for Christmas.  No other nail clipper comes close to this nail clipper.  It is awesome.  It is so good that I just ordered the toenail clipper.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this nail clipper.</li>
            <li> This clipper is so much easier to use that others that I have tried.  I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Not so great, too expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent product complimented by fantastic customer service. It does what it says on the tin. Thank you - what a great gift!</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in may hands making it hard to hold traditional clippers. Clyppi has a wider base and the grooves helps to keep my fingers from slipping.  Works just as I hoped it would. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Seems to be the best quality clipper I have ever used. Cuts cleanly and quickly. Easy to grip as well.  I am extremely happy that I ordered this product.The weight also is perfect.</li>
            <li> It’s a very good nail clipper, one of the best I had. Very sharp and good craftsmanship, I love it.</li>
            <li> Worth every dime.  Exactly what you&#x27;d expect for a tool of this quality!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Clyppi for my parents and they really like how easy it is to use.  This is the first clipper they&#x27;ve ever tried that had such a good spring action.  They like it so much they are ordering the larger size as well.</li>
            <li> Mine did not come with the nail scraper. I wish it did. These are the best clippers I have ever owned/used. Very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> Use this to trim my nails when I put Jamberry&#x27;s on them! (Nail wraps) This works great!!!</li>
            <li> These are the real deal.  I&#x27;ve never owned anything other than drug store nail clippers.  These are longer and easier to grip and they cut almost without effort.  Wish I had known about them sooner.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to let you know how great your clipper is. I was looking for a replacement for my Japanese Parada clipper and liked what I had heard about yours. It is a truly precise clipper and completely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it in my hands.  Good balance.  Most of the clippers I have used in the past were too short and I dropped them often.</li>
            <li> I googled the &amp;#34;best fingernail clippers&amp;#34; and this brand popped up. They are not cheap, but so far they have been as good as billed. The real test, however, will be how long they last.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed - something sharp with some leverage for ease-of-use because I have weakness and numbness in one hand which was making things rather difficult.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for Men with big hands ..</li>
            <li> These clippers are better than any found in our local stores.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, works very well.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Very solid feeling product. It clips finger and toe nails nice and smoothly. It doesn&#x27;t bend the nail or flex like practically every other nail clipper out there.  I think I&#x27;ll pretty much be swapping out every bathroom, car, or keychain set of clippers with this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various clippers to cut my tough fingernails but this product finally worked to my great satisfaction. I would gladly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is probably the cleanest cutting clipper I have used to date!  And because it is not polished, it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my fingers like the polished ones do.  The angle of the lever is a little higher, which also makes it easy to use.  I really like it a lot.  Having said all that, it does not slide along one&#x27;s nails as easily as the polished ones do, but I think with a little more use, I&#x27;ll get accustomed to that.  It gives a very precise cut, even on toenails, for which it is not designed.</li>
            <li> These clipper are nice and sharp and gives a nice clean cut.  I really like them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippis for my father at his request and when he opened them, and tried them, he was very happy with them.  He liked the fact that they actually cut as most of the ones that he has tired only half cut as there was not enough spring in the clip to make a clean cut.  He also purchased due to the great reviews that he had read about your product.</li>
            <li> This product came in the mail today and the product is strong. I enjoy products that do the job without breaking and this passes the test! I would recommend this product to friends and family. A+ product!</li>
            <li> These things are simply amazing.  There is no comparison out there and well worth the premium price (although even the price is really low in my opinion for the value you receive.</li>
            <li> This is our second (and third) Clyppi.  We like the fact that it cuts so well.  The only improvement that we would like is an attachment that would serve to clean our finger nails.  On other clippers, there is usually a nail file.  We don&#x27;t use the nail file for filing but to clean our nails. Nice product.  We recommend it.  Update:  Clyppi now has a nail file making it just about perfect.  I bought 2 more.  No more mashed fingernails in my house.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrific, Stainless Steel, very sharp cutting. The design facilitates easy access ..I recommend whole heartedly..some very less expensive cutters have sleeves that go over top and botttom phalanges , this is a nice touch that I would recommend for the manufacturer consider as they enhance the over all experience ...Not big deal but would be nice touch...</li>
            <li> Clyppi raises the bar for nail clippers.  Please read all the features listed in the description-they are truthful and accurate.  I particularly like its sleek and classy design which makes it easy to manipulate and pleasing to the eye.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best nail clipper!!! Study and sharp!!</li>
            <li> My thoughts on it are its convenient and compact, has 2 holes for a keyring, has a nail filer as well. It works for toenails and fingernails. Has a nice and sleek design. Great Product overall.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and easy to grip. It&#x27;s also very light despite the size. I&#x27;m hoping they stay sharp for a long time to come; if so they are worth the price! (I was going through the regular store ones a few times a year...either the lever would break off or they would dull quicky due to my tough nails)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see how these fare!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used my new Clyppi for the first time. And they are awesome!  A new paradigm in personal care.  Thank you for the great product.  I suspect there will be a few pairs of Clyppis in Christmas stockings this year.</li>
            <li> Quality product for a good price. I purchased the Clyppi for toe nails first and after using them and how great they were-I decided to purchase the Clyppi for finger nails too. The Clyppi is the last nail clipper you will have to buy in my opinion- they have a lifetime warranty and the people behind this product care about customer service ( They even sent me a personal email to make certain I recieved my order and asked how I liked the Clyppi ).</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and sharp. Does not leave rough edges on nails so I found no need to file nails after. Love that it is stainless steel!</li>
            <li> I have received my Clyppi and have been using it the last couple days.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s great! Nice clean sharp cut. My nails actually seem to feel cleaner because of the better quality cut.&lt;br /&gt;I like the texture of the metal and design. It&#x27;s easy to keep in my fingers as I use it. The size and weight is good.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I really like the Clyppi. At first I was a bit skeptical that it would be any better than the brand I was using, however it did what it promised. It clipped cleanly without causing breakage or tearing. I was really impressed that it was so clean cutting that I did not need to file my nails afterward. I was also impressed that it was delivered before the promised delivery date. This is a keeper, and I like that it has a lifetime guarantee.</li>
            <li> Works great! Have used it only once but looks solidly built. Cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;I got the smaller one initially, but I decided to order the larger one too.</li>
            <li> A great pair of nail clippers!  I love the brushed nickel look/feel.  I like that I can grip the clippers easily - the width of the handles is much better than other clippers I&#x27;ve used.  They are sharp, cut well and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> best clippers I have ever owned, sharp and sturdy, when you press to clip it is smooth and effortless.</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but they are accurate.  I have purchased these again - because they are worth it.</li>
            <li> handle broke off while cutting fingernail</li>
            <li> I really like it. Cuts smoother than any other clipper I have ever used. I cannot find anything to complain about. Well worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping that I had found the ultimate nail clipper. Needless to say I was not impressed. The design, material, and feel of the clippers are nice but the cut actually left my nails in need of a nail file (not a smooth finish cut). As a matter of fact I cut the nails on my left hand with my new Clyppi&#x27;s and the nails on my right hand with some ordinary ones I picked up from Riteaid. To be honest the Riteaid ones worked best on my nails. Oh well it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever had. They are very precise and sharper then other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had. I also realized after receiving them that they have a nail file built in where you see the rectangle on top. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I used these clippers about four times until the lever broke.  They seemed okay prior to this, but turns put they are totally useless.</li>
            <li> It was the perfect transaction. I ordered and the item came quickly and as advertised. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Ergonomically correct (nice wide end on thumb side), sharp, and proper curvature on the blade.  Quite better than the 2nd rate stuff from our eastern hemisphere friends.</li>
            <li> Not your average fingernail clipper, for sure. Worked like a charm and nails look good. No ragged edges like some clippers cause. I suggested a slightly bigger &#x27;clip&#x27; for people like me with large fingers and nails and learned a toenail clipper is on the way. Good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Clyppi clippers for about a week and so far, I am happy with the product.  I haven&#x27;t really had a chance to use them very much, though I can definitely see they produce a much more precise, clean and effortless cut than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  They are definitely more expensive than your average store-bought model, though I expected premium performance to coincide with the price.  So far so good!  My favorite clippers prior to these (made in Korea and given to me by my father back in the &#x27;80&#x27;s) have gone on &amp;#34;walk-a-bout&amp;#34; AGAIN (... probably the kids, argh) and every replacement clipper during those MIA times have not performed well at all.  Usually, they don&#x27;t cut well because the clipping edges don&#x27;t line up and meet properly and/or the handle levers are weak and can&#x27;t provide sufficient force to cut.  Many products today lack the quality of yesteryear, but Clyppi has done well by offering a product that excels at its job and feels comfortable when in use.  I&#x27;m hopeful that they will continue to perform at a high level and last an exceptionally long time... for me, 30+ years is where the bar&#x27;s set!</li>
            <li> The nail clipper arrived and it’s great! Well-built and sturdy!</li>
            <li> Easy to use with arthritic hands.  Great product.</li>
            <li> The Clyppi is great, easy to use and a very precise cutter.  I’m going to order some more to give as gifts.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> These clippers are beautifully made and managed to trim my teenage sons thick nails with ease. The fit easily in my travel case and cut evenly and smoothly the first time, every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Really well made and engineered.  Totally fulfills my expectations.</li>
            <li> Great ergonomic design. I love using it, but it needs a bit more space between the top of the file and the hinge. Sometimes when I go to use it the hinge hits the file and pushes it out. Otherwise this is one of the best nail cutters I have used.</li>
            <li> Great quality fingernail clipper. Just the right size.</li>
            <li> These are the best ever. Shipped on time,and they work great. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, that feels good in your hand. It is head and shoulders above both the dollar store cheapies, as well as most anything you could get in a grocery store or drug store. Looks and feels like it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I have received my Clyppi and I am very satisfied with it. It is exactly as advertised and I really like its craftsmanship and quality. Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> My husband said these are the best clippers he has ever used.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Item was as described and good quality too and i strongly recommend who are interested for quality goods.Though price is little higher compared to others available in market but worth to get one for those who are not compromosing on quality.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would highly recommend this Nail Clipper. It is very solid and well constructed and feels like it is built to last. I guess you get what you pay for! Did its job cutting my nails properly which makes a pleasant change – nail clippers usually make me crazy cutting half way through my nails and leaving them jagged so that they get caught in everything!</li>
            <li> Extra sharp clipping edges slice right through my tough nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has great feel and is ergonomic in its design. It doesn&#x27;t slip when cutting like my old clippers used to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the way the nail file is built into the handle. It is so much more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Clyppi  nail clipper and would purchase it again should I ever misplace this one!</li>
            <li> Good quality but a little too small for a me. I liked the quality so I got the toenail clippers and they are a better size for both my hands and feet. Giving these to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Clyppi. It is very sharp and ergonomic. I received it on time and the customer service is awesome.</li>
            <li> So this is my first Amazon review. I had such an amazing experience that I decided to finally write a review aver being a shopper since the dawn of the internet.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Clyppi and the clippers did not close evenly. The manufacturer proactively contacted me to inquire how I was enjoying the product. I wrote back telling them the problem with the clippers and they were exteremely apolgetic and two days later I had a brand new pair sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;The new clipper is amazing a lives up to all the great reviews. They cut great and feel great in the hand.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with these clippers.  They are very well designed and sharp.  Oddly, for me, they seem light.  That said they are very well made.  I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I like the clippers just not sure they are worth $15. Seriously, $15 for nail clippers. But, I am satisfied and want to still give them a good review. Now make one for toes!</li>
            <li> For years I have used drugstore clippers and been satisfied.  Then, I lost one I had used for years.  On seeking a replacement in the local drugstores and Target I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I next turned to my catalogs and bought two clippers in the area of $20 each.  Both were very unique designs with striking visual impact.  Alas, both disappointed me.  They looked fancy but performed poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I took a look at Amazon and that is where I found my Clyppi.  It cost five times as much as my drugstore clippers but its performance is excellent and I expect to use it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying nail clippers only to have them split my nails or fall awkwardly out of my hand during use.  I did not know this product existed but now that I have tried it, I want to recommend it heartily.  The clippers fit your hand comfortably and the cut is clean and easy to do, even if you do not have a lot of hand strength. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love these clippers!  They work perfectly, and do not leave rough edges, snags, or chipped areas.  Easy to handle and the best I have had.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Clyppi for my husband who is always “complaining” that we need better fingernail clippers as a Fathers Day gift. He was quite impressed with this, says they are sharp and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a buyer the product came quick and as described, overall this family couldn’t be happier with Clyppi!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t deserve the money. the quality is like a $1 product. It doesn&#x27;t work well. bad quality. don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> This is the best nail clipper that I have purchased. The nail file is a little inaccessible, but I don&#x27;t use it for that purpose.  It is a superb choice!</li>
            <li> This nail clipper works so perfect. Easy and very comfortable to use, sharp enough to cut your finger nails clean. True to its description. So happy that I also bought Clyppi for my toenails. You won&#x27;t regret owning this piece of precision tool.</li>
            <li> I have received Clyppi nail clipper. It is good. Very easy and comfortable to use. And it won&#x27;t make my nails everywhere. It is also sharp, which can clip my nails and hang nail easily. I also like the size, not too big or small, which is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Wow this is just a really well made product. Fully impressed with how nice these are. Look forward to clipping my nails now.</li>
            <li> I received the Clyppi, and have taken it for a test clip. My arthritic fingers appreciate the leverage, angle, and non-slip surface...all as described. I hope to love them for years.</li>
            <li> Much smoother and sharper than regular clippers.</li>
            <li> The Clyppi Fingernail Clippers are a little longer and wider than the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. I can really get my fingers &amp; thumb into each cut as a result of the added leverage and strength. These seem sharper. And coupled with the brushed steel, slippage is minimized.  The lever arm seems more bent up for added leverage.  I don&#x27;t have to squeeze so hard for a nice, clean cut.  And my nails don&#x27;t spit or flake into a hangnail everytime I trim them. That&#x27;s what was so aggravating about using my old clippers.  If forced to suggest an improvement, I guess I&#x27;d say to add an extra fingernail cleaner blade with an integrated nail file. Perhaps a hole near the bottom to carry on a keychain. It&#x27;s Aa nicely engineered grooming tool.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Very well designed, very sharp clippers, nice upgrade from department store clippers.  I like the nail file feature on the back.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that I can tell such a difference in these nail clippers from all the ones I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;So clean and sharp and comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a diabetic for 40 years, so I have to be very careful with products used in dealing with the delicate skin of the hands and feet.  I like that this product cut evenly, cleanly and with a small amount of applied pressure.  I would recommend this product to older folks with delicate skin as well as mom&#x27;s for their kids.  My husband uses it also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a chance to use my new Clyppi twice so far, but am very happy with it. It does a clean job cutting my nails, doesn&#x27;t leave any jagged edges so I don&#x27;t really need to file afterwards. And if I do have to file, there is a really cute little file built into the clyppi which is very effective despite its small size. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied and am hoping this product lasts many many years.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a nail clipper that would be easier to use than the little ones that I&#x27;ve had in the past. I have some arthritis in my hands and had to have some thumb joint surgery so it really helps that these clippers are much easier to handle. In the past it seemed like the little ones that you see everywhere were almost impossible to get a good grip on. I had even entertained buying the $50 ones that I saw in Dwell magazine. No need to now.</li>
            <li> Looked like it would work well and seemed to work well at first. However, after the third or fourth use, the top piece of the clipper broke right off near the pin that connects the clipper. It did not take much force to break the thing. Not worth buying at all...What luxury?</li>
            <li> They are as good as they say.</li>
            <li> My regular drug store fingernail clipper was getting dull so I ordered the Clyppi because I liked the name and it looked like a nice design.  When I received it I gave it a try and really like it.  It clips very well and feels good in my hand while still being small and compact.  I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer should this one ever wear out!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and effective. If it would have been even half-inch longer it would make even better for holding to clip nails. No other &amp;#34;complaints&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The CLYPPI nail clippers actually do meet the expectations they built up in their product description by far. They are extremely durable providing a clean, sharp cut each and every time of use. The way they are designed my thumb rests comfortably in an indent that makes the clippers fit well in my hand. The brushed finish is quite refreshing you really do not see that feature on many clippers. Read my full review here: [...]</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Great quality.</li>
            <li> Just got it today and tried it out and it is sharp! Awesome product! Great job! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very high quality. Precision cuts. Good file.</li>
            <li> The nail clipper is sleek and very well made. Very happy with my purchase. And it cuts my nails like butter. Now to not loose the nail clipper like my others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fully satisfied with my purchase! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Item does not include the nail cleaner/file, despite it being pictured and stated in the product description</li>
            <li> The Clyppi finger nail clippers are great!  have only used a couple of times but my wife is already starting to put them back in her drawer. looks like i need to buy another pair.</li>
            <li> I was replacing an old clipper I have been carrying around in my travel bag for years that just about tore off my thumbnail the last time I used it. I decided it was time for a decent clipper so am trying the Clyppi. I have used it once and it worked well and did the job. It cuts quick and clean and has a great file incorporated into the clipper handle.</li>
            <li> I do like these clippers a lot. I will definitely purchase more in the future as they are now my favorites. They mailed them promptly as well.</li>
            <li> Love the clipper.  Used a couple times and it is without a doubt a much better quality of product than the normal clippers bought at competitors stores.  I recommend and will purchase again as needed. One bizarre thing,,,,,they don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34; name on it, so not sure why they did that?  But they are still much better than any others I had.</li>
            <li> I finally used the Clyppi and I love how it feels in my hand and how it clips my nails. The file on the inside of the handle helps me grip the Clyppi as I use it.  I gave the other one I ordered to my wife and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally sick of buying brand new, right out of the package nail clippers with dead spots.  I decided to check Amazon, and from the many nail clippers offered, I choose to order Clyppi.  I was a bit wary but that was put to rest when I received my Clyppis.  NO DEAD SPOTS!  They make a sharp, clean cut on my fingernails and, as just stated, no dead spots.  I recommend these clippers, and when I need new ones I will order Clyppi Fingernail Clippers again.</li>
            <li> Life is too short to use inferior clippers. These are the best and the difference is obvious.</li>
            <li> I think these are great clippers however less than 6 months after purchasing and having used them less than 10 times the handle snapped.  There&#x27;s a lifetime warranty so hopefully the situation is rectified.</li>
            <li> The clipper came Tuesday and gave it a trial run yesterday.  It performed as I hoped it would. Nothing more irritating than a jagged or broken nail and not have a quality device to correct things. I now have that.  The only thing I would suggest is enlarging the file portion. It does the job but such a small area makes it a chore</li>
            <li> Great design.  Lightweight and more compact than other clippers.  Like the materials for the&lt;br /&gt;price - feels like a more expensive pair of clippers.  I like the nail file on the clipper arm.  Make&#x27;s it lighter weight and smaller than&lt;br /&gt;having a seperate file.  The file is very small but works well enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> good item, durable, works great</li>
            <li> Sharp and cut well. I ordered this clipper and at same time I ordered a Seki clipper which also cut well and were sharp. I find these (Clyppi) to give a much smoother cut then the Seki which left my nails with a rough edge. I had to use an emery board/ file on my nails after using the Seki Brand. I would buy these again. If I have a problem with them I will update later. I also used them on my toenails and had no problems. I will order toenail ones if they make them.( I have not looked yet.)</li>
            <li> These Fingernail Clippers do what they say they do: the clip fingernails.  Considering that $1 fingernail clippers do just that as well, I question why I bought these at 15x the price.  Yes, they are nicer and smoother than your run-of-the-mill, but not $14 worth- maybe half that max.</li>
            <li> These work a little better than the generic kind you find in drug stores, but not that much better.  For the cost, I was expecting more; something a lot better, and that&#x27;s not what these are.  Also, be prepared to get numerous emails from the seller after the purchase, asking you to review the product.  Well, here it is.</li>
            <li> Would be just the slightest bit better with grip pads and a cuticle device added.</li>
            <li> Four stars for being easy to use after having had thumb/wrist surgery.  However, the cut isn&#x27;t any more precision than the local drugstore&#x27;s name brand clippers.</li>
            <li> They cut well, but are smaller than my previous clippers I was trying to replace. They looked like good high quality clippers that could clip my toes and fingernails, a nice hybrid size. They are not, they are minuscule. The file is tiny and hard to get a good rhythm, they leave my nails with sharp points because they don&#x27;t have a wide enough arch and are too small for my toes. For the price I expected something hardy, but these are skimpy. The file, when I can actually hit the small area with my nail, works well to fix the sharp points the clippers leave behind, and the clippers cut through nails like butter. However, their performance is not good enough to merit the high price for such a small device that doesn&#x27;t have anything special about it. I don&#x27;t understand the hype.</li>
            <li> I received my clippers and tried them today. I purchased both the nail and toenail clippers (two separate orders from Amazon). These worked well. These made a very clean cut which didn&#x27;t require filing. Huge Plus!! The only suggestion I would make is to offer a men&#x27;s manicure set in a carry case. I searched online and didn&#x27;t find any kits, so I purchased these separately, the price separately was a little pricey. While searching online, I made my decision to purchase based on the reviews. * I have since found that there is a set that can be ordered. I am very pleased with my clippers!! I liked them so much I ordered 3 more sets..</li>
            <li> I bought this simply because my local market had none and I needed a pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ordering, I found that the company that made this is very passionate about their product and Amazon, so I&#x27;m actually writing a review of nail clippers. Something I never thought I&#x27;d do. Let&#x27;s get on with it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;- They seem to cut well enough. Better than others? Maybe, I don&#x27;t really know. Definitely not worse.&lt;br /&gt;- Comparing them to my other nail clippers, the metal seems nicer and probably won&#x27;t rust as easy. It&#x27;s also a bit thicker so maybe it won&#x27;t warp as easily. Pure speculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not-so-good:&lt;br /&gt;- The emery board embedded in the lever is poorly placed. To use it, the clippers have to be in the \\&quot;ready\\&quot; position. This requires some finesse to avoid clipping your skin while trying to file your nails after cutting and makes the thing awkward to hold while doing so.&lt;br /&gt;- The emery board in the lever is attached with some sort of glue and it doesn&#x27;t hold very well, I am able to slide it down a millimeter or two with my thumb, but I am unwilling to see if it comes off completely at this time.&lt;br /&gt;- There&#x27;s no mechanism to hold the lever in place when the trimmers are closed as seen on other clippers, meaning the lever is never securely in place.&lt;br /&gt;- After owning them for only a few days, there appears to already be scuff marks where the metal of the lever meets the metal of the clippers. I&#x27;m certainly no expert on metals though and I have no idea how that will play out with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I understand what&#x27;s so great about these nail clippers that they came up first in my search results for customer reviews. I don&#x27;t need great nail clippers, I&#x27;m no hand model or anything, and I&#x27;m certainly no expert on beauty products, but for my simple needs these nail clippers are average at best. For the increased cost, I think I would prefer something manufactured in the USA or that had a more functional design than the clippers theyusually sell at the local grocery store.</li>
            <li> Thought these were excellent clippers. Very sharp and doesn&#x27;t leave your nails sharp or with rough edges.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably purchase the matching toe-nail clippers too.&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit pricey and at this price I do wish they came with a simple case or cover to protect them and keep them sharp.</li>
            <li> No more raggedy edges or split nails.  Having basal joint arthritis has made fingernail clipping a challenge.  The Clyppi is easy to use and cuts completely through every time.  I&#x27;ll be getting another one for my travel bag so I never have to be without.  Funny how little things like this make live so much easier!</li>
            <li> I must admit - these are pretty amazing. My girlfriend thinks I am nuts getting excited about fingernail clippers but I love quality and that&#x27;s what the these are. If you&#x27;re careful in trimming your nails with these precision cutters, you don&#x27;t even need a file, but there is one onboard if you need it. I already ordered two more pairs - one for my brother and another for some other lucky soul.</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers for myself but made a mistake and ordered the &#x27;fingernail&#x27; instead of the &#x27;toenail&#x27; clippers. I will still use them for the children in our orphanage but haven&#x27;t had the chance to start clipping yet.&lt;br /&gt;The company was very gracious and helpful. For that reason alone, I felt good about having ordered the &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;From the appearance, the way it feels in the hand and one practice use, I will be happy to order the &#x27;toenail&#x27; Clyppi once I return to the States.&lt;br /&gt;- four star rating and not five because I haven&#x27;t used them over a long period of time...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had high quality nail clippers before, but lost them.  These are better.  Easier to hold.  The gap between the jaws when open is wider, making it easer to get my fingernail in there. I&#x27;m going to get a pair for my son, as well.</li>
            <li> I just received my order for my new CLYPPI FINGERNAIL TRIMMERS and was EXTREMELY SATISFIED. They feel like they&#x27;re from the future and look it too. The edges line up beautifully (no ripping or tearing 😊) and you can tell that the craftsmanship is of HIGH QUALITY. I&#x27;m already planning on ordering their toenail trimmers. I have and will continue to RECOMMEND  these products to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Great fingernail clipper</li>
            <li> These are average clipper therefore over priced.  There are great clippers out there but these are not them.  Just a regular clipper.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a good pair of fingernail clippers and wanted to buy some German-made ones.  However, I couldn&#x27;t find any for a reasonable price.  I got the Clyppi instead and am very happy.  These make a quick, easy, sharp cut on dry nails.  Don&#x27;t make the mistake of trying to cut a damp nail (after a shower).  I would recommend these to anyone and am looking at ordering a set of toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably wonderful product.  Excellent precision.  Extremely easy to use.  Worlds better than my former clippers.</li>
            <li> The clippers do what they are supposed to do very well--they don&#x27;t chew up your fingernails like some others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to hold and seem sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I would go as far as &amp;#34;the best.&amp;#34; They work well, but they don&#x27;t even have the tool that most other do to dig dirt out from under the nail. I&#x27;m going to keep using them, but they haven&#x27;t changed my life.</li>
            <li> The nail clipper has arrived and is solid!  I like the design, the way it clips, and that the file is a part of the clipper.  All expectations met.</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic, and being so, small tears and cuts into my nail bed can lead to unwanted infections. These clippers do as claimed. Cutting through my nails is clean, with absolutely no tearing. I hope they come out with a pair of toenail clippers as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my new Clyppi for about a week.  I love it!  It cuts cleanly and is easy to use.  For nail CLIPPING it&#x27;s great.  But, ... I miss having a nail cleaner and the small patch of file is hardly worth having.</li>
            <li> The clippers were sharp, fit easily into the hand, and required only the slightest pressure for cutting.  The clippers say that they are for &amp;#34;fingernails,&amp;#34; but they can easily do toenails too.</li>
            <li> Wow! The Clyppi is the first nail clipper I’ve ever used that doesn’t jump out of my hand whenever it feels like it! It is very well designed and executed from an ergonomic point of view and is extremely sharp as well. Well done!</li>
            <li> This will sound cliche, but it&#x27;s the truth -- it&#x27;s the best clipper I have ever used!  It&#x27;s easy on the fingers and my son (who is 6) doesn&#x27;t fight me because it works so quickly nail clipping is over before he can complain.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. She likes it. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> These clippers beat the heck out of the drug store clippers! I am obsessed with keeping my fingernails short., My last pair of clippers i had for over years and then one day they were just gone.....Been looking for another pair every since, I tried numerous different brands. The Clyppi is the best.&lt;br /&gt;The Clyppi is a high quality product, the cutting edge is very sharp, and the clippers are just the right size. I will be ordering the Clyppi toe nail clippers next.</li>
            <li> These are great!  Love the grip and they don&#x27;t slip out of your hand.  The design is awesome.  Would definitely recommend.  Shipped very quickly and came in a great package!</li>
            <li> Was a little unsure about paying this much for a finger nail clipper, but was amazed at how sharp it is.  It takes so little effort, have to be careful where you place the clipper on your nail, I had a tendency to clip a little too short at first.</li>
            <li> Despite being made in China?  Keegan Allen must have contracted specific metallurgy PRC mfrs.  Cutting edges of his brand&#x27;s clyppi.....?&lt;br /&gt;I bought both nail and toe clippers.  AS other reviewers have mentioned, Clyppi cuts clean without needing an emery board touch up.  Sekis leave a rather jagged edge.  Of course, have the money afford a once a week professional manicure with cuticle nippers and of course a pedicure?  Smoke your $$$$.&lt;br /&gt;Comparison test REMINDER.......Seki nail and toe clippers, despite being Made In Japan........nowhere near precision cut versus the Clyppis.&lt;br /&gt;Sekis these styles:&lt;br /&gt;  http://www.amazon.com/Seki-Edge-Stainless-Toenail-Clipper/dp/B0063LG46O/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0GKVQF1BRG92K71PB4VW and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Seki-Edge-Stainless-Fingernail-Clipper/dp/B000F35R00/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1402846375&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;seki+nail+clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar in price, new kid on the block Keegan Allen&#x27;s Clyppi is 2X better, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;Will return the two Seki&#x27;s and buy a 2X pair of his nail products instead.

            <li> I ordered the Clyppi for my Mom.  She is 90 and was having a hard time trimming her nails with her little cheapy nail clippers.  I saw your clyppi on Amazon  and got it for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is very happy with it!  It is easier for her to hold, applies a little more pressure and is nice and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product, I plan on getting several more for our family too!</li>
            <li> Trust me ... This is a very good product worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for a while now and they are the best nail clippers you&#x27;ll ever buy. They are solid, sharp, and fit in your hand. they just cut. well worth the extra coin. now that my wife found them, i&#x27;ll undoubtedly be buying more. the only &#x27;complaint&#x27; i have is that someone from Clyppi emailed me like 3 times to find out how I liked them............... cmon, you knew they were the best!!</li>
            <li> The Clyppi is a lot better than the old set of clippers I had, which literally fell apart in my hand last time I used them. The Clyppi has a nice texture to it and has a weight to it that makes it feel really sturdy. I think they will last a really long time!  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another set for a friend or family member.</li>
            <li> Wow these could not have come at a better time. I love to do things for myself and what better way than to have your nails and toes nice and neat! Since time is short I usually do my nails and toes at home. I am so excited about this CLYPPI clipper, they are amazingly sturdy. I never knew what I was missing out on until I used these.</li>
            <li> I think these clippers should be a little larger for men&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> After using this clipper for a few months, I have come to the conclusion that they are &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;not worthy of all the hype, and certainly not worth the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the pros,&lt;br /&gt;they do cut tough nails with ease&lt;br /&gt;they are relatively easy to hang onto in use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cons,&lt;br /&gt;the file area is tiny, and hard to access,&lt;br /&gt;and you WILL need a nail file or emery board to get a smooth clip job</li>
            <li> The Clyppi nail clipper has arrived on time and in fine condition. I am impressed with quality of the clipper. It is easy to use and very sharp. I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old clipper was till I used the clyppi.</li>
            <li> Substantial metallic construction; satisfactorily sharp</li>
            <li> This is a great little item! Cuts MUCH more precisely and easily than any clipper I have ever had before due to the good ergonomics and very sharp blades.  Well worth the money over cheap ones you get in drugstores!</li>
            <li> I was really looking for quality clippers as I found the other ones were difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have a weight and feel about them which I really like !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend them</li>
            <li> This clipper met my high expectations. Most nail clippers crack my fingernails as they&#x27;re cutting, so I have to try to cut away all the&lt;br /&gt;cracked parts as I&#x27;m finishing up each finger (and it never really works). But this clipper cut cleanly every time. I was pretty amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main comment for the future is that it should come with a removable cover to catch the clippings.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with their feel to start with, solid and smooth. Gave a nice, clean, easy cut like I&#x27;ve never seen before. As a former cosmetologist I highly recommend  the CLYPPI!</li>
            <li> Clippers work smoothly and expertly.  Much easier to grip than cheaper clippers.  No jagged nails left behind.  Great for the whole household, including youngsters learning to clip nails.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product. I replaced a cheap clipper, because I could not get leverage to operate it. Clyppi has a high enough handle, allowing it to provide plenty of leverage, so it does not &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; in use. It cuts great, and I use it on both hands and feet (except for the big toe)  :)  I knocked off 1 star, because the file does not come to the edge of the handle, making it unusable on the corners of the nail.</li>
            <li> More marketing than any revolutionary tech.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper. It clips cleanly, no ragged edges and quickly. You&#x27;re definitely better off buying this than the $2 one at the local convenience store. You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> What I like about the clipper is how light weight and sturdy it is.  I mentioned that I&lt;br /&gt;was looking for a nail clipper that allowed  me to cut the nails on my right hand since&lt;br /&gt;the  stroke on my left side limits the strength and force I use with a nail clipper.  The&lt;br /&gt;Clyppi did that for me with a clean cut on the nails.</li>
            <li> These are okay nail clippers, but it&#x27;s sorely missing the tool for cleaning under the nail. Wish I had noticed that before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have used this clipper several times already and am impressed with how easy it is to use when I clip left or right fingernails. It cuts quicky and requires very little pressure! Overall, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great little nail clipper. Super sharp on my tough as nails nails. Will buy again, probably as soon as the TSA removes them from my briefcase.</li>
            <li> The clippers work, but are to expensive for what they are.  The seller e-mail and mailed me asking for a review which really annoyed me that I bought their product but did not give them permission to spam me.</li>
            <li> My husband goes through nail clippers like you would not believe and also gets frustrated when they don&#x27;t fit in his large hands, but he thought these were great!</li>
            <li> These clippers are everything they advertise to be. They are fantastic! Easy to hold, trim cleanly, - love them!</li>
            <li> This is one fine product! Made of excellent materials, and the design is awesome. My next step is to try out the toenail clipper version. Do yourself a favor and try these out. Exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> By now you know I bought the toe nail clippers. The finger nail clippers are wonderful. If you keep filing your nail the tips become frayed and allow water into the nail. I have used other nail clippers and they are cheaply made . These allow you to shorten the nail and just file into shape as an end step.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, I guess.  It&#x27;s a lot smaller than what I thought it would be.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s well designed and constructed, but, it pretty much just cuts nails.  That tiny little nail file inserted into the handle just doesn&#x27;t do it for me - I have to use a separate one. I have big hands, and big feet, therefore big nails, and they grow quickly. This sure isn&#x27;t going to work on my toenails, whereas the $3 special from the drugstore can.  I don&#x27;t mean to be trash talking this device, but I was expecting a little more for the price.</li>
            <li> Bit expensive but its well made</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this nail clipper is the best I&#x27;ve used.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~They are sturdy &amp; stylish&lt;br /&gt;~Their matte finish doesn&#x27;t allow for any slippage even when squeezing hard&lt;br /&gt;~The end of the handles flare OUT slightly at the end for more gripping surface area&lt;br /&gt;~They clip with authority, precision, and punch.  None of that &amp;#34;I wonder if I got all the way through?&amp;#34; nonsense&lt;br /&gt;~They are lifetime guaranteed (awesome)&lt;br /&gt;~There is a built-in emory board that doubles as a fantastic grip while trimming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completely recommend this brand of fingernail clippers and would not hesitate purchasing again should they be stolen out of jealousy. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, Clyppi, thank you!</li>
            <li> This is just a regular nail clipper; like to any old clipper one might get in supermarkets and drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing fancy.&lt;br /&gt;The size is about 2,5 in.&lt;br /&gt;It clips - but what else do you expect?&lt;br /&gt;I could not quite relate to rave reviews - product - and pricing.</li>
            <li> Due to basal joint arthritis in both thumbs, with left thumb being far worse making trimming my nails on the right hand a very painful experience with even the sharpest drugstore clippers I have found, I went shopping for a better nail clipper.  The reviews for the Clyppi were encouraging and the price was reasonable if it lived up to the expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physical examination of the Clyppi shows that is 100% brushed stainless steel construction with the sharpest cutting edge of any clippers I have when viewed under 30X magnification.  It is also substantially heavier at 361 grams vice a comparable pair of drugstore clippers at 271 grams further substantiating its overall build quality.  The cutters mate perfectly when closed and they are the first pair ever to not get jammed by a dime when pocket carried with lose change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use, the Clyppi cut through my somewhat tough nails with far less effort than standard clippers, so much so that I barely had any discomfort using my ailing left thumb.  I was able to neatly trim both the nails and the cuticles with minimal effort.  The Clyppi uses surface features on both the lever and main body, as you can see in the photos, to aid in keeping it well gripped while trimming.  The lever is easy to rotate into the cutting position, yet is tight enough to stay put when pocket carried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the Clyppi so much I bought a 2nd one just in case I should lose it.  I am never using a different pair of clippers again, and like a previous poster had hoped for, I also hope that a companion upsized toe nail clipper version is made available.</li>
            <li> Clyppi Fingernail Clippers works as described. I will buy additional clippers for travel and emergency kits. Best clipper I have used.</li>
            <li> The makers of this clipper went all out!  I have arthritis in my hands and have been unable to find a clipper that does not hurt to use.&lt;br /&gt;Well I finally found one!  This feels so good on my hands, no poking or pinching when trying to use it. It also has a built in file, which I find to be helpful.  The material that it is made of is wonderful as well.  It will last a long time...thank you to Clyppi!!!</li>
            <li> This clipper gets it done and is user Freindly.I enjoyed the ease and comfort of it since sometimes I have arthritic discomfort in my hands.I would recommend the clyppi to anyone who needs a quality clipper.Vanessa.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers.  You&#x27;re able to be precise in clipping because of the gripping part that keeps your grip from slipping.  (Say that last sentence really fast, 10 times.)  :-)  Anyway, solidly made and sharp cutting edge.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I find the Clyppi outstanding, excellent and easy to use.  We are &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; citizens with&lt;br /&gt;some physical limitations and are definitely pleased to have found these clippers.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have had the worst luck with fingernail clippers, but my husband and I both love these! they clip well and shape my nails really well, definitely get them!!</li>
            <li> Crisp, clean cutting sets these clippers apart from the crowd.  I have bought several pairs for myself (office, briefcase, car, bathroom, etc.........and plan to purchase several more as stocking stuffers.  ;-)</li>
            <li> Does a great job.Liked it so much i ordered the toenail clipper also</li>
            <li> boy does it work well</li>
            <li> Just go right ahead and buy these clippers right now.  The standard drugstore-type clippers are clumsy and poorly made.  This one is sharp and precise.  You don&#x27;t need heavy pressure and they are very easy to hold.  A lifetime investment that is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> I am very fussy about keeping my nails short For 40+ years I&#x27;ve owned some German clippers made by INOX. The steel is still sharp after all these years. Good steel just lasts and lasts. About ten years ago, I bought my adult children each a set of the INOX clippers. They&#x27;re good, but nothing like the originals. I know because when they visit, they borrow mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that brings me to Clyppi. After trying out various manufacturers, I got one of these and was delighted. They are extremely sharp and the tiny nail file, which I dismissed as a joke, is quite useful. I just bought two more sets as birthday gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the clippers twice since purchasing them. The sturdy steel construction is a big improvement over the clippers I used to have (and broke) which had plastic parts. I get great control and can trim my fast-growing nails evenly and quickly. Plus, the co-founder of Clyppi wrote to me personally to ask how I liked this product. When I asked for a recommendation for my husband&#x27;s nail grooming needs, he immediately pointed me to another clyypi product and provided a coupon. I was impressed with this degree of interest in customer satisfaction. I am purchasing the second clyppi for my husband today!</li>
            <li> We have received our Clyppi and as of today both of us have used it.  It is terrific.  Works just as advertised - smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product and great company. Will not hesitate to buy from them again. And these clippers are the real deal. I don&#x27;t only use for nails, but for fly making and fishing, so this set is of real quality. It&#x27;s like buying any tool ---&amp;#62; The way these are made compares to chromed pot metal clippers makes me think these are gonna be around for a long time. Added a 6&amp;#34; lanyard to mine so I can keep &#x27;em clipped to my fishing vest.</li>
            <li> I work in the automotive profession and like to keep my nails trimmed very short and these clippers are by far the best I&#x27;ve used . I&#x27;ve used them a few times since purchase and the quality is obvious and much higher than the products sold in walmart and other local stores. Like the packaging and product description too it really adds to the overall experience , I plan on buying another set or two , thanks</li>
            <li> Used these once. Great look, sharp cut &amp; easy to hold. Best clipper I&#x27;ve ever had. Now my wife wants one.</li>
            <li> These are expensive (for nail clippers) but they are very precise, sharp and the small nail file that is built into the handle works like a champ.  Don&#x27;t try to trim your cuticles with these as they&#x27;re so sharp, you can cut yourself without even noticing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL worth the money!</li>
            <li> The Clyppi is easily the best nail clipper I have ever owned. I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a clipper.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers provide a really nice clean cut every time.  For me the cutting edge needed to be a bit more curved but that&#x27;s just a personal preference so I still give them 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use. So much better quality than the cheap drug store clippers. Hide them because other family members will want to steal them!</li>
            <li> I thought the clippers were very good.  Clean cuts and no snags, etc.  Very easy to use and handle.  I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are by far the BEST clippers I have ever bought. They are awesome!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this off by saying these are not my first nail clippers. Everything breaks eventually, and I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t be my last either, but I&#x27;ve gone through designs of both high and low quality, often at much higher prices, and Clyppi has exceeded my expectations for ease of use, attractive design, and comfortable feel in the hand. Cutting a nail with Clyppi feels almost effortless, and the lever does not give the sensation that it is digging into the pieces it pushes on, and the brushed coating only shows minor points of wear at the edges after a week&#x27;s use catching up for the absence of its predecessor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, at this price point and for this quality experience, even if it somehow broke within the year (which doesn&#x27;t seem likely), I&#x27;d just replace it with another Clyppi. Recommended to anyone who catches themselves applying brute force to a pair of clippers! ;-)</li>
            <li> I have maybe 8 nail clippers lying around the house. These are the only ones I&#x27;ve ever found that cut clean and easy. Truly a great invention.</li>
            <li> The Clyppi fingernail clipper is by far the sharpest fingernail clipper we have ever used. It is a little larger then the cheap type, making it easy to use. I must say that this company has amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> Precise clipping as described - FINALLY!</li>
            <li> Received my Clyppi in the mail today and it works great!</li>
            <li> I really am enjoying your new Clyppi and am actually considering getting several to use as gifts.  I carry mine in my pocket and use it pretty regularly.  I think you&#x27;ve got a winner here - keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> Its  great!  Thinking about ordering the toe nail clipper also.</li>
            <li> first time i managed to cut my finger nails without looking like i ate them off.  great product</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying the cheapo clippers at drug stores. I just couldn&#x27;t find any that were higher quality, despite some that had a higher price. These are what I would expect from a pair of nail clippers that cost 3-4x what the cheapos cost. They are a high quality tool, sturdily built, and I expect these to last a long time, provided I don&#x27;t lose them :). Cuts my nails very cleanly and with little effort. A word of caution, these things are really sharp, and will cut pretty much anything you manage to get into the opening.</li>
            <li> This was given to me as a gift, and it is great.  It&#x27;s the perfect size, and is sharp so there is no breaking or tearing nails.  Definitely would recommend this!</li>
            <li> they are what I was looking for...</li>
            <li> These are seriously the best nail clippers that I have ever owned.  I keep them hidden so my hubby and kids can&#x27;t steal them!</li>
            <li> the clipper is very well made, very sharp, and easy for precise cut. its quality is surprisingly way above my expectation on a clip. The product is actually smaller than it looks to me from the product pictures. The size of the clipper is indeed listed in the production description though if you can find.</li>
            <li> Sharp and clean cuts, almost effortless. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice clean cut, I like these very much.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality but I wish that there would have been a leather case that holds both small and large clippers.</li>
            <li> Powerful precision in a nail clipper? Absolutely! It makes a difference. My nails are quite strong and I’ve not used a clipper that handles the job better than this one. It’s so good, I have two! Give it a try; you won&#x27;t be sorry. Now I’m waiting patiently for the toenail clipper to be available…</li>
            <li> This clipper deserves the amount of stars and great reviews it gets because it truly works to trim my finger nails. I also highly praise the customer service I received from Clyppi. This isn&#x27;t like any other clipper I&#x27;ve used and is very sturdy. GREAT nail clipper.</li>
            <li> This product is very sturdy and well made.  I have been using nail clippers from the department store, and now I realize what I’ve been missing.  The Clyppi is very sharp and precise.  It cuts so cleanly that the nail doesn&#x27;t go flying across the room when you cut it.  This is the first high-end nail clipper I&#x27;ve used, so I can&#x27;t compare to the extremely expensive stuff from Solingen and the like, but I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice clean cuts. Worked well on finger nails and toe nails without having to soak. Grip on clippers was good. They did not slip like some clippers I have used. Thanks for making a quality product.</li>
            <li> Better than I could have imagined! I had an expensive nail clipper that was made in France and marketed by a high priced knife company, which I used for years, even though it hurt my finger and thumb every time I pressed to clip a nail. Finally, I decided to go to Google \\&quot;best fingernail clipper\\&quot; and arrived at Amazon&#x27;s number one item: Clyppi. I am 80 years old and have never ever experienced such a marvelous clipper. Extremely sharp, smooth cutting, and easy to use with no discomfort. I am going to order 5 more to give as gifts next Christmas.</li>
            <li> In a word, it&#x27;s wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been long frustrated at the trend of declining quality in other nail clippers I&#x27;ve purchased. Some are almost useless. Yours cuts so cleanly that my nails feel like I&#x27;ve filed them. Thanks for making an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I just used the Clyppi and I have to say I am most impressed. It is really&lt;br /&gt;sharp and cuts the fingernails very cleanly. It is smaller than I thought&lt;br /&gt;it would be, but that is not a knock. I might buy a bigger one for the toe&lt;br /&gt;nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Seller communication, shipping are excellent but the product itself is not user friendly! Need lot of improvements!!</li>
            <li> Purchased July 7.&#x60;14 broken yesterday, not 3 months . Garbage, no stars...DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK.</li>
            <li> The nail clipper is really great!  It&#x27;s got a nice feel to it.  With other&lt;br /&gt;nail clippers i always feel like it&#x27;s going to pop out of my hand.  The&lt;br /&gt;edges also line up precisely for an easy cut.  I bought a nail clipper&lt;br /&gt;about 5 months ago and it was a piece of crap.  the edges didn&#x27;t even line&lt;br /&gt;up and it was tearing and bending my finger nail.  I don&#x27;t understand why&lt;br /&gt;people put crap out on the market.  Nice work!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was amused by the product description for the Clyppi  and they are so right – my husband DID steal my Clippi the very next day after  got it! I think I will buy another one as I can see this becoming a problem – lol. Not sure why we’ve fallen in love with this nail clipper so quickly. I think it’s because it is so small but has such a big attitude!  And it is a good nail clipper for men as well as women because it is not too “girly”.</li>
            <li> Great Clippers!  Easy to hold, they don&#x27;t sip out of place and they cut very well.  They are worth the money for me.  I have arthritis in my hands and these are a huge help.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp! I bought them for my husband who has incredibly thick fingernails, figuring if these are meant for toenails they should work fine. He used to have to take a shower before clipping his nails to make them softer - no more! When he tried them for the first time his only words were, &amp;#34;Wow.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. Very smooth cuts.  Easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I have used my Clyppi only once since I have received it . I am delighted and impressed with the lightness of the clippers themselves and also the sharpness of the blades. I am 65 years old and have never before used a nail clipper that was this light and as sharp . I am 100% satisfied. I would buy this product again and again and again.</li>
            <li> Great Quality! Sharpest clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. I think these clippers will outlast me!</li>
            <li> As I approach my 90th birthday I find that some appendages do not perform in the spontaneous way of the past. I refer to my fingers, stiff with arthritis, slow in almost everything except growing fingernails long and fast. I had several fingernail clippers, but pressing the levers had become painful and hard to control. I spent hours with Amazon catalogs, then ordered a Clyppi. It is precisely what I had hoped for. I find it sharp, smooth and painless.</li>
            <li> Good stocking stuffer for the men on my list.</li>
            <li> BUY AGAIN? Yes. Excellent and sharp.</li>
            <li> This is a quality nail clipper. You can buy cheaper, I&#x27;m sure, but this is a well-made item.</li>
            <li> They look nice but in my opinion the quality of those that I received aren&#x27;t up to the standards of $1 store clippers. The problem is that the top and bottom blades do not meet correctly and as a result they tear more than cut and leave my nails more jagged and torn than neatly clipped.</li>
            <li> Received the items (2 purchased) early and used one immediately. Wow! A fantastic clean, smooth cut. You don&#x27;t even have to file afterwards because the cut is so clean. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I wish handles were a bit longer to improve stability while holding but the sharpness reduces pressure needed to clip</li>
            <li> I spent many years going through cheap clippers that chip or tear my nails.  I hate when they cut but not all the way through and the nail hangs on!!!!  I have been looking for these clippers for years and finally, I can rest.  These are the clippers for me and I hope they last until I am ashes in the wind.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers.  They have a high quality feel to them and seem to be extremely well made.  They cut/trim with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that it really matters, but they do have a cool, machined look to them.</li>
            <li> At last a strong, beautiful, truly functional nail clipper! The only nail clipper you will ever need. We have now purchased the toenail clipper also. A must buy if you are tired of cheapie drugstore clippers functioning poorly and even breaking more easily than in our parent&#x27;s times.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it....works perfectly....from now on will only buy these</li>
            <li> Clean, crisp cut, best one I have ever owned.  This is a great product.  Will also be buying the toenail Clyppi .</li>
            <li> So far so good. Seems like a quality product. Just the right amount of heft, and a nice clean cut. Good profile on the edge which helps me cut on scratchy parts of my cuticles. I&#x27;m counting on the stainless steel to help these maintain a clean cut and last a long time. One request though is I wish they had the nail catch guards on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owners emailed to thank us for our purchase and ask for feedback. Sent the above feedback and got a great response back! 5 stars for the exceptional personal touch to the buying experience.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy duty as I expected and don&#x27;t expect much from the built in file. They are nice and sharp and hope they stay that way.</li>
            <li> Well I finally tried the nail clippers. Truthfully the main reason I was looking to replace the one I had was it never opened far enough. My nails aren&#x27;t abnormally thick but I had to use two fingers to lift the handle just to get enough space and then try to clip with the remaining two fingers. What a pain. Checked a couple local stores and found the same types all selling for around 8-10 dollars. Took a chance on the Clyppi based on great average user rating (Amazon) and I must admit these are the best I&#x27;ve ever used. They clip easily - little pressure needed - and as a bonus, evenly. No sharp edges that need extra clipping or filing. They seem well built but of course only time will tell; hopefully a lot of time.I guess it&#x27;s a sign of the times, but it is rare to find a product that works the way it should, and this does.</li>
            <li> It seems that this product is what I have looking for quite a while. Very different from regular clippers; more sturdy, better design, and sharp blade. I should be using it often and, hopefully, for a long time.</li>
            <li> Clyppi is my new best friend. Quality cuts every time. Good feel in the hands when going for those tough to get out nails. It has actually been the first even cut my nails have had. No more sock snags no more glove snags in the winter time.</li>
            <li> Super Sharp and easy to use.  Great for arthritic hands - even on gross thick toenails.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery.  Looks like the clipper will work well - certainly better than any other clipper we&#x27;ve had/</li>
            <li> Great clippers, easy for very arthritic hands to use.</li>
            <li> I  really wasn&#x27;t impressed with its cutting ability.  I expected it to be much sharper and perform much better than the drugstore brands available to me.</li>
            <li> Great product.  They work well.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Clyppi&#x27;s performance.  Contrary to some of the dissenting reviews, I found that it provides for a very smooth, clean cut, that is far better than the cheaper $.99 grocery store options.  Plus, it has a nice form factor, which is always nice to see.  While I didn&#x27;t need a new pair of toenail clippers, I liked the fingernail version enough that I went ahead and completed the set.  If you&#x27;re in the market for an effective, upscale, and appealing nail clipper, the Clyppi is a great choice!</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for, because of the arthritis in my thumbs I needed very sharp and easy to use clipper.&lt;br /&gt;This one is extremely sharp, does not pull. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased different kinds before from large department stores and drug stores , they were either hard to use or will pull while clipping.</li>
            <li> OK, these clippers are fantastic.  These shut my wife up as she told me before I ordered them &amp;#34;they&#x27;re all the same&amp;#34;.  Clearly they are not.</li>
            <li> Ilove it works great.</li>
            <li> I got these for my husband because he kept using mine, which are a different brand.  They are very sharp and easy to use.  He is very pleased and I may get one for myself.</li>
            <li> Littl high in price, but the ergonomics are great.</li>
            <li> Very high quality clippers!</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great pair of clippers... my husband puts these through hell with his claw feet and they still look new... will repurchase when my husband finally destroys these one of these days...</li>
            <li> Seriously the best clippers we&#x27;ve ever owned. Thanks for making an exemplary product.</li>
            <li> This was much larger than I anticipated. Also it doesn&#x27;t clip off cuticles cleanly like it does the nails. As a nail clipper it&#x27;s good...just too big for me.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble clipping my finger nails as I suffer from peripheral naropathy. This means I have very little feeling in my hands. Finally I found a clipper I can use.</li>
            <li> Too small for my larger fingers.  Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very nice clippers. :)</li>
            <li> very good quality product</li>
            <li> These clippers are very easy to use.  They don&#x27;t require much pressure to cut a fingernail and have a textured section to help get a good grip.  I&#x27;ve only used them a couple months, so I don&#x27;t know how long they will last, but so far I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very good clipper.  It doesn&#x27;t cut as sharply/cleanly as some of the reviews stated.  A little pricey.</li>
            <li> i like it, but for $15, it isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> Sometimes things just work like how they are supposed to....like this. Well crafted and it doesn&#x27;t break my nails. It cuts them perfectly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect in every aspect!  Sharp cut, good grip, doesn&#x27;t twist to slip while cutting (like all the others).  Well worth the higher price!</li>
            <li> I like both clippers (fingernail and toenail). Nice modern design but simple. The blades are sharp and cut well. I think the file on the top of the handle is really too short to be of much use. But overall I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these only to find that both done an excellent job of crushing the nails rather than cutting them. Both had the lower cutter extending beyond the upper. With my die grinder, I sharpened my 15 year old drug store clippers and they work superbly. I returned the Clyppi clippers for a refund and won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
            <li> I made my purchase of the Clyppi for my aging mother who suffered a stroke 8 years ago and is paralyzed on her right side. She is still fiercely independent and insists on clipping her own nails. I saw her struggling with a cheap pair from Wal-Mart and, after doing some research about your product, I decided to order your clippers. They arrived this weekend, and she loves them! She clipped her own nails with total ease while I observed. Thank you for making such a wonderful product for those that have disabilities. Since my own biological clock is ticking, I’m anticipating needing a pair of these for myself in the near future, as arthritis in my hands is already beginning to plague me.</li>
            <li> I knew this was a good product when I received a letter from the company BEFORE the clippers arrived!  Being a good person, I wanted to hurry and try the clippers and write a review, however I had just gotten a pedicure and manicure two days ago.  Yes, I am a male and no, I am not.  Anyway, I did find a toenail that Tina had not gotten even.  It wasn&#x27;t fair to try a fingernail clipper on a toenail, but it worked fantastically.  AND most guys I know just grab a clipper so here was a success.  It is build well, and clips even toes so there you go!  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I like how the material is very sturdy and very sharp.  It feels like it is a very worthwhile lifetime purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been in environments where a good set of nail clippers can save a lot of heartache, so I&#x27;m very happy I found this product.</li>
            <li> The first Clyppi that arrived had a flaw. I had already been contacted by Clyppi to get feedback on the product and let them know about the flaw. They immediately sent me a new item and followed up to make sure the product arrived. Not only is the clipper extremely good; the customer service is even better. I certainly would not hesitate to recommend Clyppi on both counts without any reservation.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with this purchase. These are way better than the cheap over the counter kind that you buy at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Just received my New &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34; Fingernail Clipper today, April 1st, 2014.  TRUELY AN AWESOME PRODUCT!!  I reviewed every fingernail clipper here at Amazon.  Bought this one, AND its true, With this nail clipper, cuts so perfectly, no need to file the nail afterwards.  Fantastic!!  (Can&#x27;t wait untill Clyppi also has a Toenail clipper.  B.G.. Mn</li>
            <li> Good product---good service</li>
            <li> Just o.k. Didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference from other nail clippers. Found my old pair from many years ago and like the old ones much better. They don&#x27;t make them like they used to. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers! They are very sharp, and very easy to operate because of the wide lever - so much better than those old-style clippers with the silly pointed lever.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered and received the &amp;#34;Best Fingernail Clipper&amp;#34; for men.  I immediately utilized it.  I found the product to be unquestionably the best fingernail clipper I have ever used.  The design of the device makes it very easy to do the job that it was designed.  In particular, the area that is pressed to make it cut the nail is perfectly designed for the thumb to perform the task.  The cutting ability is perfect also.  My wife will use it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack W. Fleshman&lt;br /&gt;Roanoke, VA. 24018</li>
            <li> These are great clippers, are well made and work well!</li>
            <li> Works great and very sharp. So much better than the drug store variety.</li>
            <li> Was really hoping that this would be a great clipper but I&#x27;m not loving it.  I find that the handle angle is too steep (65 degrees vs a normal 40 degrees) so my thumb slides off.  (I&#x27;m considering putting it in a vise and reducing the bend.)  I&#x27;m not sure of the purpose of the raised area where your thumb sits since it doesn&#x27;t add an anti-slide feature.  Although it is counterintuitive, I&#x27;m also finding that the clipper is too sharp.  The sharp edge catches on the underside of the nail when I&#x27;m trying to insert it or re-position it.  The filing area is much sharper than you normally see on a clipper, but it is so short and so far in from the edge that it isn&#x27;t very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this clipper is beautifully crafted with great fit and finish.</li>
            <li> The most gentle nail clipper that I have ever used.  It is easy to hold and the clippers cut fingernails so smoothly that I can almost get away without filing.  I really like Clyppi Clippers.  Now I want Clyppi Toenail Clippers.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d have to get some German steel import for quality, but this clipper is a beautifully engineered precision tool and comes with a lifetime  guarantee too.</li>
            <li> They were sharp for the first 5-6 times I used them then they dulled out a bit. I am convinced I will never find the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; pair of clippers but these are pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> Great clippers - heavy and sturdy.  It is very sharp, perhaps too sharp.  I really wish it had the little file/hook attachment that swiveled out so you could get at any dirt that is stuck under your nails.</li>
            <li> Very well built. Feels great in the hand. You&#x27;ll like it enough that you&#x27;ll want to keep track of it!</li>
            <li> My husband was looking for a fingernail clipper that was comfortable in his hands and made a clean cut.  I saw these and read reviews and decided to give them a try for him.  They work great!  He says that the handle works comfortably in both hands and the cut is clean and smooth.  He used to have a nail that would always split between trimmings, and that is no longer happening.  Would HIGHLY recommend these clippers!</li>
            <li> I bought everyone in my house a set of Clyppi Fingernail Clippers for xmas and they did not appreciate the gift.  As a matter of fact, they took it as an insult and immediately started looking at each others nails.</li>
            <li> Well made and very sharp !</li>
            <li> so much eaiser clipping my nails! you barely have to push it down! and i now have both the small and large ones of these!</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a nice fingernail clipper to see if there was any difference compared to drugstore clippers.  I had Tweezerman clippers but didn&#x27;t like how they worked.  The Clyppi is a much better product and I like how much neater my fingernails look.</li>
            <li> used the new Clyppi for the first time this morning and it works very well.  It is so nice and sharp and I really like the thumb piece being wide rather than tapered.  I have not been able to find a decent nail clipper and have tried several previously.  Nice product and keep up the good work</li>
            <li> These clippers are sleek, easy to hold/grip and lightweight.  They are helpful for me when clipping nails on my small kids.  The top piece popped off one time but I easily put it back together.  I also have the &amp;#34;Seki Edge&amp;#34; clippers but prefer these &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34; ones because I have a better grip with them.  Only con is that the blades aren&#x27;t as sharp as the &amp;#34;Seki.&amp;#34;  But still gives a clean cut first time, most of the time.</li>
            <li> Very sharp clipper.  You have to learn a technique of continuing a cut as you start in or you will end up with a slight jagged edge.  Fortunately there is an abrasive surface on the top that you can use to smooth out or buff down any sharp or ragged edges.  I use them on myself and my grandchildren and they are quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Best fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> These are very nice/ sharp clippers. tricky to use for some reason. worth $15 .</li>
            <li> When I first got it I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be powerful enough (since it looks pretty small in size) Turns out not to be a problem. Nice, clean cuts! Just good!</li>
            <li> It cuts nails, but don&#x27;t get fooled by the hype. This is in no way a better fingernail clipper than any other you find in the supermarket for 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and well-made. Pleasantly sharp for a clean cut. Comfortable design for a steady grip.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I feel that a lot of companies these days go out of their way to reinvent a common household product, slap a brand name on it, and make sure it is better than their competition.  I would say the Clyppi clippers pretty much do that and do it well.  So far, these are probably the best nail clippers I have ever used and the file on the inside of the handle works very well to shape finger and toe nails the way you want them.</li>
            <li> excellent, very sharp clippers.</li>
            <li> most perfect nail clipper EVER&amp;#62;\</li>
            <li> Fingernail clippers cuts clean and fits well in hand, a little disappointed in the small area for the nail file.</li>
            <li> These are great, definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Seem like a quality product.  Plan to hide them from my family  as clippers are often not returned.  No big deal for cheap clippers but I&lt;br /&gt; plan to protect these!</li>
            <li> Absolute, complete GARBAGE!!!  One of the first times using these on regular fingernails the handle broke off completely - using only normal pressure.  I would strongly recommend you keep shopping - these are the worst (hands-down) clippers I have ever owned - even the generic grocery store brand have always lasted me longer than these!</li>
            <li> The clippers are well made and sharp. The only thing that kept them from being 5 stars is that I find the space for my nails between the blades to be a little tighter than I&#x27;ve had on other clippers.</li>
            <li> I loved these while they lasted.  Came apart after a little over a year which is better than any other pair of nail clippers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  Wouldn&#x27;t say that these are worth the money, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Once you go Clyppi, you will never go back.</li>
            <li> The Clyppi is an excellent tool. It surpaced my expectations. I was looking for a quality clipper and it very much a quality tool.</li>
            <li> Best Buy for nail clipper&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold and to clip !.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice and a good grip on them.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bill</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 99-cent drug-store bargain bin clippers for years. I figured I&#x27;d pony up the extra money and try something decent, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. The Clyppis are rock solid, made out of nicely finished stainless steel, easy to handle, and have a broad end that allows you to get plenty of leverage. Plus, they are crazy sharp. The only thing that worried me at first was whether I&#x27;d be able to put a small chain or ring in the slotted end of the handle. I ended up putting on a small split-ring, and it works great. I&#x27;ll be buying more of these for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Fell apart several times while folding or unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;Last time lost the pin, had to tgrash the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Lasted 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Also made a somewhat ragged cut that always needed to be filed.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  Cuts nails great, durable. (Doesn&#x27;t cut cuticle skin as well as the cheap ones.)  Brought a second for a gift.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Quite literally, the best clippers in the world. Really well built, and they both fit in your hands exactly right and are sharp enough that they effortlessly clip like no other.</li>
            <li> It is fine this product , is just a fingernail clippers , not a Mercedes . It is also way much overpriced . You can buy a good one too from the store with 7-8 bucks . if you wanna pay 15 here . go for it .</li>
            <li> Perhaps I didn&#x27;t read the description adequately, but they were much smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> Not your average clipper, the kind you used for years and years,  This one gets the job done easily and correctly.  It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> I really needed some clippers for my fingernails that would do an excellent cut.  I was tired of all these cheap clippers I would buy and they really did not do the professional cut I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers had a great reviews and even though a little pricey so happy I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neat thing for me is that it nearly impossible to cut them too short by mistake.  To me these are mistake proof clippers. After cutting with these I barely have to take a file and even off any rough edges they trim that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now feel like finally I have found me a pair of wonderful clippers that when these wear out I will only get this brand.</li>
            <li> These did not come for so long I reordered.  There is no pointy file piece under the flipup part to clean under nails.  I have never seen clippers for Fingernails without that.</li>
            <li> These are nice quality, but the opening is two narrow for my nails.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much that I also bought the toe nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Well made and good quality.</li>
            <li> I lost a forefinger about a year ago to an accident involving a table saw and also mangled my index finger and had to have my thumb joint fused. This made clipping the the nails on the other hand almost impossible.  I have fairly tough nails. None of the clippers I had allowed enough leverage to clip the nails.  Also, the fairly narrow lever on my clippers hurt my fingers when I applied pressure. This clipper has a wide lever that is comfortable to my fingers. Also, the placement of the lever is such that it allows a lot of leverage without a lot of pressure.  Add to it that I have never had clippers this sharp.  I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> The clippers are great.  Easy to use, hold and less pressure to squeeze, should you have any arthritis in your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes the job much faster!</li>
            <li> it was smaller than I expected....it&#x27;s very sharp tho</li>
            <li> Great product, sharp and compact. Awesome follow up emails.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well. Clearly the product has tremendous attributes and is a quality product.</li>
            <li> I bought these for daily trimming of my finger nails.  I absolutely hate cheap clippers that bend, don&#x27;t cut well and are hard to hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers took some getting used to.  They seem to cut closer than I expected, but I learned how to use them &amp; they work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The are a little tough to hold onto, at times.  The top of the handle is very smooth.  I modden mine &amp; roughed up the handle with some sand paper.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to make it a lot easier to use.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Sharp and small. Quite expensive for its kind. When others cheapo failed it&#x27;s time to spend a little more.</li>
            <li> Clippers are easy to use and don&#x27;t slip off your fingers like small ones do Customer support is excellent they seem to care about whether you are happy with their product or not and delivery service. . .</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers i have ever had</li>
            <li> Great clippers! Sharp and easy to grip!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  As a guitarist I need to keep my nails trimmed very short, and the Clyppi does an excellent job; it is sharp, it requires very little effort, and produces a very precise cut.  (You could probably cut wire with this clipper!)  It by far beats any of the clippers I have tried from the local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy two Clyppis, one for my husband and one for myself. I&#x27;m glad I did. It is a well-made product that performs as promised. I don&#x27;t know how many nail clippers I have bought in the past and discarded, because they didn&#x27;t cut cleanly. All I want is a clipper that cuts well and doesn&#x27;t tear the nail. This one does the trick. Can&#x27;t wait for the toenail Clyppi!</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is very well built.  It cuts with ease and leaves a clean cut.  I am extremely satisfied and highly recommend this clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now compared the Clyppi to the Seki and the winner is definitely the Clyppi.  The [[ASIN:B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper]] clipper I have has a mushy, dull cut and the hinge pin always works loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clyppi Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Good feel and grip in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;-Sharp and precise nail clipping (the important part).&lt;br /&gt;-Higher quality, more durable hinge design compared to Seki Edge.&lt;br /&gt;-Built-in nail file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clyppi Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Pricey.&lt;br /&gt;-Wish it had the kind of swing-out nail file with the little hook at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;-Compared to your average drug store branded clippers, I find I absolutely *must* file my fingernails after using Clyppi clippers, as they are left with a very sharp, rough edge after being trimmed.  Same happens with Seki.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers. Much better then a more expensive one I purchased from amazon that was made in Japan. These cut much nicer, and no need to file!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love them and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper for my husband as he is very particular about the way his nails are cut. So many clippers cut like scissors instead of offering one straight cut like the Clyppi. He really likes these clippers but has one suggestion. The cleaning tool commonly found on most clippers would be the perfect addition. He&#x27;s blue collar and often get dirt under his nails.  I&#x27;ve been told by Clyppi that the cleaner/pick is being considered for future designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product!!  I like the look and feel of the clipper.  Thank you, Clyppi, for taking your customer service seriously. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> clips nails without drama,&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t work on hangnails at all,&lt;br /&gt;and smaller and more expensive than other options,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so its OK, but I can&#x27;t justify the premium price when there are many stainless quality options for 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice clipper, cuts well and feels sturdy in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and well made..</li>
            <li> Clyppi Fingernail clippers are a great product and a worthwhile Health and Beauty Care investment. The Clyppi Fingernail clippers were delivered very quickly and well packaged. The customer service and follow-up communications are both efficient and courteous. These fingernail clippers are made of high quality steel that is also ergonomically designed to fit the shape of your hand.  The weight of the clippers is an indication of a precision tool that make fingernail grooming and manicuring simple. There are no jagged or sharp edges left after trimming, each uses gives a clean, even cutting and the results after the first few uses have been pleasing. I am very happy that there is a lifetime guarantee on the Clyppi Fingernail clippers, they are extremely well made, but it is good to know that they are replaceable should there ever be a problem.  I look forward to continued use and great results and I am a very satisfied Clyppi customer. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I received these and immediately tried them. These are unlike any other clippers I&#x27;ve used- very solid and they cut cleanly. It took a few seconds to get used to the feel of them in my hand, but I have to say I really like them. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate in buying another pair if I lost these.</li>
            <li> Really great product.  Value for Money</li>
            <li> Fantastic clippers!  We live in a hot and humid climate and have to buy these often.  So glad I no longer have to worry about that.  A bonus is we will never have to replace them!</li>
            <li> I have used my new Clyppie nail clippers for about a week now and am very impressed with the precision with which they cut. Not only that but very little effort is required to cut through the sturdiest of nails. None of the clippers I have used in the past comes even close in comparison. Thanks - I shall be ordering more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - I have now been using these clippers for several weeks and, although I am still happy with their precision cutting ability, I am a bit dissatisfied with the emery \\&quot;board\\&quot; because it does not extend to the edge of the lever arm but rather sits as a \\&quot;pad\\&quot; in the arm&#x27;s center. In its current configuration it is essentially useless for filing nails unless the nails extend beyond the end of the finger. Redesign may be in order.</li>
            <li> Very solidly made and sharp.  I use them all the time.</li>
            <li> One wouldn&#x27;t think there could be so much difference in a simple clipper but this is a superb little instrument.  Splurge and get one!</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used.  Cuts clean with little to no emery filing necessary.  It&#x27;s unmarked on where it is manufactured which&lt;br /&gt;I found strange.  Wish it had a little carrying pouch for the price I paid.  HCF</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers, very sharp.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a quality fingernail clipper for a while, and I found it! I am very pleased with my new clyppi. It&#x27;s sturdy, sharp, and works great! At first, I was a bit hesitant to buy it due to it&#x27;s higher price, but in the end decided to give it a try. I have not been disappointed with my purchase. I am now planning to buy a toenail clipper by the same brand.</li>
            <li> Wow! These are great. Very high quality construction and they work better than normal cheap clippers! So glad I got these!</li>
            <li> Items delivered as stated in a timely fashion. Would recommend this retailer and product to other. Prior to these we were using tweezermans. We have no problems with those other than the women in our house constantly misplace clippers. This time I decided to replace with clypi and we like them</li>
            <li> Super adorable and functional clippers!!  I am SO glad that I purchased these clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so fingernail clippers are just fingernail clippers, right??  Actually, they TRULY aren&#x27;t!  I am not an engineer, so I&#x27;m not quite sure, what they have done that makes them work better, but they truly do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle, with it&#x27;s little notch indentation, helps when gripping the clippers and helps to prevent them from slipping..  The actual cut, it&#x27;s nice and firm...  If that makes any kind of sense..  It works well...  However, I probably maybe just have funky nails...  But, it isn&#x27;t just the Clyppi, but it seems all Fingernail clippers, the mouths don&#x27;t seem to be wide enough for me to insert my nail...  Of course, It as well as other things are LIKELY to be user error...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice clippers!  I can&#x27;t wait to try the toe nails out, my fingernails are probably tougher and shaped funkier than the average fingernail...  So, I usually use toe nail clippers for EVERYTHING....</li>
            <li> Good clippers. Wish I&#x27;d gotten the toenail size, but as good as these seem to be I&#x27;ll likely wind up with those, too. Sharp clean lines, and the brushed finish is more pleasing to me even on chrome clippers that are in good shape.</li>
            <li> Great product, costs a little more than most but ease of operation and excellent design make this a five star product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months, now, and it still feels brand new. I didn&#x27;t think a fingernail clipper could warrant a review, but this one definitely does. Everything about this product feels precise, from the construction of the product to its use. This clipper feels very smooth and cuts precisely with a minimum of applied force - no more slips. Highly recommended to friends and family.</li>
            <li> This is the first pair of clippers I have felt comfortable using without needing to soften my fingernails before using.  Typically, I will only cut my nails after a shower while my nails are still soft.  These clippers are so sharp and offer significant leverage that I don&#x27;t need to do that.  This is perfect as I bought these to keep in my desk at work for those times I realize I forgot to trim my nails and want to take care of it immediately.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  The clippers grip is wider than a normal pair and maybe a tad longer. However, I wouldn&#x27;t say they entirely suitable for large handed individuals such as myself.  Also, the &amp;#34;nail file&amp;#34; is so small it&#x27;s virtually useless.  Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with them.  They&#x27;re better quality than the cheap pair we&#x27;re all use to, but I wish they were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I ordered the smaller fingernail clippers, and I am very impressed. They are sharp and cut with ease. Just like a hot knife through butter! They seriously work that well. They are slightly more expensive than the cheap grocery store ones, but definitely worth the extra money. I recommend this product! 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I received them and had a chance to use them, I left a review for the manufacturer. They gave me a coupon for $8 off another pair. I will be using that coupon!</li>
            <li> excellent cut and style</li>
            <li> Great product.  I play guitar have have to keep nails on one hand cut close.  Had gone through many pairs of the kind you buy in drugstores, all I have tried including the big brands are of poor quality.  These are different, great cut.</li>
            <li> Cuts cleanly and easily</li>
            <li> I read the many reviews on this and decided to invest in a high quality nail clipper but instead got a nail clipper that is even worse than the 99 cents one.  While using it just for the second time after I first bought the handle just snapped.  I thought I got stronger from working out but I can&#x27;t possibly be this much stronger.  So the most logical explanation is this nail clipper just wasn&#x27;t of high quality and is just like any other nail clipper, in this case even worse than the 99 cents, which as least lasted longer than this.  Thanks Clyppi for teaching me that just because something is expensive doesn&#x27;t mean that it is high quality.</li>
            <li> my husband and I both tried it out and are &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34; !!!  The woman who said she no longer had to file her nails was right on point</li>
            <li> Great little fingernail clipper, heavier gauge steel than dollar store/pharmacy/etc. $1 clippers. I have another fingernail clipper I bought in a grooming set. This one is noticeably higher quality with thicker steel throughout. Time will tell how these will hold up to normal use but from my impression, it&#x27;s a confident little piece of gear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my new Clyppi once and it is sharp and more ergonomic.comfortable than the cheap drug store/vending machine/discount store ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are replacing a pair that I inherited from my grandfather.  They were made in Germany perhaps 50 or more years ago.by a company named Rex Cutlery Corporation.  Despite the fact that they&#x27;ve become a mite dull from abuse over the years, they still cut well, but they&#x27;re too small and the ergonomics aren&#x27;t very well suited for for my aging hands.  The jaw design of these antiques is unique in that the cutting edge is driven more like pliers than by the cam action of yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, In short, I&#x27;m pleased with the Clyppi, despite the absence of a feature to clean under my fingernails, they work flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while I find an item that proves to be the best of its kind. This is one of those times. The Clyppi Fingernail Clippers are the best clippers You can buy. Adjectives to describe them are: sharp, stylish, sturdy, strong ... They are as sharp as a Seki Edge but I prefer the curved clipper to the straight clipper. I get a closer cut at the sides of the nail. They are more stylish than any other clipper I have ever seen. They are very well made. Sturdy and strong. I only purchased the fingernail clippers to try them out to see if I wanted to buy the toenail clippers as well. Suffice it to say I will order the toenail clippers as soon as my cart has enough in it to get free shipping. Thank-You for a quality product Clyppi! I highly recommend these clippers to anyone.</li>
            <li> Best fingernail clippers we have ever had!  These clippers clip my husband&#x27;s and boys&#x27; fingernails accurately, quickly, and smoothly.  With other nail clippers there was always some roughness after the job was done.  The Clyppi Clippers are smooth!</li>
            <li> Great Clippers, would purchase another one if needed !!!!</li>
            <li> These clippers are awesome.  The sharpest clippers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> We were looking for some fingernail clippers that were sharp and easy to handle, as the cheaper variety were too small and usually dull.  We are very pleased with the Clyppi. It is very well made, sharp and ergonomically friendly. I would highly recommend this product, especially for people that have difficulty using the smaller clippers. The quality of this product is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> i find these clumsy to use. it is nice to have the greater leverage that they supply for tough nails, but the design just doesn&#x27;t work for me, making it difficult to manipulate them And to see what i&#x27;m cutting. the nail file Is much nicer than the nasty ones on most such clippers, but it is located in a place that frankly baffles me; i cannot see how one could possibly use it with the angle at which it is mounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wish the good Trim ones were still available. never equalled, and now unfortunately junk.</li>
            <li> Got these a few months ago and they work well. They haven&#x27;t dulled and are small enough for my nails and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best nail clipper I have owned. I know that sounds like an exaggeration but I was so disappointed in the nail clippers I had been using that I decided to run my own test. I purchased 5 different brands and compared them with each other and the ones I already owned. The Clyppi was by far the best.</li>
            <li> They look cool but they are really no that great.  They are awkward to hold.  The jaw opening is not big enough so getting them around a curved nail is difficult.  I prefer my cheap Revlon clippers.</li>
            <li> I was fooled by the clever product description and great reviews.  The design of these clippers is the same old design used since the 1950&#x27;s.  There&#x27;s nothing innovative or exceptional about them.  Their quality is average.  They&#x27;re very small.  They&#x27;re slippery to hold, like all the clippers at your local Dollar store.  These clippers are noteworthy in only one way -- their unjustifiable high price.</li>
            <li> Promptly after writing a dissatisfied review, the co-founder of the company contacted me directly to rectify the situation.  They pride themselves on having a remarkable product--and THEY DO!  The first one we received must have been a fluke!  I can say my husband is very happy after trying the second pair of clippers!  And I am very happy with a company that truly cares!  Thank you Clyppi!    In case you&#x27;re wondering how we received a second pair of clippers so quickly, we actually ordered a toenail clippers and fingernail clippers, but were sent two fingernail clippers.  That was also solved, we got to keep the sent in error second pair of fingernail clippers (that DO work wonderfully!), got a refund on the never sent toenail clippers, AND they are sending out the pair of toenail clippers for free!  Very happy camper here!    Original Review (10/6/14):  Arrived today and snapped in half during the first use!!  Not just that the two arms separated . . .the metal snapped!! Ugh!!!</li>
            <li> This is a bit small for my liking.</li>
            <li> I love the Clippers. I have never had a nail clipper that cut my nails as well this one. The built in nail file is a wonderful plus and it works just great.</li>
            <li> This is a great nail clipper!  Nice and sharp, and feels like a well designed tool. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother purchasing these, the company does not even list where they are made. For all you know, you&#x27;re buying a $15.00 Chinese product that should be less then $3.00 at a drug store!</li>
            <li> The best.  My family has ordered 5 toenail and fingernail clyppi&#x27;s.  Excellent quality.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have naturally strong nails that I keep a little long.  I bought these clippers so I could have a good set of emergency clippers to replace some crappy ones that I already had.  So I tried this Clyppi out yesterday.  It left my fingernails ragged and sharp, and I couldn&#x27;t get a straight cut to save my life.  I always cut my nails after a shower, when they&#x27;re the softest, which is what I did yesterday.  That obviously didn&#x27;t help these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already own a fantastic pair of clippers that I got maybe 22 years ago from a random beach gift shop, that still work great, but I don&#x27;t know what brand they are, so I can&#x27;t get more of them.  (I&#x27;d have bought a dozen at the time, if I&#x27;d known how great they were going to be.)  My clippers always leave my nails smooth and give me a good edge.  And I know I didn&#x27;t pay $15 for them, like I paid for the Clyppi.  Because the Clyppi was so expensive, and had so many good reviews, I thought there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;d be as bad as the dollar emergency clippers I already had.  But any price for these Clyppis is too much, and I&#x27;m returning them.  I&#x27;m very surprised these clippers have any good reviews.</li>
            <li> Purchased this  for my teenage son who strong, fast growing nails that constantly needs clipped for sports. He absolutely loves them and says he has finally found a clipper that is sharp, sturdy and easy to handle! He&#x27;s asking for toenail clippers now, which I am purchasing today. You must try this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful concept even better execution!  Looks good with great tactile feedback.  Matte finish is gorgeous even my husband likes the way it looks.  Workmanship above par, very sturdy.  Cuts sharply without leaving rough edges. Only better than a Clyppi is two Clyppis!</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are expensive, for nail clippers, but god damn to they make a clean cut.</li>
            <li> At first look and feel you can tell these are not your &#x27;average&#x27; nail clippers. They are superbly made and balanced too. There is even an indention in the handle for your thumb...nice touch. I like everything about these nail clippers. The stainless steel construction is much sturdier than your run of the mill clippers and it just looks good too. The &#x27;built in&#x27; nail file built is ever so handy and much superior to the traditional fold out style on average clippers. Most of all, Clyppi is built to last. This will likely be your last set of clippers you buy... unless you give them away or lose them of course. What a great gift idea this would be.</li>
            <li> This is a very well designed nail clipper and easy to use. It requires very little pressure to readily cut the nail. I was very impressed by the fact that Keegan Allen, Co-Founder of the company e-mailed me the day I received the clipper explaining about the amount of work that went into perfecting the instrument and asking me how I liked it. This was a class act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no writing on the clipper. I think it would be neat if the company name and email address was etched into it. I like the small rectangular stainless steel area for filing nails.</li>
            <li> I received my Clyppi about a week ago, and I love it. It cuts very well, and it&#x27;s nicely styled. I love how easy and comfortable it is to use. Unlike other clippers, it stays put in my hands when I&#x27;m using it, meaning it does not slip and slide in my fingers. Thanks for a great product; I&#x27;m going back to buy another one now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few years ago when it did not have a fold out nail cleaner/file and wrote the following review:  &amp;#34;I consider your clipper to be very high quality. It fits well in my hand and is easy to grip.  It cuts very well. All the high quality clippers I&#x27;ve seen do not seem to have a fold out finger nail cleaner that most low end clippers have.  I would like to find a man sized, easy to grip, high quality fingernail clipper with a finger nail cleaner&amp;#34;  Someone listened to me. This finger nail clipper is an awesome man size finger nail clipper with a fold out nail cleaner.</li>
            <li> Bought a pair for all four of us and we all love them. They are sharp and cut perfectly and best of all are easily handled. Plan to buy more for Christmas gifts for all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle.  Sharp, and does the job smoothly.  Fold up to put away.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these, they are not worth two bucks, as a matter of fact the cheap ones from the drugstore work better than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> There its nothing worse than dull clippers.  I bought two clippers recently, different brands.  Opened then eagerly and what did I get?  Dull, dull clippers.  Hardly went through my nail.  So, I went on Amazon, read through a lot of reviews and decided to give Clyppi a shot.  Thank you, thank you!!!  Finally a pair of sharp clippers.  I let my husband try them and now he wants me to get him one!  Awesome.  Thank you Clyppi!</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper... Although pretty much like every other standard nail clipper, it&#x27;s sharp and seems to be made of stainless steel (non-austenitic since it&#x27;s magnetic)... The nail file insert is pretty small but functional... My primary problem with most nail clippers is that the back ends are most often somewhat pointed and the natural pushing of the clipper onto the nail generally inflicts pain on the other hand... At least the Clyppi has a nice rounded back end... Some of the new clippers I&#x27;ve seen recently are designed to apply the clipping force in the direction of that natural push of the clipper on the nail... Unfortunately, some of those are either *very* pricey or not the greatest in quality...</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for my husband and me, and returned mine. While the quality was acceptable for the price, one of the two arrived in obvious used condition, which I find gross. I ordered the SEKI for myself.</li>
            <li> This thing is really well made!  I was so tired of the cheap nail clippers &amp; especially of how difficult they were to grip.  These rock!</li>
            <li> Nice finger clipper. Although a bit expensive but this product should be worth the price, it gives you clean cut.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these clippers! They give a nice clean, smooth cut. I had received the toenail clippers for review, and knew once I loved those I knew that I had to also do a review for fingernail clippers. Best clippers I have ever used!</li>
            <li> It does look and feel like a really cool little gadget so I get a kick out of using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The matt stainless steel finish is classy and it didn’t slip out of my hands the way my last nail clipper did – drove me insane!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very sharp and cuts right through my fingernails with no effort.  Glad I discovered this nail clipper.</li>
            <li> One of the best clippers I have had.  I would order this product again</li>
            <li> Best in class trimmer. Feels better in the hand and more efficient than the average clipper. Will definitely make sure I try not to lose this one!</li>
            <li> The clippers are very well made and I love the attention to detail your company has put into them. Great ergonomics as well.</li>
            <li> I like everything about these nail clippers.  The stainless steel construction seems a lot sturdier and won&#x27;t start peeling off like the plating on other clippers, and it just looks good.  The blades come together precisely for a clean cut.  Other clippers I&#x27;ve used seem to crush down on the nail before finally cutting it, making for a ragged cut.  Having a small file built into the lever I find superior to having to have a separate file attached to the clippers.  Most of all, Clyppi is built to last, not be replaced constantly when it falls apart, peels, or just doesn&#x27;t get the job done anymore.</li>
            <li> I received the nail clipper and it’s fabulous.  Truly.  It’s so sharp (therefore, accurate) that I don’t even need to use a nail file.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few different brands at the local stores, All of them were poor quality.  I took a chance with Clyppi, and I should have just bought this one first.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this clipper- so much so that I just ordered two more.  It&#x27;s built well, cuts clean, and easy to grasp. I could not find anything in stores that even comes close.  Get one. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are pretty great. Very sharp and made from heavy duty materials. I cannot stand to have long fingernails, so I cut them pretty much every other day. These do the job well.</li>
            <li> I received my clyppi and am happy with it. I would recommend a clyppi for any one need a sharp fingernail clipper.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to use.  I have arthritis and was having trouble with regular clippers, but these are easy to use and cut nice and clean.</li>
            <li> a very good design. sharp and cutting edge is smooth.</li>
            <li> Really neat little clippers!!</li>
            <li> 5/8&amp;#34; wide for the cutter and the length of the clipper is 3 1/4&amp;#34; long.  Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> I will have to say I read the Amazon reviews before my purchase and I couldn’t believe what people were saying about these nail clippers.  How could a set of clippers be so great.  After all they are just fingernail clippers.  Well I can’t believe how they fit my hand and feel when cutting.  It is the smoothest, cleanest cut I have experienced with any nail clipper, hands down.  It is so refreshing to purchase a product that exceeds my expectations for quality.  There is no doubt the only clippers I will purchase in the future is the Clyppi.  I am so pleased I am going to purchase two more sets for my daughters. This is definitely a grade A+ product.</li>
            <li> I like the clippers, they do a good job. I have a 30 year old clipper made in Germany by J. A. Henckels that I measure all other cutters by. Your product cuts as well and a little easier than the old pair. To be fair the old pair is old. I am pleased with the product. The fit and finish is superb, and I like the leverage that a long handle provides. My nails are so smooth that I no longer have to file them.</li>
            <li> I wanted a nail clipper that is sharp, precise and durable. I bought two Clyppi&#x27;s clippers - for me and for my husband. We both are pleased with this product. It is really sharp and precise; also, easy to hold onto - it’s not slippery. Clean cutting, doesn’t leave jagged nail edges.</li>
            <li> This clipper is well made and robust. Very sharp cutters. And a nail file integrated with the lever handle, and it&#x27;s much &amp;#34;grittier&amp;#34; than others. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> These are sharp and work well, but I really miss having a fingernail file that you can clean your fingernails out with.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 11 year old who has trouble with our regular nail clippers.  He found it much easier to use, his fingers don’t slip and it takes less finger strength to make the cut.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This thing is GREAT. Having had reconstructive thumb surgery on one hand and ulnar nerve and carple tunnel release on the other hand I have some strength issues in my thumbs,. This is far easier to use than standard devices. The wider lever is a great benefit. I&#x27;m goon to order another one right away to have when I misplace this one. Ordered it Friday evening and received it Sunday afternoon through Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I was quite impressed with it.  It is very sharp and cuts nails very thoroughly and efficiently with no snags or rough edges.  I was a little more cautious cutting my nails because you can tell when you set the clippers to the ends of your fingers that it feels a little different than the typical pair of nail clippers and I didn&#x27;t want to cut to the quick.  I may now have to buy a pair of toenail clippers to go along with the fingernail clippers I just received.</li>
            <li> The clippi works as described. It&#x27;s quick and clean and easy to handle. Leaves nails smooth. This is a keeper and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the best fingernail clippers that I have ever owned!  They are super sharp and cut my nails effortlessly.  The integral nail file is good too. I only wish that it&#x27;s area was larger and closer to the edge.  I highly recommend these clippers!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent clipper and very well made.I have some nerve damage from a broken wrist but the clippers made it easy to clip my nails with minimal pressure.It has a life time warranty which you rarely see these days so it assures me that they will stand by an excellent product.</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful product until it broke after ~5 months.</li>
            <li> What, are my fingernails made of butter? Cuts so effortlessly I had to check to see that they had actually done anything. Love a good tool!</li>
            <li> Awesome,totally awesome. Wish I had bought two.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned bar none!</li>
            <li> You need to use this several times before you appreciate the design and features. It&#x27;s solid and sharp. I like the emery board like surface under the lever for finishing off a nail. It&#x27;s slightly wider than what I&#x27;ve used in the past, making it easier on me. If they could only make a version that doesn&#x27;t make a loud clicking noise with each cut I make on my nails, I&#x27;m in cubicle land at work!</li>
            <li> I just used mine for the first time tonight - it&#x27;s TERRIFIC! I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference a real metal clipper made.  I&#x27;ve been using cheap plastic ones for a long time, and I can tell these clippers are much nicer.  Especially when I was clipping my dominant hand (holding the clippers with my other hand) - most clippers are painful for me to use like that.  These guys cut perfectly and with minimal effort, and no pain at all.  Thank you. :)</li>
            <li> chipped and damaged and hard to hold - had to take it back- too small and can&#x27;t believe all the good reviews-</li>
            <li> These are well made clippers with a good cutting edge.</li>
            <li> Wonderful clippers. I have reduced strength in my right hand and could not us a regular pair of fingernail clippers. These worked amazingly easy. No problem at all clipping nails. The price is well worth it in my estimation. I would not recommend your using them to cut fishing line when replaces a lure as they are too good, but would work great for this also but over kill. I plan to purchase a couple more pair. My mother who is 99 might even be able to use them..</li>
            <li> Fantastic. While you probably don&#x27;t think that a device like a nail clipper could make your life better, sometimes you just get pleasantly surprised. This is the case with this great product. Just using it once and I was suddenly aware of the years and years of using cheap, poorly designed and poorly made clippers. After my last cheap, local pharmacy-bought clippers broke, I decided to see if there was a better product out there. Boy, is there. I just didn&#x27;t have any idea how bad the cheap junk sold in most stores was! I just wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t break, but this far exceeded any expectation I might have had. I never considered things like sharpness or precision of cut or anything that this product delivers. Don&#x27;t waste your $5 on something that&#x27;s junk and just going to break. Considering how many times you&#x27;ll use this over time, this is cheap!</li>
            <li> I hate, hate, hate, crappy nail clippers.  I have a drawer full of the darned things that I&#x27;ve bought hoping &amp;#34;this one will actually work&amp;#34;.  They all stink.  None of them cut worth a darn.  At best, most of them leave ragged nail edges.  At worst, they squash the nail apart rather than cutting.  Now I can throw them all in the recycle bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clyppi clippers are definitely made well.  That is apparent just looking at them.  Holding them is another clue.  They actually have some weight to them due to the thickness of the steel.  The leaves are fused, not riveted, so it&#x27;s obvious the cutter halves aren&#x27;t going to shift around during a hard clip like some of the cheapo brands do.  The leaf thickness makes the cutters look more like quality chisel points than dinky nail clippers.  I like this, as it probably means keeping a good cutting edge longer.  These clippers really do appear to have had some thought and engineering placed into their development and construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do they work?  Very well.  I have thick nails and most clippers hack them to ragged pieces.  These cut cleanly and precisely.  So clean, in fact, that the nail edge is a little sharp.  A quick swipe with a file cures that.  The sharp cutting edges also mean very little pressure is needed, a relief since I have the beginnings of arthritis in my thumb joints.  The wide lever and body also make it much easier to grasp, again a relief as I have very large hands and thick fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy them again?  Absolutely.  (Though I likely will never have to purchase another pair if the initial quality impressions hold true)</li>
            <li> Very nice quality well worth the money</li>
            <li> The first set I got had a slight manufacturing issue and the blades where not aligned quite right.  The manufacturer sent me an email asking how I liked them, when I mentioned it they immediately sent me a replacement set without me even asking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got my replacement set, they are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could change one thing, I would make the filing pad wider.  I keep my nails short and it can be a bit of a trick to get the edges.  I am really surprised how nice the filing pad works though.  From the pictures you wouldn&#x27;t think it would.</li>
            <li> My wife and I were tired of the drugstore clippers that never seemed to feel solid in the hand or cut that well and often seemed to come apart.  I have not tried all the other brands to say if any other are as good, but I can tell you that we are VERY pleased with these.  I may be buying at least one more.</li>
            <li> Best finger nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever seen or used. Quality of materials, build, finish and sharpness of cutting edges are all excellent. Trimming nails and cuticles is faster, easier and quieter with the Clyppi. Doesn&#x27;t require as much of a  squeeze of the lever as the other clippers I&#x27;ve used. One smart design feature is the cutting edges get substantially closer together when you fold the lever down for storage, which both protects the edges from getting dulled by coins or keys in pants pockets, etc., and reduces the likelihood of the edges cutting or scratching other things (like pants pockets) inadvertently. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Well designed with stainless steel, not the cheap junk metal used by drugstore clippers. This is the iPhone of the nail clippers market.</li>
            <li> Just got this thing: well built/designed, and works great. Will probably get another one for the wife, and possibly the toe-nail clipper also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with mine.  There are so many poorly made products out there, this is a welcome relief. Really nice design as well.</li>
            <li> My old clipper was getting dull, so grabbed this off of Amazon. Very pleased with the clippers. They did a great job on my nails, and they worked great on trimming my cat&#x27;s claws too. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I used a LaCross clipper for what seemed forever and&lt;br /&gt;it was outstanding.  Alas, I lost or misplaced it a few&lt;br /&gt;months ago and after going through a bunch of drug&lt;br /&gt;store clippers, I decided to go “all-in” and go for the&lt;br /&gt;Clyppi.  I am more than pleased that it is all I could&lt;br /&gt;want in a clipper.  It’s great!  Once again you get&lt;br /&gt;what you pay for (mostly).</li>
            <li> This clipper is awesome!!! - I can&#x27;t believe I wrestled with the pharmacy brands all these years. I&#x27;m glad I found you - I just wish it would have been sooner.</li>
            <li> overhyped! what&#x27;s so great about this? it&#x27;s the same as the nail cutter i bought for 1/3 the price. I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Used twice, loved it.  Third time I used, handle snapped off.  Only 1 month old.  Terrible product.  Can&#x27;t get refund or replacement.  They say lifetime guarantee.  Inferior product.  Poor manufacturer.  Would give zero stars, but this is required.</li>
            <li> these seem to be great little clippers - if they stand the test of time then I&#x27;ll only have wonderful things to say about them</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the great reviews of this item. They were right. I may have to order another pair for my husband so he will quit using mine.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have owned a Clyppi.  It clips my nails evenly and smoothly.  They now look as if I have had a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> There is certainly nothing wrong with these clippers. They are very sharp and leave a clean edge. I like to keep my finger nails short and trim them at least once a week. For some reason unless you have some growth on the nail you can&#x27;t get the clippers to work, you just can&#x27;t get them to clip. I don&#x27;t dislike them but I have a difficult time using them.</li>
            <li> GREAT IN EVERY WAY.  MY HUSBAND&#x27;S FAVORITE.  CUTS, SNIPS BEAUTIFULLY</li>
            <li> This will make all of your wildest dreams come true</li>
            <li> Very nice.  I had no idea how lousy my clippers were.  The feel really good and cut very well.</li>
            <li> This is the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned and the seller is wonderful as well. The Clyppi gives a nice, even cut on thicker nails as well. I have really strong finger nails and the Clyppi didn&#x27;t leave them jagged. Great purchase!! Very happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one who would&#x27;ve thought there was a difference between nail clippers, but this one really does seem to be better.  It was easy to use, and the cuts were cleaner.  Beyond that, the people who make the product seem really invested in it, and I appreciate that kind of care.</li>
            <li> Frustrated with my normal nail clippers one day, I looked on amazon and sure enough their is the solution to my problem. As a guy with large hands, typical clippers are about 1 inch long and the bane of my existence as a necessary evil. I gave these their first clip and OMG where have you been all of my life Clyppi? Good weight, not too heavy but not too light either, and large surface area to easily grab on to when clipping finger nails or toe nails. An absolute must buy!</li>
            <li> I was tired of shredding my toenails with the cheap Walmart clippers I had. These work incredibly well and knowing this, are worth the price. They open wide enough to comfortably clip a couple of the nails that have a curve to them, and no more ragged edges! I&#x27;m happy. Haven&#x27;t tried the fingernail clippers yet but I expect to be just as happy with them.</li>
            <li> Appears to be nice, need more time to see the quality!</li>
            <li> Just received my Clyppi and it works fantastically! I will definitely recommend it to friends! Very sharp, leaves no jagged edges. I just threw all my other finger nail clippers in the trash.</li>
            <li> Clippers have fallen apart twice. Would not recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> My wife recently bought these [[ASIN:B00GQ0GD4A Clyppi Fingernail Clippers]]  at the same time as buying [[ASIN:B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clippers]].  Both are excellent clippers and deserving of their high ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if I had to choose between them, I think I would go for the Seki.  They are slightly heavier (32 grams vs. 25 grams) so feel ever-so more sturdy, have a 50% taller opening (making nail positioning that much easier) and are a couple of dollars less expensive (at the time of this review writing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t go wrong with either, but if are looking for the best, go for the Seki.</li>
            <li> High quality. Cuts cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li> These fingernail clippers are just as advertised.  They are very sharp and give a very clean cut.  Many clippers I have used are dull at the start and also don&#x27;t clip as easily.  Even though a little pricey, it&#x27;s better than having to purchase several in order to get a good cut.  Time will tell as to how long they last.  Previous clippers get dull after about 6 months; these are such  fine metal and I am hopeful that will not happen.  Also they are attractive, as far as a fingernail clipper can be attractive!  Love them!!</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper ever.  I am giving them as stocking stuffers for all my relatives and friends this year.</li>
            <li> Finally! Someone did it right! I will never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> I like the sharp cut! I decided to try this product because I had two surgery because of not clean cutting in the corner of the nails,this seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> Well packaged. Work great. Delivered as advertised. Kent Oram</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers, they are sharp and have a nice sharp angle on the lever arm making nail cutting more convenient. I like it a lot</li>
            <li> Great product!  Exactly what I needed.  Very reasonably priced. Don&#x27;t listen to the B-holes who are for some reason being negative! This product works!</li>
            <li> I just received my 2 clyppis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have one, and I ordered two more so I can keep one at the office and one in my travel kit, because if I have just one, Ill probably loose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Nice clippers, I have been searching for something that stays sharp, and well aligned. After buying several at the drug store that just dont work, and then purchasing a very expensive pair from brookstone, where the cutting edges dont stay aligned when you apply pressure to make the cut, I started looking at reviews online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours had a good review and price, so I tried a pair and was very satisfied, super sharp, and very good alignment!!</li>
            <li> The Clyppi clippers are the best clippers ever! Well worth the money; I did not realize that this kind of tool could be vastly improved, but it can, and these clippers are vastly better than any other clipper I ever labored to use. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I can actually cut my fingernails with the Clyppi which I havent been able to for a while. I have RA in my hands so they dont work very well.</li>
            <li> Good nail clippers, much better department store standby.  They have stayed sharp and cut well, have owned them for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> This clipper is great. I&#x27;ve lost strength and dexterity in my hands; this is one that fits my diminished ability. I ordered a second one for insurance against losing it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They worked great until they broke after 8 months of light use by one person.</li>
            <li> i use these for both my Kanthal and my Nails. So far they work very well. i highly recommend them</li>
            <li> Seems to be a great clipper so far. We really liked the built in file.&lt;br /&gt;Ill post back after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> opened up my new clyppi this evening.  I wasn’t disappointed.  Again the blades are nice and sharp and cut evenly.  No rough scratchy patches and if there would be an area I needed to smooth out, I could just use the file that is so conveniently located on the top.&lt;br /&gt;My husband was very impressed with the larger clippers.  He liked that the metal didn’t flex.  He also liked the clean cut edge he was left with.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, on the smaller clipper your name in visible but there is no marking on the large clipper.  If folks are anything like me, I will forget what type Im using without it written.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t get some nice clippers before.  They make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have been frustrated with the quality of nail clippers in US stores, I shop at the military exchanges as well. The Clyppi is easy to hold while cutting and cuts sharp and clean. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than the on the shelf brands but if it doesn&#x27;t fall apart in a year or two it&#x27;s worth the extra.</li>
            <li> I really like the Clyppi, and I&#x27;m planning on buying a couple of others as a backup for me and one for my husband. I have a KAI clipper which I like a lot too, but haven&#x27;t been able to find easy, so I opted for the Clyppi based on the glowing reviews. It delivers the same kind of precise cut without any ragged edges, that of course, is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> This is what a nail clipper should be.  It&#x27;s substantial and sharp.  Don&#x27;t bother with the cheap drugstore nail clippers.  I think they&#x27;re all made in the same Chinese megafactory.</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m impressed by the quality and ease of use for the price.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job.  Cuts sharply and cleanly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, Im OCD about trimming my nails and cuticles...  These are the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> I have finally found a clipper that works easily and smoothly!</li>
            <li> I love these clippers!  They cut my fingernails cleanly and with minimum effort.  So nice for my poor, arthritic hands!  My only regret?  That I didn&#x27;t buy the toenail clippers at the same time!</li>
            <li> Below you will find a rather scathing one star review I recently wrote. Since that time, and in response to that review, the customer service at Clippy contacted me by email and phone. They assured me that all of the reviews were authentic and furthermore that I must have received a defective clipper.  They offered to send me another clipper at no charge. Upon receiving and using I can now see what&lt;br /&gt;all the superlatives were about. These clippers made it feel as if my nails were made wax--they cut that easily.  There are, as others have written, no better clipper on the market today; and believe me I think I have tried them all.  In addition, it would be a terrible slight if I did not mention the Clippy customer support.  I though there could be none better than Amazon but now they have an equal..  So, again I apologize and thank you for proving me wrong. You received a corrected and more accurate review and I now have the best clippers in the world..  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this is the first time after several years and thousands of purchases that I  feel completely ripped-off by a product sold by Amazon. As you have no doubt heard, many so-called &amp;#34;customer reviews&amp;#34; are, in fact, company employees and/or PR departments submitting reviews. This can be the only explanation for the near insanely wonderful reviews for this product. I do not have particularity thick or tough nails and yet I could not cut a thumbnail using all my strength, and only barely cut fingernails.  They do not cut as well as the old Trim nail clippers you can pickup for around $1.00 at any drugstore. Oh they look quite nice with a very modern aesthetic, but that is the only thing about them that one can compliment.  I can only hope that Amazon investigates these charlatans and their bogus reviews as these kind of dishonest hurts Amazon&#x27;s reputation.  If there were ever an instance where caveat emptor applies, this is it.e where caveat emptor applies, this is it.</li>
            <li> MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER CLIPPERS I HAVE HAD</li>
            <li> I was tired of purchasing nail clippers from the market that barely work so I decided to pay more and see if I get a different result. It&#x27;s not that I was opposed to paying extra, I do believe you get what you pay for but it seems the options at a market or a general store were pretty limited. Amazon has everything so I decided to try my luck here and that&#x27;s how I found these nail clippers. I love them, they&#x27;re exactly what I was missing in every other clipper I had tried. Very pleased with this product! </li>
            <li> Awesome clippers! Very sharp and more comfortable in the hand. The longer base gives you more leverage to clip with and the clipper stays put in your hand. Nice Job.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift for my Boss while I watched him struggle with standard clippers. He has arthritis and get days where his fingers just don&#x27;t work. He came in the next day and said these are the greatest clippers he has ever used. He could trim all his fingers easily and the way the clippers don&#x27;t have to be squeezed low, he never felt he was going to drop them and had no discomfort using them. He said they are hidden from anyone finding them because they will be gone. He loves them. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Just got these out of the mail yesterday.  I am about to order another one.  Awesome clippers!!!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic nail clipper and you will be happy when you purchase it. I had purchased many cheap fingernail clippers over the years and this was absolutely what I was looking for. The vendor/seller is a great communicator and my transaction went really smooth and this is what Amazon purchases should be about. I recommend this product and vendor very highly.</li>
            <li> Yes! Best nail clippers ever. I have already hidden them from everyone else in the house!</li>
            <li> I never thought I would care about fingernail clippers, but I got tired of just smashing my fingernails down each time I trimmed them.  My old pair were very small at one end and used to hurt my fingers when I squeezed them together.  These are well designed being easy to hold are very sharp making a crisp, clean cut on the fingernail.  I&#x27;ll be looking at the toenail clippers next.</li>
            <li> Received &amp;#34;welcome/thank you&amp;#34; e-mail from seller before item was even shipped.  New nail clipper model incorporates user feedback from original version - it&#x27;s great that they so quickly responded to user comments with this new model.  The new one now has a swing out 2-sided nail file that is large enough to be practical (and also very effective) as well as a pointed fingernail cleaner (which I personally find much less useful, but other might like).  Personally I would have preferred a more traditional design wherein the fingernail cleaner is simply a sharp triangle at the end of the file rather than the current implementation of an angled edge - I feel this makes use of the file a bit more awkward to avoid cutting oneself with the pointed angled edge.  Also it would be better (IMHO) if the file could swing out while the clipper is in the closed position, thereby making it a bit easier to use.  These are all small criticisms of a great nail clipper which fulfills its intended use with great aplomb!</li>
            <li> Best clippers EVER! CLEAN CUT!  Feels as if they are ergonomically designed- easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging &amp; fast delivery!&lt;br /&gt;THANKSGIVING!</li>
            <li> What I do not like about this product is that it didn&#x27;t come with a nail cleaner.  Now, it does.  I wonder how many years it took for the manufacturer to figure that one out.</li>
            <li> good clippers. Does the job well.</li>
            <li> Say good bye to rigid, jagged nails thanks to the best nail clippers out there!  After years of using cheap quality nail clippers and toe clippers, I decided to make a change and picked up these Clyppi nail clippers after seeing the reviews.  They are precision sharp nail clippers.  You can feel the quality right out of the box.  I have very hard toe nails that usually look horrible after trimming.  These nail clippers cut my nails in one cut, straight across.  Because of that I my toes looked beach ready for a recent vacation.  My husband who has chronic ingrown toe nails has found that he hasn&#x27;t had any since using these toe nail clippers.  I let go of the baby nail clippers for my two children and just used these because they were more precise and quicker to use.  Because the nails are cut with a quality nail clipper, I have found both my toe and fingernails have been growing in very healthy and manicured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received these nail clippers for the purpose of this review, however this is my personal opinion and it was not influenced in anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few different brand nail clippers in the stores and but they didn&#x27;t make clean snips on dry nails.  These have to be the sharpest clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve only used them once since I just received them, but so far they appear to be a great product.</li>
            <li> The clippers work very well - much better than the cheap ones from the drug store I have been using. The nail file is different from what I am used to. It has an abrasive finish on both sides and seems to be more abrasive on one side than on the other. All in all, I am impressed with the quality and design of the device.</li>
            <li> These are ok I guess...not super thrilled.  They&#x27;re kinda awkward to hold actually.</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned or used. I bought both the fingernail and toenail clippers. They are works of art. They clip great and I can easily hold them. I have thick toenails that are hard to cut. It&#x27;s much easier with these babies!</li>
            <li> I have received my new clyppi fingernail clippers. I am waiting for my finger nails to grow back so I can use them again. I am a toolmaker by trade, so I know good tools when I use them... this is a good tool,  quality made and very sharp!</li>
            <li> Broke but quickly replaced</li>
            <li> I bought Seiki nail clippers from Amazon back in 2011 and was somewhat disappointed that they did not cut as cleanly as I had expected. So when I lost them, I got these, also on Amazon and so far, they are much better. The cut is always clean and smooth without any leftover sharpies. The file is really a joke but I have a little sapphire nail file I keep in the house for that purpose and besides, the cut is really so clean clippers are not really necessary.</li>
            <li> Used the product once. Felt great in my hand.  It cut my nails much easier than my old clippers.  Very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 and these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting something a little better, when compared to the dollar store clippers it seems it should be more curved.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted a really good pair of clippers. He loves the clippers.</li>
            <li> Great nail clippers for anyone with finger pain and/or weakness.  Very little pressure is required to obtain a nice clean trim.</li>
            <li> They work very well. Good leverage, clean edge, easy to hold and use. However, the finish is rough, with unpleasantly textured surfaces, and sharp edges. I&#x27;ll keep using them, but only after I polish them up a bit.</li>
            <li> Superb quality and performance.  Glad I ordered and tried one-- works really well.</li>
            <li> Just received and used my Clyppi.  Been saving up my nails all week.  It’s sharp, comfortable, and effortless.  Probably my best nail-cutting experience ever.  Nice work!  I had a nice cheapie that worked great (even if it wasn’t quite as comfortable and effortless) for many years... but then it broke.  I’ve purchased several other cheapies at the checkout aisle and have been disappointed every time.  Just couldn’t find that magic again.  Until now.</li>
            <li> Too small to cut my nails conveniently, which to be fair, size is probably listed, but still, the pictures looked like it was the larger clipper size. Also, ergonomically they are not good for me. They are awkward to use. Most importantly, they don&#x27;t clip well, if you look closely the top and bottom over-lap rather than come to a good cutting edge. Because of this my nails feel really weird and undesirable. Maybe I just got a bad pair, but this isn&#x27;t a complex machine.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best clippers I have owned.  They are very sharp and create a very clean cut with little pressure applied.  I play guitar, so I have to cut my fingernails a lot as well as very close.  I wish I had these a long time ago!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Clyppi nail clipper</li>
            <li> Well, Everybody loves this.  Guess why.  What&#x27;s not to love.  Great product.  Great company.  I&#x27;m on my way to buy 5 more.  You see I grow natural nails.  Yes I am a women and no their not thick from abuse.  I have had only one manicure in my life.  not my fault it was my husbands partner wife&#x27;s fault I had to.&lt;br /&gt;I have nails tough as nails.  They are thin and good enough to get me a magazine layout if I wanted--No, I don&#x27;t.I want them short for the wonderful journey left in front of me.  Keegan offered me a precision instrument to cut through the tangle of hard as nails&lt;br /&gt; that I need to tame to do my journey&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Mr. Keegan, I may have gotten a bit emotional there.  your product is great and there area lot of us Quads and paraplegics that need your tools.  I&#x27;m in there with the iron nails.</li>
            <li> I am a nail biter. To prevent biting, I have to keep my nails trimmed. My judgement of this product is versus my gold standard - Revlon classic nail clipper and metal nail filer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- This clipper is sharp. Cuts nails easily.&lt;br /&gt;- Solid metal construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- Cutting edge misaligned (perhaps mine is defective - sending it back - off about 1/5mm overbite)&lt;br /&gt;- Lever too steep an angle&lt;br /&gt;- Wimpy small filing area&lt;br /&gt;- Brushed metal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps mine is defective, I will send it back and maybe try a new one. But because of the misalignment, nails are not cut perfectly and still needed to be filed. I do not deem that a &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34; tool. Because of that, I can not cut hang nails well. The brushed metal looks nice, the problem is that the friction between the metal show wears quickly and initially makes it more difficult to open and twist lever back. Used a little oil and helps. The nail file area does a good job of filing, but too small to be practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed and currently does not find value (cost vs benefit). The hunt continues ... :(</li>
            <li> My Clyppi fingernail clippers arrived right on time. These clippers are far better than any other clippers I have purchased in the past. I plan to try their toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> I have always bought over the counter clippers. This is the first pair of higher priced clippers for me. There is no comparison, I will never go back to OTC clippers again. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Gave two clyppi&#x27;s for Christmas presents.  The recipients were pleased with them.  I am waiting at this time to purchase one for me.  They are currently out of stock.</li>
            <li> The company contacted me to put a review up within days of receiving my clippers. I refused as longevity is key for nail clippers. Having had them for over 6 months at this point I am satisfied and would order them again.</li>
            <li> I hate to admit it, but I bought these to clip my cats&#x27; claws because what was available locally went dull too quickly. Perfect for that, and my paws, too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!. We love your clippers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Clyppi fingernail clippers once so far, and they are WONDERFUL!  I&#x27;m hoping they will continue to hold up.  I&#x27;ve bought many clippers over the years that don&#x27;t last even 3 months and I got fed up.  I figured if I&#x27;d invest some money in a pair they would be good ones, and I do think I made the right choice with Clyppi.  If you buy them and do become unhappy with them, they have a LIFETIME GUARENTEE, so how can you go wrong?</li>
