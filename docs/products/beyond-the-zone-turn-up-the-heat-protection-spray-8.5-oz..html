            <li>and I have used so many.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I have to say I did like it much better now knowing the pitfalls to avoid.</li>
            <li>Received many compliments.</li>
            <li>Many people thought I got my hair done.  </li>
            <li>Okay product don&#x27;t use if you don&#x27;t like oily hair...</li>
            <li>Will be buying more of it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it does not leave my hair oily.</li>
            <li>Not only does BTZ smell wonderful and protect my hair, it leaves it controlled and shiny, too!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Best making hair serum for Flat  iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good hair protector</li>
            <li>Reasons I love this product is because it leave your hair smelling great while you are protecting it and getting it super straight.</li>
            <li>the scent is very sweet</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy, but it&#x27;s fine and frizzes easily.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is perfect!</li>
            <li>By far &amp; away my most favorite hair protection product!</li>
            <li>i really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>It will make your hair salon smooth.</li>
            <li>how lightly I used it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply when it was on sale (buy two BTZ products, get one free).</li>
            <li>I gave the one I got for free to my sister, and she uses it now too.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got that kind of hair that nothing but a trip to the salon will give you smooth, straight, frizzless locks, give this product a try.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great to use for non-wash days as a flat iron prep.</li>
            <li>I use it with a high temperature flat iron for the best effect.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to have purchased in this way, is fantastic, very grateful, it is easy and fast.</li>
            <li>I am super cheap when it comes to products, but considering I use about a spray at a time, this was quite the bargain.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable using higher heat with this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While that&#x27;s not 100% true, using this on my damp hair with a blowdryer as she recommended has made some pretty significant differences.</li>
            <li>You have to use it lightly - too much</li>
            <li>This really works to smooth hair and give it a silky, very straight feel.</li>
            <li>I section my hair and spray each section right before</li>
            <li>Again, just a quick spray on the ends is all you really need&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I Absolutely LIVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>I have used different heat protection sprays and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using hot tool on.</li>
            <li>Most products I use on my hair, especially conditioner and heat protection spray, leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this, I did not check its consistency.</li>
            <li>First, it arrived wrapped in plastic but that didn&#x27;t keep the contents from leaking during shipping and soaking the cardboard box.</li>
            <li>As the other ratings say, it smells amazing, but what my favorite part about this is, I just spray a tiny amount (one or two sprays) into the palm of my hand and distribute it through my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, lasts a long time and makes your hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>I have tried many heat protectants, specifically for flat irons, and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a product worth trying because it is so cheap.</li>
            <li>My hair is of the kind that never stays straight for long after straightening...but just a few sprays of this product and my hair is soft, manageable, great smelling and straight for the whole day.</li>
            <li>This time being very cautious about how I applied it, even first spraying it on my hands then manually applying it tip to root.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this product I was worried about my hair looking greasy, but this is not the case actually, somehow once it dries it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Smooth over ends first and the rest on the upper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blow drying, just a quick all-over spray on damp hair leaves immaculate looking blow-outs; even on my super color-treated, long hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if I didn&#x27;t use anything on my hair while straightening it would take forever for it to get straight.</li>
            <li>and I just really like it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair perfectly straight and shiny, not want so ever greasy.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really concord curly yet.</li>
            <li>I try to only wash my hair 2-3 times a week; this product doesn&#x27;t build up and keeps my smooth.</li>
            <li>Those experiencing oily hair are spraying on to much.</li>
            <li>Just gently coat.</li>
            <li>It cost as much to ship as to buy.  </li>
            <li>OMG this made my hair so shiny and straight</li>
            <li>or you risk a very shiny and greasy looking finish.</li>
            <li>you used too much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require that much.</li>
            <li>I have relatively straight hair, so a while ago a stylist told me to use this in my hair when it&#x27;s damp, then blowdry.</li>
            <li>My hair is bleached dry and this gives it a more normal texture after ironing.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, this weighed it down no matter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent heat protectant but very oily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use too much though, so be careful.  </li>
            <li>I bought this back im December and stull have almost a full bottle</li>
            <li>I love that is does not leave my hair greasy and weighed down</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older, but still have longer this hair, and to boot, it&#x27;s curly.  </li>
            <li>highly recommeded</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, with so much body.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly, dry and full of frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy - it doesn&#x27;t make your hair weird and greasy and it&#x27;s a great way to get your hair smooth and straight without using an iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>Frizz Zapper Anti Frizz Serum (I live in Florida,</li>
            <li>I put in wet hair only because you can easily spray to much and gets greasy.</li>
            <li>Have tried many more expensive brands and this is the ONLY thing that works for my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it daily before using my hot iron...</li>
            <li>The smell was so strong that I got a headache from the little that had leaked in transit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the product with a flat iron and it performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I first tried this heat protectant when I was natural and flat ironing.</li>
            <li>I think this product leaves my hair really soft, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li>Trust me, the heat activation completely takes care of this leaving your hair protected and shiny.</li>
            <li>This product does not make hair sticky, it feel natural, but seems to offer protection</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>So be warned not to spray it directly into your hair like a mist</li>
            <li>It works well on my daughters natural hair for a press, but for my fine limp hair it&#x27;s just too much oil rendering it flat.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and colored with blonde highlights and pretty dry with fly-aways.</li>
            <li>but I have not found anything else that works with my flat iron to give me straight, frizzless hair that lasts.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d only buy it again if they repackage it in a newly designed sprayer.</li>
            <li>After 3 months, I barely made a dent in the amount of product.</li>
            <li>Just be careful you don&#x27;t use too much at once</li>
            <li>I just use a little hair powder if that happens and it takes the greasiness right out.</li>
            <li>Some of the other stuff I have tried actually fried my hair when I used the hot iron after it.</li>
            <li>When I first do my hair it is left looking oily but after an hour or so the product \\&quot;dries\\&quot; and my hair is left soo soft and extremely shiny!</li>
            <li>The saying a little goes a long way is definitely true about this product.</li>
            <li>I try to air dry, and then use a flat iron to get it straight.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it really feels like my hair is being protected while I use the flatiron and my hair is not being weighed down by the product.  </li>
            <li>This product makes your hair very oily, even when only little is used.</li>
            <li>Was a little slow to ship, but it was ok.</li>

            <li> This time being very cautious about how I applied it, even first spraying it on my hands then manually applying it tip to root.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product I was worried about my hair looking greasy, but this is not the case actually, somehow once it dries it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Smooth over ends first and the rest on the upper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blow drying, just a quick all-over spray on damp hair leaves immaculate looking blow-outs; even on my super color-treated, long hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if I didn&#x27;t use anything on my hair while straightening it would take forever for it to get straight.</li>
            <li> and I just really like it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair perfectly straight and shiny, not want so ever greasy.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really concord curly yet.</li>
            <li> I try to only wash my hair 2-3 times a week; this product doesn&#x27;t build up and keeps my smooth.</li>
            <li> Those experiencing oily hair are spraying on to much.</li>
            <li> Just gently coat.</li>
            <li> It cost as much to ship as to buy.  </li>
            <li> OMG this made my hair so shiny and straight</li>
            <li> or you risk a very shiny and greasy looking finish.</li>
            <li> you used too much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require that much.</li>
            <li> I have relatively straight hair, so a while ago a stylist told me to use this in my hair when it&#x27;s damp, then blowdry.</li>
            <li> My hair is bleached dry and this gives it a more normal texture after ironing.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, this weighed it down no matter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent heat protectant but very oily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use too much though, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> I bought this back im December and stull have almost a full bottle</li>
            <li> I love that is does not leave my hair greasy and weighed down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older, but still have longer this hair, and to boot, it&#x27;s curly.  </li>
            <li> highly recommeded</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, with so much body.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, dry and full of frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy - it doesn&#x27;t make your hair weird and greasy and it&#x27;s a great way to get your hair smooth and straight without using an iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Frizz Zapper Anti Frizz Serum (I live in Florida,</li>
            <li> I put in wet hair only because you can easily spray to much and gets greasy.</li>
            <li> Have tried many more expensive brands and this is the ONLY thing that works for my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it daily before using my hot iron...</li>
            <li> The smell was so strong that I got a headache from the little that had leaked in transit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the product with a flat iron and it performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I first tried this heat protectant when I was natural and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I think this product leaves my hair really soft, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li> Trust me, the heat activation completely takes care of this leaving your hair protected and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product does not make hair sticky, it feel natural, but seems to offer protection</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> So be warned not to spray it directly into your hair like a mist</li>
            <li> It works well on my daughters natural hair for a press, but for my fine limp hair it&#x27;s just too much oil rendering it flat.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and colored with blonde highlights and pretty dry with fly-aways.</li>
            <li> but I have not found anything else that works with my flat iron to give me straight, frizzless hair that lasts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d only buy it again if they repackage it in a newly designed sprayer.</li>
            <li> After 3 months, I barely made a dent in the amount of product.</li>
            <li> Just be careful you don&#x27;t use too much at once</li>
            <li> I just use a little hair powder if that happens and it takes the greasiness right out.</li>
            <li> Some of the other stuff I have tried actually fried my hair when I used the hot iron after it.</li>
            <li> When I first do my hair it is left looking oily but after an hour or so the product \\&quot;dries\\&quot; and my hair is left soo soft and extremely shiny!</li>
            <li> The saying a little goes a long way is definitely true about this product.</li>
            <li> I try to air dry, and then use a flat iron to get it straight.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it really feels like my hair is being protected while I use the flatiron and my hair is not being weighed down by the product.  </li>
            <li> This product makes your hair very oily, even when only little is used.</li>
            <li> Was a little slow to ship, but it was ok.</li>
            <li> It can be tricky to use, learning the right amount of product to use takes a few tries.</li>
            <li> She said the results would essentially be the same as using a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am careful not to spray it directly on my roots and use on dry hair only with or without straightening.</li>
            <li> and I flat iron my hair a lot</li>
            <li> I flat iron.</li>
            <li> It does get hair pinstraight when using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Worked well with the Remington S9620 Silk Ceramic Flat Iron than I purchased.</li>
            <li> I flat iron it.</li>
            <li> Heat protection spray for use with the flat iron....</li>
            <li> I feel the flat iron gliding across my hair.</li>
            <li> It helps manage blow drying, curling, or flat ironing without damaging hair.</li>
            <li> Personally I cannot spray it directly on hair, I have to spray a LITTLE on hands,  rub together, and apply to section of hair</li>
            <li> But be careful because if you apply too much your hair might look a little greasy</li>
            <li> but overall it leaves my dry hair a silky feel and protection!</li>
            <li> when that happens, I just use dry shampoo or baby powder to get rid of the excess product and greasy appearance.</li>
            <li> I recommend applying it to damp hair rather than dry hair.</li>
            <li> I never blow dry or straighten my hair without this.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry before use its not too much or too little it gets the job done without weighing hair down!</li>
            <li> I have to use both hands to awkwardly spray my head, and it&#x27;s hard to direct the spray where I want, so most of the spray ends up going in the air or on the walls of my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> and it also protects from the extreme heat that is generated by my flat iron.</li>
            <li> The spray button just will not go down unless it&#x27;s at a very specific angle.  </li>
            <li> In comparison to other such products that leave my hair hard, this leaves my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> but I can buy a bigger bottle that costs half the price.</li>
            <li> Very dry.</li>
            <li> If you are having trouble with your hair being oily after using a small amount, I suggest starting from your ends and then work up with your fingers instead of spraying directly into your hair.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is dry, I don&#x27;t have any of the issues some of the other reviewers mentioned -</li>
            <li> you have finer hair like I do, the product may initially appear oily or heavy on your strands.</li>
            <li> And even with my heavy usage, a bottle last me 2-3 months, so</li>
            <li> I am a African american with really thick hair which is about armpit length, so</li>
            <li> I like it because it seems to protect my hair from the heat of the flat iron and does not leave a burnt smell, although it is a little oily.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday before using my curling or flat iron and it doesn&#x27;t build up or give it a greasy look between washes.</li>
            <li> Warning though: a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have cured lice in my kids twice with it by spraying and combing every other day for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> :/ Sending it back.</li>
            <li> Take note, you only need to use a small amount for each section, otherwise, your hair can get to oily and not hold a curl.</li>
            <li> cheaper even with shipping and does not make their hair greasy like other sprays.</li>
            <li> Other reviews mention the bottle leaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pressed so hard that I actually end up bending the BOTTLE</li>
            <li> (Also doesn&#x27;t create steam or smoke that some other products spit off, giving you a steam burn on the hairline!)</li>
            <li> , the sprayer is hard to push down and it won&#x27;t allow lighter sprays - just a big heavy blast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also have way less split ends because of it.</li>
            <li> I wish I had saved my bottle from my previous hair protectant</li>
            <li> For me I just have trouble pushing down the nozzle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily and makes your hair look dirty.</li>
            <li> living in a humid climate I needed something to protect my hair as well as tame it...</li>
            <li> the past couple years</li>
            <li> I hate hair spray, or other products in my hair, I like it soft.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find item.  </li>
            <li> The downside, which isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, is that this bottle sucks.</li>
            <li> this bottle sucks.</li>
            <li> and i use it at LEAST 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> It has an oily base which I discovered after quickly nearly saturating my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to take care of hair like that.</li>
            <li> Protects my hair, adds a little holding power, doesn&#x27;t smell bad after contact with the heat, doesn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel oily.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thin hair.</li>
            <li> but the stupid thing still won&#x27;t spray.  </li>
            <li> However, the packaging is terrible!!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I put in wet hair only because you can easily spray to much and gets greasy. Don&#x27;t have damaged hair or split ends and I flat iron my hair a lot so I assume its protecting my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used different heat protection sprays and this is my favorite. I like it because it really feels like my hair is being protected while I use the flatiron and my hair is not being weighed down by the product.  Will deferentially continue to order.</li>
            <li> This product does wonders. It smells like candy. And works great. I am a African american with really thick hair which is about armpit length, so if I didn&#x27;t use anything on my hair while straightening it would take forever for it to get straight. Reasons I love this product is because it leave your hair smelling great while you are protecting it and getting it super straight. And I use it about once or twice every week and one bottle has lasted me six months. Great Product and looking to buy more.</li>
            <li> Sent it back. The smell was so strong that I got a headache from the little that had leaked in transit.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair very oily, even when only little is used. I don&#x27;t think it protects the hair, just leaves it greasy.</li>
            <li> I think this product leaves my hair really soft, shiny, and manageable. It has a really nice smell and I just really like it. I give it 4/5 stars cause I thInk it does leave my hair kinda oily so be cateful with that.</li>
            <li> I am African American with 4a relaxed hair. I first tried this heat protectant when I was natural and flat ironing. I thought it was just ok and stopped using it. When I started relaxing again. I decided to give it another try.My hair is in love with this stuff. My hair is soft, shiny, with so much body. It works best if you spray it in your hands and apply it to your hair. I roller set my hair after washing and deep conditioning. After it dries. I flat iron. My hair always looks like I just left the salon.</li>
            <li> i really enjoy using this product. It leaves my hair perfectly straight and shiny, not want so ever greasy. one concern is, my hair always stay frizzy which suck but i would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have tried many heat protectants, specifically for flat irons, and this is one of my favorites.  it&#x27;s easy to use too much though, so be careful.  when that happens, I just use dry shampoo or baby powder to get rid of the excess product and greasy appearance. this also has a really nice citrus scent to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily and makes your hair look dirty.</li>
            <li> By far &amp; away my most favorite hair protection product!</li>
            <li> Excellent for combing out nits and lice.  I have cured lice in my kids twice with it by spraying and combing every other day for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> this is very good .......... the scent is very sweet i would recommend this 100 % i bought it to use at home and i will be getting another one.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really concord curly yet.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to have purchased in this way, is fantastic, very grateful, it is easy and fast., I love the product, protects my hair and leaves it spectacular.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length bleached blonde hair. Oily roots and normal/dry ends. This product smells AMAZING like cotton candy. It can be tricky to use, learning the right amount of product to use takes a few tries. Personally I cannot spray it directly on hair, I have to spray a LITTLE on hands,  rub together, and apply to section of hair I&#x27;m using hot tool on. When I first do my hair it is left looking oily but after an hour or so the product \\&quot;dries\\&quot; and my hair is left soo soft and extremely shiny! It does get hair pinstraight when using a flat iron. The saying a little goes a long way is definitely true about this product. Overall this is a product worth trying because it is so cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m blow drying, just a quick all-over spray on damp hair leaves immaculate looking blow-outs; even on my super color-treated, long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to use for non-wash days as a flat iron prep. Again, just a quick spray on the ends is all you really need&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have finer hair like I do, the product may initially appear oily or heavy on your strands. Trust me, the heat activation completely takes care of this leaving your hair protected and shiny.</li>
            <li> I would have loved to give this product a shot. The box smelled wonderful- but that was only because the bottle arrived without a cap and it leaked all over the box. :/ Sending it back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older, but still have longer this hair, and to boot, it&#x27;s curly.  I try to air dry, and then use a flat iron to get it straight.  I hate hair spray, or other products in my hair, I like it soft.  This product does not make hair sticky, it feel natural, but seems to offer protection, what more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product I was worried about my hair looking greasy, but this is not the case actually, somehow once it dries it&#x27;s fine. It should be called &#x27;shine spray&#x27; because that&#x27;s what it is. It will make your hair salon smooth. My hair is straight and colored with blonde highlights and pretty dry with fly-aways. This spray will make my hair look amazing. I am careful not to spray it directly on my roots and use on dry hair only with or without straightening. It is almost exactly like Perfect 10 Shine Spray. Same feel and look. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great scent (my friend&#x27;s boyfriend commented on it when we were styling our hairs) and it protects your hair! Whenever I stop using it/lose it my hair starts frying without it! But be careful because if you apply too much your hair might look a little greasy but overall it leaves my dry hair a silky feel and protection!</li>
            <li> Great stuff for heat control!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I try to only wash my hair 2-3 times a week; this product doesn&#x27;t build up and keeps my smooth. I use it everyday before using my curling or flat iron and it doesn&#x27;t build up or give it a greasy look between washes.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me at a beauty store. I like it because it seems to protect my hair from the heat of the flat iron and does not leave a burnt smell, although it is a little oily.  In comparison to other such products that leave my hair hard, this leaves my hair soft.  Therefore, I recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Smells good!  My hair was very dry before use its not too much or too little it gets the job done without weighing hair down!</li>
            <li> Just started using this two weeks ago. It&#x27;s a pretty good hair protector and I have used so many. Some complaints are of it being to oily, but for me that&#x27;s not the case. My hair has been colored blonde for like 27 years. It&#x27;s tough to take care of hair like that. Very dry. Those experiencing oily hair are spraying on to much. I was told to always spray in your hands and rub it together. Smooth over ends first and the rest on the upper. I don&#x27;t saturate my hair with products. Just gently coat. But I do like this stuff a lot.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, this weighed it down no matter how lightly I used it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good produce for heat protection</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent heat protectant but very oily. It works well on my daughters natural hair for a press, but for my fine limp hair it&#x27;s just too much oil rendering it flat.</li>
            <li> This really works to smooth hair and give it a silky, very straight feel. I use it with a high temperature flat iron for the best effect. Take note, you only need to use a small amount for each section, otherwise, your hair can get to oily and not hold a curl. Great product!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, but it makes my hair look and feel greasy. Even if I only spray the tiniest amount.</li>
            <li> Amazing heat protector and it smells great!!! highly recommeded</li>
            <li> I have VERY thin hair. Most products I use on my hair, especially conditioner and heat protection spray, leave my hair greasy. I absolutely love this product. I recommend applying it to damp hair rather than dry hair. It leaves my hair silky and soft. I will definitely continue using it and I recommend others to give it a try!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this, I did not check its consistency. It has an oily base which I discovered after quickly nearly saturating my hair. After reading reviews I decided not to return it and try it again. This time being very cautious about how I applied it, even first spraying it on my hands then manually applying it tip to root. I have to say I did like it much better now knowing the pitfalls to avoid. My hair is bleached dry and this gives it a more normal texture after ironing.</li>
            <li> Used it on my wig.  Received many compliments. Many people thought I got my hair done.  Worked well with the Remington S9620 Silk Ceramic Flat Iron than I purchased.</li>
            <li> The contents of this bottle - flawless. I&#x27;m using the product with a flat iron and it performs exactly as advertised. Protects my hair, adds a little holding power, doesn&#x27;t smell bad after contact with the heat, doesn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel oily. Fragrance is nice - kind of sweet - but it doesn&#x27;t linger at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself has issues. First, it arrived wrapped in plastic but that didn&#x27;t keep the contents from leaking during shipping and soaking the cardboard box. I&#x27;d guess about an ounce leaked out in transit.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the sprayer is hard to push down and it won&#x27;t allow lighter sprays - just a big heavy blast.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the bottle just seeps all the time so when you pick it up, your fingers are covered with residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d only buy it again if they repackage it in a newly designed sprayer.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, dry and full of frizz. Every day is a battle to straighten it and all that straightening takes it&#x27;s toll on my hair. Because my hair is dry, I don&#x27;t have any of the issues some of the other reviewers mentioned - I guess my hair is thirsty enough to absorb the extra oil! I section my hair and spray each section right before I flat iron it. (Also doesn&#x27;t create steam or smoke that some other products spit off, giving you a steam burn on the hairline!) It keeps my hair healthier and it helps get it flatter than it would otherwise, which saves me from going over the same section over and over. I moved to another state and was still ordering it from my hairdresser and having it shipped because I couldn&#x27;t find it locally. Have tried many more expensive brands and this is the ONLY thing that works for my hair. And even with my heavy usage, a bottle last me 2-3 months, so it&#x27;s a great value. So happy I found it on Amazon! Hooray!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two years and It is being used in conjunction with a CHI....I love that is does not leave my hair greasy and weighed down and it also protects from the extreme heat that is generated by my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have never found a better heat spray! Leaves my hair shiny and soft. Warning though: a little bit goes a long way. It is an oil based product. I use it mid shaft to ends because it makes my roots greasy looking. Other than that it is perfect!</li>
            <li> Hard to find item.  Great price and product is perfect.  Amazing what this product can be with firzzy hair. even spray</li>
            <li> Best making hair serum for Flat  iron.</li>
            <li> Heat protection spray for use with the flat iron....excellent product rating from both my Granddaughters...cheaper even with shipping and does not make their hair greasy like other sprays. I will buy this product again, they both have instructions to let me know when they are getting low....thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve seen for curly hair.  However, the product didn&#x27;t come from Amazon but, from Sally&#x27;s.  It cost as much to ship as to buy.  I&#x27;ll look for it locally.</li>
            <li> I loveeeeeeee this heat protection spray it smells awesome and gives your hair a nice shine</li>
            <li> Okay product don&#x27;t use if you don&#x27;t like oily hair... my hair needs oil so it works for me</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got that kind of hair that nothing but a trip to the salon will give you smooth, straight, frizzless locks, give this product a try.  You have to use it lightly - too much and you look like you need to wash your hair - but I have not found anything else that works with my flat iron to give me straight, frizzless hair that lasts.  Even in our humid East Coast summers.</li>
            <li> Smells good, protects well.</li>
            <li> OMG this made my hair so shiny and straight# I Absolutely LIVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It smells like candy...reminds me of the spice girls lollipops. And it works wonders. My hair is of the kind that never stays straight for long after straightening...but just a few sprays of this product and my hair is soft, manageable, great smelling and straight for the whole day. Also have way less split ends because of it. Definitely does its job of protecting the hair from heat. Will be buying more of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply when it was on sale (buy two BTZ products, get one free). I have been using this for 3 months now. As the other ratings say, it smells amazing, but what my favorite part about this is, I just spray a tiny amount (one or two sprays) into the palm of my hand and distribute it through my hair. If you are having trouble with your hair being oily after using a small amount, I suggest starting from your ends and then work up with your fingers instead of spraying directly into your hair. I am super cheap when it comes to products, but considering I use about a spray at a time, this was quite the bargain. After 3 months, I barely made a dent in the amount of product. I gave the one I got for free to my sister, and she uses it now too. I have frizzy wavy hair, and it always makes it silky. I follow up with BTZ&#x27;s product Frizz Zapper Anti Frizz Serum (I live in Florida, the heat spells disaster for my frizz) I couldn&#x27;t find the product online or on Sally&#x27;s website, which makes me wonder if they sell it anymore.</li>
            <li> great product fast and easy shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I never blow dry or straighten my hair without this. It protects my hair and it makes it shine.I  recommend it</li>
            <li> This Smells Wonderful! I feel the flat iron gliding across my hair. I feel comfortable using higher heat with this. The downside, which isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, is that this bottle sucks. Other reviews mention the bottle leaking. For me I just have trouble pushing down the nozzle. Also be warned this is oily, which is neither pro nor con but some people have preferences. So be warned not to spray it directly into your hair like a mist or you risk a very shiny and greasy looking finish.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing but I can buy a bigger bottle that costs half the price. At Sally&#x27;s. And if your hair came out oily and dirtt feeling its not the product its cause you used too much. It doesn&#x27;t require that much. My dad is a hairstylist and uses this product on all his clients. You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does not leave my hair oily. It helps manage blow drying, curling, or flat ironing without damaging hair.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. I use it daily before using my hot iron...it definitely helps protect my hair. Some of the other stuff I have tried actually fried my hair when I used the hot iron after it. This doesn&#x27;t do that. Just be careful you don&#x27;t use too much at once or it will make your hair a bit greasy. I just use a little hair powder if that happens and it takes the greasiness right out.</li>
            <li> living in a humid climate I needed something to protect my hair as well as tame it... This does both!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> My favorite product to use before I straighten my hair! I have used it for years! Smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> The product itself is nice and smells good.  However, the packaging is terrible!!!  For the life of me, I cannot hold the bottle in one hand and spray.  The spray button just will not go down unless it&#x27;s at a very specific angle.  I&#x27;ve pressed so hard that I actually end up bending the BOTTLE but the stupid thing still won&#x27;t spray.  I have to use both hands to awkwardly spray my head, and it&#x27;s hard to direct the spray where I want, so most of the spray ends up going in the air or on the walls of my bathroom.  I wish I had saved my bottle from my previous hair protectant so I could just transfer this product to THAT bottle... this bottle sucks.</li>
            <li> I bought this back im December and stull have almost a full bottle and i use it at LEAST 4 times a week. Smells amazing! Like candy almost. And leaves my hair SO silky and lasts all day. Whenever i run out i will buy again. Has become a must have in ny beauty supply</li>
            <li> A girl at work bought this spray from a beauty supply outlet in town and offered to let me try it. My hair is healthy, but it&#x27;s fine and frizzes easily. Not only does BTZ smell wonderful and protect my hair, it leaves it controlled and shiny, too!</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I have relatively straight hair, so a while ago a stylist told me to use this in my hair when it&#x27;s damp, then blowdry. She said the results would essentially be the same as using a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While that&#x27;s not 100% true, using this on my damp hair with a blowdryer as she recommended has made some pretty significant differences. It smells good, works well, feels great. It&#x27;s not too heavy - it doesn&#x27;t make your hair weird and greasy and it&#x27;s a great way to get your hair smooth and straight without using an iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past couple years I&#x27;ve tried similar products but none work like this one. It&#x27;s easy to use, lasts a long time and makes your hair super shiny. Best of all, it holds! Buy it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Was a little slow to ship, but it was ok. Product arrived in perfect condition!!</li>
