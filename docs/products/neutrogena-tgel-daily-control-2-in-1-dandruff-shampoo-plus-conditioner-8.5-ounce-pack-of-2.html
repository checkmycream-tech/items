            <li>Great product I will be ordering more.</li>

            <li>Always awesome to have something in a 2 pack that&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The addition of the conditioner is nice too.</li>
            <li>I thought that the price on amazon was good too, considering I paid more than $7 at CVS.</li>

            <li>Excellent shampoo removed all the itching problem and is more soft than the tgel and the smell is very good and leave your hair smooth</li>
            <li>bought this shampoo for my wife and she said she would like to order it again when she runs out which means it is pretty good!</li>
            <li>So far is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is nicely scented (very mild)</li>
            <li>Other shampoos are more glamorous because of the font on the bottles, the sassy commercials and the fragrance but lets keep it true and honest, noone looks like the people on those commercials anyway and beautiful or &#x27;ideal&#x27; hair is a matter of genetics and has nothing to do with whats in a plastic bottle, until now...</li>
            <li>It make my dandruff situation better but not did not solve it 100%.</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it to anyone concerned about looking their best.</li>
            <li>This stuff works wayyyyyyy better then</li>
            <li>T-Sal works much better in dandruff control.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>He used to use a Head and Shoilders shampoo but finds this one to work much better.</li>
            <li>You are a lifesaver! :)</li>
            <li>This product WORKS like t-sal but smells soooooooo much better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works more like a shampoo than a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I use this as a shampoo and prefer a thicker more hydrating conditioner.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena&#x27;s T/Gel &amp; T/Sal Products.</li>
            <li>I love saving time using the 2 in 1</li>
            <li>I used coal tar based shampoo to relieve scalp itch for many years.</li>
            <li>So cheap!</li>
            <li>So far that one use was great.</li>
            <li>This product works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>My scalp is very sensitive and over the years I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos in every price range - even supposedly miracle shampoos with their own infomercials.</li>
            <li>He still has a bit of dandruff occasionally, but the shampoo definitely greatly decreases his dandruff.</li>
            <li>At last, I&#x27;ve found a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp and makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li>It fortunately worked well for me.</li>
            <li>The product itself works fantastic.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but far superior to Head &amp; Shoulders in terms of dandruff control.</li>
            <li>As good as the old style with separate shampoo and rinses.  </li>
            <li>Daily shampoo has had remarkable effect for me.</li>
            <li>It looks clean even if I skip a day of washing.</li>
            <li>It works ok, but not as good as the other T/Gel.</li>
            <li>I really also like that it&#x27;s pretty nice smelling.</li>
            <li>It is a good price for a double set, I keep one in the gym bag and one in the shower.</li>
            <li>Had to use a bottle of this before I got rid of dandruff good stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like that selson blue stuff</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is one of my favorite brands and it really lives up to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this product successfully for years for dry scalp.</li>
            <li>Just a wonderfully clean and fresh head of hair.</li>
            <li>Its mild and lather&#x27;s well.</li>
            <li>I have drier hair and scalp in the winter and needed something that would help soothe my scalp and not end up making my hair super greasy.</li>
            <li>This the best shampoo/conditioner on the market for those who suffer with anything related to dry scalp, e.g. dermatitis, rosacea, etc.</li>
            <li>It is very important however to get a lot of the product in your hair and really scrub and work it in and leave it for 3-5 minutes to really work.</li>
            <li>I have resorted to buying DHS tar shampoo which has amazing reviews and will switch back to this once my condition is almost improved.</li>
            <li>I do not know what&#x27;s in these ingredients that could be that powerful</li>
            <li>can only speak from my own experience and this stuff is a hero.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t have a medicated smell, It just has a fresh out of the shower smell.</li>
            <li>and I love that I can use it frequently</li>
            <li>It cleared my hair right up after two washes.</li>
            <li>While this is a very good product, I found that it has the exact same content as Head &amp; Shoulders and every house brand that CVS, Costco, Safeway, and Giant Foods offers.  </li>
            <li>I used exactly how it said on the bottle</li>
            <li>This is very lite and fun to use, I look forward to using it becauss</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Might be better for others, but I will probably go back to my first one.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today I tried this Tgel for the first time and</li>
            <li>I have been using the original T/Gel since the early 90s.</li>
            <li>The smell was an issue for me at first too, But this product really works.</li>
            <li>I suffer from a very dry scalp and the original T/Gel extra strength was amazing for it.</li>
            <li>I got this for a good price but one bottle was only half full.</li>
            <li>It does seem to dry the scalp out more</li>
            <li>It is not something I would want to use daily, however, so this milder version is a good compromise for the person who needs to use something daily.&lt;br /&gt;In summary:&lt;br /&gt;-works decent for the daily user</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and all was packed with care.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I expected more from this.</li>
            <li>This stuff is surprisingly gentle but defiantly works miricles within two uses.</li>
            <li>Packaged out of sealed paper box, unlike stores, hoping it&#x27;s the real thing for the person intended to be given to.</li>
            <li>The conditioner really helps keep the moisture in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient, and I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Its like &#x27;yaye, Im normal now!&#x27;</li>
            <li>He gave me a sample that works better than any other product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of greenish and kind of reminds me of some kind of thin silly putty</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really Ideal about this product is that even though it&#x27;s medicated it&#x27;s very gentle and delicate, it&#x27;s not like your average shampoo that feels like dish detergant on your scalp.</li>
            <li>For my hair type ( thick, curly and coarse but manageable) I get best results when combined with aussie 3 minute deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>And, since my scalp is no longer irritated, my hair seems to be growing in better and falling out less.</li>
            <li>I read so many different reviews about different products.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay a larger amount of money for a different product that was an &amp;#34;upscale&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li>I feel that it is similar to any head and shoulders product and with head and shoulders, you have different scents and get more in the bottle.</li>
            <li>went back to Free &amp; Clear shampoo and conditioner that my dermatologist had</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know too much, only used it once, it says safe for daily use and dye hair...</li>
            <li>but I remember back in 2009 I used it for the very first time and it immediately calmed and soothed my scalp.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suggestion: Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>One day, I read a review about the new two and one combo.</li>
            <li>After my hair dried I spent a good 10-15 minutes tossling my hair and scrubbing my scalp all over my head to break it all up and get it out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Absolutely not going back to any other brand of shampoo, I&#x27;m sticking to this product because IT WORKS AMAZINGLY!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I contributed it to the large amounts of hairspray that I used back then.</li>
            <li>(Might have to switch back in the winter when the air gets much dryer.)</li>
            <li>but I feel like this stuff is gentle enough for me to continue using it to just get it gone and over with once in for all!</li>
            <li>I have a very sensible head skin, then my doctor recommended this shampoo to be used daily 5 days a week, shifted by another (medicated)</li>
            <li>it was gone completely</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my 70 year old mother in law who was having a problem with dandruff.  </li>
            <li>By the third day my scalp was much improved.</li>
            <li>And I have thick semi curly/wavy hair so in sure that doesn&#x27;t make things easier.</li>
            <li>I finally can wash my hair like a normal person without worrying about my head feeling burnt and stripped of all its natural protectors.</li>
            <li>Finally I&#x27;m not self conscious of my flaky itchy scalp!!</li>
            <li>One bottle of this and things were back to normal.</li>
            <li>I have used every type of shampoo for daily dandruff control and this one really works with no strange smell.</li>
            <li>I normally used the regular T/Gel, but thought I would give this a shot.</li>
            <li>Dry and very itchy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works as advertised, smells great and is a little less harsh on my color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of an odd consistency though not like usual shampoo.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Never had dandruff til recently and saw how highly rated this was (Neutrogena T-Gel 2 in 1 Daily Control Shampoo 8.5 fl oz)</li>
            <li>I generally use it for a week if I start to have a dandruff problem, and it knocks it out for 4-6 months.</li>
            <li>Will purchase again in near future.  </li>
            <li>Back then I developed a spot of what appears to be Psoriasis.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no harsh chemical odor and it not only helped get rid of the flakes but soothed my red inflamed patches too.</li>
            <li>Recently had some major scalp issues.</li>
            <li>I was desperate to find out good shampoo for my dry scalp with flakes.</li>
            <li>so I switched to the T/Gel, but at least the itching and flaking were considerably less with the Free &amp; Clear.</li>

            <li> I have used this product successfully for years for dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Just a wonderfully clean and fresh head of hair.</li>
            <li> Its mild and lather&#x27;s well.</li>
            <li> I have drier hair and scalp in the winter and needed something that would help soothe my scalp and not end up making my hair super greasy.</li>
            <li> This the best shampoo/conditioner on the market for those who suffer with anything related to dry scalp, e.g. dermatitis, rosacea, etc.</li>
            <li> It is very important however to get a lot of the product in your hair and really scrub and work it in and leave it for 3-5 minutes to really work.</li>
            <li> I have resorted to buying DHS tar shampoo which has amazing reviews and will switch back to this once my condition is almost improved.</li>
            <li> I do not know what&#x27;s in these ingredients that could be that powerful</li>
            <li> can only speak from my own experience and this stuff is a hero.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t have a medicated smell, It just has a fresh out of the shower smell.</li>
            <li> and I love that I can use it frequently</li>
            <li> It cleared my hair right up after two washes.</li>
            <li> While this is a very good product, I found that it has the exact same content as Head &amp; Shoulders and every house brand that CVS, Costco, Safeway, and Giant Foods offers.  </li>
            <li> I used exactly how it said on the bottle</li>
            <li> This is very lite and fun to use, I look forward to using it becauss</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Might be better for others, but I will probably go back to my first one.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I tried this Tgel for the first time and</li>
            <li> I have been using the original T/Gel since the early 90s.</li>
            <li> The smell was an issue for me at first too, But this product really works.</li>
            <li> I suffer from a very dry scalp and the original T/Gel extra strength was amazing for it.</li>
            <li> I got this for a good price but one bottle was only half full.</li>
            <li> It does seem to dry the scalp out more</li>
            <li> It is not something I would want to use daily, however, so this milder version is a good compromise for the person who needs to use something daily.&lt;br /&gt;In summary:&lt;br /&gt;-works decent for the daily user</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and all was packed with care.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is surprisingly gentle but defiantly works miricles within two uses.</li>
            <li> Packaged out of sealed paper box, unlike stores, hoping it&#x27;s the real thing for the person intended to be given to.</li>
            <li> The conditioner really helps keep the moisture in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient, and I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Its like &#x27;yaye, Im normal now!&#x27;</li>
            <li> He gave me a sample that works better than any other product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of greenish and kind of reminds me of some kind of thin silly putty</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really Ideal about this product is that even though it&#x27;s medicated it&#x27;s very gentle and delicate, it&#x27;s not like your average shampoo that feels like dish detergant on your scalp.</li>
            <li> For my hair type ( thick, curly and coarse but manageable) I get best results when combined with aussie 3 minute deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> And, since my scalp is no longer irritated, my hair seems to be growing in better and falling out less.</li>
            <li> I read so many different reviews about different products.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay a larger amount of money for a different product that was an &amp;#34;upscale&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li> I feel that it is similar to any head and shoulders product and with head and shoulders, you have different scents and get more in the bottle.</li>
            <li> went back to Free &amp; Clear shampoo and conditioner that my dermatologist had</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know too much, only used it once, it says safe for daily use and dye hair...</li>
            <li> but I remember back in 2009 I used it for the very first time and it immediately calmed and soothed my scalp.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suggestion: Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> One day, I read a review about the new two and one combo.</li>
            <li> After my hair dried I spent a good 10-15 minutes tossling my hair and scrubbing my scalp all over my head to break it all up and get it out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not going back to any other brand of shampoo, I&#x27;m sticking to this product because IT WORKS AMAZINGLY!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I contributed it to the large amounts of hairspray that I used back then.</li>
            <li> (Might have to switch back in the winter when the air gets much dryer.)</li>
            <li> but I feel like this stuff is gentle enough for me to continue using it to just get it gone and over with once in for all!</li>
            <li> I have a very sensible head skin, then my doctor recommended this shampoo to be used daily 5 days a week, shifted by another (medicated)</li>
            <li> it was gone completely</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 70 year old mother in law who was having a problem with dandruff.  </li>
            <li> By the third day my scalp was much improved.</li>
            <li> And I have thick semi curly/wavy hair so in sure that doesn&#x27;t make things easier.</li>
            <li> I finally can wash my hair like a normal person without worrying about my head feeling burnt and stripped of all its natural protectors.</li>
            <li> Finally I&#x27;m not self conscious of my flaky itchy scalp!!</li>
            <li> One bottle of this and things were back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have used every type of shampoo for daily dandruff control and this one really works with no strange smell.</li>
            <li> I normally used the regular T/Gel, but thought I would give this a shot.</li>
            <li> Dry and very itchy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works as advertised, smells great and is a little less harsh on my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of an odd consistency though not like usual shampoo.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Never had dandruff til recently and saw how highly rated this was (Neutrogena T-Gel 2 in 1 Daily Control Shampoo 8.5 fl oz)</li>
            <li> I generally use it for a week if I start to have a dandruff problem, and it knocks it out for 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> Will purchase again in near future.  </li>
            <li> Back then I developed a spot of what appears to be Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no harsh chemical odor and it not only helped get rid of the flakes but soothed my red inflamed patches too.</li>
            <li> Recently had some major scalp issues.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find out good shampoo for my dry scalp with flakes.</li>
            <li> so I switched to the T/Gel, but at least the itching and flaking were considerably less with the Free &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product other than it actually works is that it doesn&#x27;t smell bad!!</li>
            <li> &quot; It actually uses a completely different active ingredient than T/Gel.</li>
            <li> Using H &amp; S for a long time.</li>
            <li> After a long search, saw this in the store shelf and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> My entire scalp felt tight and my forehead above the temples began flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way that dandruff shampoo advertising is highly fraudulent.  </li>
            <li> my head was so damn dry</li>
            <li> I have switched back to the fruity scents a few times, but have always had to come back to T/Gel.</li>
            <li> #1 was like super expensive and this is $5.99</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t strip the color out of my hair and dry it out like other medicated shampoos.</li>
            <li> and when your hair dries you might be shocked to see even MORE dandruff.</li>
            <li> This product in conjunction with neutrogena&#x27;s other T gel shampoos (tar and salicylic acid) help keep my scalp from becoming dry, irritated, and painful.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this shit works, and fast.</li>
            <li> I really like the subtle scent of this shampoo, and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life saver, My scalp was extremely itchy due to PSORIASIS.</li>
            <li> I shampoo with it about every other day.</li>
            <li> When that was banned in Calofornia I had to load up when traveling to other states.</li>
            <li> The other products I have used are Pantene, Head and Shoulders, Dove, Suave, etc.</li>
            <li> It loosens up the dry dead skin so that the flakes can be removed from your head.</li>
            <li> all the rest, if you suffer from very dry itchy scalp!!  </li>
            <li> cuz I hate strong scented stuff, and it lathers like a dream.</li>
            <li> , I let it stand on my head for a few minutes</li>
            <li> but he really disliked the smell.</li>
            <li> When I started using this my dandruff went away but after two weeks it came back worse.</li>
            <li> No more itching, flakes are gone.</li>
            <li> I had itchy scalp &amp; small flakes of dandruff even though I shampoo every day.</li>
            <li> am a fan of the Neutrogena T-gel myself, but it is very harsh.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> but NO MORE!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not too drying and doesn&#x27;t smell bad like the regular T/Gel.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my dandruff had gotten progressively worse over the years.</li>
            <li> My scalp got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> my dandruff and itchy scalp problems are definitely behind me.</li>
            <li> Some expense or organic shampoos even irritated my scalp &amp; made it worse.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce scalp break outs and also if you find you have excessive oil and a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Massively dried out my scalp and my head was itching like crazy!</li>
            <li> But it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> my head was itching like crazy again.</li>
            <li> Mine must have been really really bad though.</li>
            <li> it was really bad</li>
            <li> The smell fades after your hair dries and isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with my stupid dandruff for months now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just kid who a had terrible scalp problem</li>
            <li> It would drive me insane, I would wear hats all the time because my scalp began peeling at the hairline and crown area.</li>
            <li> I had terrible dandruff</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It make my dandruff situation better but not did not solve it 100%. Its mild and lather&#x27;s well. It seems to have stopped working which I heard can happen with the different types of dandruff shampoo. I have resorted to buying DHS tar shampoo which has amazing reviews and will switch back to this once my condition is almost improved.</li>
            <li> I read so many different reviews about different products. I have drier hair and scalp in the winter and needed something that would help soothe my scalp and not end up making my hair super greasy. This is that product. I am quite satisfied with this product and I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay a larger amount of money for a different product that was an &amp;#34;upscale&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for controlling dandruff.  It has a pleasant odor and is a great shampoo.  I definitely recommend it to anyone concerned about looking their best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 4 dandruff shampoos before this one.  3 different types of Head &amp; Shoulders and a Dove Men+Care. I used them for weeks and weeks but nothing changed. In fact, my dandruff had gotten progressively worse over the years. Then finally I was recommended Neutrogena. I used exactly how it said on the bottle, I let it stand on my head for a few minutes and I rinsed and repeated. MY DANDRUFF WAS GONE THAT DAY. That is not hyperbole, this is not a joke review, I&#x27;m not some lowly Neutrogena corporate employee. I&#x27;m just kid who a had terrible scalp problem but NO MORE! Seriously, this shit works, and fast.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well to get rid of dandruff and buildup, arrived on time in good condition</li>
            <li> I would do business with this merchant again,</li>
            <li> Este Shampoo es excelente para controlar el exceso de grasa del cuero cabelludo. A diferencia de otros &amp;eacute;ste no deja el cabello &amp;aacute;spero o seco. Lo mejor es que tiene un buen perfume y se puede usar todos los d&amp;iacute;as</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life saver, My scalp was extremely itchy due to PSORIASIS. It would drive me insane, I would wear hats all the time because my scalp began peeling at the hairline and crown area. My mother bought this for me years ago and honestly, I have NOT had an outbreak since then. I was using it daily and now I can go weeks without using it. I dont even think I have it anymore (knock on wood). I do not know what&#x27;s in these ingredients that could be that powerful but I remember back in 2009 I used it for the very first time and it immediately calmed and soothed my scalp. It was like freedom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only speak from my own experience and this stuff is a hero. What&#x27;s really Ideal about this product is that even though it&#x27;s medicated it&#x27;s very gentle and delicate, it&#x27;s not like your average shampoo that feels like dish detergant on your scalp. This is very lite and fun to use, I look forward to using it becauss I finally can wash my hair like a normal person without worrying about my head feeling burnt and stripped of all its natural protectors. Its like &#x27;yaye, Im normal now!&#x27; Lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t have a medicated smell, It just has a fresh out of the shower smell. Even if I didn&#x27;t have psoriasis I would use this. Other shampoos are more glamorous because of the font on the bottles, the sassy commercials and the fragrance but lets keep it true and honest, noone looks like the people on those commercials anyway and beautiful or &#x27;ideal&#x27; hair is a matter of genetics and has nothing to do with whats in a plastic bottle, until now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this bottle and experience the magic!</li>
            <li> I have used this product successfully for years for dry scalp. It is a good price for a double set, I keep one in the gym bag and one in the shower.</li>
            <li> wont sleave my hair smelling like tar. Will purchase again in near future.  Don&#x27;t leave home without it.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wayyyyyyy better then all the rest, if you suffer from very dry itchy scalp!!  But it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to help control and finally rid yourself of Dandruff, this is the product for you. Neutrogena works great for me! I can finally stop looking! I hope this makes some of you out there as happy and satisfied as it did for me. It shipped fast and all was packed with care.</li>
            <li> Using H &amp; S for a long time. Recently had some major scalp issues. Dry and very itchy. One bottle of this and things were back to normal. That being said, for the price, I switched back to H &amp; S hoping not to have the issue again. (Might have to switch back in the winter when the air gets much dryer.)</li>
            <li> My husbands swears by this shampoo.  Uses it twice a day and keeps his hair looking great. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I have used every type of shampoo for daily dandruff control and this one really works with no strange smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in using this shampoo. The bottle isn&#x27;t very big either. I feel that it is similar to any head and shoulders product and with head and shoulders, you have different scents and get more in the bottle. I expected more from this. T-Sal works much better in dandruff control.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way that dandruff shampoo advertising is highly fraudulent.  While this is a very good product, I found that it has the exact same content as Head &amp; Shoulders and every house brand that CVS, Costco, Safeway, and Giant Foods offers.  So, now I get the stuff for one third the cost at Costco using their Kirkland brand.</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis, and I used to have to rely on a douche of ketakonozole to deal with outbreaks, which left my hair sticky and gross. This product in conjunction with neutrogena&#x27;s other T gel shampoos (tar and salicylic acid) help keep my scalp from becoming dry, irritated, and painful.</li>
            <li> Always awesome to have something in a 2 pack that&#x27;s reasonably priced. Thanks! This stuff is great on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dandruff shampoo. A bit pricey but far superior to Head &amp; Shoulders in terms of dandruff control.</li>
            <li> Had to use a bottle of this before I got rid of dandruff good stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like that selson blue stuff</li>
            <li> My husband uses this as his daily shampoo.  He still has a bit of dandruff occasionally, but the shampoo definitely greatly decreases his dandruff. He ran out of it a couple of months ago and had to use a non-dandruff control shampoo for a week or two and definitely noticed an increase in dandruff during that short period. He used to use a Head and Shoilders shampoo but finds this one to work much better. He has used it for years now.&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of the Neutrogena T-gel myself, but it is very harsh. I generally use it for a week if I start to have a dandruff problem, and it knocks it out for 4-6 months. It is not something I would want to use daily, however, so this milder version is a good compromise for the person who needs to use something daily.&lt;br /&gt;In summary:&lt;br /&gt;-works decent for the daily user&lt;br /&gt;-best daily use dandruff control shampoo we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Great product I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I really like the subtle scent of this shampoo, and use it everyday. It&#x27;s very effective and makes my hair and scalp feel a lot cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product other than it actually works is that it doesn&#x27;t smell bad!! Most t-gel type shampoos stink and this one smells good! It cleared my hair right up after two washes. I will be using this forever!!</li>
            <li> The label says this is \\&quot;from the makers of T/Gel.\\&quot; It actually uses a completely different active ingredient than T/Gel.</li>
            <li> bought this shampoo for my wife and she said she would like to order it again when she runs out which means it is pretty good!</li>
            <li> I use this both for hair and body - works with my skin problem (whatever it is - docs do not agree).</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with my stupid dandruff for months now. Went through bottle after bottle of shampoos and tried every home remedy imaginable. Nothing worked but this! And I am so relived! Finally I&#x27;m not self conscious of my flaky itchy scalp!! This stuff is surprisingly gentle but defiantly works miricles within two uses. It is very important however to get a lot of the product in your hair and really scrub and work it in and leave it for 3-5 minutes to really work. I even repeated it for good measure. I really also like that it&#x27;s pretty nice smelling. There&#x27;s no harsh chemical odor and it not only helped get rid of the flakes but soothed my red inflamed patches too. It&#x27;s kind of an odd consistency though not like usual shampoo. It&#x27;s kind of greenish and kind of reminds me of some kind of thin silly putty lol. Neutrogena is one of my favorite brands and it really lives up to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I might add is that although it helps get rid of dandruff in the shower it also almost seems like it keeps working after you get out and when your hair dries you might be shocked to see even MORE dandruff. Don&#x27;t panic! It&#x27;s just loosened up the build up of patches and it is actually working. After my hair dried I spent a good 10-15 minutes tossling my hair and scrubbing my scalp all over my head to break it all up and get it out of my hair. Mine must have been really really bad though. And I have thick semi curly/wavy hair so in sure that doesn&#x27;t make things easier. It says on the bottle two times a week usuage but I feel like this stuff is gentle enough for me to continue using it to just get it gone and over with once in for all! Thank you neutrogena! You are a lifesaver! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Daily Control medicated shampoo for about four months now and I love that I can use it frequently and it doesn&#x27;t strip the color out of my hair and dry it out like other medicated shampoos. My scalp is very sensitive and over the years I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos in every price range - even supposedly miracle shampoos with their own infomercials. At last, I&#x27;ve found a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp and makes my hair look great. The conditioner is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. It looks clean even if I skip a day of washing. And, since my scalp is no longer irritated, my hair seems to be growing in better and falling out less. My hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Helps reduce scalp break outs and also if you find you have excessive oil and a bad smell. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This has been the only product that has worked for my son. Well, I should say that t-sal worked but he really disliked the smell. This product WORKS like t-sal but smells soooooooo much better. The addition of the conditioner is nice too. I thought that the price on amazon was good too, considering I paid more than $7 at CVS.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It has worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo removed all the itching problem and is more soft than the tgel and the smell is very good and leave your hair smooth</li>
            <li> This product works just fine for me. If you price this type of  product you will find most to be quite expensive. I like this two pack and the same results I get with more expensive products.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works more like a shampoo than a conditioner. I still give it 5 stars because it actually works. I use this as a shampoo and prefer a thicker more hydrating conditioner.</li>
            <li> My husband lives by this shampoo</li>
            <li> The product matches the description.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensible head skin, then my doctor recommended this shampoo to be used daily 5 days a week, shifted by another (medicated) the remained 2 days.  For 3 years, this recipe has worked well.  Both, hair and skin, are in good condition.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff - I&#x27;ve had chronic flakey scalp (and beard) for some time.  My dermatologist recommended T/SAL (not T/GEL) and I added the Daily on the days I don&#x27;t use T/Sal which i use 3 times a week. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but definitely works.  I buy the 2 pack which reduces the cost just a bit.</li>
            <li> I had terrible dandruff my head was so damn dry I bought this within 2 weeks it was gone completely I never wanted to go anywhere it was really bad I&#x27;ve used this ever since still works great</li>
            <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to have bigger bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Use as directed and it will work. I have dandruff and this shampoo knocked it out in one week.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair feel good.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion: Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works as advertised, smells great and is a little less harsh on my color treated hair. I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> Packaged out of sealed paper box, unlike stores, hoping it&#x27;s the real thing for the person intended to be given to.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 70 year old mother in law who was having a problem with dandruff.  She uses this 1x a week and her Pantene 1 x a week.  This routine seems to have done the trick.  :)</li>
            <li> I had a burning dandruff experience before I started using it. It fortunately worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I use this product alternately with the T/Gel shampoo, especially when I&#x27;m in  a hurry.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not too drying and doesn&#x27;t smell bad like the regular T/Gel.  The conditioner really helps keep the moisture in my hair.  I use it a couple of times per week and have great results!</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo. Nice fragrance. No build up-  no itching, no dandruff. Just a wonderfully clean and fresh head of hair.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find out good shampoo for my dry scalp with flakes. So, I ended up buying this product. This didn&#x27;t help me at all. My scalp got worse and worse. Probably, this product might be good for your conditions but not mine for sure!</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena&#x27;s T/Gel &amp; T/Sal Products. I have been using the original T/Gel since the early 90s. Back then I developed a spot of what appears to be Psoriasis. I contributed it to the large amounts of hairspray that I used back then. Even though I have since stopped using hairspray I still have the Psoriasis. Nothing over the counter will help but T/Gel. I have switched back to the fruity scents a few times, but have always had to come back to T/Gel. The smell was an issue for me at first too, But this product really works. The smell fades after your hair dries and isn&#x27;t so bad. I have come to like the smell as well. Recently I ran out of my regular T/Gel Shampoo my head was itching like crazy again. While shopping I came across a Neutrogena T/gel Therapeutic Shampoo and Scalp treatment Kit in the store. I decided to try it out and that was when I started using T/Sal. It does seem to dry the scalp out more but that is how it works. It loosens up the dry dead skin so that the flakes can be removed from your head. In the kit there was a three day regimen. T/Sal was day two. By the third day my scalp was much improved. I recently ordered one of each of the three shampoos in the treatment kit. I wont have to use the T/Gel or T/Sal but once a week now and I follow up with the T/gel shampoo and conditioner. Daily washing will always be a must for me if I want to keep my Psoriasis at bay. Thank you Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> One of the best products out there for Psoriasis helps keep my hair not feel itchy all the time. This product definitely deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I normally used the regular T/Gel, but thought I would give this a shot. I suffer from a very dry scalp and the original T/Gel extra strength was amazing for it. This was on sale so I gave it a shot also. It works ok, but not as good as the other T/Gel. Might be better for others, but I will probably go back to my first one.</li>
            <li> I have had dandruff problems for years and tried everything I could find to help control the dandruff. Nothing worked well until I found this. No more itching, flakes are gone. Best stuff out there!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only non-prescription shampoo that manages my seborrheic dermatitis but it can be so expense at the drugstore.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> After a long search, saw this in the store shelf and decided to give it a try. So far is the best I&#x27;ve tried. For my hair type ( thick, curly and coarse but manageable) I get best results when combined with aussie 3 minute deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not going back to any other brand of shampoo, I&#x27;m sticking to this product because IT WORKS AMAZINGLY! my dandruff and itchy scalp problems are definitely behind me.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo to help control dandruff so it doesn&#x27;t come back.  I shampoo with it about every other day.</li>
            <li> I got this for a good price but one bottle was only half full. I would not buy this again just because of that. The product itself works fantastic. I love saving time using the 2 in 1 and the product works great on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Massively dried out my scalp and my head was itching like crazy! My entire scalp felt tight and my forehead above the temples began flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to Free &amp; Clear shampoo and conditioner that my dermatologist had recommended.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t getting rid of my dandruff so I switched to the T/Gel, but at least the itching and flaking were considerably less with the Free &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li> I used coal tar based shampoo to relieve scalp itch for many years. When that was banned in Calofornia I had to load up when traveling to other states. I still have some of these products in my cupboard.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I asked a dermatologist if he could prescribe any for me. He gave me a sample that works better than any other product I have ever used. I recommend that anyone who has this condition try the solution that worked for me.</li>
            <li> When I started using this my dandruff went away but after two weeks it came back worse. Off too try another shampoo.</li>
            <li> For anyone fighting with dandruff, this shampoo is the best on the market. My boyfriend always had problems until we found this gem.</li>
            <li> As good as the old style with separate shampoo and rinses.  It&#x27;s very convenient, and I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know too much, only used it once, it says safe for daily use and dye hair... hope it does not take the colof away.  So far that one use was great. and the fact that it&#x27;s bot shampoo and conditioner helps</li>
            <li> Works great for my seborrheic dermatitis. Daily shampoo has had remarkable effect for me.</li>
            <li> Great for the kids. Smells great.  Hard to find in stores, so we like to stock up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely amazing! But for some reason it has been discontinued from several stores which got me pissed off.</li>
            <li> This the best shampoo/conditioner on the market for those who suffer with anything related to dry scalp, e.g. dermatitis, rosacea, etc. I have tried never everything, including the T-Gel solo version and it didn&#x27;t help me. One day, I read a review about the new two and one combo. I felt a big difference after one shampoo!!! I believe the inclusion of a conditioner is a big plus in keeping the scalp moisturized. I have tried another product sold by the same company without conditioner and it didn&#x27;t work for me. The other products I have used are Pantene, Head and Shoulders, Dove, Suave, etc.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Never had dandruff til recently and saw how highly rated this was (Neutrogena T-Gel 2 in 1 Daily Control Shampoo 8.5 fl oz), I decided to try it. It is really great! I had itchy scalp &amp; small flakes of dandruff even though I shampoo every day. Some expense or organic shampoos even irritated my scalp &amp; made it worse. I was desperate.&lt;br /&gt;Today I tried this Tgel for the first time and wow! Itch &amp; dandruff is like 99% gone. My hair is silky &amp; it feels great. The shampoo is nicely scented (very mild) cuz I hate strong scented stuff, and it lathers like a dream. I am so impressed with this shampoo!!! &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;When I googled for the best dandruff shampoo, this was #2. #1 was like super expensive and this is $5.99 So cheap! Some reviews I&#x27;ve read said &amp;#34;dandruff is such an embarrassing thing to talk about&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t think so. This shampoo is so good!!!</li>
