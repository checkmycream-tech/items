            <li>Great color</li>
            <li>but im happy with the results.</li>
            <li>so, great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Omg the shine is amazing!</li>
            <li>Spectacular!</li>
            <li>and it always turned out even and nice EXCEPT this one!</li>
            <li>I just loved it.</li>
            <li>My hair just looks so good</li>
            <li>the smell was bearable and my hair smelled so good after washing it out.</li>
            <li>I loved it and will swear by it if it continues to give me these results.</li>
            <li>My hair still looks gorgeous.</li>
            <li>however whenever any kind of light hits it, shines perfectly (purple-red).</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with how this order also came all in one box.</li>
            <li>I have been using this hair color for a couple of years now, and I can&#x27;t say how much I love it!</li>
            <li>You know your hair the best, so if your hair is pretty fried/damaged, I&#x27;d stick to the instructions on the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>so that makes it even better!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>They better not ever quit making this color!</li>
            <li>If you COMBINE this dye with another, it comes out real nice, but by itself, its kind of a very  bright noticeable red and my hair was medium brown to begin with.  </li>
            <li>The after smell of your hair is amazingly fruity.</li>
            <li>This color is amazing.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Hey, nice red.\\</li>
            <li>Then, it was R3&#x27;s turn, since I had read many good reviews about it.</li>
            <li>I get many, many compliments on my hair color (I think my hair stylist is jealous, because everyone loves the color, and she can&#x27;t claim responsibility!).</li>
            <li>Garnier is one of the better scented hair coloring products, because they include a nice fruity scent within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The oil serum smells wonderful and makes hair so soft.</li>
            <li>If amazon would let me take a picture, I would show you the beautiful sparkling ruby hair I have today thanks to R2.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair color.</li>
            <li>The color is absolutely lovely.</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s been almost 4 weeks and instead of the color fading away, it became surprisingly more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>the color is absolutely lovely too.  </li>
            <li>Despite the fact that there are more cons than pros, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of compliments about it and the color would compliment most skin tones.  </li>
            <li>Thank you!!! :)</li>
            <li>but it does not seem to be able to get washed out in the beginning.</li>
            <li>Love the conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is the hair color I was meant to have, so glad I found out about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li>Soooo glad I found this, now off to look for a hair cream to make it stay longer.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the lighter shades for even more stunning look.</li>
            <li>I like this application better then the foam stuff.</li>
            <li>really liked the color, because it was really bright, and it showed up on my hair really well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>I wish I knew if there was some product or something I could use to reduce this bleed time, as I&#x27;m simply in love with the color.</li>
            <li>but once I was my hair twice it becomes the perfect red.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying a hair dye brush from Sallys Beauty Supply for a better touch-up application.  </li>
            <li>I love Garnier hair color &amp; this color</li>
            <li>and i love the color that it leaves my hair in.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on the color.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I don&#x27;t ever color my hair</li>
            <li>a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start by saying I LOVE the color.</li>
            <li>My original hair color still kind of shows up (which i love)  </li>
            <li>The color shows lightly indoors but is VERY bright in the sun, kind of flaming actually.</li>
            <li>Pretty good dye that I will choose again if I decide to change my hair color.</li>
            <li>colors are VIBRANT and multi faceted, and look just stunning out in the sunshine or in bright lighting</li>
            <li>Very cool...</li>
            <li>Really, the color is gorgeous.     </li>
            <li>Now I am back to this one for good!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to distribute.</li>
            <li>The dye was easy to mix up, and it didn&#x27;t have too offensive of an odor.</li>
            <li>Where my purple was I now have beautiful red highlights.</li>
            <li>This color is dark and awesome.  </li>
            <li>hair is noticeably burgundy/red in natural light, and bright reddish-brown in the sun.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t love the color results for R2 Medium Intense Auburn any more.</li>
            <li>It was nice for a natural reddish-brown look, but I had wanted something more drastic and tried</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have to use it more than once to get the result nor should the light have to be just right</li>
            <li>The color was okay at first, but after the 8th or 9th wash, it became a red-brown (chestnut) color that I didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>was a lot lighter than my original color which is black-brown).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than many professional jobs.  </li>
            <li>: If you have naturally light colored hair, this is a BRIGHT red.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of gray hair and even the medium red was outstandingly bright.  </li>
            <li>Full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>I used some good protein and moisture treatments afterward and my African American/Asian hair is shiny and curly again.</li>
            <li>That was cool.</li>
            <li>color will fade away quick.  </li>
            <li>Since red does fade quickly, this ensures that even by the time I need to re-dye my hair, it is still a nice bright red.</li>
            <li>also love that my hair feels soft and smells great after I dye it, unlike some of the other dyes I have tried.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the models hair on the box!</li>
            <li>was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a beautify auburn red in low light and gorgeous bright red in daylight.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I always wash my towels in bleach, so this didn&#x27;t bother me so much.</li>
            <li>Use kind of pinkish or red towels.  </li>
            <li>Not like totally black-black, but kind of brownish.  </li>
            <li>I had purple pravana in parts of my hair and decided that professionally it was time for a more &amp;#34;acceptable&amp;#34; hair color.</li>
            <li>so its powerful stuff.</li>
            <li>A good buy for the money and actually has a somewhat decent smell.</li>
            <li>I was told that I couldn&#x27;t get an intense red with my naturally dark brown hair without lightening it first, but I was very pleased with how bright this color got (without being clownish).</li>
            <li>gorgeous dark red looks fantastic with fair skin especially, and will make you a knock out!</li>
            <li>a little over an hour later I got in the shower and washed it out, LOL!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Garnier Nutrisse Medium Intense Auburn has proven to be my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>It turns my highlights into nice red streaks that are very noticeable.</li>
            <li>This R2 Medium Intense Auburn is such a beautiful red.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are pretty clear and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Ive had many shades of red in my life time.</li>
            <li>Ok, only giving this product 2 stars becuase YOU CAN&#x27;T GET RID OF IT.  </li>
            <li>and I actually think it did a better job of lightening my hair on the first application.</li>
            <li>but I like this red more (R2).  </li>
            <li>Be ready to attract attention!</li>
            <li>It turned out exactly how i wanted it to.</li>
            <li>But I think you will need to dye your hair twice if you want the exact color (and effect) like on the box, (I used R3 and my hair</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work the first time for me either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not Arial mermaid red, haha, but it&#x27;s a very pretty darker bright red.</li>
            <li>I tried it based on other reviews and I have alot of experience dying my own hair</li>
            <li>I love this color and it will really get you a red to die for.  </li>
            <li>although it looks black inside, when I walk outside there&#x27;s this beautiful tint.</li>
            <li>I of course loved the product in the beginning but the color was way too vibrant and super hard to remove if you regret it.</li>
            <li>First, I used the Blue-Black reflective, which was gorgeous, but didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>kit is easy to use and works quickly, with minimal chemical scent.</li>
            <li>If you want dark red sparkling reflective hair this stuff is perfect and only fades the tiniest amount.  </li>
            <li>But I really didn&#x27;t want to cut my hair because I wanted to grow them out...  </li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t read the whole box</li>
            <li>/&gt;For people that say this color faded fast.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t faded that much (comparing to R3).  </li>
            <li>but nothing really noticeable.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t bleed too much afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting this whole year.</li>
            <li>R2 Intense Medium</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it washed off relatively easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice red auburn and with proper care, it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>That may have been due to my own mistake in double layering color without stripping it out, but I still was really bothered that this happened with the color.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good color, but messy.</li>
            <li>I could wait another month to maybe see more vibrancy like other reviewers have mentioned</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty healthy (I only flat iron in winter</li>
            <li>It promises a berry red but my hair looks dark dark brown indoors, then if I&#x27;m outdoors and the light hits it a certain way I get tones of berry purple on top of brown, and if it&#x27;s really sunny and the light hits it at certain angles</li>
            <li>Well, I used it and my roots were the most prettiest color I have ever had, however the rest of my hair was still dark brown.  </li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T try this if you have dark hair - it will leave dark on top and light on your roots!</li>
            <li>/&gt;R2 smells SOOO much better than 66, hands down.</li>
            <li>do have naturally fine, and dark blonde to light brown hair, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American (a delightful blend of Black and German Jew ...</li>
            <li>If you really care about your hair being shiny and soft, I don&#x27;t really recommend this.  </li>
            <li>It stays vibrant-</li>
            <li>I have been through SO MANY different brands of color and different shades over the years.</li>
            <li>The color barely stuck and I could occasionally see spatterings of it in strong sunlight</li>
            <li>On me, indoors it&#x27;s a deeper red and almost looks more brown, then it looks like a nice deep red, then outside it&#x27;s whoa red in the sun.</li>
            <li>Be careful wearing light colored shirts for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>That being said when I usually try to give my hair any color it doesn&#x27;t show up unless I&#x27;m like, standing outside on a bright sunny day.</li>
            <li>It is a little bright the first few days</li>
            <li>The color indoors is black with a red+maroon+puple+pink tone, but when you&#x27;re outside, it turns to a bright red.  </li>
            <li>it also makes my hair very soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>I think for anybody with dark hair though, you should understand that it&#x27;ll take two or three applications for your hair to get light</li>
            <li>For me personally, it gave me almost the exact shade</li>
            <li>Finally, some time later, I felt confident enough that my hair was fully rinsed, and I wrapped it up in a towel.</li>
            <li>Be aware of wearing light colored shirts while your hair is wet for a very long time!</li>
            <li>My hair looks dark for the most part but artificial light makes it looks a bit purple and sun light, direct and indirect a vibrant wine color.</li>
            <li>so I had to dye my hair back dark on the top.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m outside everyone can see this cool red tint though.  </li>
            <li>It does run red for quite some time after in the shower, although the color remains a pretty intense red on your hair despite how the water looks.  </li>
            <li>It looked almost exactly the same when I left, so much so that she didn&#x27;t charge me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not auburn like the box, but like I said I applied this on top of previously Luminista</li>
            <li>However, right afterwards and for two weeks after that, every time I would dry my hair with my towel, a ton of read hairdye would get all over my towel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to dye it again the same color to make the color stand out a little more.</li>
            <li>If anything, a little more from a second box might have helped.</li>
            <li>A white towel will show light pink stains on it after showering, even a couple of weeks after dyeing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think the model has naturally darker hair, my hair comes out much brighter than this, especially after a couple of weeks of washing.</li>
            <li>It really does work and dyed my normally dark ash blonde hair true to the color on the box.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural color while adding in some highlights.  </li>
            <li>Darker hair might not get such an intense result.</li>
            <li>My natural hair color is a medium brown.  </li>
            <li>Since my hair is unprocessed and very coarse, I kind of expected to get the results I did.</li>
            <li>I have med/light brown hair naturally and my color looks just like on this box.</li>
            <li>I am tan with blue eyes and it really goes with my skin tone and brings out my eyes.</li>
            <li>This list is considerably longer.</li>
            <li>I have naturally lighter brown hair than most Asians, but it&#x27;s still dark enough to worry that red won&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li>I used Garnier Nutrisse True Red 66 a week prior, and it only showed up in the sun, and very little in natural light.</li>
            <li>My hair isnt so shiny but after dying it it looks vibrant, I actually cant wait till I can dye it again.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this color if you want to go red.</li>
            <li>On that note, since red washes out a little bit each time you shower, make sure you have a red towel for your hair or don&#x27;t care if it stains!</li>
            <li>My hair still looks black until I step into some light and then the red is noticeable.</li>
            <li>So I used a hair repairing product and stopped using heat products and now it&#x27;s back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Only use this dye if you REALLY want to STAY RED until your hair grows out!!</li>
            <li>and I came across an Asian girl who has jet black hair that got hers to the actual color where you can SEE it in all light.</li>
            <li>and I barely made it by with one box.</li>
            <li>The oil also made my hair really soft and fluffy the first week after</li>
            <li>The first time I needed two boxes due to the thickness of my hair but for root touch-ups only need one box.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to fade as fast as other reds I&#x27;ve used either</li>
            <li>On my hair it does come out a little orange, but a pretty reddish orange.  </li>
            <li>My hair is pretty close to the box color, and the little circle of color is what it looks like in the sun...</li>
            <li>I kept the color in for an hour as opposed to 30 minutes and after washing it, saw a very noticeable difference (dark red/purple).</li>
            <li>Hair loss as in not clumps of hair, but a little more than the amount of hair you would usually lose.</li>
            <li>Also, the color doesn&#x27;t work very well on dyed black hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight, black hair that does not respond well to any changes and last year, I attempted to dye it reddish brown.</li>

            <li> I was very pleased with how this order also came all in one box.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair color for a couple of years now, and I can&#x27;t say how much I love it!</li>
            <li> You know your hair the best, so if your hair is pretty fried/damaged, I&#x27;d stick to the instructions on the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just love it!</li>
            <li> so that makes it even better!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> They better not ever quit making this color!</li>
            <li> If you COMBINE this dye with another, it comes out real nice, but by itself, its kind of a very  bright noticeable red and my hair was medium brown to begin with.  </li>
            <li> The after smell of your hair is amazingly fruity.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Hey, nice red.\\</li>
            <li> Then, it was R3&#x27;s turn, since I had read many good reviews about it.</li>
            <li> I get many, many compliments on my hair color (I think my hair stylist is jealous, because everyone loves the color, and she can&#x27;t claim responsibility!).</li>
            <li> Garnier is one of the better scented hair coloring products, because they include a nice fruity scent within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oil serum smells wonderful and makes hair so soft.</li>
            <li> If amazon would let me take a picture, I would show you the beautiful sparkling ruby hair I have today thanks to R2.  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair color.</li>
            <li> The color is absolutely lovely.</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s been almost 4 weeks and instead of the color fading away, it became surprisingly more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> the color is absolutely lovely too.  </li>
            <li> Despite the fact that there are more cons than pros, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of compliments about it and the color would compliment most skin tones.  </li>
            <li> Thank you!!! :)</li>
            <li> but it does not seem to be able to get washed out in the beginning.</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the hair color I was meant to have, so glad I found out about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Soooo glad I found this, now off to look for a hair cream to make it stay longer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the lighter shades for even more stunning look.</li>
            <li> I like this application better then the foam stuff.</li>
            <li> really liked the color, because it was really bright, and it showed up on my hair really well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> I wish I knew if there was some product or something I could use to reduce this bleed time, as I&#x27;m simply in love with the color.</li>
            <li> but once I was my hair twice it becomes the perfect red.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying a hair dye brush from Sallys Beauty Supply for a better touch-up application.  </li>
            <li> I love Garnier hair color &amp; this color</li>
            <li> and i love the color that it leaves my hair in.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on the color.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I don&#x27;t ever color my hair</li>
            <li> a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start by saying I LOVE the color.</li>
            <li> My original hair color still kind of shows up (which i love)  </li>
            <li> The color shows lightly indoors but is VERY bright in the sun, kind of flaming actually.</li>
            <li> Pretty good dye that I will choose again if I decide to change my hair color.</li>
            <li> colors are VIBRANT and multi faceted, and look just stunning out in the sunshine or in bright lighting</li>
            <li> Very cool...</li>
            <li> Really, the color is gorgeous.     </li>
            <li> Now I am back to this one for good!  </li>
            <li> It was easy to distribute.</li>
            <li> The dye was easy to mix up, and it didn&#x27;t have too offensive of an odor.</li>
            <li> Where my purple was I now have beautiful red highlights.</li>
            <li> This color is dark and awesome.  </li>
            <li> hair is noticeably burgundy/red in natural light, and bright reddish-brown in the sun.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t love the color results for R2 Medium Intense Auburn any more.</li>
            <li> It was nice for a natural reddish-brown look, but I had wanted something more drastic and tried</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have to use it more than once to get the result nor should the light have to be just right</li>
            <li> The color was okay at first, but after the 8th or 9th wash, it became a red-brown (chestnut) color that I didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> was a lot lighter than my original color which is black-brown).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than many professional jobs.  </li>
            <li> : If you have naturally light colored hair, this is a BRIGHT red.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of gray hair and even the medium red was outstandingly bright.  </li>
            <li> Full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> I used some good protein and moisture treatments afterward and my African American/Asian hair is shiny and curly again.</li>
            <li> That was cool.</li>
            <li> color will fade away quick.  </li>
            <li> Since red does fade quickly, this ensures that even by the time I need to re-dye my hair, it is still a nice bright red.</li>
            <li> also love that my hair feels soft and smells great after I dye it, unlike some of the other dyes I have tried.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the models hair on the box!</li>
            <li> was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a beautify auburn red in low light and gorgeous bright red in daylight.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I always wash my towels in bleach, so this didn&#x27;t bother me so much.</li>
            <li> Use kind of pinkish or red towels.  </li>
            <li> Not like totally black-black, but kind of brownish.  </li>
            <li> I had purple pravana in parts of my hair and decided that professionally it was time for a more &amp;#34;acceptable&amp;#34; hair color.</li>
            <li> so its powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> A good buy for the money and actually has a somewhat decent smell.</li>
            <li> I was told that I couldn&#x27;t get an intense red with my naturally dark brown hair without lightening it first, but I was very pleased with how bright this color got (without being clownish).</li>
            <li> gorgeous dark red looks fantastic with fair skin especially, and will make you a knock out!</li>
            <li> a little over an hour later I got in the shower and washed it out, LOL!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Garnier Nutrisse Medium Intense Auburn has proven to be my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> It turns my highlights into nice red streaks that are very noticeable.</li>
            <li> This R2 Medium Intense Auburn is such a beautiful red.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are pretty clear and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Ive had many shades of red in my life time.</li>
            <li> Ok, only giving this product 2 stars becuase YOU CAN&#x27;T GET RID OF IT.  </li>
            <li> and I actually think it did a better job of lightening my hair on the first application.</li>
            <li> but I like this red more (R2).  </li>
            <li> Be ready to attract attention!</li>
            <li> It turned out exactly how i wanted it to.</li>
            <li> But I think you will need to dye your hair twice if you want the exact color (and effect) like on the box, (I used R3 and my hair</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work the first time for me either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Arial mermaid red, haha, but it&#x27;s a very pretty darker bright red.</li>
            <li> I tried it based on other reviews and I have alot of experience dying my own hair</li>
            <li> I love this color and it will really get you a red to die for.  </li>
            <li> although it looks black inside, when I walk outside there&#x27;s this beautiful tint.</li>
            <li> I of course loved the product in the beginning but the color was way too vibrant and super hard to remove if you regret it.</li>
            <li> First, I used the Blue-Black reflective, which was gorgeous, but didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> kit is easy to use and works quickly, with minimal chemical scent.</li>
            <li> If you want dark red sparkling reflective hair this stuff is perfect and only fades the tiniest amount.  </li>
            <li> But I really didn&#x27;t want to cut my hair because I wanted to grow them out...  </li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t read the whole box</li>
            <li> /&gt;For people that say this color faded fast.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t faded that much (comparing to R3).  </li>
            <li> but nothing really noticeable.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t bleed too much afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this whole year.</li>
            <li> R2 Intense Medium</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it washed off relatively easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice red auburn and with proper care, it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> That may have been due to my own mistake in double layering color without stripping it out, but I still was really bothered that this happened with the color.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good color, but messy.</li>
            <li> I could wait another month to maybe see more vibrancy like other reviewers have mentioned</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty healthy (I only flat iron in winter</li>
            <li> It promises a berry red but my hair looks dark dark brown indoors, then if I&#x27;m outdoors and the light hits it a certain way I get tones of berry purple on top of brown, and if it&#x27;s really sunny and the light hits it at certain angles</li>
            <li> Well, I used it and my roots were the most prettiest color I have ever had, however the rest of my hair was still dark brown.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T try this if you have dark hair - it will leave dark on top and light on your roots!</li>
            <li> /&gt;R2 smells SOOO much better than 66, hands down.</li>
            <li> do have naturally fine, and dark blonde to light brown hair, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American (a delightful blend of Black and German Jew ...</li>
            <li> If you really care about your hair being shiny and soft, I don&#x27;t really recommend this.  </li>
            <li> It stays vibrant-</li>
            <li> I have been through SO MANY different brands of color and different shades over the years.</li>
            <li> The color barely stuck and I could occasionally see spatterings of it in strong sunlight</li>
            <li> On me, indoors it&#x27;s a deeper red and almost looks more brown, then it looks like a nice deep red, then outside it&#x27;s whoa red in the sun.</li>
            <li> Be careful wearing light colored shirts for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> That being said when I usually try to give my hair any color it doesn&#x27;t show up unless I&#x27;m like, standing outside on a bright sunny day.</li>
            <li> It is a little bright the first few days</li>
            <li> The color indoors is black with a red+maroon+puple+pink tone, but when you&#x27;re outside, it turns to a bright red.  </li>
            <li> it also makes my hair very soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> I think for anybody with dark hair though, you should understand that it&#x27;ll take two or three applications for your hair to get light</li>
            <li> For me personally, it gave me almost the exact shade</li>
            <li> Finally, some time later, I felt confident enough that my hair was fully rinsed, and I wrapped it up in a towel.</li>
            <li> Be aware of wearing light colored shirts while your hair is wet for a very long time!</li>
            <li> My hair looks dark for the most part but artificial light makes it looks a bit purple and sun light, direct and indirect a vibrant wine color.</li>
            <li> so I had to dye my hair back dark on the top.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m outside everyone can see this cool red tint though.  </li>
            <li> It does run red for quite some time after in the shower, although the color remains a pretty intense red on your hair despite how the water looks.  </li>
            <li> It looked almost exactly the same when I left, so much so that she didn&#x27;t charge me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not auburn like the box, but like I said I applied this on top of previously Luminista</li>
            <li> However, right afterwards and for two weeks after that, every time I would dry my hair with my towel, a ton of read hairdye would get all over my towel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to dye it again the same color to make the color stand out a little more.</li>
            <li> If anything, a little more from a second box might have helped.</li>
            <li> A white towel will show light pink stains on it after showering, even a couple of weeks after dyeing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think the model has naturally darker hair, my hair comes out much brighter than this, especially after a couple of weeks of washing.</li>
            <li> It really does work and dyed my normally dark ash blonde hair true to the color on the box.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural color while adding in some highlights.  </li>
            <li> Darker hair might not get such an intense result.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is a medium brown.  </li>
            <li> Since my hair is unprocessed and very coarse, I kind of expected to get the results I did.</li>
            <li> I have med/light brown hair naturally and my color looks just like on this box.</li>
            <li> I am tan with blue eyes and it really goes with my skin tone and brings out my eyes.</li>
            <li> This list is considerably longer.</li>
            <li> I have naturally lighter brown hair than most Asians, but it&#x27;s still dark enough to worry that red won&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li> I used Garnier Nutrisse True Red 66 a week prior, and it only showed up in the sun, and very little in natural light.</li>
            <li> My hair isnt so shiny but after dying it it looks vibrant, I actually cant wait till I can dye it again.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend this color if you want to go red.</li>
            <li> On that note, since red washes out a little bit each time you shower, make sure you have a red towel for your hair or don&#x27;t care if it stains!</li>
            <li> My hair still looks black until I step into some light and then the red is noticeable.</li>
            <li> So I used a hair repairing product and stopped using heat products and now it&#x27;s back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Only use this dye if you REALLY want to STAY RED until your hair grows out!!</li>
            <li> and I came across an Asian girl who has jet black hair that got hers to the actual color where you can SEE it in all light.</li>
            <li> and I barely made it by with one box.</li>
            <li> The oil also made my hair really soft and fluffy the first week after</li>
            <li> The first time I needed two boxes due to the thickness of my hair but for root touch-ups only need one box.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to fade as fast as other reds I&#x27;ve used either</li>
            <li> On my hair it does come out a little orange, but a pretty reddish orange.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty close to the box color, and the little circle of color is what it looks like in the sun...</li>
            <li> I kept the color in for an hour as opposed to 30 minutes and after washing it, saw a very noticeable difference (dark red/purple).</li>
            <li> Hair loss as in not clumps of hair, but a little more than the amount of hair you would usually lose.</li>
            <li> Also, the color doesn&#x27;t work very well on dyed black hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight, black hair that does not respond well to any changes and last year, I attempted to dye it reddish brown.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is coal black, super deep dark black.</li>
            <li> Nothing really worked as well as I wanted it to, as was expected with hair that has been continuously dyed dark for almost 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have natural dark brown hair and it did not change my hair ONLY MY ROOTS</li>
            <li> I dyed directly over dark brown hair</li>
            <li> (I naturally have dark brown hair).</li>
            <li> Color does last long.</li>
            <li> I am now a much lighter shade of red but it is HARD to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> maybe my hair is just too difficult for such a huge change with at home kits.</li>
            <li> But after the hair is dry, it stops leaking, so I had no problems of red dye getting on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for almost a hour because I wanted it to really sink into my previously dye black hair.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair at all, especially if you use the conditioner they supply.</li>
            <li> So naturally I didnt go red head, not precisely.</li>
            <li> When it came time to rinse the dye from my hair, I&#x27;m a little embarrassed to say that I found it amusing just how much my bathtub resembled a violent crime scene.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used the Colorsilk Luminista for dark hair (Deep Red 148).  </li>
            <li> One of the only (maybe the only) hair color for dark hair to transform into a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even get the expected result after following directions and applying it twice...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how long this color &amp;#34;bled&amp;#34; or leaked tint after every shower.</li>
            <li> I feel as if it should not have taken so long.</li>
            <li> then I finally get red in only small parts of my hair.</li>
            <li> I even got a consultation at a salon where they advised me that it would be a very long and drawn out process.</li>
            <li> you soak your hair in blood?\\&quot; dark red.  </li>
            <li> I have been attempting to dye my hair a dark red for about a year now.</li>
            <li> Being an asian, I had black hair.</li>
            <li> 20 weeks in and a black dye applied as well as two times trying blonde and the color wont come out.</li>
            <li> As someone mentioned before, I also have asian black hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other chemicals would react with an hour long color</li>
            <li> I do find that my scalp feels itchy for a few days after I dye it, but I have very sensitive skin and might be developing a slight allergic reaction due to overuse</li>
            <li> I have a mixture of past dye jobs in my hair ranging from long ago copper to a faded black, as well as my natural medium brown shade.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted something a little different</li>
            <li> , some people complained about how the red keeps running constantly every time they wash their hair.</li>
            <li> Intense Auburn - false advertising -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean a natural brown-red.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the fumes to be strong or a bad odor.  </li>
            <li> I was actually really disappointed at first because the color barely showed up at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a dark cherry color, but not too dark.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, but have my hairdresser put in highlights before I cover the rest of my hair in this color.</li>
            <li> It turns my dark brown hair to a visible burgundy.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, jet-black hair that is almost reaching my bra-strap</li>
            <li> and it says that if you have dyed your hair dark brown or black not to use this.</li>
            <li> It looks dark brown indoors (or bronze black)</li>
            <li> This drew all of them together and even disguised the black parts, making them a slightly darker shade of auburn.  </li>
            <li> and I was applying it to previously colored hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half the price.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these for a year and half.</li>
            <li> I was NOT dying it black</li>
            <li> The directions tell you this will not work will previously darkened hair.</li>
            <li> I have a slightly tighter than shirley temple curl pattern</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll say that my results are nowhere close to the intensity on the box, which is pretty disappointing considering that this is a product that is supposed to be for dark hair.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair gets very dry and split ends etc.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews and watching youtube videos, I was a little skeptical of how this color would come out on my African American hair.</li>
            <li> Regardless of my issues witht he haircolor, if you have NATURALLY dark hair, then this is for you!</li>
            <li> , otherwise wet-n-go with a little conditioner added)</li>
            <li> It lightens it up a little though.    </li>
            <li> But speaking of clownish, the color when you first start putting it on is SCARY!</li>
            <li> and it was still getting a little tint on the towel.</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair, but so do all hair colors</li>
            <li> If you wash ur hair everyday in warm/hot water then yes.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m someone that even has trouble at the salon.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as harsh as others.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to look like the box on the first try or you&#x27;ll just be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately, it&#x27;s almost the same result even after trying it twice.    </li>
            <li> I attempted it at a salon once and my stylist was simply not able to get the color to hold.</li>
            <li> I was a little sad because I thought it didn&#x27;t do anything to my black hair, but</li>
            <li> The smell was a little bad if u inhale deeply.</li>
            <li> Every time you wash your hair, your towel gets dirty and get the same color.</li>
            <li> I mean murder scene, \\&quot;Did</li>
            <li> Well duh!</li>
            <li> First of all, the gloves that come with this hair dye are terrible.</li>
            <li> I am extremely confused by this, and also saddened by it.</li>
            <li> Changed to another color for a little while and the compliments stopped :(  </li>
            <li> The smell while applying it isnt uncomfortable at all or toxic smelling.</li>
            <li> So if your hair isn&#x27;t as difficult as mine, give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is also STILL staining my towels and sheets after about 2 dozen showers.</li>
            <li> I had horrible split ends and my hair felt SO dry like a broom stick for about 2~3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I used cold water once I was finished rinsing the color out.</li>
            <li> Bad move.</li>
            <li> I looked retarded</li>
            <li> This has stopped now, and it didn&#x27;t stain my towel, but it was downright annoying.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!!</li>

            <li> I have a mixture of past dye jobs in my hair ranging from long ago copper to a faded black, as well as my natural medium brown shade.  This drew all of them together and even disguised the black parts, making them a slightly darker shade of auburn.  A good buy for the money and actually has a somewhat decent smell.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair color. I dyed directly over dark brown hair and it&#x27;s a beautify auburn red in low light and gorgeous bright red in daylight. Full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your shower will look like a murder scene after using it though..and it rinses red for quite awhile. Be careful wearing light colored shirts for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are VIBRANT and multi faceted, and look just stunning out in the sunshine or in bright lighting especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is easy to use and works quickly, with minimal chemical scent. Garnier is one of the better scented hair coloring products, because they include a nice fruity scent within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gorgeous dark red looks fantastic with fair skin especially, and will make you a knock out!</li>
            <li> Cons:  1. The smell. It has a chemical smell and it stays on your hair for about 4 days.  2. Red towels! For about a week your color will leak in the shower. Use kind of pinkish or red towels.  But after the hair is dry, it stops leaking, so I had no problems of red dye getting on my clothes.  3. Obviously, because it&#x27;s a hair dye it&#x27;s going to damage your hair.  I had horrible split ends and my hair felt SO dry like a broom stick for about 2~3 weeks.  But I really didn&#x27;t want to cut my hair because I wanted to grow them out...  So I used a hair repairing product and stopped using heat products and now it&#x27;s back to normal.  If you really care about your hair being shiny and soft, I don&#x27;t really recommend this.  But it is repairable.  Oh, and you&#x27;re experience bit of hair loss too.. Hair loss as in not clumps of hair, but a little more than the amount of hair you would usually lose. But it all stops eventually. Don&#x27;t worry.    Pros:  1. The instructions are pretty clear and it&#x27;s easy to use.  2. The color is absolutely lovely. Being an asian, I had black hair. Not like totally black-black, but kind of brownish.  I was actually really disappointed at first because the color barely showed up at all.  So I decided to wait 4 weeks like the instructions said, and dye it again.  Now, it&#x27;s been almost 4 weeks and instead of the color fading away, it became surprisingly more noticeable.  Very cool... the color is absolutely lovely too.  My original hair color still kind of shows up (which i love)  The color indoors is black with a red+maroon+puple+pink tone, but when you&#x27;re outside, it turns to a bright red.  Really, the color is gorgeous.     Despite the fact that there are more cons than pros, I recommend this product. I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  I had a lot of compliments about it and the color would compliment most skin tones.  I&#x27;m going to dye it again the same color to make the color stand out a little more.</li>
            <li> If amazon would let me take a picture, I would show you the beautiful sparkling ruby hair I have today thanks to R2.  I tried Garnier R3 6 months ago and it stayed in my hair until, well until I colored over it today.  This stuff does not fade.  It stays red.  forever red.  I don&#x27;t mean a natural brown-red.  I mean murder scene, \\&quot;Did you soak your hair in blood?\\&quot; dark red.  If you want dark red sparkling reflective hair this stuff is perfect and only fades the tiniest amount.  These reds have the best staying power of any reds I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for almost 15 years now.  It&#x27;s better than many professional jobs.  Spectacular!</li>
            <li> Ive had many shades of red in my life time. My hair would always two tone, but not this product even color everytime.  I hope they nvr stop the production of this product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with how this order also came all in one box. Thank you!!! :)</li>
            <li> It really does work and dyed my normally dark ash blonde hair true to the color on the box.  It does run red for quite some time after in the shower, although the color remains a pretty intense red on your hair despite how the water looks.  Ok, only giving this product 2 stars becuase YOU CAN&#x27;T GET RID OF IT.  It&#x27;s been a month since dying my hair and with all of the washes I had hoped it would lighten some.  But no!  So I went to a salon and she ended up BLEACHING my entire head, using a toner, then trying to dye my hair it&#x27;s natural color while adding in some highlights.  The red is STILL THERE.  I am now a much lighter shade of red but it is HARD to get rid of.  Only use this dye if you REALLY want to STAY RED until your hair grows out!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering it again, so that should be informative enough.  It dried out my hair, but so do all hair colors and I was applying it to previously colored hair.  I used some good protein and moisture treatments afterward and my African American/Asian hair is shiny and curly again. I think for anybody with dark hair though, you should understand that it&#x27;ll take two or three applications for your hair to get light the way it is on the box, which means your roots will always be darker than the rest of your head. Don&#x27;t expect to look like the box on the first try or you&#x27;ll just be disappointed.  Also, I don&#x27;t wash my hair every time I shower, maybe only once or twice a week.  So my hair was bleeding red for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got complimented by a guy at Sally Beauty supply today.  \\&quot;Hey, nice red.\\&quot;  He thought I&#x27;d bought the color there and I was like, nope, Garnier Nutrisse!  Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used the Colorsilk Luminista for dark hair (Deep Red 148).  It&#x27;s half the price.  I was happy with that too and I actually think it did a better job of lightening my hair on the first application. I&#x27;d be buying it again but I like this red more (R2).  On my hair it does come out a little orange, but a pretty reddish orange.  It&#x27;s definitely not auburn like the box, but like I said I applied this on top of previously Luminista colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps somebody...</li>
            <li> Great color but it does not seem to be able to get washed out in the beginning. Love the conditioner. If you have lots of hair buy two.</li>
            <li> Been using this brand and color for years. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this!!! This is the hair color I was meant to have, so glad I found out about it. My natural hair is coal black, super deep dark black. So naturally I didnt go red head, not precisely. My hair looks dark for the most part but artificial light makes it looks a bit purple and sun light, direct and indirect a vibrant wine color. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments. The smell while applying it isnt uncomfortable at all or toxic smelling. The after smell of your hair is amazingly fruity. Also the shine! Omg the shine is amazing! My hair isnt so shiny but after dying it it looks vibrant, I actually cant wait till I can dye it again. Soooo glad I found this, now off to look for a hair cream to make it stay longer.</li>
            <li> I of course loved the product in the beginning but the color was way too vibrant and super hard to remove if you regret it. 20 weeks in and a black dye applied as well as two times trying blonde and the color wont come out.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of gray hair and even the medium red was outstandingly bright.  Be ready to attract attention!</li>
            <li> color will fade away quick.  Every time you wash your hair, your towel gets dirty and get the same color.</li>
            <li> I love this color and it will really get you a red to die for.  However, I didn&#x27;t read the whole box and it says that if you have dyed your hair dark brown or black not to use this. Well, I used it and my roots were the most prettiest color I have ever had, however the rest of my hair was still dark brown.  I looked retarded so I had to dye my hair back dark on the top.  When I&#x27;m outside everyone can see this cool red tint though.  I wish I could get this color with my current hair color.  Regardless of my issues witht he haircolor, if you have NATURALLY dark hair, then this is for you!</li>
            <li> One of the only (maybe the only) hair color for dark hair to transform into a lighter shade. I have been using these for a year and half. Color does last long. The oil serum smells wonderful and makes hair so soft. I had zero experience coloring hair by myself but I managed to color the whole head of hair and did not have to worry about a few missed spots. The color looked wonderful. I would recommend the lighter shades for even more stunning look. Start with the deeper red and gradually lighten if its too sudden a change.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews and watching youtube videos, I was a little skeptical of how this color would come out on my African American hair. I had purple pravana in parts of my hair and decided that professionally it was time for a more &amp;#34;acceptable&amp;#34; hair color. I was NOT dying it black so of course red was my number one pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using ion&#x27;s color corrector, the next day I put this color on my hair. I was so scared I was going to run out of dye and I almost did. I have medium length hair and I used every drop of the dye. I left it on for almost a hour because I wanted it to really sink into my previously dye black hair. The directions tell you this will not work will previously darkened hair. This is why I used the color corrector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results are AMAZING!!!! It turned out exactly how i wanted it to. The smell was a little bad if u inhale deeply. I like this application better then the foam stuff. It was easy to distribute. I just loved it. Where my purple was I now have beautiful red highlights. I was a little sad because I thought it didn&#x27;t do anything to my black hair, but OH IT DID!!! although it looks black inside, when I walk outside there&#x27;s this beautiful tint. My hair just looks so good I can&#x27;t wait for work tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people that say this color faded fast. Well duh! If you wash ur hair everyday in warm/hot water then yes. Any color will fade especially red! My hair did not bleed onto any of my towels or stain my tub like pravana. I used cold water once I was finished rinsing the color out. My suggestion, read the directions and research.</li>
            <li> So I colored my hair for the second time with this color. I had it the same color before, but from a different brand, and I layered over it with this color.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the color, because it was really bright, and it showed up on my hair really well (I naturally have dark brown hair). However, right afterwards and for two weeks after that, every time I would dry my hair with my towel, a ton of read hairdye would get all over my towel. This has stopped now, and it didn&#x27;t stain my towel, but it was downright annoying. That may have been due to my own mistake in double layering color without stripping it out, but I still was really bothered that this happened with the color.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good color, but messy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair color for a couple of years now, and I can&#x27;t say how much I love it! I get many, many compliments on my hair color (I think my hair stylist is jealous, because everyone loves the color, and she can&#x27;t claim responsibility!). Garnier should actually be paying me to use this, as I quite often get asked what color I use and do quite a bit of word-of-mouth advertising for Garnier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have naturally fine, and dark blonde to light brown hair, so my hair seems well suited to retaining color. Darker hair might not get such an intense result. I also leave the color in longer than the instructions ask for (35-40 minutes instead of 25 minutes). Since red does fade quickly, this ensures that even by the time I need to re-dye my hair, it is still a nice bright red. On that note, since red washes out a little bit each time you shower, make sure you have a red towel for your hair or don&#x27;t care if it stains! A white towel will show light pink stains on it after showering, even a couple of weeks after dyeing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that my hair feels soft and smells great after I dye it, unlike some of the other dyes I have tried. I do find that my scalp feels itchy for a few days after I dye it, but I have very sensitive skin and might be developing a slight allergic reaction due to overuse (I dye my hair about once a month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: If you have naturally light colored hair, this is a BRIGHT red. It&#x27;s not for everyone! I think the model has naturally darker hair, my hair comes out much brighter than this, especially after a couple of weeks of washing.</li>
            <li> Always use this dye when going back to dye my hair. It&#x27;s a nice red auburn and with proper care, it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> That being said when I usually try to give my hair any color it doesn&#x27;t show up unless I&#x27;m like, standing outside on a bright sunny day. I was roaming around on YouTube checking out some beauty bloggers videos on hair coloring and I came across an Asian girl who has jet black hair that got hers to the actual color where you can SEE it in all light. Trick is, she just left it in her hair longer than indicated on the box. Simple. So that&#x27;s what I did. I put the color in and intended to leave it in for 45 minutes, I started watching a movie...a little over an hour later I got in the shower and washed it out, LOL! The color is BEAUTIFUL! Looks exactly like the models hair on the box! I also couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it because it was so incredibly soft.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;1) My hair is pretty healthy (I only flat iron in winter *Chicago*, otherwise wet-n-go with a little conditioner added) so I don&#x27;t notice any damage done to it by leaving the color on for an hour. You know your hair the best, so if your hair is pretty fried/damaged, I&#x27;d stick to the instructions on the box.&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;m African American (a delightful blend of Black and German Jew ...huh? Yeah) I have a slightly tighter than shirley temple curl pattern and I&#x27;ve never permed my hair so the color is the only chemical I have in my hair. I don&#x27;t know how other chemicals would react with an hour long color treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with your hair coloring endeavors!!! ^_^</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve used Garnier Nutrisse for Darker Hair. First, I used the Blue-Black reflective, which was gorgeous, but didn&#x27;t last long. Then, it was R3&#x27;s turn, since I had read many good reviews about it. The color was okay at first, but after the 8th or 9th wash, it became a red-brown (chestnut) color that I didn&#x27;t like.  This color is amazing. It is purple-red and doesn&#x27;t look red-brown at all!!! It looks dark brown indoors (or bronze black) however whenever any kind of light hits it, shines perfectly (purple-red). It hasn&#x27;t faded that much (comparing to R3).  I recommend this %100 if you want red hair! But I think you will need to dye your hair twice if you want the exact color (and effect) like on the box, (I used R3 and my hair was a lot lighter than my original color which is black-brown).  Also, the color doesn&#x27;t work very well on dyed black hair. It lightens it up a little though.    There is a YouTube video (review) about this color. Here is the link to it:    [...]</li>
            <li> As someone mentioned before, I also have asian black hair and it didn&#x27;t work the first time for me either. She tried it again and it worked but unfortunately, it&#x27;s almost the same result even after trying it twice.    It promises a berry red but my hair looks dark dark brown indoors, then if I&#x27;m outdoors and the light hits it a certain way I get tones of berry purple on top of brown, and if it&#x27;s really sunny and the light hits it at certain angles then I finally get red in only small parts of my hair. I shouldn&#x27;t have to use it more than once to get the result nor should the light have to be just right and I didn&#x27;t even get the expected result after following directions and applying it twice...I could wait another month to maybe see more vibrancy like other reviewers have mentioned but I should just stick with the salon and not waste any more time or money on disappointing results...maybe my hair is just too difficult for such a huge change with at home kits.</li>
            <li> Garnier Nutrisse Haircolor is a great product, but I love this color!!!!  It&#x27;s like a dark cherry color, but not too dark.  I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on it.  I just love it!</li>
            <li> I never went red before but im happy with the results. I was going for a deep reddish brown look so i bought this and then dyed over a medium brown and my hair came out beautifully. If you COMBINE this dye with another, it comes out real nice, but by itself, its kind of a very  bright noticeable red and my hair was medium brown to begin with.  so its powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this color for over a year and get alot of compliments on my hair color.  Changed to another color for a little while and the compliments stopped :(  Now I am back to this one for good!  It&#x27;s &#x27;my&#x27; color!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t love the color results for R2 Medium Intense Auburn any more. I was told that I couldn&#x27;t get an intense red with my naturally dark brown hair without lightening it first, but I was very pleased with how bright this color got (without being clownish). But speaking of clownish, the color when you first start putting it on is SCARY! It&#x27;s like a neon tangerine! But I pressed ahead and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER! I can&#x27;t believe how long this color &amp;#34;bled&amp;#34; or leaked tint after every shower. I think it was going on 3 weeks and it was still getting a little tint on the towel. Be aware of wearing light colored shirts while your hair is wet for a very long time! I wish I knew if there was some product or something I could use to reduce this bleed time, as I&#x27;m simply in love with the color.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is a medium brown.  This R2 Medium Intense Auburn is such a beautiful red.  It is a little bright the first few days but once I was my hair twice it becomes the perfect red.  It stays vibrant- I don&#x27;t find the fumes to be strong or a bad odor.  I have dyed my hair 4 times with this color.  The first time I needed two boxes due to the thickness of my hair but for root touch-ups only need one box.  The color has blended well each time.  I ended up buying a hair dye brush from Sallys Beauty Supply for a better touch-up application.  Will continue to use this color until I&#x27;m done being a red head~!</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight, black hair that does not respond well to any changes and last year, I attempted to dye it reddish brown. The color barely stuck and I could occasionally see spatterings of it in strong sunlight but nothing really noticeable. This year, I decided to try the Garnier R2 after checking some reviews (Amazon, Garnier, Walmart, and Youtube). I kept the color in for an hour as opposed to 30 minutes and after washing it, saw a very noticeable difference (dark red/purple). The color shows lightly indoors but is VERY bright in the sun, kind of flaming actually. The oil also made my hair really soft and fluffy the first week after and it didn&#x27;t bleed too much afterwards. Pretty good dye that I will choose again if I decide to change my hair color.</li>
            <li> I have naturally lighter brown hair than most Asians, but it&#x27;s still dark enough to worry that red won&#x27;t show up. I used Garnier Nutrisse True Red 66 a week prior, and it only showed up in the sun, and very little in natural light. It was nice for a natural reddish-brown look, but I had wanted something more drastic and tried R2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R2 smells SOOO much better than 66, hands down. When I used 66, I almost passed out trying to apply it on myself, but with R2... the smell was bearable and my hair smelled so good after washing it out. This product doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair at all, especially if you use the conditioner they supply. I also use Dove&#x27;s leave-in conditioner as a precaution, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is noticeably burgundy/red in natural light, and bright reddish-brown in the sun. My hair is pretty close to the box color, and the little circle of color is what it looks like in the sun... so, great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I got it for $6 at Albertson&#x27;s (:</li>
            <li> I love Garnier hair color &amp; this color was exactly what I was looking for! It doesn&#x27;t seem to fade as fast as other reds I&#x27;ve used either so that makes it even better!</li>
            <li> This color is dark and awesome.  But if you have medium length hair you will need two boxes.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, jet-black hair that is almost reaching my bra-strap and I barely made it by with one box. If anything, a little more from a second box might have helped. Definitely get two boxes if you have longer hair. Heck, get two just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll say that my results are nowhere close to the intensity on the box, which is pretty disappointing considering that this is a product that is supposed to be for dark hair. My hair still looks black until I step into some light and then the red is noticeable. I think that following up with another box should help lighten my hair some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some people complained about how the red keeps running constantly every time they wash their hair. From my experience, that&#x27;s just how red dyes are ( pinks too). Even when I get it done at the salon, it runs when I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts: It&#x27;s so-so. It may work for you, it may not. Since my hair is unprocessed and very coarse, I kind of expected to get the results I did. But I&#x27;m someone that even has trouble at the salon. So if your hair isn&#x27;t as difficult as mine, give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I use this every 6 months</li>
            <li> This is one i have used before and i love the color that it leaves my hair in. it also makes my hair very soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> I have been attempting to dye my hair a dark red for about a year now. I even got a consultation at a salon where they advised me that it would be a very long and drawn out process. I attempted it at a salon once and my stylist was simply not able to get the color to hold. It looked almost exactly the same when I left, so much so that she didn&#x27;t charge me. Nothing really worked as well as I wanted it to, as was expected with hair that has been continuously dyed dark for almost 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier Nutrisse Medium Intense Auburn has proven to be my favorite by far. For me personally, it gave me almost the exact shade I&#x27;ve been wanting this whole year. Perfect! I loved it and will swear by it if it continues to give me these results.</li>
            <li> I have been through SO MANY different brands of color and different shades over the years. I found a red like this years ago by clarol and they quit making it. I read a lot about this color and seen how it turned out on people and I tried it myself. I LOVE IT! They better not ever quit making this color! It&#x27;s so gorgeous and the color lasts! I color it about every 6 weeks. On me, indoors it&#x27;s a deeper red and almost looks more brown, then it looks like a nice deep red, then outside it&#x27;s whoa red in the sun. I get so many compliments on the color. Even my hair stylist couldn&#x27;t believe it came from a box. Also, this doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. Usually my hair gets very dry and split ends etc. None of that with this color. Though, I am a fan of Garnier color anyway. Doesn&#x27;t seem as harsh as others. I have med/light brown hair naturally and my color looks just like on this box. I am tan with blue eyes and it really goes with my skin tone and brings out my eyes. I highly, highly recommend this color if you want to go red. It&#x27;s not Arial mermaid red, haha, but it&#x27;s a very pretty darker bright red.</li>
            <li> R2 Intense Medium Intense Auburn - false advertising - I have natural dark brown hair and it did not change my hair ONLY MY ROOTS and I processed it as instructed!  DON&#x27;T try this if you have dark hair - it will leave dark on top and light on your roots! I tried it based on other reviews and I have alot of experience dying my own hair and it always turned out even and nice EXCEPT this one! HORRIBLE!!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I don&#x27;t ever color my hair but I wanted something a little different so I figured I&#x27;d give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start by saying I LOVE the color. It&#x27;s shiny and gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s move on to what I do not like. This list is considerably longer. First of all, the gloves that come with this hair dye are terrible. One of them tore, but it was up by the cuff so I didn&#x27;t worry about it. The dye actually seeped through the gloves and turned my hands red. Fortunately, it washed off relatively easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s move on to the dyeing experience. The dye was easy to mix up, and it didn&#x27;t have too offensive of an odor. That was cool. When it came time to rinse the dye from my hair, I&#x27;m a little embarrassed to say that I found it amusing just how much my bathtub resembled a violent crime scene. My husband helped me rinse my hair, which was helpful. 45 minutes later, the water was still tinted as it came off my hair. I was starting to get cranky. I feel as if it should not have taken so long. Finally, some time later, I felt confident enough that my hair was fully rinsed, and I wrapped it up in a towel. Bad move. The towel got stained. Fortunately, I always wash my towels in bleach, so this didn&#x27;t bother me so much. My hair looked gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward almost three weeks. My hair still looks gorgeous. It&#x27;s still shiny and hasn&#x27;t lost it&#x27;s luster. Unfortunately, it is also STILL staining my towels and sheets after about 2 dozen showers. I am extremely confused by this, and also saddened by it. I do not feel like I will want to purchase this hair color again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used all 3 of the reds in this product line. They don&#x27;t have it at the local drug stores anymore. I have dark brown hair, but have my hairdresser put in highlights before I cover the rest of my hair in this color. It turns my dark brown hair to a visible burgundy. It turns my highlights into nice red streaks that are very noticeable. I hope Garnier never dicontinues this line.</li>
