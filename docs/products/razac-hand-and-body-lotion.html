            <li>It really is nice and I am going to buy another bottle just to keep on</li>
            <li>Every man I know always comments that I smell nice just from using this lotion...</li>
            <li>nice smell</li>
            <li>The texture was nice and silky but nothing I&#x27;d swoon over.</li>
            <li>Again great lotion super strong smell!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important to me to be well groomed, moisturized and smelling good.  </li>
            <li>This is , by far, the best lotion I have used.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item based on many comments about the nice smell.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the scent and not to mention the way it made my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t sold in more stores (retail).  </li>
            <li>so I suggest when you find it buy as many bottles that you can afford to.</li>
            <li>Need to order more for the family.</li>
            <li>me and my husband love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It is better than eurcerin for the feet</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin so healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments and it is not my perfume</li>
            <li>It may not have fancy bottle, but it sure does smell fancy.</li>
            <li>I have had many compliments on the lotion.</li>
            <li>HAD MANY PEOPLE STOP AND ASK WHAT</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LOTION.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this lotion.</li>
            <li>My husband love this lotion and now we know where to get we will be ording this again.</li>
            <li>smelling fresh and good.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this lotion makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>what is that you&#x27;re wearing, I love it.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more.</li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion..</li>
            <li>However, I tried it and found it to have an overwhelming floral scent.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star for him:)</li>
            <li>Unlike so many perfumes that fade away so quickly, this stays with you in a pleasant&lt;br /&gt;unoffensive way and is so refreshing and feminine!  </li>
            <li>This product has a strong smell initially but very pleasant!  </li>
            <li>This is a great lotion to have, although im very surprised to see that men are into it, any way I was turned on to it by my cousin who lives in LA.</li>
            <li>It smells good and it moisturizes very well, Razac lotion also compliments ANY fragrance you are wearing.  </li>
            <li>The smell is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>it was baby oil to cut it richness and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>If I bathe at night and give it time for the scent to dissipate a lot, I am fine with it.</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrant smell.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and leaves your skin so soft and the fragrance is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and very fragrant, it leaves your skin feeling and smelling good all day.  </li>
            <li>and I find it so overpowering and smelly, that after 6 months of breathing it in, I eventually lost my cool and through it in the bin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He said this is one of the only lotion he and my mom use - sounds like a good Xmas gift.</li>
            <li>Great product I recommend it for winter , nice scent projects very well and last you all day long .</li>
            <li>It has a lovely scent and leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>(DON&#x27;T TELL HIM) smile</li>
            <li>We really like this lotion as it will make your skin very smooth and soft but it comes at a price of really coming on strong with the smell.  </li>
            <li>Okay this is kind of a mixed review&amp;#62; my father gets this for his super dry skin and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and non greasy, my skin stayed soft and the scent lasted all day</li>
            <li>AND I AM NOT SORRY.</li>
            <li>At first it smells like a perfume, but as the day goes by, someone always ask me do you have on baby powder or</li>
            <li>My body feel silky smooth , soft and smell</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and clean, and needs no other scent added to it.  </li>
            <li>I can barely use the lotion as it is way to strong for me.</li>
            <li>Although many reviewers liked the scent, I find it to be too medicinal and am a little embarrassed to wear it anytime I am going out because it does actually last all day.</li>
            <li>She was so excited to get more as she has had trouble finding it.</li>
            <li>I just wish I liked the smell as much as the other reviewers.</li>
            <li>SMELLS GOOD, LAST A LONG TIME!</li>
            <li>It is a nice thick consistency and goes into the skin quickly without leaving a greasy or watery layer on my skin.</li>
            <li>this has a very lingering scent and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Thank you for shipping so fast.</li>
            <li>She says it works great for her thin skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a moisturizer hand and body lotion, a protectant against weathered sensitived skin, it&#x27;s rich non-greasy, and softens the skin instantly.</li>
            <li>Lotion has a clean lasting scent that will bring you compliments all day.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the product I wasn&#x27;t sure of how good it really was until other people would ask me, \\&quot;what is that you wearing\\&quot;, as if I had on some expensive cologne.  </li>
            <li>You will not regret getting this beauty secret to feel and smell good.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and the price cannot be beat - wow!</li>
            <li>They sale it in the beauty supplies out there but not where I live.</li>
            <li>My elbows and knees did not dry out like most of the other lotions that I have tried.</li>
            <li>To give it more moisturizing capabilities though, I have very dry skin, I usually dilute it a bit with a good moisturizing oil, such as Vitamin E, and that tones the scent down a bit too.</li>
            <li>The feel of my skin while wearing this lotion is so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>My 16 yr old uses this lotion faithfully.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels moist and soft when lotion applied .  </li>
            <li>Says it works wonders and he&#x27;s used nearly every product out there.</li>
            <li>strong smell and not very pleasant</li>
            <li>A coworker wears this stuff and it stinks up the place for a good 10 minutes every time he passes by.  </li>

            <li> but I got tired of it quickly</li>
            <li> How can I describe the scent, soft but not sweet or baby smelling.  </li>
            <li> I recommend that everyone tries it</li>
            <li> But it has some other after note to die for.</li>
            <li> No need to wear perfume or any other scent while using this..</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again due to the smell alone</li>

            <li> I find myself using perfume less.</li>
            <li> everyday</li>
            <li> It is hard to find</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li> and I do mean all day.  </li>
            <li> but the price is ridiculous .</li>
            <li> Go get yours, you will be addicted.</li>
            <li> My dad finds it difficult navigating the web</li>
            <li> If you looking to buy something simular dont get RINJU IT STINKS!</li>
            <li> Drives men crazy!!!!!</li>

            <li> I still get compliments on how great it smells, even though I agree with a lot of people who says the scent has changed over the years.  To give it more moisturizing capabilities though, I have very dry skin, I usually dilute it a bit with a good moisturizing oil, such as Vitamin E, and that tones the scent down a bit too.</li>
            <li> Razac hand and body lotion is a product that I have used for atleast 15 years.  The first time I used the product I wasn&#x27;t sure of how good it really was until other people would ask me, \\&quot;what is that you wearing\\&quot;, as if I had on some expensive cologne.  As a man it&#x27;s important to me to be well groomed, moisturized and smelling good.  Razac covers both, and not only that, it mixes with your body chemistry, so no two people will smell the same.  Compliments, compliments compliments!!  Great product for the price!!</li>
            <li> This is , by far, the best lotion I have used.  The price is great and you get a lot in each bottle.  The smell is fresh and clean, and needs no other scent added to it.  The feel of my skin while wearing this lotion is so soft and silky.  I have had numerous strangers stop me to ask what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> This lotion was given to me by my cousin to try.  I want you to know that I was hooked just after one try.  I fell in love with the scent and not to mention the way it made my skin feel.  It went on smooth and non greasy, my skin stayed soft and the scent lasted all day and I do mean all day.  How can I describe the scent, soft but not sweet or baby smelling.  My elbows and knees did not dry out like most of the other lotions that I have tried. I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews but I could not pass up the opportunity to review this lotion.  I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t sold in more stores (retail).  It is hard to find so I suggest when you find it buy as many bottles that you can afford to.</li>
            <li> My 16 yr old uses this lotion faithfully.  We recently moved from Rochester, NY to St. Augustine, Florida and I haven&#x27;t seen it in any stores as of yet so he&#x27;s got me on line ordering it for him.</li>
            <li> A coworker wears this stuff and it stinks up the place for a good 10 minutes every time he passes by.  Definitely overpowering and smelly.  If you want to put off your coworkers this is the stuff to wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product!  Need to order more for the family.</li>
            <li> My mums boyfriend uses this product \\&quot;razac hand and body lotion\\&quot; everyday and I find it so overpowering and smelly, that after 6 months of breathing it in, I eventually lost my cool and through it in the bin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this lotion in the past on my face when I first came across it and had to wash it off because It was affecting my breathing.</li>
            <li> me and my husband love this lotion. We use it on our feet. It is better than eurcerin for the feet and it last all day and is not greasy. It has a light fragrant smell. My husband&#x27;s socks used to stink at the end of the day but now they smell good. This Is Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Razac is the best skin lotion I have ever had! The smell lasts more than my $100 perfumes! and it makes my skin so healthy looking. It kind of reminds me of a Coco Chanel type aroma. But it has some other after note to die for. I get so many compliments and it is not my perfume I have on, its just because of this lotion. It may not have fancy bottle, but it sure does smell fancy. You will not regret getting this beauty secret to feel and smell good. I wont use anything else after I bathe. Razac is the answer. I just went to my local beauty supply store and got the last bottle! Go get yours, you will be addicted.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best lotions i have ever used. It goes on smooth and leaves your skin so soft and the fragrance is amazing.No need to wear perfume or any other scent while using this..this has a very lingering scent and it stays on all day.Dont let the price fool you.</li>
            <li> Perfect for women of color.  Fragrance blends well with any perfume or cologne you typically use.  Leaves skin soft and moisturized all day.  Drives men crazy!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion to have, although im very surprised to see that men are into it, any way I was turned on to it by my cousin who lives in LA. They sale it in the beauty supplies out there but not where I live. She gave me her bottle and I went to Amazon to find it. I have had many compliments on the lotion. There is no need to wear perfume with it. I mix it was baby oil to cut it richness and it works just fine. One of my girl friends smelled it and bought 8 bottles. It great! If you looking to buy something simular dont get RINJU IT STINKS!</li>
            <li> SMELLS GOOD, LAST A LONG TIME! THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT NEEDED FOR ALL DAY FRAGRANCE! I&#x27;VE HAD MANY PEOPLE STOP AND ASK WHAT I&#x27;M WEARING, AND JUST COME OUT AND SAY,\\&quot;YOU SMELL SO GOOD\\&quot;. I LOVE THIS LOTION.</li>
            <li> strong smell and not very pleasant</li>
            <li> Awesome! My som comes home smelling oh so good from grandma&#x27;s :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great product.It&#x27;s a moisturizer hand and body lotion, a protectant against weathered sensitived skin, it&#x27;s rich non-greasy, and softens the skin instantly. I love the scent of this lotion.I find myself using perfume less.</li>
            <li> My husband love this lotion and now we know where to get we will be ording this again. Thank you for shipping so fast.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong for me. I was really excited to get this but wish the odor was lighter.</li>
            <li> This product has a strong smell initially but very pleasant!  I have finally found a lotion that makes and keeps me&lt;br /&gt;always smelling fresh and good.  Unlike so many perfumes that fade away so quickly, this stays with you in a pleasant&lt;br /&gt;unoffensive way and is so refreshing and feminine!  It really is nice and I am going to buy another bottle just to keep on&lt;br /&gt;hand as I am now hooked!  I highly recommend this and the price cannot be beat - wow!</li>
            <li> The lotion is great, my mum loves it. but the price is ridiculous . you can get it cheaper at your local beauty shop like Sally or similar. I don&#x27;t like when sellers try to rip people off. Just bought this location for $5/16 oz.&lt;br /&gt;regards&lt;br /&gt;jeffruzz</li>
            <li> Every man I know always comments that I smell nice just from using this lotion...I wish the Razac folks would make a body spray...LOVE THE FRAGRANCE!</li>
            <li> I love the way this lotion makes my skin feel. It is a nice thick consistency and goes into the skin quickly without leaving a greasy or watery layer on my skin. Although many reviewers liked the scent, I find it to be too medicinal and am a little embarrassed to wear it anytime I am going out because it does actually last all day. If I bathe at night and give it time for the scent to dissipate a lot, I am fine with it.</li>
            <li> My husband, of all people, turned me on to this lotion.  His students at the school he worked at used it all the time.  I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 10 years.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and very fragrant, it leaves your skin feeling and smelling good all day.  Thankfully here in Philly they sell Razac in all the beauty supply stores and also in RITE Aid stores so I&#x27;m never without.  Buy this lotion today, you will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> We really like this lotion as it will make your skin very smooth and soft but it comes at a price of really coming on strong with the smell.  You may really love the smell and that will be great but if you don&#x27;t that&#x27;s where things could become a problem.  Again great lotion super strong smell!</li>
            <li> SOMEONE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND I AM NOT SORRY. IT&#x27;S AN AWESOME PRDUCT AND IT SMELLS GREAT TOO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! It has a lovely scent and leaves my skin soft and moisturized. I use this lotion daily after showering!</li>
            <li> It smells good and it moisturizes very well, Razac lotion also compliments ANY fragrance you are wearing.  At first it smells like a perfume, but as the day goes by, someone always ask me do you have on baby powder or what is that you&#x27;re wearing, I love it.</li>
            <li> Annice C.G. Chicago,  This lotion is great for anyone ( male/female ) and for any season. My body feel silky smooth , soft and smell Great!  I just ordered more.</li>
            <li> MY MOM LOVES THIS. HAS A GREAT SMELL</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!! Lotion has a clean lasting scent that will bring you compliments all day. I am a satisfied customer. Two thumbs up!  [[ASIN:B000ALIL78 Razac Hand &amp; Body Lotion, 16 oz.]]</li>
            <li> nice smell but I got tired of it quickly i gave the lotion to my mother</li>
            <li> My dad finds it difficult navigating the web and he wanted this lotion but couldn&#x27;t find it at the stores.  I located it, bought it and made my dad really happy.  He said this is one of the only lotion he and my mom use - sounds like a good Xmas gift. (DON&#x27;T TELL HIM) smile</li>
            <li> Love this lotion smell wonderful</li>
            <li> The wife loves this product, so we will continue to buy it!;&lt;br /&gt;My mother in law used this lotion and my wife will continue to do the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this profit for over 5 years and it needs all of my expectations.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I advice every body to try it!!!</li>
            <li> I used this lotion earlier in the day..went to work out at the gym for about an hour....then went to go get something to eat..the guy at the counter said &amp;quot;OH MY GOD U SMELL SOOOOOO GOOD!&amp;quot; Even when I worked as a cashier the customers complimented me all the time on how I smelled..I LOVE this lotion.. Best around!!!</li>
            <li> best lotion ever, everyone states I smell so good when I put this on. I recommend that everyone tries it</li>
            <li> Great product I recommend it for winter , nice scent projects very well and last you all day long .</li>
            <li> this hand and body lotion is a good product. Skin feels moist and soft when lotion applied .  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Its got a great smell that literally lasts alll day, and its not all greasy and oily after its applied. Fully recommend this product</li>
            <li> This body lotion it good for my skin.............</li>
            <li> Okay this is kind of a mixed review&amp;#62; my father gets this for his super dry skin and absolutely loves it. Says it works wonders and he&#x27;s used nearly every product out there. However, I tried it and found it to have an overwhelming floral scent. It gave me an instant headache. The texture was nice and silky but nothing I&#x27;d swoon over. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again due to the smell alone but, like I said, My father raves over this stuff so I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star for him:)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my grandma becuase she worships the stuff. She was so excited to get more as she has had trouble finding it. She says it works great for her thin skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on many comments about the nice smell. I can barely use the lotion as it is way to strong for me. It sort of smells like a perm. I do like the light-weight feel of it. I just wish I liked the smell as much as the other reviewers.</li>
