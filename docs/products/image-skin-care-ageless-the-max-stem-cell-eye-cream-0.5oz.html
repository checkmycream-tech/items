            <li>and I love them!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I still haven&#x27;t found one to commit to.  </li>
            <li>But this one is very close to being perfect.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see what kind of results I get after using for awhile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s packed full of great anti-aging ingredients and comes in a pump bottle.</li>
            <li>Many of their products have impressive results, so I was very hopeful for this one.  </li>
            <li>Was really great for the first month but then started drying my skin..</li>
            <li>My eye area looked brighter and I looked more rested</li>
            <li>It seems ok, but nothing great.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause problems with concealer when used on top.</li>
            <li>I love this product and see a noticeable difference on the skin surrounding my eyes.  </li>
            <li>and I end up squirting out more every time than I need.  </li>
            <li>What a combination..  Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Great product, the real deal.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it cures anything; but I feel it prevents more bags and wrinkles under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the entire product line.</li>
            <li>but I love the Image products.</li>
            <li>receive so many compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Many times.  </li>
            <li>I bought this thinking that it would be even better than the Ageless eye lift</li>
            <li>more tired.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not the most hydrating eye cream I have used.</li>
            <li>A bit watery... much more than when I purchase it in the store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams, but I&#x27;m sticking with this one.</li>
            <li>perfect in all its tiny packaging &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have used the image products and I just love them.</li>
            <li>Great product and highly recommended by my estetician.  </li>
            <li>Great product, goes on easily and feels gentle.</li>
            <li>The product is pretty good</li>
            <li>This product truly works with diminishing fine lines(crows feet).</li>
            <li>For under eye it was fine.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>But so far so good.</li>
            <li>Image is excellent brand, high quality and worth using (check out their Vital C line).</li>
            <li>Eye max is a silky rich eye cream that has soften the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Well worth it for such great eye cream.</li>
            <li>I love the whole Image line.</li>
            <li>They must have changed the design because I see many sai too much came out.  </li>
            <li>I bought and used the whole bottle without any notable results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this and every other Image product I have purchased.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>I just take the top off and use a cue tip for applying cream (put top back on for storing).  </li>
            <li>I am really enjoying the change of my new skin.</li>
            <li>It is fine but really haven&#x27;t seen any results so to speak.</li>
            <li>Be careful might be great for others just for me twice a day after a while was too much - had to switch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several eyecreams but keep going g back this really is the best</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product rolls right off of the application area.</li>
            <li>Really, nothing special.</li>
            <li>Purchased this eye creme on Amazon (usually buy at salon) and aesthetician couldn&#x27;t believe how great my eye area looked.  </li>
            <li>but instead it dried the area around the eyes making my creases more prominent.  </li>
            <li>I think I really like this eye cream!</li>
            <li>Love this for some extra TLC for under my eye area.</li>
            <li>I tried many different ways of using the pump - it was a challenge every day.  </li>
            <li>I just bought and wrote a review on the Ageless Total Pure Hyaluronic Filler which I just love.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve tried this eye cream and it really makes the area around my eyes soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Complaints about the applicator seem to have been addressed, and my most recent bottle is working very well.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer a different packaging, but overall, love the eye creme!</li>
            <li>This product smells nice and yes the pump does give a little to much when pumped.</li>
            <li>there is too much air</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t tell her because she wants me to buy everything from the salon.  </li>
            <li>but wish it would not dispense so much cream at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>But the real problem is</li>
            <li>Dispenses too much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference using it or not tho.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I had was that the first container I purchased seemed to have a defective pump so huge globs could come out, far more than I needed, causing the product to be used up too quickly.  </li>
            <li>One full pump for me is enough for both eyes.  </li>
            <li>(I have a new born baby, I am not rested!)</li>
            <li>I am not sure how much of a difference this eye creme makes, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my under eye area puffy which many eye cremes do.  </li>
            <li>So many eye creams are too stiff and you have to rub your eye far too much to get them to absorb.</li>
            <li>Because I don&#x27;t like perfume I switched to something else pretty quickly, so I probably didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was concerned how this would do...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and this eye cream</li>
            <li>I am seeing less dark circles and less wrinkles around my eyes with this wonderful creme.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my skin soft and minimizes the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Not too light or too heavy.  </li>
            <li>My Esthetician recommended this and Vital C.  </li>
            <li>You know there is only so much a product line can do.</li>
            <li>Then when it finally dispenses, it is a disgorge so that you have way too much cream on your finger.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really comment.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or not, but it&#x27;s not the same consistency as the one I purchased in the store.</li>
            <li>The price may seem high, but the jar is pretty large, and a small pump--maybe half a pump--is all you need.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and is truly worth the invest.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way and is truly worth the invest.</li>
            <li> so there is no &amp;#34;dragging&amp;#34; on the delicate skin around the eye and absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t have to rub too much (also easier on delicate eye tissue).</li>
            <li> Tube doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Almost every use I had to open the container to put half back in.</li>
            <li> I had tried other moisturizers with firming, but found my makeup did not &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; properly or looked flakey.  </li>
            <li> This is the 1st time I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;Max&amp;#34; eye creme (I usually use the &#x27;Vital C&#x27; line of this brand), but I went out on a limb.  </li>
            <li> For the same price, I found other eye cremes that work the same if not better than this one.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I see much difference than the creams I have used in the past</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this item I read quiet a few reviews, which convinced me to buy it</li>
            <li> It is now in a tube with a tiny hole wher very little comes out.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have any noticeable results with the other eye creams or any other eye cream for that matter.</li>
            <li> so I figured it can&#x27;t hurt because you can combine other Image products with it.</li>
            <li> One small pump is enough for both eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may be that the ph is not right for my skin age or something.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it sticks and won&#x27;t go down.  </li>

            <li> I have used all kinds of eye creams but this is the best I have tried! After only a week i noticed a difference, granted I am only 30. My eye area looked brighter and I looked more rested (I have a new born baby, I am not rested!) I like all the image products but I didn&#x27;t have any noticeable results with the other eye creams or any other eye cream for that matter.</li>
            <li> I think I really like this eye cream! Goes on smooth and soaks in great! I am still wrinkled…not a miracle cream but defintley feel hydrated!</li>
            <li> Product received is not what is pictured or  described.  What is received is the Image Stem Cell eye cream, not The Max eye cream.  Thinking Image may have discontinued then previous version.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for little product you get.  What happened to the Max Eye Cream?  It seems ok, but nothing great.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s hard to get out of the tube sometimes.  It just squirts out.  Very tiny tube of product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several eyecreams but keep going g back this really is the best</li>
            <li> Great product, goes on easily and feels gentle.</li>
            <li> love it , great product, recommend it to all age groups, perfect texture, smells great still looking for a better product that would remove my age spot/ brown spots under my eye lid.</li>
            <li> I was expecting for my eyes to be well moisturized but instead it dried the area around the eyes making my creases more prominent.  Before I purchased this item I read quiet a few reviews, which convinced me to buy it but unfortunately I did not get the results I read on the comments.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream. I use it day and night. It doesn&#x27;t cause problems with concealer when used on top. Have reordered.  Tube doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Last year a rep introduced me to the entire Image brand line.  This specific Eye Creme (MAX) definitely has the quality.  This is the 1st time I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;Max&amp;#34; eye creme (I usually use the &#x27;Vital C&#x27; line of this brand), but I went out on a limb.  One of the 1st things I do after waking up is look at my face in the mirror.  I immediately reach for this eye creme.  One full pump for me is enough for both eyes.  The bags and lines tighten up well, and it has a fragrance to die for.  Over the years I have tried a dozen (no exaggeration) different under eye creams,serums, etc.  Honestly I still haven&#x27;t found one to commit to.  But this one is very close to being perfect.  Image is excellent brand, high quality and worth using (check out their Vital C line).</li>
            <li> Love it! Crows feet and lines are smoother.</li>
            <li> I love this product and see a noticeable difference on the skin surrounding my eyes.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I don&#x27;t like the pump- there is too much air and I end up squirting out more every time than I need.  I would prefer a different packaging, but overall, love the eye creme!</li>
            <li> Had a facial yesterday and have been using IMAGE for a couple of years, but not the MAX products.  Purchased this eye creme on Amazon (usually buy at salon) and aesthetician couldn&#x27;t believe how great my eye area looked.  She pushed to find out what I had done....my lips are sealed.  Didn&#x27;t tell her because she wants me to buy everything from the salon.  Use this at night and the Ageless Total Eye Lift Creme in morning.  What a combination..  Love this product.  Also ordered another MAX creme and will leave feedback once that arrives.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin soft and minimizes the appearance of wrinkles. I am really enjoying the change of my new skin.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing eye cream, skin around eyes feel great and hydrated. Lightens areas underneath eyes. Eyes look and feel refreshed all day.</li>
            <li> Was really great for the first month but then started drying my skin.. So I had to up the moisturizer!!! Be careful might be great for others just for me twice a day after a while was too much - had to switch.</li>
            <li> Like it. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really comment. I use it with my Clarisonic. Hope it pays off</li>
            <li> Great product, the real deal. I have purchased through salon and online.  Works well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Good price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year now and find it to be very good.  I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t expect miracles at my age; but this feels good.  I can&#x27;t say it cures anything; but I feel it prevents more bags and wrinkles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have only just begun to use this product. So far so good.  It quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> is the product to be used with my eye lift cream or alone in PM. I&#x27;m very happy with the entire product line.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this eye cream.  Not too light or too heavy.  We&#x27;ll see what kind of results I get after using for awhile.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I have ever used. used it last year then ran out and bought Dermalogica instead. Now back to the ageless max forever!!!!</li>
            <li> This product truly works with diminishing fine lines(crows feet). A little goes a long way and is truly worth the invest.</li>
            <li> Love this for some extra TLC for under my eye area.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I see much difference than the creams I have used in the past but I love the Image products.</li>
            <li> Great Product...but wish it would not dispense so much cream at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Used product line for serveral years! Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely obsessed with this stuff! I have very sensitive skin and was concerned how this would do...but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very sensitive eyes and this eye cream NEVER irritates my eyes.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Eye max is a silky rich eye cream that has soften the lines around my eyes. I have been using Image products for awhile. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Image line. First time I&#x27;ve tried this eye cream and it really makes the area around my eyes soft and smooth. I also feel it has helped with some of the lines as I don&#x27;t see them as pronounced anymore.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty good but the bottle it comes in is terrible.  They must have changed the design because I see many sai too much came out.  It is now in a tube with a tiny hole wher very little comes out.  But the real problem is mine burst end at the end of the tube so a bunch of cream exploded out the back and now I have to either tape up the end or put in some othe container to use the rest.</li>
            <li> Used this product for years great amazon has the best price</li>
            <li> My Esthetician recommended this and Vital C.  The eye cream firms and moisturizers my eye area giving my eyes a lift, staving off Botox at least for now.  The only complaint I had was that the first container I purchased seemed to have a defective pump so huge globs could come out, far more than I needed, causing the product to be used up too quickly.  Complaints about the applicator seem to have been addressed, and my most recent bottle is working very well.  I had tried other moisturizers with firming, but found my makeup did not &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; properly or looked flakey.  This product allows for the best of all worlds, firming, smoothing, brightening and great with makeup.</li>
            <li> I am seeing less dark circles and less wrinkles around my eyes with this wonderful creme. I think I have found another addition to my skin care regime. Love the Image skin care line!</li>
            <li> terrible packaging. Hard to get product out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I had to remove the product &amp; put it into another case.&lt;br /&gt;The creme is good but I wasted a lot of it. The company agreed to&lt;br /&gt;a return but it seemed like too much trouble.</li>
            <li> I have used all your products Image Eye Cream  I would recommend great results.  I Am 71 .i receive so many compliments on my skin.  I have been told I look 50. Many times.  It&#x27;s great when your Drs tell you the same&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is very good. My daughter loves it. Unfortunately I am allergic to it. My eyes got puffy and itchy whenever I used it. Too bad because I use a few other products by Image and I love them!</li>
            <li> This product arrived when promised.  This is an amazing product.  It&#x27;s like having an eye-lift without surgery.  I recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle before realizing this product was doing nothing for my eyes.  After applying in the morning I give this product time to sit on my skin and absorb (10 min) then apply my makeup.  This product rolls right off of the application area. This product smells nice and yes the pump does give a little to much when pumped.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it would be even better than the Ageless eye lift but it is not. May be because I am not in my fifties but late thirties but I did have a ton of sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought, well, it is not working...but I will wear it at night and then wear the Ageless lift in the AM. Nope. My eyes looked drier, more tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be that the ph is not right for my skin age or something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a couple of days but I am no stranger to the Image line as I have stated in all of my reviews on the Image line. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!!!  My eye lids are a bit saggy and I&#x27;m hoping this product will help with that. You know there is only so much a product line can do. But Image in my opinion gives me the results that make me happy. I just bought and wrote a review on the Ageless Total Pure Hyaluronic Filler which I just love. Now the reason I mention this product is because I just put a small amount of it on my eyelids before I add this product. I think it gives it a boost. I don&#x27;t know if you are supposed to use the Hyaluronic Filler on your eyelids though. But so far so good. It&#x27;s used for super-hydration so I figured it can&#x27;t hurt because you can combine other Image products with it. I&#x27;m happy with this and every other Image product I have purchased.</li>
            <li> It is fine but really haven&#x27;t seen any results so to speak. Not the most hydrating eye cream I have used.</li>
            <li> Great product and highly recommended by my estetician.  I use it faithfully and now don&#x27;t like to be without it.</li>
            <li> Really, nothing special. For the same price, I found other eye cremes that work the same if not better than this one. So I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on getting this one.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is the best I have ever used - have been using it for 2 yrs.  However, the pump is terrible!!  I just take the top off and use a cue tip for applying cream (put top back on for storing).  They realy need to rethink this one.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much of a difference this eye creme makes, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my under eye area puffy which many eye cremes do.  I like it and it seems to moisturize well - not a miracle creme but I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the Image skin care line.  Many of their products have impressive results, so I was very hopeful for this one.  I bought and used the whole bottle without any notable results.  The really awful thing about this product is the pump - it is temperamental.  Sometimes it sticks and won&#x27;t go down.  Then when it finally dispenses, it is a disgorge so that you have way too much cream on your finger.  I tried many different ways of using the pump - it was a challenge every day.  Bottom line:  I used up the cream a lot faster than I would have if the pump worked well.  I feel like I wasted my money.  I&#x27;ll try another Image product.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> I am still trying it but I  don&#x27;t know if this is how its supposed to be ,the consistency?? I don&#x27;t  see any results yet?</li>
            <li> A bit watery... much more than when I purchase it in the store. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or not, but it&#x27;s not the same consistency as the one I purchased in the store.</li>
            <li> Excellent eye cream, as one would expect from Image, a quality brand. It&#x27;s packed full of great anti-aging ingredients and comes in a pump bottle. One small pump is enough for both eyes. What I like about this is the consistency. It&#x27;s perfect! So many eye creams are too stiff and you have to rub your eye far too much to get them to absorb. That&#x27;s bad for aging eyes. Well, not so for this product! It glides on with your ring finger so there is no &amp;#34;dragging&amp;#34; on the delicate skin around the eye and absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t have to rub too much (also easier on delicate eye tissue). The price may seem high, but the jar is pretty large, and a small pump--maybe half a pump--is all you need. So it lasts me a couple of months. Well worth it for such great eye cream. I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams, but I&#x27;m sticking with this one.</li>
            <li> perfect in all its tiny packaging &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I agree about the packaging. Dispenses too much. Almost every use I had to open the container to put half back in. didn&#x27;t hydrate my eyelids enough. For under eye it was fine. I didn&#x27;t see much difference using it or not tho. Because I don&#x27;t like perfume I switched to something else pretty quickly, so I probably didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> I have used the image products and I just love them. I haven&#x27;t used anything else on my skin since I got this.</li>
