            <li> It&#x27;s pink, and messy if you don&#x27;t use sparringly.</li>

            <li> good quality talc, just like the barbers use, without going to the barber.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Stop going to the barber tonsave money and time and started cutting my own hair. I got this stuff because i love the smell.  Best part of going to the barber was the end when they use this stuff on you.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen this stuff in 15 years. Great products. Great odor as well. Might need to order a couple more just for safe keeping.</li>
            <li> This is the scent you remember as a kid getting your hair cut by a real barber, no fancy hair dying and $40.00 shampoo this is the right stuff, thank you guys!</li>
            <li> The real stuff...just like you found in the barber shops of yesteryear!</li>
            <li> This is the finest talc I have ever used!  After trying many,many brands I noticed my barber was using this talc on his brush after a shave.  I ordered some of this and WOW what a difference!  Even though it is not expensive, it is the BEST!  You just have to try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 2 years, it is a stable for any man who takes grooming and hygiene serious. You never want to be in a situation where some bad smelling funk may cost you certain opportunities. Rather than applying some perfumed body spray, just add this to your post shower routine. You&#x27;ll be clean, feel fresh, and it&#x27;ll keep moisture down all without smelling like pre-puberty adolescent who just got out of the deodorant isle.</li>
            <li> this is the stuff I remember as a child. It was fun and effective then and to my surprise no one has tinkered with it. It still works great and smells even better Thanks</li>
            <li> My favorite powder ever.  A tip would be to buy the &amp;#34;Diane Powder Neck Duster&amp;#34;.  It has a reservoir with a twist off cap and you can load powder into it and release some with a button.  I use it daily.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> Trust me.....you need this and you will use it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
            <li> Great stuff I use it as deoderant at work and it works just fine. The scent ingredients are fewer than in the aftershave, but it definitely has the main base of the scent maybe without the moss extracts and some others. But if you&#x27;re using both this and the aftershave then you&#x27;re a smart man, git me? Also read a study that says inhaling linalool calms stress, it&#x27;s one of the ingredients in clubman original.</li>
            <li> Just the best in Talc for men in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Good for razor cuts or underarm deodorant.</li>
            <li> works and smells great!</li>
            <li> My husband and son like this powder a  lot.  Keeps them cool and dry.  I like it because it smells good.</li>
            <li> Very fine talc with a clean fresh scent. Smells like the old barber shops....</li>
            <li> THe product arrived exactly as explained and has a very nice aroma. Exactly like the stuff they use in the Barber Shop.!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink, and messy if you don&#x27;t use sparringly. But good product.</li>
            <li> Get it! Smell like a man!</li>
