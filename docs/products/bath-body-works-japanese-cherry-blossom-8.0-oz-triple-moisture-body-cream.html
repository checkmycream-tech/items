            <li> This is my third tube of Bath Body Works Cherry Blossom moisturizer.  I have no doubt there are a dozen or more in my future.  It has a light but lovey fragrance.  It&#x27;s not a bit greasy or gritty and works wonderfully well.  Get some.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing Body Cream.  Great clean fragrance.  Keeps even sun, and chlorine abused--old lady:0 skin moisturized.  Great for cold winter months as well.  Great sellers---super fast shipping, and a good price point.  Thank you :0</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t recognize the benefits of all the ingredients.</li>

            <li> Japanese Cherry Blossom scent is my favorite so when I saw the triple moisture crème I figured it would be great since the regular lotion already lasts a few hrs when I use it. This one actually lasts all day if not actually more than 24 hrs and the segment that I love is still the same in this one. So as far as the scent goes you can still rely on it, love it, and enjoy it  :)</li>
            <li> My son bought some Japanese Cherry Blossom  lotion for me and I was hooked. It smells so very good. It feels good and makes me feel pretty which is a nice aspect of the lotion. I really like it a lot and my son does, too, obviously, since he first picked it out for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the amount I got was worth the price but the smell can justify it.</li>
            <li> Soft hands and nice fragrance!!</li>
