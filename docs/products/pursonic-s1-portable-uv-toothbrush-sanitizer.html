            <li>So far, it is working perfectly, and I am beyond pleased with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I begin my many PROS of this sanitizer, I want to tell you how I am able to place my Crest Spinbrush&#x27;s toothbrush in this to sanitize it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Special things that I LOVE about this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was ok with this but 5 months after purchase, it just quit.  </li>
            <li>Great item, fast shipping üëç</li>
            <li>Nice to have this knowing my toothbrush is clean every time I use it in my travels.</li>
            <li>Very useful for traveling to keep it germ free!</li>
            <li>Also, it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and it is easy to get it in your purse.</li>
            <li>This is a nice case, and worked well at first.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to open/close and light weight.</li>
            <li>A problem like this reported by so many people needs to be thoroughly &amp; quickly implemented.</li>
            <li>The case is very easy to use as I just inserted 2 AA Batteries, placed my toothbrush into it and the light came right on to begin the sanitizer</li>
            <li>In order to sanitize the Spinbrush Battery toothbrush, I remove the head and place the head (toothbrush part) and face the brush toward the inside light.</li>
            <li>But, about sixty days after I bought the item, the UV light bulb seemingly burnt out.</li>
            <li>The LED light that indicates the circuits are working still works, but the sanitizing UV bulb does not.</li>
            <li>It too care of keeping my brush free from germs.</li>
            <li>So good to know I have a toothbrush that is always handy, clean, dry and sanitized for any on-demand usage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine as a regular toothbrushes holder even if it doesn&#x27;t work any more though.</li>
            <li>Mold builds up pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li>The 1st use when I closed the lid, The ultra blue violet light came on bright &amp; kinda cool looking.</li>
            <li>Well mine worked exactly twice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so many reviews with similar problems.  </li>
            <li>I tested the batteries which were brand new with a full charge.</li>
            <li>First, the light did not stay on for 5 minutes, only 2.  </li>
            <li>Batteries last a  good long time (no battery changes since purchase 3 months ago).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my new mouthwash, my new toothbrush, my new toothpaste or my new sanitizer, but something has worked and made my mouth feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>works great just wish it was a little bit bigger</li>
            <li>However no blue light at all.</li>
            <li>and the uv light simply will not turn on.</li>
            <li>Maybe two AA batteries a month isn&#x27;t a lot to some, but it seems like too much to</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really know how much it sanitizes</li>
            <li>I have also seen the reports of how much bacteria is floating around in our bathrooms.  </li>
            <li>Does the job very well</li>
            <li>They work very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice feature in that it turns on when you close the case, and stays on for a few minutes with a timer.  </li>
            <li>The 2nd time the blue light came in very fun &amp; then went out altogether after about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>When I have finished my toothbrushing, I first rinse the toothbrush with very hot water for 30 seconds and then towel dry.</li>
            <li>At more than half the price I took a chance with this one.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this everyone who has a toothbrush</li>
            <li>Nice and compact, and holds the toothbrush firmly in place, only had it a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>The bristles lay a little bit above the actual UV light emitting slot.</li>
            <li>so no long term opinion.</li>
            <li>3rd try the green indicator light came on as it did the previous uses.</li>

            <li> Small and so portable -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it at least 25X</li>
            <li> Since I am using my battery toothbrush now on the go, I carry this Spinbrush head of the toothbrush in this case and bring my battery toothbrush base with me in my travel bag for on the go...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This replaces an earlier toothbrush sterilizer that finally quit working after 3 years or so.  This on does an excellent job and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> i am using it everyday</li>
            <li> For years I have used these, keep one in my purse another in bathroom... always have one in my travel bag.  So good to know I have a toothbrush that is always handy, clean, dry and sanitized for any on-demand usage.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews which stated this item quit working after 1-4 weeks. Well mine worked exactly twice. Make that 1.5 times. The 1st use when I closed the lid, The ultra blue violet light came on bright &amp; kinda cool looking. The 2nd time the blue light came in very fun &amp; then went out altogether after about 1 minute. I tested the batteries which were brand new with a full charge. 3rd try the green indicator light came on as it did the previous uses. However no blue light at all. I&#x27;ve tried it at least 25X and the uv light simply will not turn on. I&#x27;ve read so many reviews with similar problems.  A problem like this reported by so many people needs to be thoroughly &amp; quickly implemented.</li>
            <li> Beware the fact that this case uses a lot of batteries. I brush my teeth 2-3 times a day and I have had to replace the batteries twice in two months. Maybe two AA batteries a month isn&#x27;t a lot to some, but it seems like too much to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem I have with this case, is that it is a little snug for my Oral-B brush. The bristles lay a little bit above the actual UV light emitting slot.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact, and holds the toothbrush firmly in place, only had it a couple of weeks so no long term opinion.</li>
            <li> Bought 1 of these blue Pursonics and 4 pink Zadros for Christmas.  Everyone in my family likes having our toothbrushes covered and sanitized after each use, whether at home or traveling.  Batteries last a  good long time (no battery changes since purchase 3 months ago). Sturdy little box. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now.i don&#x27;t really know how much it sanitizes, i&#x27;ve never had a way to test it or anything, but i do like the way it protects the brush from other things. it&#x27;s easy to open/close and light weight. it also doesn&#x27;t get that weird build up that many other styles of travel case do because they don&#x27;t ever get to dry out. i&#x27;d buy another.</li>
            <li> This arrived as described.  I purchased two as we will be leaving on vacation.  I had the violight and it worked great for travel but lasted just over a year before the light burnt out.  At more than half the price I took a chance with this one.  If it lasts longer than the violight it is a great deal.</li>
            <li> works great just wish it was a little bit bigger</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my new mouthwash, my new toothbrush, my new toothpaste or my new sanitizer, but something has worked and made my mouth feel so much better.  I am recommending to my friends.  Also, it is easy to use.  The book &amp;#34;Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye&amp;#34; by Ellie Phillips recommended I get one and this one works on a battery so it should travel well. I have also seen the reports of how much bacteria is floating around in our bathrooms.  Oooo.</li>
            <li> Pursonic S2 Toothbrush Sanitizer Toothbrush Holder is just perfect for me needs and really works! For me, I was so happy to find this wonderful Pursonic S2 Toothbrush Sanitizer and Toothbrush Travel holder. It is perfect for me to use at home or take with me when I travel. The case is very easy to use as I just inserted 2 AA Batteries, placed my toothbrush into it and the light came right on to begin the sanitizer process.&lt;br /&gt;**Before I begin my many PROS of this sanitizer, I want to tell you how I am able to place my Crest Spinbrush&#x27;s toothbrush in this to sanitize it. In order to sanitize the Spinbrush Battery toothbrush, I remove the head and place the head (toothbrush part) and face the brush toward the inside light. Then I close the cover and it sanitizes this brush in about 1 minute to 1.5 minutes. Since I am using my battery toothbrush now on the go, I carry this Spinbrush head of the toothbrush in this case and bring my battery toothbrush base with me in my travel bag for on the go...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special things that I LOVE about this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Small and so portable - This case I can leave on my bathroom counter so my toothbrush is always handy and CLEAN!&lt;br /&gt;Also at a moments notice, I can grab this and put it into my purse for an overnight trip. (with my Spinbrush base).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) So far, it is working perfectly, and I am beyond pleased with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful hint: When I have finished my toothbrushing, I first rinse the toothbrush with very hot water for 30 seconds and then towel dry. Then I place it into this unit. This way it is double cleaned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to all!</li>
            <li> Did not work upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Works great and gives me piece of mind!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these sanitizers for me and my husband.&lt;br /&gt;And they both have stopped working after a week of using.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote a messege to a seller asking for replacement of returning, but they did not even answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I want to warn you about the product and the seller! Don&#x27;t buy these sanitizers, because this is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, completely useless and dead after first week of use - DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> This a great product, which is great for traveling. It works to sanitize your toothbrush to last longer. Highly recommend this everyone who has a toothbrush</li>
            <li> excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> First, the light did not stay on for 5 minutes, only 2.  I was ok with this but 5 months after purchase, it just quit.  I changed the batteries to no avail.  Well I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It was great for the 9 days it worked. It was kept flat on a dry shelf the entire time and just quit.</li>
            <li> I tried this on two toothbrushes and they both grew mold!</li>
            <li> This is a nice case, and worked well at first. It broke out after about a dozen brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice feature in that it turns on when you close the case, and stays on for a few minutes with a timer.  But, about sixty days after I bought the item, the UV light bulb seemingly burnt out. I only used the sanitizer as a toothbrush case on trips, so I only opened the case/activated the UV lightbulb about a dozen times. The LED light that indicates the circuits are working still works, but the sanitizing UV bulb does not.</li>
            <li> The sanitizer only worked about five times before it quit. It&#x27;s fine as a regular toothbrushes holder even if it doesn&#x27;t work any more though.</li>
            <li> Very useful for traveling to keep it germ free!</li>
            <li> Great item - ideal for travel</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to my dental hygiene regime.  I really appreciated it when I had a cold.  It too care of keeping my brush free from germs.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well and it is easy to get it in your purse. Used it to travel abroad and had to open my bag to be checked.</li>
            <li> This is great for travel, or home use.  Would definitely buy this again.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this for all of your loved ones.</li>
            <li> My son didn&#x27;t want other people&#x27;s germs to get on his toothbrush. (Even though his room is a biohazard) This is the perfect solution. He always knows which one is his and its gets sanitized between uses. Love it!</li>
            <li> Quit after 3 months of daily use. Mold builds up pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Quit working after several weeks.  Total piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Great item, fast shipping üëç</li>
            <li> Had one of these for several years.  They work very well.  I have ease of mind about re-infecting myself with the flu...Nice to have this knowing my toothbrush is clean every time I use it in my travels.</li>
