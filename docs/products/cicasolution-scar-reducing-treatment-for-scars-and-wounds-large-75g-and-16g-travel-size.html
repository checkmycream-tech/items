            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I was hoping for better results because I love the application stick vs cream.</li>
            <li>but I feel more free when I use the gel.</li>
            <li>I put on the scar glide and cover the area with the tape so that the gel doesn&#x27;t rub off easily, get on things, etc..</li>
            <li>Shipping was fine.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>

            <li>The only good thing I can say about it is that it came on time.</li>
            <li>Works pretty easy to apply</li>
            <li>I purchased it recently for a friend who had a facial injury; knowing how awesome this gel was.</li>

            <li>Now it feels so much better, soft and supple.</li>

            <li>Not only did she have to get stitches, her face had to be cut more by the plastic surgeon in order to even out the wounds because of the jagged edges of the bites.</li>
            <li>originally tried using silicone scar strips -- actually found that C-section products are the perfect size -- but they were uncomfortable and tended to roll up on the edges.  </li>

            <li>and I don&#x27;t really see improvement.</li>

            <li>AND I DON&#x27;T SEE MUCH CHANGE IN THE KELOID AREA ON MY FOOT (HAD FOOT SURGERY IN EARLY APRIL).  </li>
            <li>I will check these when I receive the new ones.</li>
            <li>I have only positive things to say and I plan on using it for a while.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and occasionally I might just re-apply a little more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE EARLY JUNE 2015</li>
            <li>Seems to be helping me so far</li>
            <li>the last stick I bought only was half full.</li>
            <li>Product is much much cheaper than other products that do the same and of like quality.</li>
            <li>Based on other reviews, one must be consistent and use the product for a long time for results to be noticeable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is amazing stuff. My scar from leg surgery felt tight and painful. Now it feels so much better, soft and supple. I use it every day. So happy I found it, lotions and cocoa butter are not the answer. Try it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now. There are no visible results. Based on other reviews, one must be consistent and use the product for a long time for results to be noticeable. I will continue using the product for a while longer to see if there are any changes.</li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t believe  how well this product works!  I kept using it as instructed and after a month or so the scar flattened out.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect miracles from OTC products, but this one comes close.  I&#x27;ve been using it on the sternal incision scar resulting from my CABG surgery 10 weeks ago; started using it in week 7.  Definitely seems to have helped flatten the scar and keep it supple while it goes through its final healing process.  One note -- this will stain clothes and is hard to wash out of things like undershirts, so you might want to set aside some of your older shirts and undershirts to use with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally tried using silicone scar strips -- actually found that C-section products are the perfect size -- but they were uncomfortable and tended to roll up on the edges.  Also lost their stickiness after just 3-4 days, and they were too expensive to replace that often.</li>
            <li> This product does work, but takes some time. Continue to use and you will be pleased with results. Will  purchase again.</li>
            <li> Easy applicator, and nice size.  I like that it came as a pair.  Shipping was fine.</li>
            <li> Product is much much cheaper than other products that do the same and of like quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this product 3 stars. I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to make valid judgement. In the last I had immediate results with the strips so I guess I was expecting this product to be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for about 3 or 4 weeks, my keloid didn&#x27;t appear to change at all.</li>
            <li> Reading all the positive reviews on this product really made me want to buy it...so I did. Unfortunately, both tubes were extremely small and you could use just 1 tube in the first few uses, if not only the first. Because the product lasted about 2 days, and broke apart, obviously there was no way for me to see if it would actually work. Maybe the other customers received bigger tubes/sticks, I have no idea, but I REALLY wasted my money on this - I was hoping for a great product. The only good thing I can say about it is that it came on time. Please don&#x27;t waste your money, keep searching, there are other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 4 months now and I don&#x27;t really see improvement. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it a 3 star.</li>
            <li> this is the bomb this stick is great easy to use and it works my scar is fading need to get me some more.</li>
            <li> Seems to have help minimize the scar.  Nice compact container to put in your purse or pocket to use during the day</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this product....but I used it on a raised scar behind my ear that had been there for about 5 months. I used just a very small layer every morning and every night. I actually could feel the result in about two weeks. I have used it for about two months now and the scar is almost completely flat and only faintly visible. I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Works pretty easy to apply</li>
            <li> I got this gel and another item on Amazon, Mepitac Silicone Tape, to help diminish scars from a recent brachioplasty. I put on the scar glide and cover the area with the tape so that the gel doesn&#x27;t rub off easily, get on things, etc.. As such, I cannot say which of the two, if not both, is most effective but I can say that the combination of the two has been great.  I can see noticeable reduction in scar redness using this combination.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE EARLY JUNE 2015 AND NOW IT&#x27;S THE END OF JUNE AND I DON&#x27;T SEE MUCH CHANGE IN THE KELOID AREA ON MY FOOT (HAD FOOT SURGERY IN EARLY APRIL).  I&#x27;M JUST TRYING TO BE PATIENT!</li>
            <li> These  product really works I will keep buying it. I love it</li>
            <li> I saw no improvement on either scar despite applying religiously a few times a day for a month. (One was 9 weeks post surgery and the other was only 2 weeks after.)  Both incisions were healed. I was hoping for better results because I love the application stick vs cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since June 2015 after my breast augmentation and lift. The scars are now faded exceptionally well with the help of the silicon CicaSolution. I also used a silicone tape but I feel more free when I use the gel. It has been very useful and quick to put on. I usually take a shower then place this on. It stays on all day and occasionally I might just re-apply a little more. The texture is smooth/lightly oily when put on the skin. I have only positive things to say and I plan on using it for a while. There is a slight problem the last stick I bought only was half full. I will check these when I receive the new ones. Buy the 2 pack because this is less then an single if you continue to use overtime. I would highly recommend to family and friends. I will order more in the future. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Really works on a scar that I got this year from a basal cell cancer on my face. Having a scar on my face was not something I wanted everyone and myself to see. The scar is almost invisible.</li>
            <li> Still using this product. Seems to be helping a little bit with a surgical scar on my neck.  May update review at a later date but so far so good.</li>
            <li> used both bottles with the hope of some improvement, no noticeable difference. bottles are very small as well.</li>
            <li> I used this medication for almost five years &amp; I like it very much.</li>
            <li> The only scar gel my plastic surgeon will recommend, he charges $40.00 for it! Mederma has garlic in it which is an irritant he says and does not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This really works.............best out there on the market. My daughter was bitten on her face by a German Shepherd. Not only did she have to get stitches, her face had to be cut more by the plastic surgeon in order to even out the wounds because of the jagged edges of the bites. The plastice surgeon recommended it. The results were amazing and now, years later, you&#x27;d never know what had happened. I purchased it recently for a friend who had a facial injury; knowing how awesome this gel was. She is so grateful.</li>
            <li> I received the product so fast. Around 4 days. like the product. I saw the result just after 2 weeks using it! I will recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have been using the scar fade for four months now, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  In my option, this is not a great product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping me so far it goes on so much easier in stick form too.</li>
