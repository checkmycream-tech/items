            <li>need I say more!</li>
            <li>but I love them!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>Again nice variety, but no instructions.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t come with glue or any kind of directions.</li>
            <li>it was packed nicely.</li>
            <li>some ugggggllllyyy ones but mostly nice ones in the bunch though.</li>
            <li>alot of nice pinks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>For those of you who are new to this nail art form, you should purchase &amp;#34;Scraperfect Best Glue</li>
            <li>nails is very easy to use if you find the correct glue</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my colorful foils assortment.</li>
            <li>These are very very cheap foils that lost their glamor even before you apply them to your nails.</li>
            <li>A couple of sheets for more than the price of ALL of these.</li>
            <li>Love the selection, love the ease of use.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had more of a variety, but for the price, and</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use it well because the adhesive I bought didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>I love using foil on my nails for staining.</li>
            <li>Just would like to see more variety in design selections not in color.</li>
            <li>Once I figure out how to do it, I&#x27;m sure I will love it.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the product quality and selection.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>and I like the assortment in these much better.</li>
            <li>They are okay.</li>
            <li>just order my bunch way better</li>
            <li>It was okay.  </li>
            <li>Will be able to share more after I use it.</li>
            <li>should recommend brands of top coat to use with the foils because I applied it</li>
            <li>but it all ran and smudge when I applied a top coat.</li>
            <li>I might need a better glue</li>
            <li>and I love the look on my nails.  </li>
            <li>but I saw some saying they had to many repeat colors.</li>
            <li>so I was glad there seemed to be more of them.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>It took almost 1 month to arrive but I am pleased with what I received.  </li>
            <li>too many duplicates, though...</li>
            <li>I will like to have more colors.</li>
            <li>They were okay, 2 of them were all scratched but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>very nice, fast shipping</li>
            <li>I received these in the mail yesterday and immediately opened them, the variety was great, I&#x27;ve already tried one of the pink ones, looks great and was easy to use, I used it over the cnd shellac with no adhesive required.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a pretty good buy</li>
            <li>This item was pretty good thank you.</li>
            <li>None  of them are repeated and are all really cool patterns!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to buy these nail foils because it seemed like a better deal than my beauty store.</li>
            <li>Great buy for as many different containers of foil.</li>
            <li>Most of them don&#x27;t transfer completely and aren&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, they arrived on time and in almost perfect condition (one of the foils looked like they were kinda jammed in their container causing some krinkling</li>
            <li>but it haven&#x27;t been able to use any of it because I did not know I had to purchase a special type of foil glue so that the foil could stick to my nails.</li>
            <li>The foils are great &amp; received multiple colors.</li>
            <li>way I use mine is when I do my nails with a UV light.</li>
            <li>Came with free nail guides.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>Just wanna say thanks for ur cooperation nice teamwork AmazonðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li>They are so much fun once you get the hang of it!</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time the other night and my nails turned out awesome!</li>
            <li>I will start out by saying they came much more quicker than I expected which is good</li>
            <li>Also, they were not cut cleanly had torn and ratty ends and damaged edges.</li>
            <li>I purchased the special adhesive for foils and it still won&#x27;t stick to my nail.</li>
            <li>If there was anything I could say I would think it would be cool to of had a purple color...</li>
            <li>Was excited when I ordered this product but most of then are the same color not at all like the picture wears off even with top coat</li>
            <li>it came quickly</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the different designs that I have received ,Very many different designs Thank you again</li>
            <li>A ton of colors to make clear jel quick and easy</li>
            <li>Still had the right number.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors they replaced the missed ones with are nice but product is overall not what was advertised and no where in the add did it say i might not get the exact colors listed, not did it say i would get duplicates of colors.</li>
            <li>Nice product but not enough product and too many of the same designs and colors.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s such a great variety for a low price.  </li>
            <li>and I was hoping for a teal and more solid colors</li>
            <li>I got all of the reds and golds and silvers, and then some, but did not receive any of the pretty blues that I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>for the most part these are solid colors, a handful of them are suuuper psychedelic though...</li>
            <li>You get exactly what they show, containers and all</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I would consider these to be more of a sampler of different designs.  </li>
            <li>Upon further inspection, most of the foils were not even packed correctly and had rubbed off on themselves.</li>
            <li>I will definitely use all of these but many of the colors were repeated.  </li>
            <li>okay (3 red and 1 gold ) .</li>
            <li>first glance</li>
            <li>My problem now is deciding what to use first.</li>
            <li>Most of the foil designs were exactly the same just different colors but the overall package was a good deal.</li>
            <li>The value is fabulous, and the different colors are fun</li>
            <li>It will start dissolving the color of the foil pretty fast unless you drip it and spread it fast.</li>
            <li>A few of mine were different than the listed but there were no duplicates and the ones I received were beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely would order again.</li>
            <li>This product really enhances my designs.</li>
            <li>NOW I CAN DO REALLY</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>And every color x2 time... I&#x27;m very upset I fell the cheating me....</li>
            <li>I really do like this foil.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I got them so fast</li>
            <li>I was VERY please with my purchase...</li>
            <li>I really just wanted the gold and silver colors</li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>Of the 25 colors offered, I received mulitple rolls of the same  colors...and not even the pretty colors!!</li>
            <li>As do all the other colors that have more than one, so really</li>
            <li>My only complaint before I get into the great details is that with this foil when you put a top coat you have to use a fairly thin top coat.</li>
            <li>I want to know what kind of bonder or such the use with these bacause it certainly never worked as advertised or with the easiness I saw in the ad or instructions.</li>
            <li>But my only problem I had that I wish they would of done is have given me more colors not the same ones over I got like 5 red of the same 3 blues of the same wish it would of had more verity as stated on the description !</li>
            <li>The colors were mostly gold and silver with a few reds, greens, blues and pinks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews</li>
            <li>Sadly, one of the foils was damage, but the rest of them are very nice.</li>
            <li>I could not find the foil in any of the towns I live in</li>
            <li>I totally live it.</li>
            <li>Easier to apply to the nail if you first use acetone on a cotton ball and rub off copper colored layer on back side.</li>
            <li>the other brand hand many blah colors: white, cream ...</li>
            <li>I have 6 of the same exact gold.</li>
            <li>why do I need 4 golds of the same exact pattern?</li>
            <li>Most of my foil are just plain!</li>
            <li>I got more then half of the same color</li>
            <li>and as far i can tell i did not receive any duplicates.</li>
            <li>One of them came used but rest of them very goodtotally different colorse</li>
            <li>And well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>Just how many rolls of Christmas green, red and gold does one person need?</li>
            <li>Out of 25 pieces, there might be two I would actually use and due to the pattern on them, most likely only on certain holidays.</li>
            <li>I received less of the solid color non hollographic foils which is fine by me.  </li>
            <li>.I should have read all the reviews, I wanted to take a chance in buying them and it was a bad one I don&#x27;t recommend , Dollornail.com have $1 ones beautiful too</li>
            <li>Other than that this stuff is so pretty.</li>
            <li>wow, thousands of different ways to makeup</li>
            <li>I just use a thin layer of top coat</li>
            <li>Looked messy and had to remove it right away</li>
            <li>but I will say that a few of the colors were identical and I was surprised that there wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of foil in each jar.  </li>
            <li>In place of the missing colors were 5 solid colors ( black, silver, purple, light blue, and copper.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If there was anything I could say I would think it would be cool to of had a purple color...</li>
            <li> Was excited when I ordered this product but most of then are the same color not at all like the picture wears off even with top coat</li>
            <li> it came quickly</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the different designs that I have received ,Very many different designs Thank you again</li>
            <li> A ton of colors to make clear jel quick and easy</li>
            <li> Still had the right number.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors they replaced the missed ones with are nice but product is overall not what was advertised and no where in the add did it say i might not get the exact colors listed, not did it say i would get duplicates of colors.</li>
            <li> Nice product but not enough product and too many of the same designs and colors.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s such a great variety for a low price.  </li>
            <li> and I was hoping for a teal and more solid colors</li>
            <li> I got all of the reds and golds and silvers, and then some, but did not receive any of the pretty blues that I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> for the most part these are solid colors, a handful of them are suuuper psychedelic though...</li>
            <li> You get exactly what they show, containers and all</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I would consider these to be more of a sampler of different designs.  </li>
            <li> Upon further inspection, most of the foils were not even packed correctly and had rubbed off on themselves.</li>
            <li> I will definitely use all of these but many of the colors were repeated.  </li>
            <li> okay (3 red and 1 gold ) .</li>
            <li> first glance</li>
            <li> My problem now is deciding what to use first.</li>
            <li> Most of the foil designs were exactly the same just different colors but the overall package was a good deal.</li>
            <li> The value is fabulous, and the different colors are fun</li>
            <li> It will start dissolving the color of the foil pretty fast unless you drip it and spread it fast.</li>
            <li> A few of mine were different than the listed but there were no duplicates and the ones I received were beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely would order again.</li>
            <li> This product really enhances my designs.</li>
            <li> NOW I CAN DO REALLY</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> And every color x2 time... I&#x27;m very upset I fell the cheating me....</li>
            <li> I really do like this foil.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I got them so fast</li>
            <li> I was VERY please with my purchase...</li>
            <li> I really just wanted the gold and silver colors</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Of the 25 colors offered, I received mulitple rolls of the same  colors...and not even the pretty colors!!</li>
            <li> As do all the other colors that have more than one, so really</li>
            <li> My only complaint before I get into the great details is that with this foil when you put a top coat you have to use a fairly thin top coat.</li>
            <li> I want to know what kind of bonder or such the use with these bacause it certainly never worked as advertised or with the easiness I saw in the ad or instructions.</li>
            <li> But my only problem I had that I wish they would of done is have given me more colors not the same ones over I got like 5 red of the same 3 blues of the same wish it would of had more verity as stated on the description !</li>
            <li> The colors were mostly gold and silver with a few reds, greens, blues and pinks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews</li>
            <li> Sadly, one of the foils was damage, but the rest of them are very nice.</li>
            <li> I could not find the foil in any of the towns I live in</li>
            <li> I totally live it.</li>
            <li> Easier to apply to the nail if you first use acetone on a cotton ball and rub off copper colored layer on back side.</li>
            <li> the other brand hand many blah colors: white, cream ...</li>
            <li> I have 6 of the same exact gold.</li>
            <li> why do I need 4 golds of the same exact pattern?</li>
            <li> Most of my foil are just plain!</li>
            <li> I got more then half of the same color</li>
            <li> and as far i can tell i did not receive any duplicates.</li>
            <li> One of them came used but rest of them very goodtotally different colorse</li>
            <li> And well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Just how many rolls of Christmas green, red and gold does one person need?</li>
            <li> Out of 25 pieces, there might be two I would actually use and due to the pattern on them, most likely only on certain holidays.</li>
            <li> I received less of the solid color non hollographic foils which is fine by me.  </li>
            <li> .I should have read all the reviews, I wanted to take a chance in buying them and it was a bad one I don&#x27;t recommend , Dollornail.com have $1 ones beautiful too</li>
            <li> Other than that this stuff is so pretty.</li>
            <li> wow, thousands of different ways to makeup</li>
            <li> I just use a thin layer of top coat</li>
            <li> Looked messy and had to remove it right away</li>
            <li> but I will say that a few of the colors were identical and I was surprised that there wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of foil in each jar.  </li>
            <li> In place of the missing colors were 5 solid colors ( black, silver, purple, light blue, and copper.</li>
            <li> Most of the designs looked new, but one or two was in bad shape.  </li>
            <li> This is enough to last a very long time!</li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected, however the colors where basically all the same.</li>
            <li> They did not take long to get to me..</li>
            <li> Double width of other brands at a reduced cost.</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to receive the product</li>
            <li> A few are the same colors but different designs.</li>
            <li> Every single one was scratched and creased.</li>
            <li> Several plain, patternless red.</li>
            <li> When I first got the nail foil I was confused on how to use it because it wasn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> I ended up with 2 of each color that I receive which means I actually only got half of the colors of each the  items promised.</li>
            <li> what so ever.. 3 reds and about 5 that are half red.</li>
            <li> the rest was okay so not to bad  </li>
            <li> The package was delivered when I expected.</li>
            <li> Ill give it 2 stars for the ones they got right</li>
            <li> Some very small strips or completely damaged.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, you do not get all the colors pictured here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they work just like all other foils i&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to do an entire nail usually.</li>
            <li> No exciting colors at all</li>
            <li> its always fun to have some crazy patterns.</li>
            <li> and they went in the dark and just grab whatever they could find and threw it in a plastic bag</li>
            <li> Not worth spending your money on.</li>
            <li> So basically I received about half the colors that were shown and substitutes for the other half.</li>
            <li> Not flawless transfer, but I am getting new glue, so hopefully that&#x27;ll help them out</li>
            <li> They come in little tubes.</li>
            <li> mine was missing number 02, 05, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 17, 22, 25</li>
            <li> I hope this helps the ones that say it doesn&#x27;t transfer or are having trouble with it.</li>
            <li> I just dap it in a few places on the nail</li>
            <li> Green x4 time.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I ordered this batch of nail foils is because I wanted the multicolored ones that are missing.</li>
            <li> They are each a few feet of tinsil rolled up.</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH... there were a few butterfly and flower replacement rolls.</li>
            <li> IT HAS SUCH LITTLE FOIL IN THE CONTAINERS!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 green and empty broken bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little leery ordering transfer foils again because from what I have read, it&#x27;s common not to get what is pictured.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately ... Thy send me blue x3 time.....</li>
            <li> I AM SO NOT SATISFIED WITH PRODUCT</li>
            <li> the product is not very good.</li>
            <li> I just got mine in the mail today and was so excited to see it, but I was so disappointed!</li>
            <li> cant go wrong with pink.</li>
            <li> It comes of unevenly and looks sloppy and unkempt on your nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good in writing reviews But just wanna leave my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with what I received when I went back to my order, I received the majority of what is pictured for the product.</li>
            <li> Sadly what had arrived was a lot of duplicates and very few that weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Some of the containers were broken, the items were poorly packaged.  </li>
            <li> Overall very  disappointed with my my purchase</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews on these foils, I must admit that I was wary.</li>
            <li> I was so mad and frustrated</li>
            <li> Very dull, very boring.  </li>
            <li> And the bad thing is some of those numbers is why I chose this foil over others listed for sale.</li>
            <li> So I want to start by saying a never leave reviews that are bad for any product, and I do a lot of shopping on Amazon, but I had to leave a review for this product.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t too bad).</li>
            <li> how bad is that?</li>
            <li> Sorry but horrible</li>
            <li> These foils work but take over an hour to apply:(.</li>
            <li> They were packaged stupid.</li>
            <li> very disappointed it seems like they were put away in a closet or in a dungeon</li>
            <li> Worst foil purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li> This is by farâ€‹ the worst product I have ever ordered.  </li>
            <li> Received with the worst condition.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome colors and works great</li>
            <li> Four stars because one design was repeated so three of the bottles were the same. Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but will update review when I do.</li>
            <li> Received great selection.  Works quite well.  Very pleased.  Absolutely would order again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the multiple color variations. it said 25 different colors and even had them listed by number.&lt;br /&gt;Well mine was missing number 02, 05, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 17, 22, 25&lt;br /&gt;i got 2 teal which were not listed and 2 browns that were not listed, as well as two off color oranges they didn&#x27;t match but were so similar i could barley tell them apart.&lt;br /&gt; And the bad thing is some of those numbers is why I chose this foil over others listed for sale. Some of the colors they replaced the missed ones with are nice but product is overall not what was advertised and no where in the add did it say i might not get the exact colors listed, not did it say i would get duplicates of colors. Ill give it 2 stars for the ones they got right but i am over all dissatisfied</li>
            <li> I purchased foils from a craft store. A couple of sheets for more than the price of ALL of these. Love the selection, love the ease of use. I recommend this item</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with what I received when I went back to my order, I received the majority of what is pictured for the product. I viewed so many transfer foil products that I ordered from the wrong one, so that was on me and why I am giving it 3 stars. My order contained 3 ombre, lots of patterns, and 1 solid bronze. The colors were mostly gold and silver with a few reds, greens, blues and pinks. No exciting colors at all and I was hoping for a teal and more solid colors and I only got one. I&#x27;m a little leery ordering transfer foils again because from what I have read, it&#x27;s common not to get what is pictured.</li>
            <li> Shipment came on time.  Good quality. seemed to have all color options shown.  Easier to apply to the nail if you first use acetone on a cotton ball and rub off copper colored layer on back side.</li>
            <li> These are very very cheap foils that lost their glamor even before you apply them to your nails. Most of them don&#x27;t transfer completely and aren&#x27;t that good. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone at all.</li>
            <li> Did not get all the colors shown, got a couple that weren&#x27;t showed, and duplicates of some. A couple rolls were messed up.</li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected, however the colors where basically all the same. And one of my bottles didn&#x27;t have a lid on it?? I tried the foils and they don&#x27;t work as well as the more expensive foils but they still do work.</li>
            <li> This product has met all of my expectations.  I am using this product for jewelry making.  It holds up well to glazing.  This product really enhances my designs.</li>
            <li> I like all the variety I rec&#x27;d with 25 different colors/textures.</li>
            <li> its not working for me</li>
            <li> The foils are great &amp; received multiple colors.</li>
            <li> These are all of the ones I received. Absolutely LOVE them!! None  of them are repeated and are all really cool patterns!  And it&#x27;s a GREAT deal!!!The way I use mine is when I do my nails with a UV light. After i&#x27;ve cured my 2nd coat of color I stick the foil to it and it transfers PERFECTLY (as the polish is still sticky). I then put the top coat on it, cure it, and done! I hope this helps the ones that say it doesn&#x27;t transfer or are having trouble with it. They are so much fun once you get the hang of it!</li>
            <li> When I first got the nail foil I was confused on how to use it because it wasn&#x27;t like I had seen in tutorials. When you place this on your nail do it color/pattern upside! I used this for the first time the other night and my nails turned out awesome! I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of complements on this nail design. Facebook: Finesse Illusions nail fan page. THIS IS NOT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Great product for nail art</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, you do not get all the colors pictured here. I got all of the reds and golds and silvers, and then some, but did not receive any of the pretty blues that I was hoping for.  I knew that would probably happen going into this purchase though.  I just wish it had more of a variety, but for the price, and the fact it was on prime, I&#x27;m still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they work just like all other foils i&#x27;ve had.  Not flawless transfer, but I am getting new glue, so hopefully that&#x27;ll help them out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE DO NOT COME WITH GLUE.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of it. I haven&#x27;t been able to use it well because the adhesive I bought didn&#x27;t work well. The product shipped well.</li>
            <li> ummmm all i can say is YES. NOW I CAN DO REALLY OUT OF THIS WORLD NAIL ART. its always fun to have some crazy patterns. for the most part these are solid colors, a handful of them are suuuper psychedelic though...and as far i can tell i did not receive any duplicates.</li>
            <li> I waited for almost two months to get this and it was not what the picture shows.  Some of the containers were broken, the items were poorly packaged.  The foils were not the same as the picture.  I was so mad and frustrated I just threw them in the garbage.  I should have returned them and asked for a refund.  I will never ever purchase from this seller ever again!!!!</li>
            <li> I received these in the mail yesterday and immediately opened them, the variety was great, I&#x27;ve already tried one of the pink ones, looks great and was easy to use, I used it over the cnd shellac with no adhesive required.</li>
            <li> My only complaint before I get into the great details is that with this foil when you put a top coat you have to use a fairly thin top coat. It will start dissolving the color of the foil pretty fast unless you drip it and spread it fast. Other than that this stuff is so pretty. I love using foil on my nails for staining. I don&#x27;t like to do an entire nail usually. I received all the colors listed and when I got it home that night I done both my grandma&#x27;s and my nails. This is a great deal! I don&#x27;t use glue for it I just use a thin layer of top coat let it get sticky and apply. I just dap it in a few places on the nail and it&#x27;s perfect for my taste.</li>
            <li> Most of the foil designs were exactly the same just different colors but the overall package was a good deal. The package was delivered when I expected. Just would like to see more variety in design selections not in color.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because nail foils are so beautiful to me! BUT I tried to apply them with Scrap Perfect&#x27;s Best Glue Ever and it didn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t think this is because of the foil; I think it&#x27;s me! Once I figure out how to do it, I&#x27;m sure I will love it.</li>
            <li> It is not like it shows on the picture you will get a lot of metalic only one print</li>
            <li> Was excited when I ordered this product but most of then are the same color not at all like the picture wears off even with top coat</li>
            <li> Pleased with the product quality and selection.  Came with free nail guides.  You get exactly what they show, containers and all</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my colorful foils assortment. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, waiting for my glue to arrive. I was impressed by the amount of foil in each tube. Fabulous!</li>
            <li> So I want to start by saying a never leave reviews that are bad for any product, and I do a lot of shopping on Amazon, but I had to leave a review for this product. I will start out by saying they came much more quicker than I expected which is good and I like the price, but that is all I can say god about this product. The colors I received where not the colors they show in the picture I did not received all the colors that where promised. I ended up with 2 of each color that I receive which means I actually only got half of the colors of each the  items promised. I will never order from this company again..</li>
            <li> I would recommend this purchase, but don&#x27;t forget to order some foil glue as well, or else you&#x27;ll be waiting another month for that!</li>
            <li> Great purchase.. And well worth the money spent. Thanks</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors wow, thousands of different ways to makeup&lt;br /&gt;my nails is very easy to use if you find the correct glue</li>
            <li> One of them came used but rest of them very goodtotally different colorse and of them was used. Wost puschase. Sorry but horrible</li>
            <li> All but 1 color came. Still had the right number. No duplicates and you can not beat the price!!!! At sally&#x27;s 2 rolls of foil will cost about the same</li>
            <li> It was everything I had hoped for.  I could not find the foil in any of the towns I live in so I knew I could rely on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I loved this set it came quickly and I received the number of pieces listed.  A few of mine were different than the listed but there were no duplicates and the ones I received were beautiful.  I received one or two of the multicolor foils which i love because you can get great color combos on the nails. I received less of the solid color non hollographic foils which is fine by me.  I purchased another set of 24 colors from bm and I like the assortment in these much better. the other brand hand many blah colors: white, cream ... need I say more! If getting specific colors is imperative for you- there are websites where you pick each foil individually... they are 1.00 us a piece but the shipping starts at 6.95!</li>
            <li> Again nice variety, but no instructions.  Not all foils transfer to gel polish.</li>
            <li> They are okay. Didn&#x27;t come with glue or any kind of directions. Tons of colors and patterns. Every single one was scratched and creased. They were packaged stupid. They come in little tubes. They were folded into the tube instead of rolled. The folding caused creases that I don&#x27;t think will every come out.</li>
            <li> These foils work but take over an hour to apply:(. You do not get all the cooler sand patterned listed in the pic... Overall very  disappointed with my my purchase</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy these nail foils because it seemed like a better deal than my beauty store. Sadly what had arrived was a lot of duplicates and very few that weren&#x27;t. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> They did not sent all the color like it look in the pitcher .. Unfortunately ... Thy send me blue x3 time..... Green x4 time.  And every color x2 time... I&#x27;m very upset I fell the cheating me.... Don&#x27;t west your money on this item !!!!!</li>
            <li> I want to know what kind of bonder or such the use with these bacause it certainly never worked as advertised or with the easiness I saw in the ad or instructions. Ieven took it to a couple of nail salons and they were mystified as to how to make it work.</li>
            <li> These are some very nice and funky colors!  I really do like this foil.  I&#x27;d never worked with foil before so it took a bit of practice.  Overall I am happy with this purchase but I will say that a few of the colors were identical and I was surprised that there wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of foil in each jar.  But, there is enough to do a countless number of different things to your nails and the variety is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I would consider these to be more of a sampler of different designs.  BUT, for $10?  I feel it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I demand a refund. The majority of the foils were repeated. I have 6 of the same exact gold. Several plain, patternless red. Very dull, very boring.  Out of 25 pieces, there might be two I would actually use and due to the pattern on them, most likely only on certain holidays. Worst foil purchase I have ever made. I have a total of only 5 different foils, out of 25. The rest are all the same color and patterns. Upon further inspection, most of the foils were not even packed correctly and had rubbed off on themselves. Also, they were not cut cleanly had torn and ratty ends and damaged edges. This is by farâ€‹ the worst product I have ever ordered.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money on these. I will NOT order from EverMarket again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the different designs that I have received ,Very many different designs Thank you again It worksgreat</li>
            <li> Lots of colors and patterns in this package, a great selection and generous amounts included in each.  Would definitely by this again!</li>
            <li> These do not work at all. I purchased the special adhesive for foils and it still won&#x27;t stick to my nail. It comes of unevenly and looks sloppy and unkempt on your nail. I would never purchase again.</li>
            <li> very disappointed it seems like they were put away in a closet or in a dungeon and they went in the dark and just grab whatever they could find and threw it in a plastic bag, I didn&#x27;t receive any of the colors displayed on the picture I got 9 of the silver and 9 gold&lt;br /&gt;2 green and empty broken bottles. .I should have read all the reviews, I wanted to take a chance in buying them and it was a bad one I don&#x27;t recommend , Dollornail.com have $1 ones beautiful too just order my bunch way better then this ...</li>
            <li> It was okay.  Most of the designs looked new, but one or two was in bad shape.  Will be able to share more after I use it.</li>
            <li> Received with the worst condition. Cannot use them. Threw in the garbage.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews on these foils, I must admit that I was wary. Fortunately, they arrived on time and in almost perfect condition (one of the foils looked like they were kinda jammed in their container causing some krinkling but it wasn&#x27;t too bad). I received all of the colors promised with no duplicating. For those of you who are new to this nail art form, you should purchase &amp;#34;Scraperfect Best Glue Ever 2 Oz.&amp;#34; from amazon too as an adhesive because it works well with these. I would purchase this product again from the same company.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I spoke with company about the condition of container. Some of the containers were crack but did not effect the product</li>
            <li> Some of my containers were cracked but otherwise the colours were great. should recommend brands of top coat to use with the foils because I applied it but it all ran and smudge when I applied a top coat. Looked messy and had to remove it right away</li>
            <li> I give 5stars because of the variety of colors but it haven&#x27;t been able to use any of it because I did not know I had to purchase a special type of foil glue so that the foil could stick to my nails.ðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> I will definitely use all of these but many of the colors were repeated.  Of the 25 colors there were only 18 different colors/patterns.</li>
            <li> A ton of colors to make clear jel quick and easy</li>
            <li> colors fade when topcoat is applied</li>
            <li> These foils are very nice and it&#x27;s such a great variety for a low price.  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great buy for as many different containers of foil. Fast shipping. Grade AAA.</li>
            <li> I received colors 1-5,7,9,10,12,15,20,24, and 25 as pictured. Colors 13,21,and 22 were somewhat close to the colors and designs. I did not receive colors 6,8,11,14,16,17,18,19, and 23.  In place of the missing colors were 5 solid colors ( black, silver, purple, light blue, and copper. I received 4 additional colors that are patterned and okay (3 red and 1 gold ) . So basically I received about half the colors that were shown and substitutes for the other half. The foils were all in good shape when they arrived.  One of the reasons I ordered this batch of nail foils is because I wanted the multicolored ones that are missing. I will not order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Just opened the box and sorted the colors....why do I need 4 golds of the same exact pattern? 8 golds in total....irritated that I didn&#x27;t get the variety as stated but I should of figured based off of the reviews. Gold accent nails for everyone this summer! LOL</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to receive the product but I love them! The colors are great and it&#x27;s an easy up sale at the salon!</li>
            <li> still trying to figure out how to make the foil stick.  I might need a better glue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good in writing reviews But just wanna leave my opinion. I got them so fast n it was packed nicely. Just wanna say thanks for ur cooperation nice teamwork AmazonðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> Item as described and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get</li>
            <li> I love these! They are each a few feet of tinsil rolled up. You should buy the glue though before you get this because you will need it to get it to transfer onto your nail. A few are the same colors but different designs. This is enough to last a very long time!</li>
            <li> These have worked great and I love the look on my nails.  The value is fabulous, and the different colors are fun</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but I saw some saying they had to many repeat colors. I was VERY please with my purchase... I really just wanted the gold and silver colors so I was glad there seemed to be more of them.&lt;br /&gt;At first glance it looks like I have 11gold and silver combined but every one of them has a different pattern... As do all the other colors that have more than one, so really..... I did get 25 different types of foils. Id definitely order again and recommend these to friends! If there was anything I could say I would think it would be cool to of had a purple color... But even without it, I&#x27;m way stoked!!</li>
            <li> It took almost 1 month to arrive but I am pleased with what I received.  Lots of colors and different patterns.  My problem now is deciding what to use first.</li>
            <li> they wont transfer.. i even tried a different glue and still nothing</li>
            <li> its alright. some ugggggllllyyy ones but mostly nice ones in the bunch though. alot of nice pinks. cant go wrong with pink. I would buy again. so yeah. I thought this was a pretty good buy</li>
            <li> This item was pretty good thank you. I&#x27;m waiting for my replacement order. Can&#x27;t wait to get some prettier colors so that I as a nail technician could make my customers more happy with my products</li>
            <li> I wonder if this is a joke or something! I just got mine in the mail today and was so excited to see it, but I was so disappointed! I didn&#x27;t get the colors shown in the picture. Most of my foil are just plain!</li>
            <li> Good to have then for any kind of nail art. I totally live it. You can use different thing for decorations and stuff</li>
            <li> Not worth spending your money on. Of the 25 colors offered, I received mulitple rolls of the same  colors...and not even the pretty colors!! Just how many rolls of Christmas green, red and gold does one person need?</li>
            <li> They did not take long to get to me.. But my only problem I had that I wish they would of done is have given me more colors not the same ones over I got like 5 red of the same 3 blues of the same wish it would of had more verity as stated on the description !</li>
            <li> COLORS ARE NOT AS SHOWN! no lavender or purple what so ever.. 3 reds and about 5 that are half red. if you like red then this is for you. how bad is that? some are crinkled up!!! ALTHOUGH... there were a few butterfly and flower replacement rolls. too many duplicates, though... delivery.. no comment.. *sigh</li>
            <li> Nice product but not enough product and too many of the same designs and colors. I will like to have more colors.</li>
            <li> What a bargain! I received loads of various nail foils in this set with no repeats. They apply great and are stunning from holographic to shiny metallic to opalescent pearls. Double width of other brands at a reduced cost. I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> the product is not very good. Some very small strips or completely damaged.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t transfer. I am never buying this foil ever.</li>
            <li> I like the foils I will use them all. What I don&#x27;t like is that I did not receive the colors listed. I read that was a problem in a number of reviews. But I ordered any way and my experience was the same. in the future I&#x27;ll go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Regardless of what you do, it won&#x27;t transfer!! Wont ever buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got more then half of the same color</li>
            <li> They were okay, 2 of them were all scratched but the rest was okay so not to bad  I guess</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the colors.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Sadly, one of the foils was damage, but the rest of them are very nice.</li>
            <li> very nice, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I AM SO NOT SATISFIED WITH PRODUCT IT HAS SUCH LITTLE FOIL IN THE CONTAINERS!!!! ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž</li>
