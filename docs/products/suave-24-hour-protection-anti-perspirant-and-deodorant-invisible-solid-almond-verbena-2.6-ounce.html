    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful formula.</li>
            <li>Best of all, since Suave makes a variety of products, I can match the shampoo and deodorant</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know who came up with the idea of mixing almond and verbena, but the resulting scent is delightful.  </li>
            <li>best test this time of year is when I take the dogs out for a walk.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed!</li>
            <li>all in all a very good product.</li>
            <li>Suave made me realize I don&#x27;t need to spend a lot for great protection.</li>
            <li>The odor protection is great, though.</li>
            <li>I liked the scent of this deodorant just about the best of any deodorant I&#x27;ve ever smelled!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Suave deodorants off and on for years and have always been extremely happy with them.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that I noticed no difference between this and the name brand deodorant</li>
            <li>This Suave 24-hour protection is a great every-day anti-perspirant deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Great protection.  </li>
            <li>but if you prefer something non-floral or powdery but still feminine it&#x27;s a great one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy to have found this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I think this product is very nice.</li>
            <li>The scent is a very nice smell.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like an almond or lemon verbena, the scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>loved the scent.</li>
            <li>This smells really good.</li>
            <li>I found it effective, affordable and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>The texture is actually amazing: silken-smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I really liked this anti-perspirant and deodorant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an effective deodorant.  </li>
            <li>The scent stayed nice throughout the day.</li>
            <li>And the aroma is quite nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a person who is prone to &#x27;smell&#x27;, however I sweat effectively and freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful, I really like it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, pleasant scent that is light, not over-powering.</li>
            <li>This has a really nice almond scent that is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It goes on very easily without pulling at the skin.</li>
            <li>I still love Suave though; my go-to deodorant happens to be their clinical strength, light and fresh scent -- great product!</li>
            <li>The deodorant glides smoothly and smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>Although the scent is described as almond verbena, it smells more like coconut to me.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they make unscented versions, though, and I will be seeking them out to try.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I usually love Suave</li>
            <li>because I tried this once more after running out of my go-to deodorant</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, an excellent product and one that I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>It is a rich lucious kind of scent.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love with 24 hour protection and a new great scent?</li>
            <li>To me, it smells like more of a light tropical scent.</li>
            <li>The really good thing about this deodorant is that the fragrance is absolutely divine.</li>
            <li>It protects all day and has a nice, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It blends easily with perfumes or lotions.</li>
            <li>It slides on easily and didn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li>I like this scent, which is feminine but not floral, although it is a touch strong.  </li>
            <li>It smells like cookies but not with a strong vanilla note.</li>
            <li>felt like the odor and wetness protection was fine.</li>
            <li>The sauve 24 hour protection slid on smoothly, didn&#x27;t shave even though I applied it fresh out of the shower on newly shaved armpits, and smells great.</li>
            <li>The product applies smoothly and did not mark or stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>The deodorant itself works well and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Just light and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fond of this deodorant, having used several scent variations in the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as effective on mowing the lawn days, or exercising outdoors days, for me, but it&#x27;s fine for &#x27;normal&#x27; activity days.</li>
            <li>If that sort of scent is an issue to someone, then as pleasing as this deodorant is to use and as effective as it is, I&#x27;d recommend against getting this particular variety of Suave 24 Hour.</li>
            <li>Yes, I think this whole new Almond Verbana thing is a great trend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This anti-perspirant deodorant goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks, and has a pleasant but mild scent.  </li>
            <li>This particular scent is wonderful, very clean with just enough extra to make it interesting.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re offered at a virtually unbeatable price and some leave you feeling like you got what you paid for while others are a true bargain.</li>
            <li>It has the richness of almond, but it&#x27;s not too sweet, tempered by the verbena.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit sweet for my taste.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad deodorant just overpriced for suave.</li>
            <li>This scent doesn&#x27;t give me a fresh, clean feeling when wearing it</li>
            <li>though the smell was mild and one that could be used by men or women.  </li>
            <li>It is a slight pleasant floral almond smell that isn&#x27;t too strong for me.</li>
            <li>also love the new Almond Verbena scent.  </li>
            <li>It kept me dry and smelling good all day.  </li>
            <li>It also claims \\&quot;extra effective</li>
            <li>Everything that I have tried is some version of fresh, powder, or floral.</li>
            <li>This was as effective as the clinical version of this same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the real reason to love this product is that it keeps odor and wetness at bay, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant because I was pleasantly surprised at how effective it was as an anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li>It went on relatively dry and worked effectively, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with this new discovery.</li>
            <li>Sweetly scented, this antiperspirant provides decent all day protection.</li>
            <li>It smooths on nicely, and does what anti-perspirant and deodorant is supposed to do---it kept me dry and odor-free!  </li>
            <li>part I liked best is that this formula did the job while invisible without leaving my skin red and irritated or dried out as other formulas have.</li>
            <li>First, one of the biggest differences between deodorants is the scent.  </li>
            <li>(It definitely smells more of almond than verbena.)  </li>
            <li>It did achieve its twenty-four hour claim, although I wouldn&#x27;t be willing to push it on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably more of a feminine scent than masculine, but light enough for any gender.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At this point anyone who reads my reviews might wonder if I have some sort of medical problem since I try so many, but no, unless living in the south is a medical issue:)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s hot, it&#x27;s humid, the water glasses sweat, the dog lolls out her tongue and pants, and pits are.</li>
            <li>top white plastic cover that you remove when you first use</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t feel like the scent is exactly my type, and will probably stick with Suave&#x27;s Baby Powder Scent.</li>
            <li>Which is pretty amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I wouldn&#x27;t quite call it 24 hour protection it gets pretty close.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like the smell you get on your skin after visiting a tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>As with all Suave products, this is priced right and really works well.  </li>
            <li>They go on smooth, have a nice offering of fragrances, and offer all day protection at a price that is hard to beat.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong but not terrible - it may be a dealbreaker to some, though, since it doesn&#x27;t have that low key smell I would expect from Almond or verbena.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant that I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li>I should certainly hope so, because that is nothing to brag about.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t realized that Suave, which I usually associate with hair products, was branching out into the deodorant business until now, and I was somewhat unsure of whether they would be successful with this new endeavor.  </li>
            <li>Most products like this do that, so in my case anyway, it mostly comes down to the scent and the feel, and this one was terrific.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant worked really well.</li>
            <li>I really like the Almond scent.</li>
            <li>I would expect any deodorant to provide that except after an intense workout.  </li>
            <li>It works well and doesn&#x27;t cost much either.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent.</li>
            <li>This is really different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it works very well.</li>
            <li>And it handled my &#x27;manly&#x27; perspiration very well and lasted as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We either go for a mile or so, or else a shorter distance at a fast pace.  </li>
            <li>My husband, a hardworking man, says he really likes how well it works for him as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t really comment about the &amp;#34;24 hrs&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I do find it funny that things like iPhones and Kindles exist, and we still can&#x27;t get a deodorant/antiperspirant that WON&#x27;T leave white marks on clothes.</li>
            <li>I especially  like the way the complete bottom of the container rotates, dispensing the deodorant easily and evenly.</li>
            <li>It applies really smooth and gives me protection all day long.</li>
            <li>I can smell almonds and a lovely slightly floral scent that I assume is the verbena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries up quickly so I don’t have to worry about white residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>Suave products usually work great for me, and this 24-hour Anti Perspirant is no different than the other great Suave Products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>and one I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this is a moderately priced deodorant that might be fine for someone who is not very active, I won&#x27;t get choosing it again.</li>
            <li>and I also feel like the formula isn&#x27;t as strong as some of their other deodorants (or) perhaps the scent itself just starts to smell a bit like old/stale gym clothes after awhile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried Suave products in a while, so was quite surprised by this product&#x27;s very high quality.</li>
            <li>But strangely I  find the scent of the 24 Hour Protection a little more potent and longer lasting that the Suave Almond Verbena Clinical Protection version.  </li>
            <li>When I have used this one for normal activities, including brisk walks, my underarms felt damper.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job keeping me dry while working hard.</li>
            <li>I like that the scent is available in other Suave products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are in the market for a new deodorant, try this one.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use some anti-perspirants, but this one gave me no irritation.</li>
            <li>I was interested in trying a truly different scent for deodorant.</li>
            <li>I thought almond verbena would be such a pretty scent</li>
            <li>With the myriad of deodorants out there, it won’t be hard to find something that works better for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the deodorant doesn&#x27;t go on and remain as clear as I would like, I have no complaints about its 24-hour efficacy.  </li>
            <li>suave&#x27;s 24 Hour Protection is actually clear as advertised.  </li>
            <li>You may be just as pleasantly surprised by it as I was.</li>
            <li>, rather I noticed a soft, fruity scent.  </li>
            <li>I found that it actually did give 24 hour protection for everyday normal use and light activities.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t smell as fresh as I did with other deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My armpits remains clean and sufficiently dry all day long.</li>
            <li>Last year I tried a different Suave antiperspirant/deodorant product that I&#x27;ve since continued to buy because I loved how well it worked without being irritating to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But I&#x27;m used to unscented products, and this smelled so strongly of almond candy/cookies that it was hard to smell anything else even hours after applying it.</li>
            <li>I should also point out that it is currently winter where I live and have been dealing with temperatures in the low twenties.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a higher percentage, 20%, of active ingredient than another regular-strength deodorant I have, and the same percentage as a clinical strength one.  </li>
            <li>It keeps me dry during normal daily activities, and sweat-free during my less intense exercise workouts.  </li>

            <li> Everything that I have tried is some version of fresh, powder, or floral.</li>
            <li> This was as effective as the clinical version of this same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the real reason to love this product is that it keeps odor and wetness at bay, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant because I was pleasantly surprised at how effective it was as an anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li> It went on relatively dry and worked effectively, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with this new discovery.</li>
            <li> Sweetly scented, this antiperspirant provides decent all day protection.</li>
            <li> It smooths on nicely, and does what anti-perspirant and deodorant is supposed to do---it kept me dry and odor-free!  </li>
            <li> part I liked best is that this formula did the job while invisible without leaving my skin red and irritated or dried out as other formulas have.</li>
            <li> First, one of the biggest differences between deodorants is the scent.  </li>
            <li> (It definitely smells more of almond than verbena.)  </li>
            <li> It did achieve its twenty-four hour claim, although I wouldn&#x27;t be willing to push it on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably more of a feminine scent than masculine, but light enough for any gender.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this point anyone who reads my reviews might wonder if I have some sort of medical problem since I try so many, but no, unless living in the south is a medical issue:)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hot, it&#x27;s humid, the water glasses sweat, the dog lolls out her tongue and pants, and pits are.</li>
            <li> top white plastic cover that you remove when you first use</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t feel like the scent is exactly my type, and will probably stick with Suave&#x27;s Baby Powder Scent.</li>
            <li> Which is pretty amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I wouldn&#x27;t quite call it 24 hour protection it gets pretty close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly like the smell you get on your skin after visiting a tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> As with all Suave products, this is priced right and really works well.  </li>
            <li> They go on smooth, have a nice offering of fragrances, and offer all day protection at a price that is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong but not terrible - it may be a dealbreaker to some, though, since it doesn&#x27;t have that low key smell I would expect from Almond or verbena.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant that I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li> I should certainly hope so, because that is nothing to brag about.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized that Suave, which I usually associate with hair products, was branching out into the deodorant business until now, and I was somewhat unsure of whether they would be successful with this new endeavor.  </li>
            <li> Most products like this do that, so in my case anyway, it mostly comes down to the scent and the feel, and this one was terrific.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant worked really well.</li>
            <li> I really like the Almond scent.</li>
            <li> I would expect any deodorant to provide that except after an intense workout.  </li>
            <li> It works well and doesn&#x27;t cost much either.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent.</li>
            <li> This is really different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it works very well.</li>
            <li> And it handled my &#x27;manly&#x27; perspiration very well and lasted as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We either go for a mile or so, or else a shorter distance at a fast pace.  </li>
            <li> My husband, a hardworking man, says he really likes how well it works for him as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t really comment about the &amp;#34;24 hrs&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I do find it funny that things like iPhones and Kindles exist, and we still can&#x27;t get a deodorant/antiperspirant that WON&#x27;T leave white marks on clothes.</li>
            <li> I especially  like the way the complete bottom of the container rotates, dispensing the deodorant easily and evenly.</li>
            <li> It applies really smooth and gives me protection all day long.</li>
            <li> I can smell almonds and a lovely slightly floral scent that I assume is the verbena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries up quickly so I don’t have to worry about white residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> Suave products usually work great for me, and this 24-hour Anti Perspirant is no different than the other great Suave Products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> and one I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this is a moderately priced deodorant that might be fine for someone who is not very active, I won&#x27;t get choosing it again.</li>
            <li> and I also feel like the formula isn&#x27;t as strong as some of their other deodorants (or) perhaps the scent itself just starts to smell a bit like old/stale gym clothes after awhile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried Suave products in a while, so was quite surprised by this product&#x27;s very high quality.</li>
            <li> But strangely I  find the scent of the 24 Hour Protection a little more potent and longer lasting that the Suave Almond Verbena Clinical Protection version.  </li>
            <li> When I have used this one for normal activities, including brisk walks, my underarms felt damper.  </li>
            <li> It did a great job keeping me dry while working hard.</li>
            <li> I like that the scent is available in other Suave products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are in the market for a new deodorant, try this one.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use some anti-perspirants, but this one gave me no irritation.</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying a truly different scent for deodorant.</li>
            <li> I thought almond verbena would be such a pretty scent</li>
            <li> With the myriad of deodorants out there, it won’t be hard to find something that works better for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the deodorant doesn&#x27;t go on and remain as clear as I would like, I have no complaints about its 24-hour efficacy.  </li>
            <li> suave&#x27;s 24 Hour Protection is actually clear as advertised.  </li>
            <li> You may be just as pleasantly surprised by it as I was.</li>
            <li> , rather I noticed a soft, fruity scent.  </li>
            <li> I found that it actually did give 24 hour protection for everyday normal use and light activities.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t smell as fresh as I did with other deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My armpits remains clean and sufficiently dry all day long.</li>
            <li> Last year I tried a different Suave antiperspirant/deodorant product that I&#x27;ve since continued to buy because I loved how well it worked without being irritating to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But I&#x27;m used to unscented products, and this smelled so strongly of almond candy/cookies that it was hard to smell anything else even hours after applying it.</li>
            <li> I should also point out that it is currently winter where I live and have been dealing with temperatures in the low twenties.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a higher percentage, 20%, of active ingredient than another regular-strength deodorant I have, and the same percentage as a clinical strength one.  </li>
            <li> It keeps me dry during normal daily activities, and sweat-free during my less intense exercise workouts.  </li>
            <li> The deodorant keeps me dry and clean-smelling all day and there is no white residue on my clothes after I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin is a little bit sensitive</li>
            <li> It goes on clear, no stains on my black clothes, and keeps me dry and smell-free.  </li>
            <li> I tend to be a little bit suspicious of so called &#x27;clear&#x27; deodorants as they almost always end up leaving &#x27;not clear&#x27; marks on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s listed as an invisible solid, but I did get those white streaks on my black shirt when putting it</li>
            <li> It is different than any other deodorant.</li>
            <li> It protected me for the day and kept my underarms dry and smelling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> underarms stayed dry and the suave didn&#x27;t rub off or stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> my delight-- was that my underarms were dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> However, the active ingredient itself is different.  </li>
            <li> It is a lush fragrance but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> But the ani-perspirant didn’t do as well as the Clinical Protection version under extreme mental and emotional conditions.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this product wasn&#x27;t bad, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Suave is the only deodorant I have found that does a decent job of keeping me dry, other then my very expensive Elizabeth Arden deodorant, which I don&#x27;t like to wear when I am only going outside to garden or feed the animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I like this smell or not yet.  </li>
            <li> normally use Dove or Secret anti-perspirant and deodorant.</li>
            <li> In the case of the other two, it is something called aluminum zirconium tetrachlorhydrex.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to protect against odor and wetness as well as any other aluminum-based deodorant and for way longer than I&#x27;m used to a deodorant working.</li>
            <li> ; claim as I usually shower every day, but overall, this one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised, as I don&#x27;t usually buy Suave products, but I think I will, after this!</li>
            <li> If I have an even slightly active day, I will feel a slight bit of wetness under my arms.</li>
            <li> Down here we sweat, a lot</li>
            <li> I was using previously.  </li>
            <li> Even when I wore black there was no residue on me or my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is too tight.</li>
            <li> It seems to work as well as any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Just a little to overpowering on fragrance; it may compete if you are wearing perfume.  </li>
            <li> I was a little iffy on Almond Verbena as a scent</li>
            <li> I have not put this to the test doing heavy workouts.</li>
            <li> With the Clinical Protection you just get a hint of almond tones, with the 24-Hour Protection you smell like a bakery for a few hours.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any white reside and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Not strong and over-powering either.</li>
            <li> I like the solid texture of it, it applies very evenly and doesn&#x27;t leave that wet disgusting feel of a gel.</li>
            <li> I am usually picky when it comes to deodorant and have used Dove products for years</li>
            <li> wore this deodorant while moving, so I still gave it a bit of a workout even though it was cold outside.  </li>
            <li> Not a foo-froo scent at all, it actually does have a tropical base to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not a big factor but still annoying.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t considered Suave, but I was wrong not to.</li>
            <li> It smelled of artificial almonds (something I was a little disappointed in), but I don&#x27;t know if it was the Verbena floral scent that was throwing it off the almond smell.</li>
            <li> but sadly, this one isn&#x27;t a winner for me :(  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The deodorant glides smoothly and smells really nice.  It dries up quickly so I don’t have to worry about white residue on my clothes.  It protected me for the day and kept my underarms dry and smelling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is a little bit sensitive so switching from another deodorant that contains Aluminum Zirconium Tertaclorohydrex to this deodorant with Aluminum Chlorohydrate caused a small sting for the first 3 times I used it.  Not a bad deodorant just overpriced for suave.</li>
            <li> Sweetly scented, this antiperspirant provides decent all day protection. Although the scent is described as almond verbena, it smells more like coconut to me. It is a lush fragrance but not overwhelming. I especially  like the way the complete bottom of the container rotates, dispensing the deodorant easily and evenly. The product applies smoothly and did not mark or stain my clothes. I found it effective, affordable and pleasant to use. Recommended.</li>
            <li> From my wife&#x27;s perspective:&lt;br /&gt;I normally use Dove or Secret anti-perspirant and deodorant. I hadn&#x27;t considered Suave, but I was wrong not to. This deodorant worked really well. I found that it actually did give 24 hour protection for everyday normal use and light activities. I have not put this to the test doing heavy workouts. I should also point out that it is currently winter where I live and have been dealing with temperatures in the low twenties. So at this point, I&#x27;m not sure how this will work in the hot summer heat. I really like the Almond scent. I did not find it be over powering. To me, it smells like more of a light tropical scent. It&#x27;s listed as an invisible solid, but I did get those white streaks on my black shirt when putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a new deodorant, try this one. You may be just as pleasantly surprised by it as I was.</li>
            <li> This anti-perspirant deodorant goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks, and has a pleasant but mild scent.  I like that the scent is available in other Suave products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a higher percentage, 20%, of active ingredient than another regular-strength deodorant I have, and the same percentage as a clinical strength one.  However, the active ingredient itself is different.  In the case of the other two, it is something called aluminum zirconium tetrachlorhydrex.  This Suave contains aluminum chlorhydrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no chemist, but I think this difference in ingredients affects the deodorant&#x27;s ability to do its job.  When I have used this one for normal activities, including brisk walks, my underarms felt damper.  At the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t smell as fresh as I did with other deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This claims \\&quot;24 hour protection.\\&quot;  I should certainly hope so, because that is nothing to brag about.  I would expect any deodorant to provide that except after an intense workout.  It also claims \\&quot;extra effective protection.\\&quot;  I didn&#x27;t find that to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is a moderately priced deodorant that might be fine for someone who is not very active, I won&#x27;t get choosing it again.</li>
            <li> I really liked this anti-perspirant and deodorant. It has a nice, pleasant scent that is light, not over-powering. It did a great job keeping me dry while working hard. Suave made me realize I don&#x27;t need to spend a lot for great protection.</li>
            <li> The really good thing about this deodorant is that the fragrance is absolutely divine. It seems to work as well as any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried in the past. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I do find it funny that things like iPhones and Kindles exist, and we still can&#x27;t get a deodorant/antiperspirant that WON&#x27;T leave white marks on clothes. The odor protection is great, though.</li>
            <li> I liked the scent of this deodorant just about the best of any deodorant I&#x27;ve ever smelled!  It was truly lovely---enough so I almost look forward to putting it on each day!  It smooths on nicely, and does what anti-perspirant and deodorant is supposed to do---it kept me dry and odor-free!  Most products like this do that, so in my case anyway, it mostly comes down to the scent and the feel, and this one was terrific.  I was a little surprised, as I don&#x27;t usually buy Suave products, but I think I will, after this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fond of this deodorant, having used several scent variations in the best.  Indeed, it&#x27;s a formula I keep returning to and one I highly recommend.  This particular scent is wonderful, very clean with just enough extra to make it interesting.  Yes, I think this whole new Almond Verbana thing is a great trend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the deodorant doesn&#x27;t go on and remain as clear as I would like, I have no complaints about its 24-hour efficacy.  I can, without hesitation, put this on in the morning and not have to worry the rest of the day--and this includes exercising.  My armpits remains clean and sufficiently dry all day long. Wonderful formula.</li>
            <li> Suave products can be hit or miss... they&#x27;re offered at a virtually unbeatable price and some leave you feeling like you got what you paid for while others are a true bargain. This deodorant is one of the latter. I&#x27;ve used Suave deodorants off and on for years and have always been extremely happy with them. They go on smooth, have a nice offering of fragrances, and offer all day protection at a price that is hard to beat. I have no complaints about this product!</li>
            <li> I think this product is very nice. It works well and doesn&#x27;t cost much either. I really like the scent.</li>
            <li> First, one of the biggest differences between deodorants is the scent.  I like this scent, which is feminine but not floral, although it is a touch strong.  (It definitely smells more of almond than verbena.)  Best of all, since Suave makes a variety of products, I can match the shampoo and deodorant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this deodorant while moving, so I still gave it a bit of a workout even though it was cold outside.  It did achieve its twenty-four hour claim, although I wouldn&#x27;t be willing to push it on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an effective deodorant.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything that I didn&#x27;t like about it.</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying a truly different scent for deodorant. Everything that I have tried is some version of fresh, powder, or floral. This is really different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like the odor and wetness protection was fine. I had no complaints. This was as effective as the clinical version of this same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the scent. It smells like cookies but not with a strong vanilla note. It is a rich lucious kind of scent. It is different than any other deodorant. The scent stayed nice throughout the day. It blends easily with perfumes or lotions. I love this one.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like an almond or lemon verbena, the scent is pleasant. Probably more of a feminine scent than masculine, but light enough for any gender.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t show on clothes, even black.&lt;br /&gt;But the real reason to love this product is that it keeps odor and wetness at bay, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know who came up with the idea of mixing almond and verbena, but the resulting scent is delightful.  It has the richness of almond, but it&#x27;s not too sweet, tempered by the verbena.  I want to smell like this all day.  Scent aside, this deodorant does the job.  It kept me dry and smelling good all day.  It slides on easily and didn&#x27;t irritate.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized that Suave, which I usually associate with hair products, was branching out into the deodorant business until now, and I was somewhat unsure of whether they would be successful with this new endeavor.  I am happy to report that I noticed no difference between this and the name brand deodorant I was using previously.  It protects all day and has a nice, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This Suave 24-hour protection is a great every-day anti-perspirant deodorant.  It keeps me dry during normal daily activities, and sweat-free during my less intense exercise workouts.  But the ani-perspirant didn’t do as well as the Clinical Protection version under extreme mental and emotional conditions.  When you are being grilled by irate co-workers/vendors/customers nothing matches the wetness protection of the Clinical Protection Stress brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the new Almond Verbena scent.  To me it smells like almond wedding cake, and who doesn’t like cake.  But strangely I  find the scent of the 24 Hour Protection a little more potent and longer lasting that the Suave Almond Verbena Clinical Protection version.  With the Clinical Protection you just get a hint of almond tones, with the 24-Hour Protection you smell like a bakery for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Seems I misread the description of this deodorant, for it is obvious that it imeant for women. As I am of the male gender, I decided I have the stuff, why not try it? To my surprise, it works very well. And the aroma is quite nice. Not a foo-froo scent at all, it actually does have a tropical base to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use some anti-perspirants, but this one gave me no irritation. I like the solid texture of it, it applies very evenly and doesn&#x27;t leave that wet disgusting feel of a gel. And it handled my &#x27;manly&#x27; perspiration very well and lasted as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was serendipity that I tried it, but it is now my anti-perspirant of choice.</li>
            <li> As with all Suave products, this is priced right and really works well.  It goes on clear, no stains on my black clothes, and keeps me dry and smell-free.  The scent is strong but not terrible - it may be a dealbreaker to some, though, since it doesn&#x27;t have that low key smell I would expect from Almond or verbena.</li>
            <li> The scent of baby powder has been my choice scent for deodorant for years; that just changed. This has a really nice almond scent that is light and pleasant. The deodorant itself works well and goes on smoothly. What&#x27;s not to love with 24 hour protection and a new great scent? Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Yes, here I am talking about deodorant again. At this point anyone who reads my reviews might wonder if I have some sort of medical problem since I try so many, but no, unless living in the south is a medical issue:) Down here we sweat, a lot, it&#x27;s hot, it&#x27;s humid, the water glasses sweat, the dog lolls out her tongue and pants, and pits are. well.. sweaty stinky pits. The sauve 24 hour protection slid on smoothly, didn&#x27;t shave even though I applied it fresh out of the shower on newly shaved armpits, and smells great. I can smell almonds and a lovely slightly floral scent that I assume is the verbena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My underarms stayed dry and the suave didn&#x27;t rub off or stain my clothes. I give this one two arms up.</li>
            <li> Great protection.  Just a little to overpowering on fragrance; it may compete if you are wearing perfume.  White stuff disappears and become invisible when applied to skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top white plastic cover that you remove when you first use it is too tight. Not a big factor but still annoying.</li>
            <li> Suave products usually work great for me, and this 24-hour Anti Perspirant is no different than the other great Suave Products I&#x27;ve tried in the past. The smell of this product wasn&#x27;t bad, but not my favorite. It smelled of artificial almonds (something I was a little disappointed in), but I don&#x27;t know if it was the Verbena floral scent that was throwing it off the almond smell. Your product will likely smell like a floral almond scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does work to keep sweat away. And it is long-lasting too, and will keep its scent a day later, surprisingly enough. But I don&#x27;t feel like the scent is exactly my type, and will probably stick with Suave&#x27;s Baby Powder Scent.</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant because I was pleasantly surprised at how effective it was as an anti-perspirant.  I&#x27;m not a person who is prone to &#x27;smell&#x27;, however I sweat effectively and freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best test this time of year is when I take the dogs out for a walk.  We either go for a mile or so, or else a shorter distance at a fast pace.  What I found --to my delight-- was that my underarms were dry afterwards. Which is pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I though the smell was mild and one that could be used by men or women.  It went on relatively dry and worked effectively, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with this new discovery.</li>
            <li> Suave is the only deodorant I have found that does a decent job of keeping me dry, other then my very expensive Elizabeth Arden deodorant, which I don&#x27;t like to wear when I am only going outside to garden or feed the animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I like this smell or not yet.  It is a bit sweet for my taste.  I prefer the baby power scent.&lt;br /&gt;But all in all a very good product.</li>
            <li> My second go to antiperspirant/deodorant.  I use this product for daily use, going to the office, the movies, hanging out.  It&#x27;s not as effective on mowing the lawn days, or exercising outdoors days, for me, but it&#x27;s fine for &#x27;normal&#x27; activity days.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried Suave products in a while, so was quite surprised by this product&#x27;s very high quality. The texture is actually amazing: silken-smooth and creamy. It goes on very easily without pulling at the skin. It also seems to protect against odor and wetness as well as any other aluminum-based deodorant and for way longer than I&#x27;m used to a deodorant working. My husband, a hardworking man, says he really likes how well it works for him as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m used to unscented products, and this smelled so strongly of almond candy/cookies that it was hard to smell anything else even hours after applying it. If that sort of scent is an issue to someone, then as pleasing as this deodorant is to use and as effective as it is, I&#x27;d recommend against getting this particular variety of Suave 24 Hour. I&#x27;m sure they make unscented versions, though, and I will be seeking them out to try.</li>
            <li> I tend to be a little bit suspicious of so called &#x27;clear&#x27; deodorants as they almost always end up leaving &#x27;not clear&#x27; marks on my clothes.  suave&#x27;s 24 Hour Protection is actually clear as advertised.  Even when I wore black there was no residue on me or my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t pick up on the promised almond and verbena scent, rather I noticed a soft, fruity scent.  i can&#x27;t really comment about the &amp;#34;24 hrs&amp;#34; claim as I usually shower every day, but overall, this one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> This smells really good. If I didn’t know it was deodorant when I sniffed it, I might want to eat it. Unfortunately, it only works okay. If I have an even slightly active day, I will feel a slight bit of wetness under my arms. With the myriad of deodorants out there, it won’t be hard to find something that works better for me.</li>
            <li> Last year I tried a different Suave antiperspirant/deodorant product that I&#x27;ve since continued to buy because I loved how well it worked without being irritating to my sensitive skin. So when the chance came to give this one a try I couldn&#x27;t resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wouldn&#x27;t quite call it 24 hour protection it gets pretty close. It also smells amazing. I was a little iffy on Almond Verbena as a scent but if you prefer something non-floral or powdery but still feminine it&#x27;s a great one. Not strong and over-powering either. Just light and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part I liked best is that this formula did the job while invisible without leaving my skin red and irritated or dried out as other formulas have. I would definitely recommend this one and will probably buy this specifically for summer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant that I have used in a long time. It&#x27;s not anything fancy. It&#x27;s just a regular solid stick. There&#x27;s no bells and whistles, it just does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The scent is wonderful, I really like it. It applies really smooth and gives me protection all day long. It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any white reside and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes. I&#x27;m really happy to have found this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I usually love Suave but I can&#x27;t bring myself to like this deodorant.  I thought almond verbena would be such a pretty scent and maybe it is... but not as an underarm scent.  This scent doesn&#x27;t give me a fresh, clean feeling when wearing it and I also feel like the formula isn&#x27;t as strong as some of their other deodorants (or) perhaps the scent itself just starts to smell a bit like old/stale gym clothes after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update 5/13/14***&lt;br /&gt;Had to update because I tried this once more after running out of my go-to deodorant and I finally figured out what the scent reminds me of!  It&#x27;s exactly like the smell you get on your skin after visiting a tanning bed.  Maybe it&#x27;s my bodies chemistry just not melding well with this scent and it&#x27;ll work well for others but sadly, this one isn&#x27;t a winner for me :(  I still love Suave though; my go-to deodorant happens to be their clinical strength, light and fresh scent -- great product!</li>
            <li> I am usually picky when it comes to deodorant and have used Dove products for years however I decided to give this Suave Almond Verbena stick a try. I was impressed! The scent is a very nice smell. It is a slight pleasant floral almond smell that isn&#x27;t too strong for me. The deodorant keeps me dry and clean-smelling all day and there is no white residue on my clothes after I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an excellent product and one that I would definitely buy again.</li>
