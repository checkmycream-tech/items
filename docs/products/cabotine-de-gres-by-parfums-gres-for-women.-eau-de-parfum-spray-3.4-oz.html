            <li>For many years I used the original and I can compare.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m pretty selective, as most perfumes for women smell like roach spray to me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Interestingly my husband and son preferred the Cabotine de Gres over Tendre Poison ( I still have some of the Dior original</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I save for special occasions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This parfum is good to wear either in springtime or summer only.  </li>
            <li>It was priced well and arrived quick,</li>
            <li>The packaging was brand new, and when I took the plastic off  and opened the top of the box, I could already smell the heavenly scent.  </li>
            <li>It is long lasting and just perfect for any time of day or night.</li>
            <li>(that alone makes it worth every penny)  </li>
            <li>I bought this product looking for a nice, light everyday fragrance for summer.  </li>

            <li>Overall, I am pleased with the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>That is probably why there are so many fragrances on the market, everybody&#x27;s different.  </li>
            <li>I ordered &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34;,  and expected a perfume product, but received some kind of mist - not perfume.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I love this perfume.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for so many yrs. &amp; hardly a day goes by when I don&#x27;t get a compliment or someone asking for the name.  I especially like that the majority of compliments are from men. (that alone makes it worth every penny)  I heard that Ross stores carries it at $18.00 &amp; I decided to try it.  It was awful!!....Not only did it look different, it smelled like $18.00.</li>
            <li> I have no idea about perfumes, I blind bought this for my mother as a birthday present. She adores it and gets compliments from her coworkers. The scent is simply great, she says. It was priced well and arrived quick, so 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume on the advice of a stranger.  There were no samples to test when I came across this perfume in a department store.  It was locked in a glass case with other high-end perfumes.  Something even about the packaging intrigued me. Well, I finally got to open this gift to myself, and I love it!  It smells like a beautiful, light fragrance, floral but quite different than any perfumes out there.  I&#x27;m pretty selective, as most perfumes for women smell like roach spray to me.  My nose is also easily irritated and I get headaches from many scents.  This perfume is perfect, long-lasting, and my new best friend :)</li>
            <li> Although the box states Parfum, it is not, it is toilette water!...I have been using this fragrance for over 17 years and I definitely know the difference in the two. I was truly disappointed when I received these in the mail...😡</li>
            <li> A nice parfum for spring and summer for sure.  Got it for my mother and she loves it.  I recommand it for sure.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift in the mid-90&#x27;s and it is my signature fragrance! I get so many compliments from men and women when I wear it. It is long lasting and just perfect for any time of day or night. Can&#x27;t miss with this one! I&#x27;m not a big fan of the lotion and bath gel, they lose a little in the translation, but thats just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this perfume before.  I could never get tired of it. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Cabotine &#x27;parfum&#x27; for nearly 20 years.  Love, love, love it - and the many compliments I get.  Not designed for everyone but is my choice for life.  Hope De Gres never stops producing it.  The Parfum lasts longer on the skin than the Au de toilette.  Spray some on your back when going out and the warmth from your car seat will emits the lovely scent of the Cabotine de Gres.</li>
            <li> One of my favourites.</li>
            <li> I dislike this products because it not smell good.  The perfums is poor and I can see it not original.  For many years I used the original and I can compare.</li>
            <li> I bought this product looking for a nice, light everyday fragrance for summer.  After reading some of the reviews, even the negative, I purchased the product.  It is a light fragrance.  It smells lovely, light, and fresh.  It did not effect my sinuses, as some fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product without prior knowledge of how it would smell.  Overall, I am pleased with the fragrance.  It is not intrusive to others or to me, and I like that.  I don&#x27;t know that I would purchase this particular fragrance again.  I have others that I prefer more for summer.  I just wanted to try something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good fragrance at at good price.</li>
            <li> The Mrs. has always loved this concoction, so it&#x27;s nice for me to get it for her at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I remember when Cabotine De Gres was sold in department stores back in the 1990s.  I Ioved the smell then, and I love it now. To me this scent smells very French. You can only find the parfum or EDT, on Amazon at a great price. For a 3.4 ounce bottle, it only cost $18.99 including shipping charges.  I was amazed when I got my order.  The packaging was brand new, and when I took the plastic off  and opened the top of the box, I could already smell the heavenly scent.  I ordered the Eau De parfum version, and it lasts all day long.  This parfum is good to wear either in springtime or summer only.  I am going to order another bottle, so I won&#x27;t run out for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Dior hasn&#x27;t listened to all the ladies who were heartbroken when they discountinued their popular and unique Tendre Poison Perfume. I had read of the similarity of Cabotine de Gres to Tendre Poison so decided ( given it&#x27;s very reasonable price) to give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not identical to Tendre Poison especially when first applied but after about ten minutes the likeness is striking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly my husband and son preferred the Cabotine de Gres over Tendre Poison ( I still have some of the Dior original I save for special occasions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Dior, my irritation at you not listening to our pleas to bring back this signature scent has driven me into the arms of a new love .... And at a fraction of the price, I am enjoying the unique and delicious aroma of Cabotine de Gres everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Tendre Poison was your signature scent, try Cabotine de Gres. It is not expensive and after the first ten minutes you&#x27;ll wonder why you ever paid the hugely inflated price Dior demanded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unrequited love cured! Bye bye Dior.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this brand she does not want to use anything else! Worth every penny! I hope it never gets discontinued!</li>
            <li> Perfumes vary from person to person. Everyone&#x27;s taste is different. My Jamaican friend recommended this product to me and I am very satisfied. I spray a little to bed and hubby loves it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had one problem with any of my purchases.......I Think this is such an awesome way to buy things.....</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, love it.  How can you recomend a fragrance, it is personal and you either like it or you don&#x27;t.  That is probably why there are so many fragrances on the market, everybody&#x27;s different.  But this one works for me.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous scent for an unbelievable price.  I paid 80 Euros for this stuff in Brussels.</li>
            <li> I have used Cabotine products for many years so am very familiar with the fragrance.  I ordered &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34;,  and expected a perfume product, but received some kind of mist - not perfume.  This product offering is substandard, and not as advertised, and not of quality I anticipated.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance for 10+ years!  It is a scent that you can wear for any occasion, and never offend anyone!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume.  My daughter bought a bottle of it for me a while back and now that&#x27;s all I use.  I get so many wonderful compliments when I&#x27;m wearing this perfume!  The fragrance really works with my chemistry.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it the highest ranking, but feared that if I did, the price will skyrocket!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite perfume for many years.  I receive so many compliments when I wear it.  It just goes well with my chemistry.</li>
