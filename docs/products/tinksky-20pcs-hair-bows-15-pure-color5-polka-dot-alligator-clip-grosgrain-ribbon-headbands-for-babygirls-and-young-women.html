            <li>These are wonderful and quality made, my nieces loved them, will be buying more in the future have 2 more great nieces coming in a few months.</li>
            <li>I love that they all have a alligator clip which makes it so easy to clip in the hair</li>
            <li>, she was ecstatic and she asked me immediately if she could try them on.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to easily attach a hair bow to her hair.</li>
            <li>The ribbon is excellent quality, and the clips are great for my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is quite thin.</li>
            <li>The ribbon used in their construction is both sturdy and bright, and the colors really stand out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look cheap and it look so cute on my daughter.</li>
            <li>The size on these are perfect- like an inch tall and about 2 inches wide.</li>
            <li>Most bows are cheaply made and the clips just don&#x27;t hold the hair correctly.</li>
            <li>I would ideally use these to pin back my sisters bangs</li>
            <li>but the alligator clip is perfect, typically they all slide out of her hair but these are snug and secure!  </li>

            <li>These bows not only did a great job holding her bangs back</li>
            <li>Love these cute little bows!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these cute little bows, literally one to match every outfit that my daughter owns!</li>
            <li>because we have only boys doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t appreciate a good bow, and these bows from TinkSky are absolutely adorable!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They arrived pretty plastic packaging, can be closed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These bows are so cute and there is such a variety.</li>
            <li>This set of 20 bows was more than enough to keep them - and me - covered in girly hair accessories for days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad a finally found a clip that will stay in my daughters hair and not fall out with in about 10 minutes of putting it in.</li>
            <li>so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about these though- are the clips on the back.</li>
            <li>She will be in first grade</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Also if I pull my hair back these will work adorably.</li>
            <li>(Yes, he, it was just for testing;) )</li>
            <li>The colors are exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>I love the clip on the back</li>
            <li>My daughter has really fine and thin hair and the smooth ones tend to fall out of her hair very easily.</li>
            <li>However these bows are just the right size that I have been looking for as they can go in my hair without standing out too much.</li>
            <li>I love how the ends are cut correctly to lay flat on her head.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old daughter was so excited when I pulled them out and put them on the counter.</li>
            <li>Oh they give you a bright white and an off white too.</li>
            <li>I love these also because not only can my daughter wear them but also my baby niece who just turned 2 and doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair</li>
            <li>These bows are wonderful not to big or to small!</li>
            <li>You will pretty much have a bow for every outfit.</li>
            <li>I also live all of the pretty colors!</li>
            <li>have been nothing more than some ribbon held together by a single thread and some hope.</li>
            <li>I was provided a sample of these bows for review but price doesn&#x27;t change how vibrant they are, nor does it effect my review!</li>
            <li>They are very high quality bows</li>
            <li>for the quality-I really liked the fact that the clips themselves are metal with the little teeth,</li>
            <li>This would also be a nice gift for a little girl.</li>
            <li>lol, they are a little smaller than I thought they were going to be</li>
            <li>really like alligator clips</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them !</li>
            <li>The clips seem to grip the hair really well and don&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>ribbon appears to be glued to the alligator like clip very well.  </li>
            <li>she loves it so much.</li>
            <li>who wants some bows.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I love the wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li>I really like the clip that is attached to the bow.</li>
            <li>The seller was fast too.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>They have sturdy alligator clips and are made very well.</li>
            <li>Better than I could have ever expected.</li>
            <li>you like it that much, buy two!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They are made very well and will hold up very well.</li>
            <li>These are made VERY well and are on barrettes with alligator teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with them, they hold hair well.</li>
            <li>they have a gator clip underneath which did clasp her straight hair without any problem.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I did give a few of these to my niece because she really liked them as well</li>
            <li>soon as we got this yesterday she completely forgot of all the goodies we got her at the disney store for 5 times the amount this costs…&lt;br /&gt;Making her happy really doesn&#x27;t mean to break the bank.</li>
            <li>They are on the smaller size of large bow trend, so they are two small for my twelve year old but perfect on my one year old.  </li>
            <li>but i went out and bought a new clip and reapplied the two bows easy enough fix.</li>
            <li>Nice for the price, cute and well made but small than I expected.</li>
            <li>These are very cute little bows and my 3 year old</li>
            <li>color variety is great-perfect for girls, as there are more of the pinks-purple and then other colors as well</li>
            <li>Clips are razor sharp on top with teeth on the bottom.</li>
            <li>She is 6 years old and an absolute girly girl.&lt;br /&gt;She loves bows, head bands, princesses, and pretty much anything of that sort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great item for girls- big or small.</li>
            <li>The clip is very sturdy and holds a decent amount of hair.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a bow for my little girl that will clip and stay on her very fine hair  </li>
            <li>Just received this pack of bows for my 2 1/2 year old a few days ago and love them!</li>
            <li>They have a clip on the back which makes them easy to put straight into your hair or to attach to a plain headband if you don&#x27;t quite have enough hair yet (like a baby)&lt;br /&gt;Seller was easy to work with and package arrived right on time!</li>
            <li>The best for a wild toddler&#x27;s crazy hair.  </li>
            <li>You can pull these off at an older age.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find a 20 piece bow set for such a low price.</li>
            <li>The clips hold so tightly I was able to put one in my 1 year olds</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item:</li>
            <li>The ribbon is a high quality that won&#x27;t fray.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product.</li>

            <li>have 3 little girls and these are absolutely adorable and go with any outfit.</li>
            <li>They came in a cute little zip-lock package, and are well-made.</li>
            <li>If you have or know little girls, then you know how many bows are used and lost all the time.  </li>
            <li>I ordered for my four year old granddaughter and she is going to be prissing around wearing these!!</li>
            <li>3 year old daughter absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why these are labeled for baby, girls and young women-</li>
            <li>They seem to be holding up really well so far</li>
            <li>the kids love them everyday they do in the bag in</li>
            <li>they are small enough not to overwhelm a baby&#x27;s head and they are perfect size for any little girl.</li>
            <li>I have 3 little girls that wear bows daily and the quality of these bows are amazing.</li>
            <li>This pack gives you nearly every color of bow your favorite little girl needs.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend them as they are huge quality for a quite low price.</li>
            <li>I love how these are somewhat on the big size, but not too much so they look odd on littles.</li>
            <li>Cute no big as expected</li>
            <li>My daughter is 8 months old and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair yet, but the barrettes are high quality and stayed in her hair with no problem.</li>
            <li>I really like matching the dotted ones with a solid for a fun extra pop.</li>
            <li>My daughter just turned 6 years old and loves hairbows!</li>
            <li>These are easy to put into my little girls hair.</li>
            <li>I had low expectations based on the low price, and was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of not only the bows but the barrettes they came on as well as the adorable packaging.</li>
            <li>These bows are attached tightly to strong alligator clips that grab onto hair tightly!</li>
            <li>My 4 yrs old is all about accessorizing her</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bow is made of durable soft satin ribbon.</li>
            <li>They are secure on the clip so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them coming apart after you wear them a few times.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not heavy-</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 6 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>i used it on my 3 yr old daughter</li>
            <li>This has not bothered any of my daughters, but I know some children have a sensitive skalp.</li>
            <li>And my two year old didn&#x27;t rip them out of her hair in two seconds witch is a plus.</li>
            <li>I ordered these for my twin 4 year old girls.</li>
            <li>Second, the bows are very well made, the alligator clip is sturdy and the bows doesn&#x27;t look like it is about to fall apart.</li>
            <li>she let the bow stay in her hair to clip unlike some of the old bow that we had</li>
            <li>The red and white polka dot with a red shirt and white zipper up sweater high bunMinimal make up matte red lips and perfection :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to put them on my little niece.</li>
            <li>Very long wait, get the project, his first mistake, but it is not replaced by any problems.</li>

            <li>I have been searching for a good brand of bows for my 1 year old&#x27;s crazy hair.  </li>
            <li>These very well packaged hair bows arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>I love to get them all the girly things that would just never fly in my house.</li>
            <li>To clean it,simply use a little baby shampoo, rinse and let air dry.</li>

            <li>she really dint want to put any bow on hair but this product TInkSky 2 hands down for it</li>
            <li>but they are to cute to be disappointed! :)</li>

            <li> Thanks for the great product and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful and quality made, my nieces loved them, will be buying more in the future have 2 more great nieces coming in a few months.</li>
            <li> I love that they all have a alligator clip which makes it so easy to clip in the hair</li>
            <li> , she was ecstatic and she asked me immediately if she could try them on.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to easily attach a hair bow to her hair.</li>
            <li> The ribbon is excellent quality, and the clips are great for my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is quite thin.</li>
            <li> The ribbon used in their construction is both sturdy and bright, and the colors really stand out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look cheap and it look so cute on my daughter.</li>
            <li> The size on these are perfect- like an inch tall and about 2 inches wide.</li>
            <li> Most bows are cheaply made and the clips just don&#x27;t hold the hair correctly.</li>
            <li> I would ideally use these to pin back my sisters bangs</li>
            <li> but the alligator clip is perfect, typically they all slide out of her hair but these are snug and secure!  </li>
            <li> The alligator clips are super strong (without pulling hair!).</li>
            <li> I love these bows, I perfect size for little girls, you get an assorted of colors that can go with just about any outfit.</li>
            <li> they are so easy to use..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these will come apart easily.  </li>

            <li> Love these cute little bows!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these cute little bows, literally one to match every outfit that my daughter owns!</li>
            <li> because we have only boys doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t appreciate a good bow, and these bows from TinkSky are absolutely adorable!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They arrived pretty plastic packaging, can be closed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These bows are so cute and there is such a variety.</li>
            <li> This set of 20 bows was more than enough to keep them - and me - covered in girly hair accessories for days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad a finally found a clip that will stay in my daughters hair and not fall out with in about 10 minutes of putting it in.</li>
            <li> so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about these though- are the clips on the back.</li>
            <li> She will be in first grade</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Also if I pull my hair back these will work adorably.</li>
            <li> (Yes, he, it was just for testing;) )</li>
            <li> The colors are exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> I love the clip on the back</li>
            <li> My daughter has really fine and thin hair and the smooth ones tend to fall out of her hair very easily.</li>
            <li> However these bows are just the right size that I have been looking for as they can go in my hair without standing out too much.</li>
            <li> I love how the ends are cut correctly to lay flat on her head.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter was so excited when I pulled them out and put them on the counter.</li>
            <li> Oh they give you a bright white and an off white too.</li>
            <li> I love these also because not only can my daughter wear them but also my baby niece who just turned 2 and doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair</li>
            <li> These bows are wonderful not to big or to small!</li>
            <li> You will pretty much have a bow for every outfit.</li>
            <li> I also live all of the pretty colors!</li>
            <li> have been nothing more than some ribbon held together by a single thread and some hope.</li>
            <li> I was provided a sample of these bows for review but price doesn&#x27;t change how vibrant they are, nor does it effect my review!</li>
            <li> They are very high quality bows</li>
            <li> for the quality-I really liked the fact that the clips themselves are metal with the little teeth,</li>
            <li> This would also be a nice gift for a little girl.</li>
            <li> lol, they are a little smaller than I thought they were going to be</li>
            <li> really like alligator clips</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them !</li>
            <li> The clips seem to grip the hair really well and don&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> ribbon appears to be glued to the alligator like clip very well.  </li>
            <li> she loves it so much.</li>
            <li> who wants some bows.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast</li>

            <li> The seller was fast too.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> They have sturdy alligator clips and are made very well.</li>
            <li> Better than I could have ever expected.</li>

            <li> They are made very well and will hold up very well.</li>
            <li> These are made VERY well and are on barrettes with alligator teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with them, they hold hair well.</li>
            <li> they have a gator clip underneath which did clasp her straight hair without any problem.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I did give a few of these to my niece because she really liked them as well</li>
            <li> soon as we got this yesterday she completely forgot of all the goodies we got her at the disney store for 5 times the amount this costs…&lt;br /&gt;Making her happy really doesn&#x27;t mean to break the bank.</li>
            <li> They are on the smaller size of large bow trend, so they are two small for my twelve year old but perfect on my one year old.  </li>
            <li> but i went out and bought a new clip and reapplied the two bows easy enough fix.</li>
            <li> Nice for the price, cute and well made but small than I expected.</li>
            <li> These are very cute little bows and my 3 year old</li>
            <li> color variety is great-perfect for girls, as there are more of the pinks-purple and then other colors as well</li>
            <li> Clips are razor sharp on top with teeth on the bottom.</li>
            <li> She is 6 years old and an absolute girly girl.&lt;br /&gt;She loves bows, head bands, princesses, and pretty much anything of that sort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great item for girls- big or small.</li>
            <li> The clip is very sturdy and holds a decent amount of hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bow for my little girl that will clip and stay on her very fine hair  </li>
            <li> Just received this pack of bows for my 2 1/2 year old a few days ago and love them!</li>
            <li> They have a clip on the back which makes them easy to put straight into your hair or to attach to a plain headband if you don&#x27;t quite have enough hair yet (like a baby)&lt;br /&gt;Seller was easy to work with and package arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> The best for a wild toddler&#x27;s crazy hair.  </li>
            <li> You can pull these off at an older age.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find a 20 piece bow set for such a low price.</li>
            <li> The clips hold so tightly I was able to put one in my 1 year olds</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item:</li>
            <li> The ribbon is a high quality that won&#x27;t fray.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product.</li>

            <li> have 3 little girls and these are absolutely adorable and go with any outfit.</li>
            <li> They came in a cute little zip-lock package, and are well-made.</li>
            <li> If you have or know little girls, then you know how many bows are used and lost all the time.  </li>
            <li> I ordered for my four year old granddaughter and she is going to be prissing around wearing these!!</li>
            <li> 3 year old daughter absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why these are labeled for baby, girls and young women-</li>
            <li> They seem to be holding up really well so far</li>
            <li> the kids love them everyday they do in the bag in</li>
            <li> they are small enough not to overwhelm a baby&#x27;s head and they are perfect size for any little girl.</li>
            <li> I have 3 little girls that wear bows daily and the quality of these bows are amazing.</li>
            <li> This pack gives you nearly every color of bow your favorite little girl needs.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend them as they are huge quality for a quite low price.</li>
            <li> I love how these are somewhat on the big size, but not too much so they look odd on littles.</li>
            <li> Cute no big as expected</li>
            <li> My daughter is 8 months old and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair yet, but the barrettes are high quality and stayed in her hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> I really like matching the dotted ones with a solid for a fun extra pop.</li>
            <li> My daughter just turned 6 years old and loves hairbows!</li>
            <li> These are easy to put into my little girls hair.</li>
            <li> I had low expectations based on the low price, and was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of not only the bows but the barrettes they came on as well as the adorable packaging.</li>
            <li> These bows are attached tightly to strong alligator clips that grab onto hair tightly!</li>
            <li> My 4 yrs old is all about accessorizing her</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bow is made of durable soft satin ribbon.</li>
            <li> They are secure on the clip so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them coming apart after you wear them a few times.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not heavy-</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 6 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> i used it on my 3 yr old daughter</li>
            <li> This has not bothered any of my daughters, but I know some children have a sensitive skalp.</li>
            <li> And my two year old didn&#x27;t rip them out of her hair in two seconds witch is a plus.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my twin 4 year old girls.</li>
            <li> Second, the bows are very well made, the alligator clip is sturdy and the bows doesn&#x27;t look like it is about to fall apart.</li>
            <li> she let the bow stay in her hair to clip unlike some of the old bow that we had</li>
            <li> The red and white polka dot with a red shirt and white zipper up sweater high bunMinimal make up matte red lips and perfection :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to put them on my little niece.</li>
            <li> Very long wait, get the project, his first mistake, but it is not replaced by any problems.</li>
            <li> It is even easy when the hair in in a french braid or a tight bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> They have just a simple little clip that could easily be placed in the hair.</li>
            <li> They are made of high quality ribbon and look like they will last awhile.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these bows for any tiny fasionista!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good brand of bows for my 1 year old&#x27;s crazy hair.  </li>
            <li> These very well packaged hair bows arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I love to get them all the girly things that would just never fly in my house.</li>
            <li> To clean it,simply use a little baby shampoo, rinse and let air dry.</li>
            <li> The bows are good quality and are small enough for a tiny baby but big enough for a little girl.</li>
            <li> , it does not rip your hair our when you remove them, they are not sharp and do not dig into your skull, the clip are the same length as a bow</li>
            <li> polka dot clips come in blue, red, orange, light pink, and dark</li>
            <li> I really like the style and quality, however they are a little bigger in size for my 2.5 yr old.</li>
            <li> With so many Im not nearly as heartbroken when she loses one or two at school!</li>
            <li> she really dint want to put any bow on hair but this product TInkSky 2 hands down for it</li>
            <li> but they are to cute to be disappointed! :)</li>
            <li> Despite their tight hold the clips don&#x27;t pull or cause creases, which means my hair is perfectly straight after I take them out.</li>
            <li> because my daughter&#x27;s hair is very thin and most clips just fall off her hair in 3 seconds… these actually stay on!!!</li>
            <li> The quality is high, the clips are non-snagging, and they come in a heavy duty resealable plastic back that you can reuse as permanent storage for the bows.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these to all of my friends and family that have little girls.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pack for my daughter to use with her dolls (as she&#x27;s old enough now that she didn&#x27;t have a lot of little bows left from when she was a toddler).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for your little ones, furbabies, or yourself!</li>
            <li> This might be a little embarrassing for a 24 year old to admit</li>
            <li> They were smaller than I expected, but that was because I did not read the description.  </li>
            <li> too long soo</li>
            <li> My only problem was I thought they would be a little bigger</li>
            <li> Definitely money well spent!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The solid color bows include pink, green, purple, white, yellow, pink, black, red, and etc.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The spring in the clips is tight enough to keep them in place all day, while loose enough that even small hands can open them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 41 years old look about In my late 20s</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with these slipping or falling out.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the size is smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> wide assortment of bow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wearing any sort of hair accessory is no fun if it falls out over and over all day long.</li>
            <li> and my daughters have spent hours playing dress up and matching the bows to their outfits.</li>
            <li> Definitely a big hit with our little diva!</li>
            <li> Baby pink bubble gum pink brown black</li>
            <li> Not too big and not too small</li>
            <li> Each fold and twist is held tightly in place and we haven&#x27;t had a single one fall apart.</li>
            <li> They came in the mail last week packed in a small bag</li>
            <li> the size arent too big now too small.</li>
            <li> Extremely retro...love it.</li>
            <li> I personally make bows but am to lazy to make them 😂</li>
            <li> This size bow usually costs me $5 each at our local boutiques.</li>
            <li> It seems very sturdy &amp; unlikely to break off.</li>
            <li> so they stay put in her hair and the different colors gives her something to pick from everyday!!</li>
            <li> They came in a little resealable bag -</li>

            <li> They used quality ribbon to make them and the ribbon is firmly attached to the clip.  </li>
            <li> but will give it to them in a few weeks</li>
            <li> I got them wishing a few days of placing my order.</li>
            <li> There are a ton of colors (seriously, I can&#x27;t find a single outfit my daughter has that will not have a corresponding matching bow now) and</li>
            <li> They were a little small</li>
            <li> bow is a bit sloppy, a little sharp place, so you have to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were too small for my daughter to wear, which was my mistake because it says for baby in the description.</li>
            <li> I thought they are just too small..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen in the past</li>

            <li> I ordered these for my 4yr old but I was disappointed that they were kinda on the small size..</li>

            <li> I was very excited to find a 20 piece bow set for such a low price. I had low expectations based on the low price, and was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of not only the bows but the barrettes they came on as well as the adorable packaging. There are a ton of colors (seriously, I can&#x27;t find a single outfit my daughter has that will not have a corresponding matching bow now) and I love that there are polka dotted ones as well. The package arrived in a cute little bag that will be great for storing the bows not in use. My daughter is 8 months old and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair yet, but the barrettes are high quality and stayed in her hair with no problem. I&#x27;m so happy I took a chance on this product and have already placed another order to include with a gift for my nice. 10/10 would recommend to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my 4yr old but I was disappointed that they were kinda on the small size..of course they are super cute and vibrant in color. .I really like alligator clips bc they are so easy to use..so even though I can use them for her I will be giving them to friend who has a newborn and they should work perfectly</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much but when it arrived I was thoroughly impressed!!! The colors were beautiful, the bows were well made and they looked really nice on my girls hair. I highly recommend this item: the package it came in was also a plus!</li>
            <li> I can make bows, but I don&#x27;t like to. I purchased these bows and they are a great bargain! Very well made. A+</li>
            <li> These bows are adorable. Seller is on point and you can&#x27;t beat the price making them yourself!</li>
            <li> What a great set! There is a color to go with every outfit! I absolutely adore these for my grand daughters! I use them for the 1 to 12 year olds and they all love how they look. They are well made with good alligator clips that stay in their hair well. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with these slipping or falling out. Just a great [product! I received a discount on this item for my review.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I received these... I am super pleased!  We have almost every color bow we would need now, all in one package...and a super awesome deal.  Alligator clips are securely attached.  These aren&#x27;t cheaply made bows.  Glad I purchased!</li>
            <li> These were too small for my daughter to wear, which was my mistake because it says for baby in the description. I will have to use them as gifts for a baby. They are nice and vibrant colors, the material is soft. I tried them in my daughters hair and they hold nice.</li>
            <li> Love these!! Bought them as gift for my nieces and they are just darling on them! Nice quality product!</li>
            <li> OMG, these bows are ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE. I am beyond impressed with them. The are perfect for babies and up; I say babies bc they are small enough not to overwhelm a baby&#x27;s head and they are perfect size for any little girl. They have just a simple little clip that could easily be placed in the hair. They also come in this cute little packaging. I would without a doubt recommend this for anyone looking to get a good deal on a package of high quality, vibrant, adorable bows!!!!</li>

I highly recommend them !</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with these bows I got at a fantastic discount to review and they are more than I ever expected them to be. The are an excellent quality and will last my grandchildren a really long time. The clips are perfect to use on the side of the hair to hold the bangs back and they stay in very well. These would also be very good bows to add to a crochet headband or beanie.</li>
            <li> They are super pretty and a great size! There are colors to match every outfit. The clips seem to grip the hair really well and don&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> These cute little hair clips are soooo cute! My kids loves them.. they matched their clothes with these hair clips and they look very pretty! Thank u so much for these wonderful hai clips and for shipping them quickly!</li>
            <li> These bows are a great addition to accessorize any outfit! They have a clip on the back which makes them easy to put straight into your hair or to attach to a plain headband if you don&#x27;t quite have enough hair yet (like a baby)&lt;br /&gt;Seller was easy to work with and package arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> Good quality for a great price. Fast delivery</li>

            <li> I am in love with these bows! I ordered a pack for my nieces and they love them. They are not cheaply made. They are beautiful and durable and come in many beautiful colors and designs. Perfect for girls babies and toddlers of all ages. I adore them and glad I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a huge discount to review and test and review these products however my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> i love these bows they are so stylish and cute! was a bit bummed that two of them came broken but i went out and bought a new clip and reapplied the two bows easy enough fix. they stay put when they are in my daughters hair and dont move out of place unless she plays with her hair. she loves wearing them everyday. she picks out a color to go with the days outfit. i would buy these again so adorable!</li>
            <li> This is a great item for girls- big or small. The material used for the bows is good quality. The construction and making of the bow is great. The bow is not going to come off or pull apart. The clip is nice and sturdy and holds the hair well. It comes in nice packaging. There is a great array of designs and colors. This is a must buy for a girl. I love these bows.</li>
            <li> These are adorable your little girl will look so cute in these also vibrant colors</li>
            <li> Adorable,love the variety! Great deal.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased when I received these bows in the mail. The ribbon is excellent quality, and the clips are great for my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is quite thin. They come in a plastic bag, but not a thin kind, one with a handle to open and close. I am still storing my bows in that bag! We are extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> These are very cute little bows and my 3 year old calls them her BOUTIQUES because of the polkadoted ones are like Minnie mouse. They are a very good variety in beautiful colors. My only complaint is the size is smaller than I expected. But the quality of the clips and materials are nice. I am glad I had the opertunity to review these bows with my honest opinion for a small discount.</li>
            <li> These are PERFECT! These came in a cute bag, many colors and a great variety! The alligator clips are super strong (without pulling hair!). These are super well made and this is a great deal! I love how these are somewhat on the big size, but not too much so they look odd on littles. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I got this cute and adorable bows on a discount price for a review! And I love them that I would definitely would pay full price!!! Got this for my twin girls and they love them and won&#x27;t go a day without one on!!! I would so recommend this to all mom with princess!!</li>
            <li> These bows are adorable ! I am glad when I received them there was such a variety of colors .My 3 year old daughter absolutely loves them. The packaging came in a cute bag : )</li>
            <li> Love these cute little bows! They fit my 2 year old niece perfectly, very bright colors with thick quality ribbon. This pack gives you nearly every color of bow your favorite little girl needs.</li>
            <li> My 4 yrs old is all about accessorizing her hair.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as we got this yesterday she completely forgot of all the goodies we got her at the disney store for 5 times the amount this costs…&lt;br /&gt;Making her happy really doesn&#x27;t mean to break the bank. I even got a nice discount for this product, but still, $12 for 20 hair clips? even at the dollar store you can&#x27;t get that!&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality-I really liked the fact that the clips themselves are metal with the little teeth, because my daughter&#x27;s hair is very thin and most clips just fall off her hair in 3 seconds… these actually stay on!!! winning!&lt;br /&gt;the color variety is great-perfect for girls, as there are more of the pinks-purple and then other colors as well that will practically match every outfit.&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, this is a great buy for anyone who has a little girl!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter. Very cute and stylish</li>
            <li> There work great for my LoveBugs very long curly hair! Love the colors</li>
            <li> Just got these in today and they are PERFECT! Not too big and not too small they are too cute!!! I&#x27;m so excited to put them on my little niece. They have metal backs. Can&#x27;t recommend them highly enough, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> wide assortment of bow. My girls love them and goes with all outfits. Very sturdy and comfortable to wear</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product! The bows are good quality and are small enough for a tiny baby but big enough for a little girl. They are not too big like some bows. They are the perfect size for my newborn niece. It also includes so many colors that will match any outfit.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these cute little bows, literally one to match every outfit that my daughter owns! lol, they are a little smaller than I thought they were going to be but they are to cute to be disappointed! :)</li>
            <li> These already made bows were prefect for my nieces to decorate how they wanted them without me doing all the work of making the bows and adding the clips.</li>
            <li> These hair bows are so adorable! They came in a cute little zip-lock package, and are well-made. I plan to use them for baby gifts - the clips are perfect for fine, wispy hair. I couldn&#x27;t have made them myself for this price.</li>
            <li> A great collection of colorful bows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived pretty plastic packaging, can be closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bow itself well-made, covering a good variety of colors and patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clip bow is a bit sloppy, a little sharp place, so you have to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the project I&#x27;m glad to get my views to be evaluated.</li>
            <li> We loved getting these hair bows.  They were smaller than I expected, but that was because I did not read the description.  They work just as well as the ones that are a bit larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ribbon appears to be glued to the alligator like clip very well.  I don&#x27;t think these will come apart easily.  The clip makes it so easy to attach the hair bow to the hair.  It is even easy when the hair in in a french braid or a tight bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girls love all the colors.  And the 5 matching polka dot hair bows are a plus.  Works well together on those days they want two hair bows.  Colors all match what the girls are all wearing this summer, awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bow is made of durable soft satin ribbon.It doesn&#x27;t fade, won&#x27;t deform, and can&#x27;t ball. It&#x27;s about 7*8cm and very suitable for girls of all ages.  It&#x27;s washable(Please don&#x27;t use washing machine). To clean it,simply use a little baby shampoo, rinse and let air dry.</li>
            <li> These are super cute for my girls! I thought they are just too small.. but they&#x27;re not ..just right.. perfect for all sassy girls!.. super cute bag too.. love them! Thanks for the great product and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> My daughter so happy that she got this cutie hairbow. I like the sizes of it. I just wish each of it has a same color or pair.</li>
            <li> These bows are so cute and there is such a variety. I have 3 nieces, I am splitting this pack up between the three as gifts. You can&#x27;t beat that price for this many bows. If you have or know little girls, then you know how many bows are used and lost all the time.  Even better - I was very happy with the packaging. They came in a little resealable bag - so I&#x27;m not opening the packaging then having to find a basket or something to store them in. Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> My husband has a handful of nieces, and since we have nothing but boys I love to get them all the girly things that would just never fly in my house. This set of 20 bows was more than enough to keep them - and me - covered in girly hair accessories for days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some bows I&#x27;ve seen in the past have been nothing more than some ribbon held together by a single thread and some hope. Each of these 20 bows is durably made and will stand up to a day of constant wear! Each fold and twist is held tightly in place and we haven&#x27;t had a single one fall apart. The ribbon used in their construction is both sturdy and bright, and the colors really stand out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wearing any sort of hair accessory is no fun if it falls out over and over all day long. These bows are attached tightly to strong alligator clips that grab onto hair tightly! Despite their tight hold the clips don&#x27;t pull or cause creases, which means my hair is perfectly straight after I take them out. The spring in the clips is tight enough to keep them in place all day, while loose enough that even small hands can open them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because we have only boys doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t appreciate a good bow, and these bows from TinkSky are absolutely adorable! I was provided a sample of these bows for review but price doesn&#x27;t change how vibrant they are, nor does it effect my review!</li>
            <li> Just as pictured :) clip is nice and stiff, not cheap! Love the variety!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my girls they love to make their hair look pretty. I have trouble with a lot of bows because their hair is thin, but this bows stayed in their hair. The clip on them has teeth on them and helps stay in their hair. There is a variety of colors to chose from. My girls have one they can wear with every outfit. They are secure on the clip so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them coming apart after you wear them a few times. I am glad a finally found a clip that will stay in my daughters hair and not fall out with in about 10 minutes of putting it in.</li>
            <li> I purchased these bows at a low price to review them! I am a picky mother when it comes to hair accessories for my daugther! These bows are wonderful not to big or to small! I love that they all have a alligator clip which makes it so easy to clip in the hair and also they do not fall out easy! I styled my daughters hair in them and let het play to see and they stayed perfectly!! I love the material its not cheaply made ribbon its perfect! It comes in a cute zip lock storage bag for easy storage which is also perfect since sometimes hair bows get lost! I definitely recommend buying these can&#x27;t resist all the perfect colors easily will match any oufit in your closet!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece and myself. she loves it so much. And so do I. Its safe for toodlers hair. It doesn&#x27;t get tangled when u take it off.</li>
            <li> Fantastic bows.  The grosgrain ribbon wasn&#x27;t unraveling, the alligator clip has teeth so they don&#x27;t magically fall out of my child&#x27;s hair, and the size is not humongous.</li>
            <li> Love these bows! Great material and I enjoy all the assortments of colors that they have! My daughters love them!</li>
            <li> This Hair Bows are so cute. They don&#x27;t look cheap and it look so cute on my daughter. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Perfect quality vibrant colors beautiful in my daughters hair and she loves them ! Plus</li>
            <li> They came in the mail last week packed in a small bag and my daughters have spent hours playing dress up and matching the bows to their outfits. They are on the larger side, I never would have picked them out if I&#x27;d seen them in person but they are adorable. The kids love them and have received many compliments while out and about, so that&#x27;s all that matters to them . They are very high quality bows they are attached to the clip well, have no fraying, etc. I received all of the colors pictured and loved the packaging, too. Thanks so much  tinksky for a great product at a great price!I received the product at discount price for review.</li>
            <li> The are a lot like the ones that Walmart sells.</li>
            <li> Really like the hairpin, fast delivery, good packaging, there are 20 different colors of hair clips, good quality, 18-year-old girls to use it.</li>
            <li> This might be a little embarrassing for a 24 year old to admit but it&#x27;s all about honesty. I got these TinkSky 20pcs Hair Bows for myself! I like to accessorize and I can never find bows that aren&#x27;t overly big! However these bows are just the right size that I have been looking for as they can go in my hair without standing out too much. The colors that are included in this set are great since you can pretty much match your bow with any outfit you have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that these bows have alligator clasp which are super easy to put in your hair without any pain or discomfort. Also the bag that comes these bows come in help be able to store these without taking up too much room or losing any of them! I did give a few of these to my niece because she really liked them as well and she too loved how they didn&#x27;t hurt her in anyway. I would definitely recommend these bows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even say how much I love these! They are soo dang cute! I really don&#x27;t know why these are labeled for baby, girls and young women- they are for all women and men who want to add some flair! I use them almost every day and I think they are just the best. First, the colors are wonderful. Such a full range of colors that you will be able to match anything. There is only one of each color so be aware of that. There are 15 solid color bows and 5 polka dotted ones. I really like matching the dotted ones with a solid for a fun extra pop. The size on these are perfect- like an inch tall and about 2 inches wide. They don&#x27;t overpower your head- just the right size. They are made of some really nice ribbon too, they have a perfect shape and hold it well didn&#x27;t get all smooched up. They come is a super smart zipper plastic bag so you don&#x27;t even have to worry about storing them- I love that!!! My favorite thing about these though- are the clips on the back. There are so good things about the clip: grabs on to your hair nice and doesn&#x27;t slip out, it doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair!, it does not rip your hair our when you remove them, they are not sharp and do not dig into your skull, the clip are the same length as a bow so it looks great on all side and lastly- it&#x27;s not heavy- I don&#x27;t even remember I am wearing them. I am totally in love with these and recommend them any person (or pet!) who wants some bows.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE SO CUTE PERFECT FOR MY DAUGHTER NOT TO SMALL</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 6 year old daughter. She loves them. I was really impressed at well they stay in her hair. Most bows are cheaply made and the clips just don&#x27;t hold the hair correctly. She will be in first grade so she now has a bow for every outfit in her wardrobe. I would highly recommend these to all of my friends and family that have little girls. I did receive this product at a reduced rate. However this has no effect on the integrity of my review.</li>
            <li> These bows are adorable and very well made! The packaging was super cute also! I have a very excited preteen who loves to wear hair bows! I would recommend these for girls of any age!</li>
            <li> super cute bows! so many you will absolutely find one to match your lil one&#x27;s outfit! These are for my niece she has relatively thin hair but the alligator clip is perfect, typically they all slide out of her hair but these are snug and secure!  With so many Im not nearly as heartbroken when she loses one or two at school! Def recommended!</li>
            <li> Beautifu colors!!! i used it on my 3 yr old daughter and she jus totally love it. the size arent too big now too small. the clips are good and it doesnt come off easily.</li>
            <li> Cute bows! They are just smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Great bows. Arrived fast</li>
            <li> Brilliant for my daughters hair. Matches with most outfits and great for school. The girls love them. Fast delivery. Ordered on Saturday evening &amp; delivered next day Sunday.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my niece and they are very cute and stylish. I love the wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I love these colorful ribbon.They are looks adorable and very cute to my daughter hair.The delivery is on time and the packaging was good.They are the same colors like in the photo.</li>
            <li> This are so cute to match with every dress for kids.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL BOWS! This is an amazing set of 20 bows. Lots of colors. I really like the clip that is attached to the bow. It seems very sturdy &amp; unlikely to break off. The clip itself holds the hair perfectly in place. I would ideally use these to pin back my sisters bangs but you can also use the clip to attach the bow to a hairband/ponytail. My sister went crazy when she saw this set. Perfect for younger girls. (Ages1-10) The bows came in a handy close-able pouch, which can either be used to store the bows or be re-purposed.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them!</li>
            <li> Love love love the colors!  Bright and playful.  A nice variety of colors to go with anything!</li>
            <li> These are absolutely adorable. I had one without a back but I am not fan Orange and white polka dots. I worked for Hooters too long soo I will remove that back and put it on the turquoise blue one. The price is great on these. I am using mine on me!! I think these will look adorable in front of a high bun on your head. Also if I pull my hair back these will work adorably. I am 41 years old look about In my late 20s so I really LOVE the pretty bow look in front of the high placed bun. I actually saw this look in Vogue. Extremely retro...love it. Oh they give you a bright white and an off white too. Baby pink bubble gum pink brown black every color you would need. There are alot of looks for fall...one is the retro look another the hippie look. Both looks I love. Of course these bows work for a retro look. The floppy hat works for the hippie look. I am set. Cant wait for fall. It is slowly creeping in. These darling bows can be used for an array of hair styles!! Sooo excited to try these. If you have a daughter these are a must have product. The seller was fast too. Love the colors and love the polka dot ones. You can pull these off at an older age. It&#x27;s all about were you place the bow. The red and white polka dot with a red shirt and white zipper up sweater high bunMinimal make up matte red lips and perfection :-)</li>
            <li> Super cute, hold well, stand up to a toddler playing with them very well</li>
            <li> These bows are perfect for my daughter. Quality is great and I know they will last.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great well made bows they are a nice size not to big not to small the kids love them everyday they do in the bag in came with which has a zipper to open and close it and pick on out.. They are way to cute. A must have if you have a little girl price is a great deal</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these bows! I actually make bows myself but I never pass up on buying them when they are priced so well. They are nicely made! All the colors are needed when you have two girls!</li>
            <li> Simply adorable.  I am pleased with the variety of colors and quality!  I ordered for my four year old granddaughter and she is going to be prissing around wearing these!!</li>

            <li> My daughter loves things with colors so finding these bows is fantastic. She loves changing her hair clips and bows to match her outfits. Hope to order more soon. As she and my nieces are asking me for more.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my granddaughter and she love them very much, every time I go out with her, she will wear them and I always get stopped and told how gorgeous it is and where I got it from. Really like it.</li>
            <li> Nice set of bows. Comes in a resealable bag. My girls love them and they are easy to use!</li>
            <li> Got these for my daughter and she loves them. They are nicely made. They come in any color you would need to match outfits. She loves to choose her bow for the day and have 20 to choose from she never gets bored. This would also be a nice gift for a little girl.</li>
            <li> Cute no big as expected</li>
            <li> These bows are very cute and well made. I personally make bows but am to lazy to make them 😂😂😂 its just easier to purchase. My daughter loves these bows especially since she thinks I made them. Thank you lol. But over all the bows are great for infant and toddler girls. My only problem was I thought they would be a little bigger then what they actually are over then that I would definitely recommend these bows. The material On the bows aren&#x27;t the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> These bows are made of excellent quality and adorable. My girls love these bows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a discount to review this item.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I loves these bows.  Easy to put in and take out.  I love how the ends are cut correctly to lay flat on her head.  We put these in her hair to keep the short pieces out of her face.  Great material too.</li>
            <li> These look quite adorable!  I would definitely purchase them for my niece sometime in the future.  However, I keep getting asked to leave a reivew.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these adorable bows.  They are made of high quality ribbon and look like they will last awhile.  Lots of different color options and they come in a handy bag that she can store them in.</li>
            <li> I love the TinkSky 20pc Hairbow Set!  My 3 year old daughter was so excited when I pulled them out and put them on the counter. There is a wide variety of beautiful, brilliant colors. There are 15 solids and 5 with polka dots. With all the colors you definitely will not have a problem finding one to go with your child’s outfit.  I also am pleased that they have a sturdy alligator clip that has teeth so they will stay in the hair. My daughter has really fine and thin hair and the smooth ones tend to fall out of her hair very easily. They are also the perfect size and are made from a sturdy ribbon and put together very well.  I highly recommend these bows for any tiny fasionista!</li>
            <li> These bows are the perfect 3&amp;#34; size and colors for my four year old. She opened the pack and tried each one on.  They have sturdy alligator clips and are made very well. The clips hold so tightly I was able to put one in my 1 year olds super fine 1&amp;#34; hair and it stayed while he crawled around. (Yes, he, it was just for testing;) ) Overall- Very Satisfied</li>
            <li> I love these bows, I perfect size for little girls, you get an assorted of colors that can go with just about any outfit. The clip is perfect as it grips on to the hair with it getting loose and fallowing out even the bag that the bows came is cute and great to store them.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful! They are very well made and a great assortment of colors! Perfect for a gift or for your own daughter! I recommend these!</li>
            <li> Nice for the price, cute and well made but small than I expected.</li>
            <li> All of the bows are very cute. They are on silver alligator clips that have teeth on the bottom clap. My girls have thin hair and other bows just slip out. The teeth help hold these in place. They were also shipped in a clear plastic bag which is nice for storage.</li>
            <li> These very well packaged hair bows arrived sooner than expected. I really like the style and quality, however they are a little bigger in size for my 2.5 yr old.</li>
            <li> These are made well and super cute! This is a great deal for bows! This size bow usually costs me $5 each at our local boutiques. I also live all of the pretty colors!</li>
            <li> Great set of bows! You will pretty much have a bow for every outfit. My daughter was very excited when she got these and insisted on wearing 3. Good quality.</li>
            <li> The bows are absolutely ADORABLE! As a matter of fact, I will be buying a second set so that I have two of each (for pick tails). They were delivered on time, and are even cuter in person. Thank you for such a great deal!</li>
            <li> They are soooooo cute and stay in my 11 month olds hair:)</li>
            <li> The best for a wild toddler&#x27;s crazy hair.  I have been searching for a good brand of bows for my 1 year old&#x27;s crazy hair.  She has lots of hair and it&#x27;s semi fine but ALWAYS in her eyes.  These bows not only did a great job holding her bangs back but they came in a fantastic array of colors.  Love them and would recommend for everyone.</li>
            <li> I did like my product. They were a little small but, I did like them.</li>
            <li> These are so cute and what a great deal.  The colors are exactly as pictured.  They are on the smaller size of large bow trend, so they are two small for my twelve year old but perfect on my one year old.  The alligator clips on the back are not covered in cloth.  This has not bothered any of my daughters, but I know some children have a sensitive skalp.</li>
            <li> Received at discount for review, received and right that very second my granddaughter wanted them in her hair work great and we love them lots of colors and made nice, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Better than I could have ever expected. I was able to get these awesome bows at a fantastic discount to review and I am so glad I did. I have 3 little girls that wear bows daily and the quality of these bows are amazing. I really love the clip on them and they can be worn in so many ways. We are using them today already and I love they haven&#x27;t fallen out not once. They stay in great and we will definitely be getting tons of use out of them. The colors are beautiful and will go with anything you wear. Will purchase from again</li>
            <li> Excellent value for money, really well made!</li>
            <li> Very long wait, get the project, his first mistake, but it is not replaced by any problems. I really like them (despite my age ^^), which is cool, there are many colors to choose every day!</li>
            <li> I recieved my hair bows and I love them!  The colors are bright! I love the 5 polka-dot ones! They aren&#x27;t too tiny or too big for my lil ones head!</li>
            <li> Super cute bows! I love the clip on the back it makes it easier to put in hair and it stays!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful and quality made, my nieces loved them, will be buying more in the future have 2 more great nieces coming in a few months. I did get these free for a review but are made well and worth the price they want.</li>
            <li> These bows are so cute made cute  &amp;#34;Bow&amp;#34;quet with them for baby shower</li>
            <li> love them! they are so pretty and worth the price</li>
            <li> Bows are misshaped and cheap looking. Clips are razor sharp on top with teeth on the bottom. I cut my finger touching it.Very dangerous for children. The catch your hair making it impossible to take out of your hair without breaking and/or ripping your hair out of your head.</li>
            <li> Great quality hairbows. They&#x27;re made to last. You can&#x27;t beat the price for the size and quality of these bows. My daughters love them and my youngest even thought it would be a good idea to put one on her rocking horse.</li>
            <li> These assortment of colorful bows are absolutely adorable. I have colors for every outfit and occasion. My daughter just loves these. I should have gotten more than one order of these. Mama always say, &amp;#34;if you like it that much, buy two!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I LOVE these bows!! They came really fast, well packaged, and great quality! They are bright and beautiful and I use them almost daily. Attached some pictures to show colors and size.</li>
            <li> My daugther loves this bows. She cant go out without bows in her hair now! Thank you.</li>
            <li> These bows are super cute I love the variety of them. They are made very well and will hold up very well. The clip is very sturdy and holds a decent amount of hair. I would recommend these!</li>
            <li> I love this set of hair bows. They used quality ribbon to make them and the ribbon is firmly attached to the clip.  I wish they would take &amp;#34;headband&amp;#34; out of the title and description.  There are no headbands; just hair bows.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> OMG these are SOOOOO adorable!!!! We got these today and they are perfect size! My daughter just turned 6 years old and loves hairbows! These are made VERY well and are on barrettes with alligator teeth so they attach really good! My daughter has super thin hair and they look GREAT and don&#x27;t move! Awesome deal because you get 20 pieces for only 11.99!!! What a steal!!! I love these also because not only can my daughter wear them but also my baby niece who just turned 2 and doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair and they both can wear them without any problem!  They are awesome!!! Will be buying more!!!</li>
            <li> What a bunch of pretty bows and the clips not sure they will stay in my granddaughter hair..but will give it to them in a few weeks hope they stay in..but over all nice bows..</li>
            <li> These have the alligator clips that I love so they stay put in her hair and the different colors gives her something to pick from everyday!!</li>
            <li> I love these.  My eldest daughter didn&#x27;t even give me time to take any out of the package before asking to put them in her hair.  They are very bright and easy to handle. The clip can be installed with one hand. It looks good on infants and older girls (my daughter is 7 with puffy hair and it looked great in her hair)</li>
            <li> Great pack if you&#x27;re looking for a large variety of hair bows. I purchased this pack for my daughter to use with her dolls (as she&#x27;s old enough now that she didn&#x27;t have a lot of little bows left from when she was a toddler). The quality is high, the clips are non-snagging, and they come in a heavy duty resealable plastic back that you can reuse as permanent storage for the bows. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Cute bows, good quality. And my two year old didn&#x27;t rip them out of her hair in two seconds witch is a plus.</li>
            <li> I got these hair bows for my niece. She is 6 years old and an absolute girly girl.&lt;br /&gt;She loves bows, head bands, princesses, and pretty much anything of that sort.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I noticed she didn&#x27;t have any hair accessories to match her tutus.&lt;br /&gt;So, I took it upon myself to bestow her something that could change this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair clips come in a little baggie. There are 20 hair bow clips in total, 15 of which are solid colors and 5 are polka dots.&lt;br /&gt;The solid color bows include pink, green, purple, white, yellow, pink, black, red, and etc.&lt;br /&gt;The polka dot clips come in blue, red, orange, light pink, and dark pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I gave them them to her, she was ecstatic and she asked me immediately if she could try them on.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to easily attach a hair bow to her hair. They kept in her hair well and it didn&#x27;t pull her hair when she removed it.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I love the variety of the hair bow clips. It allows her to mix and match with her outfits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Very much loved by babies!  the bows are affixed to a small alligator style clip that provides excellent grip to keep the bow exactly where you want in the hair.  We have worn them to keep hair swept away from their faces, in front of a ponytail, and even in Momma&#x27;s afro curls.  Does not get stuck in the hair and is easy to remove, even in curly hair.</li>
            <li> The bows are great quality and arrived it great packaging. I&#x27;m very please with them, they hold hair well.</li>
            <li> I bought these on sale for my niece. They are so cute! they have a gator clip underneath which did clasp her straight hair without any problem. The package comes with a big variety of colors so she has bows she can use for all occasions. Great deal with a big variety and easy to clip and hold. My niece loves then</li>
            <li> I love the quality of these and they are the perfect size for my lil one!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful....great quality. Highly recommend this seller. :)</li>
            <li> I thought the alligator clip itself would have been covered with the ribbon, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s metal. Other than that the bows are beautiful.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my twin 4 year old girls. They are adorable! You receive a lot of variety in colors and patters. The bows are made from high quality ribbon, super easy to put in, and they don&#x27;t fall out even with the finest hair. My girls even used them as accessories today on their dresses. They clip right on to a tank, sundress, or any garment with straps. The bows came with their own storage bag, which is very convenient. Highly recommend for your little ones, furbabies, or yourself!</li>
            <li> These bows are adorable! The variety of colors and materials used are well worth the cost! Now my daughter will have a bow for just about every outfit! They have a nice clip that holds them snug too!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my granddaughter she loved them colors very bright</li>

            <li> Just received this pack of bows for my 2 1/2 year old a few days ago and love them! She wears a bow everyday and is very hard on them. They seem to be holding up really well so far and they&#x27;re soooo cute! I have a hard time finding bows that will stay clipped in her thin hair without sliding and we don&#x27;t have that issue with these at all! Shipping was super fast as well! I got them wishing a few days of placing my order. Definitely money well spent!</li>
            <li> The bows are beyond beautiful! I love the details of the bows and I love that they come in a resealable bag! The clip on them is perfect. It allows it to be Easily placed in the child&#x27;s hair without pulling on the hair. They are a nice size so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for newborns but any age 1 to 12yrs would be perfect!</li>
