            <li>I find it works best when I use my finger to affix my lashes to the perm rods and a q-tip when applying each solution to my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I made these changes to my routine, I came out with beautiful curls to my eyelashes!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I made these changes to my routine, I came out with beautiful curls to my eyelashes!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve permed my lashes and the curl is still beautifully intact!</li>

            <li>good product</li>
            <li>The product is good.</li>
            <li>good quality.</li>
            <li>price good ..</li>
            <li>so be patient with the shipping time, but considering, it came extremely quickly, a good 15 days before the soonest day that Amazon said it was to be delivered.</li>
            <li>Permed my own lashes turned out great.</li>
            <li>So I started looking for some eyelash perm kits at a descent/reasonable price and this fit in perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am so glad!  </li>
            <li>I am rushing to the computer to write this review because I need the world to know how amazing this product is.  </li>
            <li>It kind of worked</li>
            <li>when I swim they are looking nice all the time...loved it</li>
            <li>so that was nice.</li>
            <li>The more you put on one area, the more it&#x27;ll curl!</li>
            <li>If your eyes tend to water easily, brace yourself!</li>
            <li>Permed my lashes for the first time with this and they came out great.</li>
            <li>they stay up :3</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there is a better one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t use this on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I am going to try to leave it on longer than suggested and hope that it shows better results.</li>
            <li>I should of paid more for a better product.</li>
            <li>and it keeps the curl while getting any kinks out--be sure to rinse any residue off from your lashes after. :)</li>
            <li>Needs better instructions.</li>
            <li>:)ear) to remove the eyelash glue from your lashes.</li>
            <li>Okay this thing burned the living s</li>
            <li>Now my lashes look fabulous!</li>
            <li>for most people its not usable as it arrives.  </li>
            <li>the trick is to NOT put the perming solution ALL the way to the top of your lashes or else itll be kinky.</li>
            <li>.. Need so much patience but works good...</li>
            <li>The hardest part is glueing the eyelashes to the curling sponges, everything else is easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a great kit, and I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just a tip out there for first timers, sometimes you might have an experience where you find they are too curly, hitting the eyelid</li>
            <li>very time consuming with that kind of time bc, you have to do it with each step.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT TIP:</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind since it was free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>works like a charm, and extremely cheap</li>
            <li>It does a good job on my eyelashes and last for more than a month.</li>
            <li>For those of you who are trying the product for the first time, test some on your wrist before using!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with this bought, I would totally buy it again!</li>
            <li>what I did was get them to stick as best as possible and put another rod on top, sandwiching the upper lashes in between.</li>
            <li>, I am so excited, it saves time when I apply mascara...</li>
            <li>so I could actually perform the procedure correctly, and it was a great success.</li>
            <li>I have used other eyelash perm solutions and they work beautifully.</li>
            <li>Do full research like watch how to videos, etc.  </li>
            <li>It worked a lot better for me when I applied too much solution to my lashes versus not enough.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>Love this product, would totally recommend. :)</li>
            <li>a little boost then apply my mascara and they stay fanned out and beautiful</li>
            <li>I did it myself for the very first time without expectations, thinking that I was going to need a lot of practice to achieve the results I get from the spa.</li>
            <li>The putti is not so good as it takes long for eyebrows to stick to the rod.</li>
            <li>this was due to my own mistakes!</li>
            <li>Just use a mirror in a brightly lit room and go slowly so you don&#x27;t poke yourself. :)</li>
            <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>I was so exciting when I got this in the mail.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, you need to get the eyelashes to go the right direction</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pretty sure there has got to be, because I had mine professionally permed before</li>
            <li>and they were really curled!</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE, however product is not awesome.  </li>
            <li>but it was a price I was willing to pay in order to save some bucks but not at all</li>
            <li>This was my first time using the perm kit</li>
            <li>My first eyelash perm experience and</li>
            <li>exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>This helped me to get the lashes better into place, and helped me to avoid getting the product on my upper lashes.</li>
            <li>and it is a first time that i used a product so unprofessional.</li>
            <li>I did not do this the first time I tried using the kit, so my lashes did not come out as curly as I wanted them to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product, would totally recommend.</li>
            <li>First time ever purchasing eyelash perm.</li>
            <li>This is my first time perming my lashes.</li>
            <li>I had heard about it about 2 years ago and was really interested in doing it, but couldn&#x27;t find a salon that provided this service.</li>
            <li>The first time I permed my lashes they came out kinky and &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; shaped because I applied the solution from roots to tips.</li>
            <li>I was obviously very familiar with the process and this was exactly the same kit they used at the spa/salon.  </li>
            <li>i have really straight eyelashes that won&#x27;t curl ever the first time i did it</li>
            <li>Good luck trying to get your refund because you have to spend a fortune to ship it back to China at your own expense for their poor quality item.</li>
            <li>BE SURE TO EVENLY DISTRIBUTE THE FIRST PINK SOLUTION.</li>
            <li>Based on previous review and similar complaints, I went ahead and ordered larger, silicone/plastic ones and it works beautifully!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it worked very well.</li>
            <li>I just tried it, and it  really works.</li>
            <li>It really works.....</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are sticking straight up and bent to the side, not curled.</li>
            <li>the Putty they refer to as glue would not hold, I threw the whole thing away</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I just finished the whole process</li>
            <li>the results if you follow the directions are WOW!!!</li>
            <li>watched used a product with pink and blue lotion that was like 10 dollars more expensive, but I bought this kit and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>My eyes do water pretty easily, so it took a little bit of trial and error when using this kit.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>have the intention of doing by purchasing the whole kit.the instructions aren&#x27;t so clear.</li>
            <li>The rollers are on the smaller side if you have super long lashes like mine but not to worry, no need to buy a larger size, just be patient and glue the lashes super good with a toothpick and ONLY treat them from root to about mid length, do not go all the way to the top, This way you achieve a nice long curl at the base and not the super curly kinky eyelashes</li>
            <li>Everyone says that the perm rods are too small, and they are quite surprisingly tiny little guys, but I used them anyways and only put the product from the root to halfway up my eyelashes, and I got a perfect curl for my taste, much like what I would always get with an eyelash curler, but now I dont have to use one!</li>
            <li>That is the only thing to keep in mind, other than that, it was smooth, easy, fast, and did not even remotely make my eyes teary or hurt.  </li>
            <li>Its important to know that you MUST order perm rods with this kit unless you have teeny tiny short lashes.</li>
            <li>Instructions aren&#x27;t very clear ,the timing is correct on application thought.</li>
            <li>I wiped it off and wore make up as usual since my eyes looked ok then.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever purchased an item like this, and I totally recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The first and only eyelash perming kit I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Another thing, the rods are too small to create more natural look on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This kit looks like it will last awhile, far cheaper than a salon, and since I&#x27;m doing it myself, I can get my lashes to look exactly how I like.</li>
            <li>one side came gorgeous while other was kinky due to my incompetence to glue lashes properly over curler.  </li>
            <li>The bottles go in order of the process so that makes it easy, starting with the pink and going to the clear at the end.</li>
            <li>3rd time was a charm with this, and I had to get large rods.</li>
            <li>When removing your eyelashes from the perm rods, use a bunch of the cleaning solution (clear) to remove the eyelash glue from your lashes.</li>
            <li>Clear glue remover.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself as sensitive skin type...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still playing with the time, but so far I&#x27;m up to 30 minutes</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t put this on my eyes on anywhere near my skin.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my sensitive skin, who knows.</li>
            <li>have sensitive eyes and the solution didn&#x27;t irritate them at all, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You must be EXTREMELY careful towards the end of the treatment, especially when you are ready to take off the perming rod!!!</li>
            <li>I did this to my own lashes (though you&#x27;re not supposed to apparently) and it really wasn&#x27;t difficult.</li>
            <li>For most people, these sized rods will make eyelashes curl in on themselves and look ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>- I got a decent curl the last time I did it, but I think I need to up my time another 10 minutes...</li>
            <li>It may be that the rods were too small and I will probably need to order larger ones and a better glue,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend researching how to use this kit properly before you try it out.</li>
            <li>I already have long lashes and thought about lash extensions, but at $250 then $75 for maintenance every other month, that didn&#x27;t fit in my budget.</li>
            <li>When I inspected the bottles it became apparent that these had been used before.  </li>
            <li>It barely curled at all.</li>
            <li>Second time round, wasn&#x27;t careful enough (ended up with that blister) but it seemed to curl more.</li>
            <li>and if they last the same (normally they are supposed to last about a couple of months, so let&#x27;s see!)</li>
            <li>so im not sure what would go first!</li>
            <li>Another problem I had was even if I curled my lashes with a curler and applied waterproof mascara to hold the curl, they would droop back down to stick straight throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not careful while taking off the rod and did not thoroughly clean off the glue and ended up having a nasty blister on the top of my eyelid!</li>
            <li>Directions are hard to follow so be sure to watch YouTube videos and do a little research.</li>
            <li>and I had to guess that pink liquid for step 1, white for step 2, yellow for step 3, and clear liquid for step 4.</li>

            <li> This helped me to get the lashes better into place, and helped me to avoid getting the product on my upper lashes.</li>
            <li> and it is a first time that i used a product so unprofessional.</li>
            <li> I did not do this the first time I tried using the kit, so my lashes did not come out as curly as I wanted them to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product, would totally recommend.</li>
            <li> First time ever purchasing eyelash perm.</li>
            <li> This is my first time perming my lashes.</li>
            <li> I had heard about it about 2 years ago and was really interested in doing it, but couldn&#x27;t find a salon that provided this service.</li>
            <li> The first time I permed my lashes they came out kinky and &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; shaped because I applied the solution from roots to tips.</li>
            <li> I was obviously very familiar with the process and this was exactly the same kit they used at the spa/salon.  </li>
            <li> i have really straight eyelashes that won&#x27;t curl ever the first time i did it</li>
            <li> Good luck trying to get your refund because you have to spend a fortune to ship it back to China at your own expense for their poor quality item.</li>
            <li> BE SURE TO EVENLY DISTRIBUTE THE FIRST PINK SOLUTION.</li>
            <li> Based on previous review and similar complaints, I went ahead and ordered larger, silicone/plastic ones and it works beautifully!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I just tried it, and it  really works.</li>
            <li> It really works.....</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are sticking straight up and bent to the side, not curled.</li>
            <li> the Putty they refer to as glue would not hold, I threw the whole thing away</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I just finished the whole process</li>
            <li> the results if you follow the directions are WOW!!!</li>
            <li> watched used a product with pink and blue lotion that was like 10 dollars more expensive, but I bought this kit and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> My eyes do water pretty easily, so it took a little bit of trial and error when using this kit.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> have the intention of doing by purchasing the whole kit.the instructions aren&#x27;t so clear.</li>
            <li> The rollers are on the smaller side if you have super long lashes like mine but not to worry, no need to buy a larger size, just be patient and glue the lashes super good with a toothpick and ONLY treat them from root to about mid length, do not go all the way to the top, This way you achieve a nice long curl at the base and not the super curly kinky eyelashes</li>
            <li> Everyone says that the perm rods are too small, and they are quite surprisingly tiny little guys, but I used them anyways and only put the product from the root to halfway up my eyelashes, and I got a perfect curl for my taste, much like what I would always get with an eyelash curler, but now I dont have to use one!</li>
            <li> That is the only thing to keep in mind, other than that, it was smooth, easy, fast, and did not even remotely make my eyes teary or hurt.  </li>
            <li> Its important to know that you MUST order perm rods with this kit unless you have teeny tiny short lashes.</li>
            <li> Instructions aren&#x27;t very clear ,the timing is correct on application thought.</li>
            <li> I wiped it off and wore make up as usual since my eyes looked ok then.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever purchased an item like this, and I totally recommend it.  </li>
            <li> The first and only eyelash perming kit I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Another thing, the rods are too small to create more natural look on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This kit looks like it will last awhile, far cheaper than a salon, and since I&#x27;m doing it myself, I can get my lashes to look exactly how I like.</li>
            <li> one side came gorgeous while other was kinky due to my incompetence to glue lashes properly over curler.  </li>
            <li> The bottles go in order of the process so that makes it easy, starting with the pink and going to the clear at the end.</li>
            <li> 3rd time was a charm with this, and I had to get large rods.</li>
            <li> When removing your eyelashes from the perm rods, use a bunch of the cleaning solution (clear) to remove the eyelash glue from your lashes.</li>
            <li> Clear glue remover.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself as sensitive skin type...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still playing with the time, but so far I&#x27;m up to 30 minutes</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t put this on my eyes on anywhere near my skin.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my sensitive skin, who knows.</li>
            <li> have sensitive eyes and the solution didn&#x27;t irritate them at all, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You must be EXTREMELY careful towards the end of the treatment, especially when you are ready to take off the perming rod!!!</li>
            <li> I did this to my own lashes (though you&#x27;re not supposed to apparently) and it really wasn&#x27;t difficult.</li>
            <li> For most people, these sized rods will make eyelashes curl in on themselves and look ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> - I got a decent curl the last time I did it, but I think I need to up my time another 10 minutes...</li>
            <li> It may be that the rods were too small and I will probably need to order larger ones and a better glue,</li>
            <li> I highly recommend researching how to use this kit properly before you try it out.</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes and thought about lash extensions, but at $250 then $75 for maintenance every other month, that didn&#x27;t fit in my budget.</li>
            <li> When I inspected the bottles it became apparent that these had been used before.  </li>
            <li> It barely curled at all.</li>
            <li> Second time round, wasn&#x27;t careful enough (ended up with that blister) but it seemed to curl more.</li>
            <li> and if they last the same (normally they are supposed to last about a couple of months, so let&#x27;s see!)</li>
            <li> so im not sure what would go first!</li>
            <li> Another problem I had was even if I curled my lashes with a curler and applied waterproof mascara to hold the curl, they would droop back down to stick straight throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not careful while taking off the rod and did not thoroughly clean off the glue and ended up having a nasty blister on the top of my eyelid!</li>
            <li> Directions are hard to follow so be sure to watch YouTube videos and do a little research.</li>
            <li> and I had to guess that pink liquid for step 1, white for step 2, yellow for step 3, and clear liquid for step 4.</li>
            <li> I use the large self stick eyelash curling rods, mediums will have eyelash tips sticking off :/</li>
            <li> The first time round, the treatment only worked partially, possibly due to the insufficient amount of time and experience.</li>
            <li> Anytime this happens to me, I simply take a small amount of pink lotion on my fingers and gently stroke the lotion over the part thats too curled for a minute or two</li>
            <li> Had to Google the instructions though, as the ones included are not very clear.</li>
            <li> Only apply product on center of eyelashes, not the roots or tips.....</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re not allergic to the product, be careful to only apply on your LASHES.</li>
            <li> I have long curl resistant lashes.</li>
            <li> Instructions were not clear at all.</li>
            <li> Directions were not clear.</li>
            <li> This is probably the last time I&#x27;m ordering foreign products...</li>
            <li> There is very hard to read instruction sheet that I followed the first time I used this kit</li>
            <li> My lashes were curled but the bad news is many of my lashes were falling off and going different directions.</li>
            <li> even so the permrods are extremely small... not even babys eyelashes are small enough to fit :\</li>
            <li> It worked...not the first time because I did it wrong, tried it again, glue almost hair by hair, left it longer</li>
            <li> Just be careful and get someone</li>
            <li> my kit missed a lot of roller, one bottle was almost empty, the roll were unglued .i am an esthetician since 25 years</li>
            <li> Should any of the solutions get in your eyes, just dab at your eyes with baby wipes or a wet paper</li>
            <li> Should any of the solutions get in your eyes, just dab at your eyes with baby wipes or a wet paper</li>
            <li> Pink bottler perm solution.</li>
            <li> I recieved it faster than expected</li>
            <li> I do not recomend this product , the glue was old &amp; dry , i email them to get my money back or replace ,they never answer my email, dont waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> The only down side was that the little bottles of solution are not numbered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried eyelash perm kit from other brand and never had any problem.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money spent...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and it is time consuming but</li>
            <li> While doing this, remember to keep your eyes CLOSED!</li>
            <li> While doing this, remember to keep your eyes CLOSED!</li>
            <li> first time I tried the perming system was a big FAIL!</li>
            <li> and it was a major failure.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having trouble affixing your lashes to the perm rods for whatever reason (stick-straight lashes, long lashes, etc.), do not fret!</li>
            <li> Hours later, as I rubbed my eyes to remove makeup off, eyelids hurt pretty bad</li>
            <li> Although it was my fault for not cleaning well enough, the solutions also had an unpleasant smell and make my eye very irritated although it was not in contact with the solution (it didn&#x27;t get in my eye).</li>
            <li> This perm kit will last me at least 6 months if not longer.</li>
            <li> This perm kit will last me at least 6 months if not longer.</li>
            <li> So order extra ones the are thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse baby hairs around my face that I use perm solution to tame.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to apply too much solution to your eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Half of the bottles were all dried up.  </li>
            <li> it was a little curl but</li>
            <li> the only issue is that the curler rods that come with the kit are tooooo thin, you need to use thicker rods.</li>
            <li> I used it a few hours ago, and I did have some problems with the kit.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having trouble affixing your lashes to the perm rod</li>
            <li> Arrived with one pink bottle broken - which is the perm solution.  </li>
            <li> I have been curling my lashes permanently for the past 20 years, since I was 14 and always spending about $100  each time to have them done.  </li>
            <li> and the results were the same if not better!!!!  </li>
            <li> WAY TOO small.</li>
            <li> The ones it comes with are too small.</li>
            <li> The rods are too small.</li>
            <li> waited a few days to redo the perm and straighten out the ends of my lashes and VOILA!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> When I finally got about half my lashes stuck to the rod and applied the perming solution, my eyelid started itching really badly after a few minutes</li>
            <li> Hard to use</li>
            <li> Athens instructions were a little confused.</li>
            <li> However, the eye putti bottle had completely dried up and is unusable and the little eyelash strips were useless because they didnt stick to my eyelid or my lashes.</li>
            <li> Deserves negative 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Then, when removing the lashes from the perm rods, roll the perm rods downwards slowly.</li>

            <li> Not satisfied at all!</li>
            <li> I think the biggest reason for failure of this kit is the lack of/poor instructions.</li>
            <li> rods that come with kit, are waaay to thin.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this product.</li>

            <li> but I was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be complicated</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of doing this step with my eyes open, and holy crap my eyes burned!</li>
            <li> This was the least painful way for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> No english instructions only chinese I think,  not even numbered bottles! Not satisfied at all!</li>
            <li> Works great I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Permed my lashes for the first time with this and they came out great. Had to Google the instructions though, as the ones included are not very clear.</li>
            <li> No instructions. Didn&#x27;t work out to well for me even after I found instructions online. It made one of my eyes swollen. Never using it again.</li>
            <li> I think this is the same kit used at the place I go to get lash perm.  Shipped from asia.  I&#x27;ve use one time myself perming both sides same time and one side came gorgeous while other was kinky due to my incompetence to glue lashes properly over curler.  Next time will try to get another person to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Risky business perming lashes. Do full research like watch how to videos, etc.  Caution.</li>
            <li> This works. Best part when you put mascara on they stay up :3 My fellow mascara-users know what I am talking about :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you need to get the eyelashes to go the right direction other wise you will have funky lashes for a while D:</li>
            <li> I just want to share my experience with people who are thinking about this product.  I&#x27;ve tried eyelash perm kit from other brand and never had any problem.  However, unfortunately, this product stung my eyelids.  I wiped it off and wore make up as usual since my eyes looked ok then.  Hours later, as I rubbed my eyes to remove makeup off, eyelids hurt pretty bad and I noticed there was a blister on each eyelid....  I don&#x27;t consider myself as sensitive skin type...  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR SAFETY REASON!</li>
            <li> Opened the package aND realized the box had been opened before.  When I inspected the bottles it became apparent that these had been used before.  This day and age I could not apply this to my eye knowing someone could have tampered with the chemicals.  threw mine in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Hard to use.. Need so much patience but works good...i went to youtube for the instructions..</li>
            <li> good product the only  problem is that bottles are not number</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Aight if you know how to use it. Just be careful and get someone tp do them for you.</li>
            <li> worked great. def. need to buy thicker rods. rods that come with kit, are waaay to thin. I prefer the silicone.</li>
            <li> The rollers and glue are a joke!!! I had to buy the Dolly&#x27;s glue and silicon pads. I then tried it using the perm solution from this kit. It barely curled at all. I don&#x27;t think it worked very well. The caveat to this is I have never tried a different solution, so I don&#x27;t know if there is a better one. But I&#x27;m pretty sure there has got to be, because I had mine professionally permed before and they were really curled! I wish I had of bought a different solution as well.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE, however product is not awesome.  Arrived with one pink bottle broken - which is the perm solution.  Directions on the back say anywhere from 10-18 minutes... I&#x27;m still playing with the time, but so far I&#x27;m up to 30 minutes - I got a decent curl the last time I did it, but I think I need to up my time another 10 minutes... very time consuming with that kind of time bc, you have to do it with each step.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PACKAGE! NO INSTRUCTIONS. DONT BUY</li>
            <li> The product is good. No irritation on my skin. It does a good job on my eyelashes and last for more than a month. However, the bottles do not have number on it and I had to guess that pink liquid for step 1, white for step 2, yellow for step 3, and clear liquid for step 4. Another thing, the rods are too small to create more natural look on my eyelashes. So here&#x27;s my trick: I wrapped the rod with double sided tape to have a bigger rod!</li>
            <li> I had no instructions</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever purchased an item like this, and I totally recommend it.  I just tried it, and it  really works. I&#x27;m super happy with this bought, I would totally buy it again!</li>
            <li> Yes. My lashes were curled but the bad news is many of my lashes were falling off and going different directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t use this on my eyelashes. I have thick coarse baby hairs around my face that I use perm solution to tame. I have used other eyelash perm solutions and they work beautifully. This one managed to break off the chunks of hair around my face. Mind you this is head hair not eyelashes.</li>
            <li> even though I followed the times suggested I didn&#x27;t see the results I would see if I curled my lashes with a lash curler. It did give a lift but not a curl. I am going to try to leave it on longer than suggested and hope that it shows better results.</li>
            <li> It really works..... the only issue is that the curler rods that come with the kit are tooooo thin, you need to use thicker rods. So order extra ones the are thick.My eyelashes are sticking straight up and bent to the side, not curled. I will try bigger rods next time. Instructions aren&#x27;t very clear ,the timing is correct on application thought. Bottles are in order of use. Only apply product on center of eyelashes, not the roots or tips.....that was my problem. I searched YouTube videos for help.</li>
            <li> Great product. Worked great. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It kind of worked but I was difficult to use. Instructions were not clear at all. I had to look at countless of videos on YouTube to learn how to do it. Not worth the money spent...I should of paid more for a better product. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The first and only eyelash perming kit I have ever purchased. All the reviews and videos I&#x27;ve read/watched used a product with pink and blue lotion that was like 10 dollars more expensive, but I bought this kit and it works perfectly. I use the large self stick eyelash curling rods, mediums will have eyelash tips sticking off :/ This is a great kit, and I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just a tip out there for first timers, sometimes you might have an experience where you find they are too curly, hitting the eyelid and that can be annoying. Anytime this happens to me, I simply take a small amount of pink lotion on my fingers and gently stroke the lotion over the part thats too curled for a minute or two and it keeps the curl while getting any kinks out--be sure to rinse any residue off from your lashes after. :)</li>
            <li> Very nice eye lashes!Amazing results.</li>
            <li> I am rushing to the computer to write this review because I need the world to know how amazing this product is.  I have been curling my lashes permanently for the past 20 years, since I was 14 and always spending about $100  each time to have them done.  I was obviously very familiar with the process and this was exactly the same kit they used at the spa/salon.  Since I had experienced/seen how they did it I decided to try it myself.  I did it myself for the very first time without expectations, thinking that I was going to need a lot of practice to achieve the results I get from the spa. NOT AT ALL!  They came out looking perfect!!!! I am so glad!  IMPORTANT TIP: The rollers are on the smaller side if you have super long lashes like mine but not to worry, no need to buy a larger size, just be patient and glue the lashes super good with a toothpick and ONLY treat them from root to about mid length, do not go all the way to the top, This way you achieve a nice long curl at the base and not the super curly kinky eyelashes you don&#x27;t want to sport.  That is the only thing to keep in mind, other than that, it was smooth, easy, fast, and did not even remotely make my eyes teary or hurt.  I thought it was going to be complicated but it was a price I was willing to pay in order to save some bucks but not at all, it was a lot easier to do it at home and the results were the same if not better!!!!  I will however post again in a couple of weeks to let y&#x27;all know if they are still intact and if they last the same (normally they are supposed to last about a couple of months, so let&#x27;s see!)</li>
            <li> Needs better instructions. Bottles need to be numbered</li>
            <li> This is a great product...good quality. .I wish they give you the instructions to use it and also a faster deliver. .the price good ..the quality excellent. ..I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li> This was my first time using the perm kit the rolls were not big enough. There was only one size. Plus the glue did not hold. Was not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. My first eyelash perm experience and exactly what I was hoping for. It shipped from China so be patient with the shipping time, but considering, it came extremely quickly, a good 15 days before the soonest day that Amazon said it was to be delivered. The bottles go in order of the process so that makes it easy, starting with the pink and going to the clear at the end. I did this to my own lashes (though you&#x27;re not supposed to apparently) and it really wasn&#x27;t difficult. I didnt get any into my eyes, because I can imagine that would be painful but there was no pain, stinging, or irritation whatsoever! Everyone says that the perm rods are too small, and they are quite surprisingly tiny little guys, but I used them anyways and only put the product from the root to halfway up my eyelashes, and I got a perfect curl for my taste, much like what I would always get with an eyelash curler, but now I dont have to use one! My lashes are quite long, and I did have trouble getting them to stick to the rods at first, but what I did was get them to stick as best as possible and put another rod on top, sandwiching the upper lashes in between. This helped me to get the lashes better into place, and helped me to avoid getting the product on my upper lashes. Ive heard horror stories of eyelash perms ending in eyelashes being curled around themselves, but if you dont get product on the upper lashes, that won&#x27;t happen. This kit looks like it will last awhile, far cheaper than a salon, and since I&#x27;m doing it myself, I can get my lashes to look exactly how I like. Im definitely most impressed.</li>
            <li> the product/solutions are wonderful. My only issue with this kit is the rods. WAY TOO small. Based on previous review and similar complaints, I went ahead and ordered larger, silicone/plastic ones and it works beautifully!</li>
            <li> awesome! i have really straight eyelashes that won&#x27;t curl ever the first time i did it it was a little curl but second time curled perfect!&lt;br /&gt;careful chemical can burn your skin</li>
            <li> It worked...not the first time because I did it wrong, tried it again, glue almost hair by hair, left it longer that I was supposed to (I guess I needed that too,...I do not recommend because who knows what may happen) but it worked, I am so excited, it saves time when I apply mascara...when I swim they are looking nice all the time...loved it</li>
            <li> Deserves negative 5 stars.  That is how bad it is.  Do not buy this item.  This item ships from China, takes forever to get here.  No instructions.  The item pictured color jars does not match what I received.  Half of the bottles were all dried up.  I wouldn&#x27;t put this on my eyes on anywhere near my skin.  Good luck trying to get your refund because you have to spend a fortune to ship it back to China at your own expense for their poor quality item.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and it is time consuming but the results if you follow the directions are WOW!!!</li>
            <li> the worst product that i never bought!!!!!! my kit missed a lot of roller, one bottle was almost empty, the roll were unglued .i am an esthetician since 25 years and it is a first time that i used a product so unprofessional.</li>
            <li> Alright! I&#x27;d definitely been looking forward to using this product ever since I ordered it a week or two back. I used it a few hours ago, and I did have some problems with the kit. However, this is not at the fault of the manufacturer: this was due to my own mistakes! Here are some tips/warnings to consider while perming your lashes with this kit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• If your eyes tend to water easily, brace yourself! My eyes do water pretty easily, so it took a little bit of trial and error when using this kit. Just use a mirror in a brightly lit room and go slowly so you don&#x27;t poke yourself. :)&lt;br /&gt;• Place the eyelash roller as close as you can to the lashline! I did not do this the first time I tried using the kit, so my lashes did not come out as curly as I wanted them to.&lt;br /&gt;• If you&#x27;re having trouble affixing your lashes to the perm rods for whatever reason (stick-straight lashes, long lashes, etc.), do not fret! Curl your lashes beforehand with a standard eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;• If your lashes are stick-straight like mine, leave each solution on your lashes for the maximum time as disclosed by the instructions. Trust me, it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;• As others have said before, apply each of the solutions only about halfway up each lash starting from the root. If you apply each solution from root to tip, you may end up with too kinky of a curl for your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;• If you&#x27;re having trouble affixing your lashes to the perm rod and/or applying each of the solutions to your lashes, use either your finger or a q-tip to affix your lashes and/or to apply each of the solutions to your lashes. I find it works best when I use my finger to affix my lashes to the perm rods and a q-tip when applying each solution to my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;• Don&#x27;t be afraid to apply too much solution to your eyelashes! It worked a lot better for me when I applied too much solution to my lashes versus not enough.&lt;br /&gt;• When removing your eyelashes from the perm rods, use a bunch of the cleaning solution (clear) to remove the eyelash glue from your lashes. While doing this, remember to keep your eyes CLOSED! I made the mistake of doing this step with my eyes open, and holy crap my eyes burned! Should any of the solutions get in your eyes, just dab at your eyes with baby wipes or a wet paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;• Another tip for removal: I find it helpful to rub my eyelashes a bit with my finger to loosen them from the perm rods. Then, when removing the lashes from the perm rods, roll the perm rods downwards slowly. This was the least painful way for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I made these changes to my routine, I came out with beautiful curls to my eyelashes! Love this product, would totally recommend. :)ear) to remove the eyelash glue from your lashes. While doing this, remember to keep your eyes CLOSED!

            <li> Works well but know what your doing. The hardest part is glueing the eyelashes to the curling sponges, everything else is easy.</li>
            <li> Did. Not work :(the Putty they refer to as glue would not hold, I threw the whole thing away</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get my lashes to stick to the tiny perming rods at all. The putty/glue included didn&#x27;t work. When I finally got about half my lashes stuck to the rod and applied the perming solution, my eyelid started itching really badly after a few minutes so I took the rods off and washed my eyes. Now I&#x27;m just worried my lashes will start to fall out. Probably going to throw this thing away.</li>
            <li> I havent even tried it cause the solution is not labeled so im not sure what would go first! Ive been having it for about a week....even so the permrods are extremely small... not even babys eyelashes are small enough to fit :\</li>
            <li> Okay this thing burned the living s*** out of my eyes. I still have burn marks on my lash line from where I applied the product. For those of you who are trying the product for the first time, test some on your wrist before using!! Maybe this product might work for you, but it did not for me. Maybe it&#x27;s my sensitive skin, who knows. Even if you&#x27;re not allergic to the product, be careful to only apply on your LASHES. For me, once the tiniest drop hit my eyelid, it burned like craaaazy. This is probably the last time I&#x27;m ordering foreign products... chinese products with instructions that make 0 sense are sketchy af anyways...</li>
            <li> 3rd time was a charm with this, and I had to get large rods. The ones it comes with are too small. Directions are hard to follow so be sure to watch YouTube videos and do a little research. Now my lashes look fabulous!</li>
            <li> First time ever purchasing eyelash perm. Permed my own lashes turned out great. The only down side was that the little bottles of solution are not numbered. Directions were not clear. I had to do research to figure out the steps. Pink bottler perm solution. White neutralizer. Yellow eyelash conditioner. Clear glue remover. I will purchase this products again.</li>
            <li> I was so exciting when I got this in the mail. Shipping was fast. The putti is not so good as it takes long for eyebrows to stick to the rod. The rods are too small. I just finished the whole process and I&#x27;m disappointed with the results. It may be that the rods were too small and I will probably need to order larger ones and a better glue, which I didm;t have the intention of doing by purchasing the whole kit.the instructions aren&#x27;t so clear.</li>
            <li> This is my first time perming my lashes. I had heard about it about 2 years ago and was really interested in doing it, but couldn&#x27;t find a salon that provided this service. I already have long lashes and thought about lash extensions, but at $250 then $75 for maintenance every other month, that didn&#x27;t fit in my budget. So I started looking for some eyelash perm kits at a descent/reasonable price and this fit in perfectly. The package is shipped from Asia so be prepared to wait about 2 1/2 weeks for it to come in. I didn&#x27;t mind since it was free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;This eyelash perming system is just what I needed! My lower lashes always intertwine with my upper lashes on the outer corners and this has ended that problem. I get compliments from EVERYONE asking if I had lash extensions or if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes! Perming my lashes has actually enhanced my lower lashes, also! Another problem I had was even if I curled my lashes with a curler and applied waterproof mascara to hold the curl, they would droop back down to stick straight throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried the perming system was a big FAIL! BECAUSE OF USER ERROR, not the product! I was applying the perming solution from roots to tips when you should only be applying the solutions to the roots of your lashes or halfway before the perm rod ends. The first time I permed my lashes they came out kinky and &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; shaped because I applied the solution from roots to tips. So I know the product works, I just needed to tweak how I applied it! &#x3D;P&lt;br /&gt;I waited a few days to redo the perm and straighten out the ends of my lashes and VOILA! Butterfly effect lashes! YAY!&lt;br /&gt;I still use an eyelash curler at the root to give my eyelashes a little boost then apply my mascara and they stay fanned out and beautiful ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive eyes and the solution didn&#x27;t irritate them at all, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve permed my lashes and the curl is still beautifully intact! This perm kit will last me at least 6 months if not longer. All in all, this was just what I needed and I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase! &#x3D;)tact!

            <li> Athens instructions were a little confused. However, you can follow instructions in YouTube. The product works perfect.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal.  This had great reviews, however.... for most people its not usable as it arrives.  It only includes the smallest perm rods.  For most people, these sized rods will make eyelashes curl in on themselves and look ridiculous.  Its important to know that you MUST order perm rods with this kit unless you have teeny tiny short lashes.</li>
            <li> I recieved it faster than expected so that was nice. However, the eye putti bottle had completely dried up and is unusable and the little eyelash strips were useless because they didnt stick to my eyelid or my lashes. :/ so I cant even use the perm because of that. Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I do not recomend this product , the glue was old &amp; dry , i email them to get my money back or replace ,they never answer my email, dont waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> I think the biggest reason for failure of this kit is the lack of/poor instructions. There is very hard to read instruction sheet that I followed the first time I used this kit and it was a major failure. I decided to to watch some tutorials on Youtube so I could actually perform the procedure correctly, and it was a great success. I highly recommend researching how to use this kit properly before you try it out. I thought I could wing it and was wrong. The picture I am including is after performing the perm with no makeup/mascara. I have long curl resistant lashes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Great results.</li>
            <li> works like a charm, and extremely cheap i can probably get about 10-15 use from this kit. the trick is to NOT put the perming solution ALL the way to the top of your lashes or else itll be kinky. Just apply it to the roots or to mid length of your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> You must be EXTREMELY careful towards the end of the treatment, especially when you are ready to take off the perming rod!!! I was not careful while taking off the rod and did not thoroughly clean off the glue and ended up having a nasty blister on the top of my eyelid! Although it was my fault for not cleaning well enough, the solutions also had an unpleasant smell and make my eye very irritated although it was not in contact with the solution (it didn&#x27;t get in my eye). The first time round, the treatment only worked partially, possibly due to the insufficient amount of time and experience. Second time round, wasn&#x27;t careful enough (ended up with that blister) but it seemed to curl more. BE SURE TO EVENLY DISTRIBUTE THE FIRST PINK SOLUTION. The amount does matter!! The more you put on one area, the more it&#x27;ll curl!</li>
