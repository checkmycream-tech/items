            <li>I love this lotion and will purchase again .</li>
            <li>This is my favorite</li>
            <li>They sell this at the Ritz-Carlton in Buckhead, GA and my wife fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SCENT...</li>
            <li>Love this lotion...put it on and there is no need for cologne or perfume...</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t give it more than a 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more</li>
            <li>I love the scent so fresh and clean!!</li>
            <li>The six mini bottles make the product easy to use and to take with you if you travel</li>
            <li>It got to my house super quick and am completely satisfied!</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and leaves NO slippery feel on your hands or body.</li>
            <li>enjoy it so</li>
            <li>a light, clean, luscious smell that brings me compliments every time I wear it...</li>
            <li>&#x27;s all in the smell, and there&#x27;s something about the smell of these bottles that doesn&#x27;t match with what I remember of the original.</li>
            <li>I love the gentle clean smell.</li>
            <li>Got this on a recent trip to Cancun and loved it so much I had to buy some more when I got home.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers and rinses well and has a fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li>I dont know why the reviews on here said that it smells great when in reality it really doesnt smell anything like white tea.</li>
            <li>It still smells lovely, but could be that mine was old.</li>
            <li>Also,  leaves skin very very shiny if that is the look you want.  </li>
            <li>I also have the fragrance but just the lotion is enough for most days...</li>
            <li>It rather easy for it to pop open.  </li>
            <li>but when i open it  it smell like smoke mix with a strong scent of  flowers.</li>
            <li>the smell is not as strong as ive had tried the same brand from one my friends</li>
            <li>perfume is used in very high end</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy but it not to be used as a real moisturizer.</li>
            <li>even bought another bottle from a different company, and it confirmed my thoughts.</li>
            <li>You need to get the Black, because its a better body lotion.</li>
            <li>There is also a flip top but it does not snap tight.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is more heavily scented.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My friend keeps this at work and rubs a little on her wrist occasionally especially during &amp;#34;trying times&amp;#34; says it takes her to another dimension, it is so elegant and clean at the same time, I do not intend to be without it.</li>
            <li>The smell is very fresh and last a long time even after washing my hands!</li>
            <li>The smell is not as clean as bvlgari black.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of all the Bvlagri scents (Green Tea is a close second).</li>

            <li> it almost seems like whoever worked @the hotel&lt;br /&gt; grabbed a bunch of bottles after they were empty</li>
            <li> ever so slightly simple.&lt;br</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s very odd.</li>

            <li> I agree with the nay-sayers that it seems someone had empty bottles and just put ordinary lotion in. There is almost no scent and I can smell even very faint scents. Would not buy again. Also,  leaves skin very very shiny if that is the look you want.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> hubby loves this for his face.. a great lotion..</li>
            <li> I hate it. this is the worst smell that i ever tried. I dont know why the reviews on here said that it smells great when in reality it really doesnt smell anything like white tea. I brought this lotion thinking it was going to smell like wonderful. when I recdeived it, it was in good condition but when i open it  it smell like smoke mix with a strong scent of  flowers.</li>
            <li> I bought 1 of these  bottles before and them i saw this 6 bottles for $20 and im like i must  buy! The smell is very fresh and last a long time even after washing my hands! Definitely looking to buy the perfume! A must have! Always in my purse! It got to my house super quick and am completely satisfied! Will buy again from this seller! Awsome! and these make perfect gifts.</li>
            <li> I had used this soap in a luxury hotel and loved the smell. The soap lathers and rinses well and has a fresh clean smell. The lotion is more heavily scented.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> The cap does not screw on tight.  There is also a flip top but it does not snap tight.  It rather easy for it to pop open.  Lotion ended up leaking out.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion and scent since I stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Orlando in 2007. This was supplied in the rooms. It&#x27;s a light, non-invasive scent threat is attractive without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love it and great for traveling too.  This is my absoluted favorite perfume lotion.  What more can I say...smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love the product. The six mini bottles make the product easy to use and to take with you if you travel</li>

            <li> the smell is not as strong as ive had tried the same brand from one my friends</li>
            <li> They sell this at the Ritz-Carlton in Buckhead, GA and my wife fell in love with the scent. A drop of this and it&#x27;s like being transported back to the Ritz.</li>
            <li> I wear this a lot without layering. It&#x27;s not greasy but it not to be used as a real moisturizer. I LOVE THE SCENT...and so does everyone that I walk by</li>
            <li> Quality of the scent seems to have gone downhill.  It still smells lovely, but could be that mine was old.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion...put it on and there is no need for cologne or perfume...a light, clean, luscious smell that brings me compliments every time I wear it...enjoy it so, I bought the Lot of 6 bottles so that I could share with friends!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product while on vacation in Mexico this year. The hotel provided shampoo, body wash and lotion ...I love the gentle clean smell. To me way more sexy than overpowering perfumes!</li>
            <li> Not close to the Black in comparison! The smell is not as clean as bvlgari black. You need to get the Black, because its a better body lotion.</li>
            <li> That being said I never tried the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this along with a different order of shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;received all of them...&lt;br /&gt;love the shampoo... conditioner is okay.&lt;br /&gt;however the lotion doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.&lt;br /&gt;this perfume is used in very high end hotels.&lt;br /&gt; it almost seems like whoever worked @the hotel&lt;br /&gt; grabbed a bunch of bottles after they were empty&lt;br /&gt; &amp; put plain lotion in them &amp; sold them.  it&#x27;s very odd.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t decide of this is fake or not. So I can&#x27;t give it more than a 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all in the smell, and there&#x27;s something about the smell of these bottles that doesn&#x27;t match with what I remember of the original. Something ever so slightly simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even bought another bottle from a different company, and it confirmed my thoughts. However, it smells good.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of all the Bvlagri scents (Green Tea is a close second). I constantly get stopped and people always ask me what I&#x27;m wearing... I love it! Will be ordering more</li>
            <li> Got this on a recent trip to Cancun and loved it so much I had to buy some more when I got home. So happy that Amazon carries it so I won&#x27;t ever run out. I love this!</li>
