            <li>this is a great product, it works.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>very nice cream</li>
            <li>Not even that good of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t see any visible good result.  </li>
            <li>Good quality &amp; speedy delivery</li>
            <li>i will try to do a update in the coming months to see if i&#x27;m still getting good results.</li>
            <li>I love!  </li>
            <li>I love this cream!</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The cream feels nice, but it doesn&#x27;t have SPF</li>
            <li>I make  my own lotions</li>
            <li>So far, it feels real good on my face.  </li>
            <li>the first time I wore it , someone commented on my skin looking great.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Feels OK on my face</li>
            <li>Having worked in the beauty and spa world for many years, I have sampled many skin cremes.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to purchase more but at the time it was unavailable</li>
            <li>I never thought I would be able to say my skin looks better, but it does.</li>
            <li>However I believe most people; once they&#x27;ve tried it will find out</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>and I love the effect on my face.</li>
            <li>I am sure i will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gotten more so.</li>
            <li>I think I need more time</li>
            <li>It feels great, and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I stumbled upon &#x27;Kakadu&#x27;, and it has taken the place of my tried and true day creme!</li>
            <li>It did show some signs of improvement on fine lines of the neck without any problems.  </li>
            <li>My face is smoother and the fine lines are softer.</li>
            <li>and it did not seem to be super magical.</li>
            <li>I HAVE TO SAY MY SKIN LOOKS SMOOTH AND LUMINOUS AND</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read different articles on how best to gently treat it and read about this product and thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li>it Absorbed well and not Greasy!</li>
            <li>This did not seem worth the huge price.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and absorbs very well without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>--I didn&#x27;t even get two weeks worth of use out of it.  </li>
            <li>Will buy large size when this is gone!</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>it stays exactly where you place it almost as though all of the&lt;br /&gt;moisture</li>
            <li>I purchased the larger bottle and now wish I would have purchased more.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for dark spots on face, used it every day till it was gone, Great service as far as me getting it,</li>
            <li>It smells funny and there really isn&#x27;t much at all for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>It was good, but I am not sure the bottle was with fill up, finish in a week of start using it.</li>
            <li>It would be hard to know if it was any good.</li>
            <li>I used a whole bottle, and there was no noticeable change whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Really expected a lot more from this,  i guess the power of the word took me in.</li>
            <li>and I am now tempted to try the whole line of skin-care.</li>
            <li>I tried for a month,  I did not see much improvrment</li>
            <li>Okay, but didn&#x27;t perform as well as I had expected.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I think it just takes longer for my skin to obsorb the product, because I really am seeing some results.  </li>
            <li>Just recently my daily moisturizer I had been using for many years changed their formula and it did not agree with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Did not completely eliminate them but did fade significantly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, absorbs really well and makes my skin incredibly soft and supple.</li>
            <li>This small size should last most people for more than a couple weeks, if applied properly.</li>
            <li>In all reality haven&#x27;t we all wasted 16.00 on something more than once?</li>
            <li>Myself I would rather pay 16.00 for a small bottle of this face cream that gives you nice benefits than eating out at a fast food place, which usually doesn&#x27;t leave you with nice benefits, yet the prices are very similar.  </li>
            <li>When I saw it yesterday I did some price figuring and found the larger bottle isn&#x27;t any more expensive than other fine skin creams, yet it works better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s money not wasted.</li>
            <li>Very soothing especially around eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>and I know what rani old lotion smells like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything you would want in a day creme ( light, silky, not greasy) and has a delicate soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>Be aware this is a tiny almost sample size bottle, My own fault really I should have checked the oz but seems very expensive for such a minuscule amount</li>
            <li>I recognize the unique ingredients and how the cream is crafted, but still find the travel size small for a travel size.</li>
            <li>Light and airy I will up date later not sure if it works yet just started it today.</li>
            <li>As for dark spots , however, it didn&#x27;t do much to fade them.</li>
            <li>and I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with my dark spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had sensitive dry skin and</li>
            <li>and now i will buy a large bottle, a little pricey</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any changes and you get so very little can&#x27;t really use it long enough to review.  </li>
            <li> i have spent hundreds trying all kinds of skin creams and natural treatments for for dark spots nothing has worked,until i tried this</li>
            <li> The texture is not soft going on the skin.</li>
            <li> Only starting using it, it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> There was less than 1 week of cream in that tiny container.</li>
            <li> i am a black female with hyperpigmentation .</li>
            <li> This is a current review of the Kakadu Day Cream previously reviewed.  </li>
            <li> This product did not lighten dark spots on the skin after two months of use and as a moisturizer any other product would do the same.</li>
            <li> Expensive and not enough to really know if it works</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not much of a day cream.</li>
            <li> Part of my problem is that I am 74 years with a few deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Too pricey for such a small amount, and have not seen any difference.</li>
            <li> If does not burn my eyes like other products</li>
            <li> I had a dark spot on my cheek and the other day</li>
            <li> I AM REVIEWING MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK DUE</li>
            <li> For me, the cost of this product is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not useful at all.</li>
            <li> Have run out and think I am seeing dark spots returning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the small .33 fluid ounce size for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Product did nothing to eliminate dark spots</li>
            <li> MY DARK SPOT IS A FEW SHADES LIGHTER.</li>
            <li> Being skeptical, I only ordered this small &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; size and let me tell you, it&#x27;s totally lived up to everything I read</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Small bottle, the jury is still out on this one</li>
            <li> If someone was deciding whether or not to try it, I would say purchase the small bottle and try it.</li>
            <li> almost immediately i bought the small bottle</li>
            <li> I like the cream, but it is really small for the price.  </li>
            <li> again I am not sure what to expect.. have not noticed any change.</li>
            <li> over a three month period i have seen the spots slowly fading away, it will not work over night but will start to see it start a difference</li>
            <li> and I have very small sun spots after a week</li>
            <li> There was a very small amount and it came out in weird spurts.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, this product didn&#x27;t work out for me.  </li>
            <li> Sad sad sad</li>
            <li> Very very expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product after hearing and reading such&lt;br /&gt;great reviews about it.</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> a use bottle l were very very disappointed</li>

            <li> Small bottle, the jury is still out on this one</li>
            <li> This really works!  Will buy large size when this is gone!</li>
            <li> The cream feels nice, but it doesn&#x27;t have SPF so it&#x27;s not much of a day cream. I bought this size so I could try it--I didn&#x27;t even get two weeks worth of use out of it.  It&#x27;s tiny.</li>
            <li> Great.  Healed up a cut I had for quite a while.  Also helps remove age spots</li>
            <li> Too pricey for such a small amount, and have not seen any difference.</li>
            <li> Only starting using it, it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> It is awesome!  I had a dark spot on my cheek and the other day&lt;br /&gt;I had to look twice while putting the day cream.  It is my ch lighter and softer too. Buying for myself and mother-in-law.</li>
            <li> I have only used this couple of times, it seems to work!</li>
            <li> I love!  I am going to order a bigger size.</li>
            <li> As an indoor moisturizer, it&#x27;s great. I have acne prone skin, and this product didn&#x27;t make me break out. As for dark spots , however, it didn&#x27;t do much to fade them. I used a whole bottle, and there was no noticeable change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any changes and you get so very little can&#x27;t really use it long enough to review.  Very very expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, this product didn&#x27;t work out for me.  I have facial sensitivity and I started to have break outs.  I had to stop using it and do a purification process on my face which is now clearing up.  It did show some signs of improvement on fine lines of the neck without any problems.  For me, the cost of this product is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product after hearing and reading such&lt;br /&gt;great reviews about it. The texture is not soft going on the skin. Once&lt;br /&gt;applied it stays exactly where you place it almost as though all of the&lt;br /&gt;moisture in it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of money was lost.</li>
            <li> it Absorbed well and not Greasy! I like it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything at all. Not even that good of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It was good, but I am not sure the bottle was with fill up, finish in a week of start using it.</li>
            <li> There was less than 1 week of cream in that tiny container. It would be hard to know if it was any good.</li>
            <li> used the entire bottle did not work or even fade my spots.</li>
            <li> GREAT DAY CREAM WIFE LOVES IT...&lt;br /&gt;WILL ORDER AGAIN...THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for post sun exposure</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell how well the product worked.  There wasn&#x27;t enough in container (which had been altered internally to hold a fraction of what the outside container looked like it held) to get any results.</li>
            <li> Be aware this is a tiny almost sample size bottle, My own fault really I should have checked the oz but seems very expensive for such a minuscule amount</li>
            <li> Expensive and not enough to really know if it works</li>
            <li> I love this cream. Not greasy, absorbs really well and makes my skin incredibly soft and supple. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Feels OK on my face but I can&#x27;t see any visible good result.  Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It smells funny and there really isn&#x27;t much at all for the price you pay. Tried it, moving on to something else.</li>
            <li> Really expected a lot more from this,  i guess the power of the word took me in. Not useful at all.</li>
            <li> the amount I bought was not enough to make or notice a difference. But I will try it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with my dark spots. It does leave my skin looking dewy  but I have to put on a tiny bit of not I feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I am using this cream for 3 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> Having worked in the beauty and spa world for many years, I have sampled many skin cremes. Just recently my daily moisturizer I had been using for many years changed their formula and it did not agree with my sensitive skin. Fortunately I stumbled upon &#x27;Kakadu&#x27;, and it has taken the place of my tried and true day creme! It&#x27;s everything you would want in a day creme ( light, silky, not greasy) and has a delicate soft fragrance. My skin seems to love it and I am now tempted to try the whole line of skin-care.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week twice a day and I have very small sun spots after a week they are still the same I am hoping to see changes in the next week</li>
            <li> Very tiny.  There was a very small amount and it came out in weird spurts.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Have run out and think I am seeing dark spots returning. Did not completely eliminate them but did fade significantly.</li>
            <li> first, I was sure I ordered a one ounce not a .33 oz; I used it up in 2 weeks and it did nothing; am a bit disappointed</li>
            <li> I tried for a month,  I did not see much improvrment</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing.  I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading about the benefits of the Kakadu Plum. I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve had the small .33 fluid ounce size for a few weeks and it&#x27;s not all gone yet. This small size should last most people for more than a couple weeks, if applied properly. I wanted to purchase more but at the time it was unavailable and I was very disappointed. When I saw it yesterday I did some price figuring and found the larger bottle isn&#x27;t any more expensive than other fine skin creams, yet it works better. I purchased the larger bottle and now wish I would have purchased more. It glides on smoothly and absorbs very well without a greasy feeling. I never thought I would be able to say my skin looks better, but it does. The Kakadu produces an overall even appearance. My face is smoother and the fine lines are softer. If someone was deciding whether or not to try it, I would say purchase the small bottle and try it. In all reality haven&#x27;t we all wasted 16.00 on something more than once? However I believe most people; once they&#x27;ve tried it will find out it&#x27;s money not wasted. Myself I would rather pay 16.00 for a small bottle of this face cream that gives you nice benefits than eating out at a fast food place, which usually doesn&#x27;t leave you with nice benefits, yet the prices are very similar.  Think about that and weigh the two options, chances are you&#x27;ll agree.</li>
            <li> Very soothing especially around eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Good quality &amp; speedy delivery</li>
            <li> This product did not lighten dark spots on the skin after two months of use and as a moisturizer any other product would do the same.</li>
            <li> The cream only last for only a couple days I for was I pay for could have last a month of to that make me thing I got a use bottle l were very very disappointed</li>
            <li> Okay, but didn&#x27;t perform as well as I had expected.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It feels great, and makes my skin feel so soft. the first time I wore it , someone commented on my skin looking great. Great product. !</li>
            <li> i have been using Yurrku kakadu day cream for 2 weeks now and I love the effect on my face. my complexion is clearer and my skin feels smoother. i am using it in the morning and at night before my moisturizer. one of the best cream I have used. i highly recommend it. I am sure i will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> I AM REVIEWING MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK DUE TO THE FACT THAT YURRKU SENT ME A BIG BOTTLE OF THE KAKADU DAY CREAM FOR ME TO TRY IT. I HAVE TO SAY MY SKIN LOOKS SMOOTH AND LUMINOUS AND MY DARK SPOT IS A FEW SHADES LIGHTER.</li>
            <li> Feels good! smells good! seems to be working!</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> This did not seem worth the huge price. There is just a tiny amount and it did not seem to be super magical.</li>
            <li> I had just started using this..  So far, it feels real good on my face.  Thank you for another great product.</li>
            <li> Havent&#x27; noticed any changes at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive dry skin and as I age, darn it, it&#x27;s gotten more so. I&#x27;d read different articles on how best to gently treat it and read about this product and thought I&#x27;d try it. Being skeptical, I only ordered this small &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; size and let me tell you, it&#x27;s totally lived up to everything I read and then some. I love this cream! My skin feels like it did 20 years ago and I&#x27;ve already purchased the larger size!</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer, in a handy travel-size bottle.  Moisturizes for hours, my skin doesn&#x27;t chap or peel when I am wearing this.</li>
            <li> very nice cream and does what it says it will do</li>
            <li> Product did nothing to eliminate dark spots</li>
            <li> Lotion smells rancid. I make  my own lotions and I know what rani old lotion smells like. Sad sad sad</li>
            <li> this is a great product, it works. i have spent hundreds trying all kinds of skin creams and natural treatments for for dark spots nothing has worked,until i tried this, it works. i would advise anyone to use this.  i am a black female with hyperpigmentation . over a three month period i have seen the spots slowly fading away, it will not work over night but will start to see it start a difference almost immediately i bought the small bottle and now i will buy a large bottle, a little pricey but i don&#x27;t mind if works. i will try to do a update in the coming months to see if i&#x27;m still getting good results.</li>
            <li> I think I need more time</li>
            <li> Light and airy I will up date later not sure if it works yet just started it today. If does not burn my eyes like other products</li>
            <li> This is a current review of the Kakadu Day Cream previously reviewed.  Since using two products together - Kakadu Day Cream and Kakadu Night Cream, my skin is beginning to show promise.  Part of my problem is that I am 74 years with a few deep wrinkles.  I think it just takes longer for my skin to obsorb the product, because I really am seeing some results.  I hope this will give you some thought to consider trying both the Day Cream and the Night Cream.  I look forward to hearing your results.</li>
            <li> I like the cream, but it is really small for the price.  I recognize the unique ingredients and how the cream is crafted, but still find the travel size small for a travel size.</li>
            <li> again I am not sure what to expect.. have not noticed any change.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for dark spots on face, used it every day till it was gone, Great service as far as me getting it,</li>
