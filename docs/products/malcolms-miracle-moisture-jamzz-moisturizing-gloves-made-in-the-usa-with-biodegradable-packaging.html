            <li>They have been a great benefit to me.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve been great at keeping the moisture in (</li>
            <li>Still, they have been helpful and unless I invent something better, they are the best I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>This makes 7 pairs I own, one for each night of the week, and often during the day also since my sclerodermic arthritis is quite eased by these great gloves.</li>
            <li>The material was a good quality.  </li>
            <li>That being said, the product is good for the purpose it was designed.</li>
            <li>Also, they did not rip, I find them good quality.  </li>
            <li>a good value.</li>
            <li>(And I gave them a good tug to test them out)  </li>
            <li>They have held up beautifully through many washings.</li>
            <li>Very cute.</li>
            <li>Also very pleased that these are made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>I probably wear them 5 nights a week and am very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE these Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle Moisture Jamzz Moisturizing Gloves!  </li>
            <li>Wearing the glove just becomes more irritated!</li>
            <li>love these gloves!</li>
            <li>Satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve used them for more than a month now, every night, and they haven&#x27;t ripped!</li>
            <li>They made an amazing difference overnight when used with O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s &amp;#34;Working Hands&amp;#34;  cream.</li>
            <li>Washes well great comfort fit</li>
            <li>Use them to keep your hands warm, but don&#x27;t bother if your intention is to hold in</li>
            <li>I got them in the mail I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>They wash up nicely.</li>
            <li>These gloves are generously cut and have plenty of stretch to allow a great fit for most hand sizes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very appreciative of this company&#x27;s personal involvement and great customer service.  </li>
            <li>These are very comfortable, well fitting gloves.</li>
            <li>Along with the cute design they are very comfortable and shipping came promptly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing this because after posting the 1st review, I was contacted by the company and they very kindly and respectfully asked if they could replace the first pair as they believed they were defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the gloves, I love the look, feel and fit!.</li>
            <li>Being form fitting makes it easier if you want to handle any objects with the gloves on.  </li>
            <li>Will get more once I need to</li>
            <li>Even just washing them and air drying alone however, does not seem like they would stretch out any better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am immediately returning the gloves after they were tried on just one time, and appreciate the fact that I am able to return them with the Amazon refund policy.  </li>
            <li>I just wish that the size would be better disclosed, instead of having to go through this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this type of glove for most of my eczema ridden life.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Also able to access my iphone.  </li>
            <li>I love these gloves.  </li>
            <li>I am going to order a couple more pairs</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really rate these gloves - my dog ate them before i had a chance to try them out, lol.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>I started looking for gloves to be able to moisturize overnight.  </li>
            <li>(that I purchased on Amazon) and my hands are already better overnight...</li>
            <li>She is able to do most anything needed while wearing her gloves, including using her</li>
            <li>My fingers are no longer so cracked and my hands feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>I would really love a solid-color glove.</li>
            <li>Also, I wore them for several nights and have washed them and they&#x27;ve held up great!  </li>
            <li>I am still using my LOVE gloves.  </li>
            <li>--I have now worn many times and washed once without any problem.  </li>
            <li>I think that it is important to support merchants who treat customers and others in an honest and caring manner.  </li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I put on my favorite lotion and then these.  </li>
            <li>Many reviews comment that these gloves are nothing but cotton gloves</li>
            <li>These gloves feel more sturdy that my Avon ones I have used for years</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more now</li>
            <li>When they arrived, I thought they seemed okay</li>
            <li>this pair wasn&#x27;t any better.  </li>
            <li>At any rate, I do appreciate your gesture of good will and I am glad to know that some people have had positive experiences with the gloves.  </li>
            <li>They are so form fitting that it is easy to work with them on.</li>
            <li>I love the snug fit.  </li>
            <li>Love the fit and design.</li>
            <li>I can still type easily and even still use the touchscreen on my tablet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle&#x27;s make these fantastic gloves in the USA, they also have the BEST customer service, supporting their products!</li>
            <li>Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle has a loyal customer as long as they continue to make and stand by these excellent gloves.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and I can easily type with them on, as well as use the touchscreen on my phone.</li>
            <li>But they are still fine.</li>
            <li>They were snug and comfortable for wearing to bed and easy to wash.</li>
            <li>The design is super cute as well.</li>
            <li>These are super cute gloves, they just don&#x27;t do a thing to keep your hands moisturized.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Customer service is truly helpful, quick to respond, and genuine too about these!</li>
            <li>Touch/Snuggle worthy hands!</li>
            <li>and I can accurately report that they did not tear when putting them on.  </li>
            <li>The company has gone to cheaper thinner fabric and the fit is looser.</li>
            <li>They fit snug, so you can still get work done where you need, at the computer, etc.</li>
            <li>(I wear about a 5 - 6 size glove) as a glove should fit.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise comfortable and fits well.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and do the job.</li>
            <li>They are secure once on, and I haven&#x27;t had them slip off when I have worn them to sleep</li>
            <li>The fit is snug, offering support and relief when my skin is cracked and sore.</li>
            <li>so I can have them available all the time.</li>
            <li>I bought them to use at work; I work with manila folders filled with documents.  </li>
            <li>They fit well and do not come off at night, and they hold the moisture.</li>
            <li>and they fit just like the picture.  </li>
            <li>The package of the gloves came covered with dust, and the gloves feel cheap and like a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>They are a snug fit, which helps keep them on.  </li>
            <li>Now it is finally time for a  replacement, and will happily retire one of the senior pairs  </li>
            <li>Soon after the Amazon refund arrived I received an e-mail note from the company wanting to know the nature of the problem and offering me a free pair of gloves.  </li>
            <li>They are simply light cotton/spandex gloves which hold in the lotion all night in my hands and don&#x27;t interfere with my sleeping.</li>
            <li>This is an update based on the free pair I received from the seller.  </li>
            <li>gloves wash beautifully, and fit well, except fingers are long, but I am sleeping, so who cares!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone needing to wear gloves at night.</li>
            <li>Quality was not great at the time of purchase but the seller was wonderful as she wanted to know the issues, very easy to deal with.  </li>
            <li>One of the gloves of my first pair --the LOVE gloves--tore at the seam after wearing them twice.  </li>
            <li>I now own 11 pairs, have given them as gifts, and will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>My old gloves weren&#x27;t nearly as well made as these are so I am happy with my purchase and their easy to get on and off</li>
            <li>but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Adorable really.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, if you are looking for cotton gloves (because a doctor told you or a loved one to buy them, but has no idea with their fancy medical degree with where to)</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t recommend these gloves and company more highly!</li>
            <li>they stay on all night, my hands stay warm, and are soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>Its not a bad thing but its not a solution.</li>
            <li>I returned them to Amazon and quickly received a full refund.</li>
            <li>These will not be comfortable for those who wear large gloves!)</li>
            <li>I use a super moisturizing cream and put these on over night, man what a difference.  </li>
            <li>Having fingernails would most likely speed up this process, and let&#x27;s face it - most of the people who are going to use these will be women, who have fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I expected them to contain aloe or some kind of lotion or moisturizer - should have read up on them better, I suppose.  </li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m updating this review from the original one (you can see the original below).  </li>
            <li>as I had hoped for) overnight while wearing them and fit snug, but not too tight, which is good as many are a bit large and fall off during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, I had no problem with the fit or the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>While they are fairly comfortable, as soon a i put them on for the first time a rip formed along the seams of the gloves.  </li>
            <li>The seam ripped when I put them on the very first time.  </li>
            <li>I know that after many years, my long fingers will once again poke through the tops, and I will  darn them and then purchase another comfortable pair through Amazon!</li>
            <li>I read some mixed reviews, but ordered and I am so glad that I did!</li>
            <li>These gloves feel really soft and comfortable, and they&#x27;re easy to wash too.</li>
            <li>Do wonders to moisturize my skin and make them feel baby fresh again.</li>
            <li>I put these on at night and within two nites, my hands were back to being soft and happy.  </li>
            <li>overall quality looks fair, and the decoration (swirled) is nice, but most likely you would want to buy these gloves to help your hands from cracking/peeling/drying and a glove with a very short shelf life (like this one)</li>
            <li>These did not seem to hold in any moisture, rather, they just absorbed the lotion on my hands.</li>
            <li>so I like the fit even more compared to my last pair which was made of 100% cotton.  </li>
            <li>These gloves are wonderful during the long winter months when skin gets dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li>Even though, I would consider getting another pair, because they feel so good when they are on compared to the other ones I have.</li>
            <li>right out of your hands.</li>
            <li>They have a nice fit (woman with fairly average length fingers and a largish palm).</li>
            <li>However, the stitching did break in one spot, because I have very large hands.</li>
            <li>thing to note is that if you have VERY large hands, these are probably not for you.  </li>
            <li>Just wanted to note that today, 12/24/12 I received a new, free pair of these gloves unsolicited from the seller.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and easy to sleep in.</li>
            <li>The owner tried to tell me they just made the fabric thicker-thicker than what exactly?</li>
            <li>As with any skin care product, you must be consistent to see the results.</li>
            <li>They are soft to the touch and fit my hand</li>
            <li>most likely is not going to help you in this</li>
            <li>I am always washing my hands, doing my nails, and using cleaning products without the proper gloves so my hands are drying out more than I would like them to.</li>
            <li>They really do work!</li>
            <li>medium weight, might be hot in summer</li>
            <li>First time buying these type of gloves.</li>
            <li>These look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>I can even use these with my ipad and iphone, which is an absolute bonus!  </li>
            <li>had ordered two pair after reading the reviews stating that some gloves ripped or split when first tried on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would most definitely recommend these gloves if you are looking for moisturizing gloves.</li>
            <li>First, the gloves.  </li>
            <li>but THIS IS EXACTLY</li>
            <li>that I know they are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>These are pretty pricey for just two uses.  </li>
            <li>They fit snug but not tight, which I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I also own two pair of moisturizing gloves made by other companies.  </li>
            <li>These are a bit more expensive but a good value.  </li>
            <li>Well, I made him use them because his knuckles crack in the winter, to the point of bleeding, so after a few nights - he was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>They fit well - not too snug but definitely not loose.</li>
            <li>but I am certain they will serve my purpose.  </li>
            <li>While they do help, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it miraculous.  </li>
            <li>My hope is that this company will be an example for others, including large corporations.</li>
            <li>These fit very well and actually noticed a difference the first night with my Jergen&#x27;s Shea Butter lotion.  </li>
            <li>I would caution you if you are a person who has large hands, as the fit will be too tight, and the collar that goes around the wrist will barely fit below the meat of your thumb.  </li>
            <li>For real moisturizing, apply castor oil and wear the gloves overnight (put it on your feet and wear your socks).  </li>
            <li>The accompanying moisturizer works really well also.</li>
            <li>Talk about fast delivery . .</li>
            <li>all thanks to being a member of Prime.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like these gloves for treating my hard-working hands.  </li>
            <li>And the absorption time for lotion is fast-</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore these gloves.</li>
            <li>They have made a real difference when I lotion my hands before bed.  </li>
            <li>lotion absorbing advantage that the rest of my hand is getting, but they still really work.  </li>
            <li>When the gloves arrived, she tried one pair on, and even though she has smaller hands, the gloves fit well.</li>
            <li>I wash them on gentle in my wash with</li>
            <li>Each e-mail note I received was signed by a real person together with a phone number.  </li>
            <li>Thanks -&lt;br /&gt;Chris Bell</li>
            <li>These gloves are very well made also.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Lynn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>They are much, much nicer than most other cotton gloves I&#x27;ve used with lotion at night.</li>
            <li>The light stretchy fabric was comfortable on my large hands even though these were too small for me.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;- machine wash, hang dry - easy care</li>
            <li>I have long fingers, albeit my hands are not chubby, and these fit very well.</li>
            <li>These are appropriate tight on my large (size 7.5/8 ) hands, and do not slip off during the night.</li>
            <li>I am grateful that I could find these tried and true gloves of the same quality on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I know because I have the older pairs too.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like the floral pattern, but it was the only style available, as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference in my hands although I used a nice thick quality lotion with them.</li>
            <li>Initially the code did not go through and each time the company persistently and quickly responded and contacted Amazon in an effort to get the code to work.  </li>
            <li>Gloves like these might be more helpful at moisturizing old, rough hands if there was a layer of plastic between 2 layers of cloth.</li>
            <li>And it ripped in exactly the same place as it did with the first pair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these gloves and in fact I purchased three additional pair yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the company.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these</li>
            <li>The gloves are pretty tight and do not expand well to fit hand.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these and they fit snug enough to fit under my work gloves, while not being too tight and restrictive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classy act and much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>I would stay away from harsh chemicals that are found in most moisturizers ladies.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that she wanted to stand behind her merchandise and to keep good will with her customers.  </li>
            <li>I tried them with a typical moisturizer and have to admit my hands felt amazing the next day after wearing them overnight.</li>
            <li>nice thick fabric, very stretchy, but they also fit my little size 6 hands.</li>
            <li>the bands quickly became stretched at the wrists.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll re-rate these in a couple of weeks based on the new pair.  </li>
            <li>Then a few months ago, after doing research on Amazon and reading the reviews, I discovered these wonderful, comfortable gloves, that not only do they &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; and moisturize, but are thin enough that I can type and write with them on!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to return the gloves, but just sent an email to the company through Amazon, and within a day or two, the actual owner of the company emailed me back, offering to replace the gloves, free of charge, with a pattern of my choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not only is it pretty</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd pair of these (i wore the first pair out).  </li>
            <li>If your hands are even average size.. they wont fit in these.</li>
            <li>First of all, be in the know: there are currently (as of 1/6/2014)</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and not a small person.</li>
            <li>I have two small children in diapers and between them and many animals</li>
            <li>I tried looking at the reviews to see if they would fit a person with large sized hands and even tried the suggestion to get one style over the other, as the reviewer claimed they were slightly larger.  </li>
            <li>I weighed them on my scale and the old pairs weighed 28 grams and the new pair weighs 23 grams.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a major problem, but if your hands are very large and or you have very short fingers, this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Love these but even for my very tiny hands they are far too tight.</li>
            <li>it was a bit disappointing on top of the fit.  </li>
            <li>and they were on my front porch early this afternoon, Sept 17th.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using 100%pure Petroleum Jelly followed with Alba Botanica Natural Hawaiian hand and body lotion</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since these are almost 100% cotton, I would think that they will most likely shrink if they were to be machine dried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are not comfortable enough to wear for more than 30 minutes - forget wearing them overnight!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t get how these are better than a thin pair of gloves.</li>
            <li>I get dry hands in the winter, so I bought these because of all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>and voila, my hands were back to normal.</li>
            <li>, the first time I pulled them on, I was pulling kind of hard (probably since they&#x27;re so snug) and the outside seam ripped a few stitches.  </li>
            <li>I am kind of rough when I do things, so maybe I pulled too hard.</li>
            <li>After I responded that I had already received a refund I received a second e-mail with a discount code for a new pair of gloves.  </li>
            <li>I wear these to bed with my pick of moisturizer, and in the morning I have such soft supple skin!</li>
            <li>I wash these gloves at least twice a week and they are holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>These gloves are thick and feel super!</li>
            <li>Now, to be clear, I have what I would consider average sized hands, so it&#x27;s not as though they are ripping because my hands are large.  </li>
            <li>I have a pair of GEL filled gloves from Bath &amp; Body Works which I find uncomfortable and hot to sleep in (not to mention my cat cannot stand me petting her while wearing them).</li>
            <li>They really do help when I&#x27;ve spent the day in the yard or in the work shop painting</li>
            <li>The gloves are a soft white cotton material.</li>
            <li>I have even used an old pair to pull weeds that are intertwined with some of my low ground covering.</li>
            <li>I do not have big hands at all and was surprised at the ease these gloves ripped.  </li>
            <li>There are two old (10-20 years) pairs of Moisture Jamzz that I have used several nights a week.</li>
            <li>At the same time, your lotion(s) do not travel through the gloves and the outsides remain dry (unlike pure cotton gloves).</li>
            <li>Seriously, Malcolm either raise the price and continue providing a quality product or stop selling these cheap pieces of junk.</li>
            <li>After wearing them, my hands were still dry and it did not make my hands soft.</li>
            <li>I even went so far as to fill the fingers with lotion and then put my hand in, and in the morning the skin on my fingers felt as dry as ever.  </li>
            <li>They keep my hands and feet soft and they also help keep my  cuticles from getting dry.  </li>
            <li>First off, they are very tight, so they rub off any lotion on your hands when you put them on.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am very happy about my purchase and would recommend them to others who need (or want) to wear lotion at night.</li>
            <li> These were not for me but the person who used them told me that they were not the greatest thing.</li>
            <li> These are the best, best, best.  </li>

            <li> They have been a great benefit to me.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve been great at keeping the moisture in (</li>
            <li> Still, they have been helpful and unless I invent something better, they are the best I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> This makes 7 pairs I own, one for each night of the week, and often during the day also since my sclerodermic arthritis is quite eased by these great gloves.</li>
            <li> The material was a good quality.  </li>
            <li> That being said, the product is good for the purpose it was designed.</li>
            <li> Also, they did not rip, I find them good quality.  </li>
            <li> a good value.</li>
            <li> (And I gave them a good tug to test them out)  </li>
            <li> They have held up beautifully through many washings.</li>
            <li> Very cute.</li>
            <li> Also very pleased that these are made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> I probably wear them 5 nights a week and am very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE these Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle Moisture Jamzz Moisturizing Gloves!  </li>
            <li> Wearing the glove just becomes more irritated!</li>
            <li> love these gloves!</li>
            <li> Satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve used them for more than a month now, every night, and they haven&#x27;t ripped!</li>
            <li> They made an amazing difference overnight when used with O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s &amp;#34;Working Hands&amp;#34;  cream.</li>
            <li> Washes well great comfort fit</li>
            <li> Use them to keep your hands warm, but don&#x27;t bother if your intention is to hold in</li>
            <li> I got them in the mail I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> They wash up nicely.</li>
            <li> These gloves are generously cut and have plenty of stretch to allow a great fit for most hand sizes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very appreciative of this company&#x27;s personal involvement and great customer service.  </li>
            <li> These are very comfortable, well fitting gloves.</li>
            <li> Along with the cute design they are very comfortable and shipping came promptly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing this because after posting the 1st review, I was contacted by the company and they very kindly and respectfully asked if they could replace the first pair as they believed they were defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the gloves, I love the look, feel and fit!.</li>
            <li> Being form fitting makes it easier if you want to handle any objects with the gloves on.  </li>
            <li> Will get more once I need to</li>
            <li> Even just washing them and air drying alone however, does not seem like they would stretch out any better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am immediately returning the gloves after they were tried on just one time, and appreciate the fact that I am able to return them with the Amazon refund policy.  </li>
            <li> I just wish that the size would be better disclosed, instead of having to go through this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type of glove for most of my eczema ridden life.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Also able to access my iphone.  </li>
            <li> I love these gloves.  </li>
            <li> I am going to order a couple more pairs</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rate these gloves - my dog ate them before i had a chance to try them out, lol.</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> I started looking for gloves to be able to moisturize overnight.  </li>
            <li> (that I purchased on Amazon) and my hands are already better overnight...</li>
            <li> She is able to do most anything needed while wearing her gloves, including using her</li>
            <li> My fingers are no longer so cracked and my hands feel so much better.  </li>
            <li> I would really love a solid-color glove.</li>
            <li> Also, I wore them for several nights and have washed them and they&#x27;ve held up great!  </li>
            <li> I am still using my LOVE gloves.  </li>
            <li> --I have now worn many times and washed once without any problem.  </li>
            <li> I think that it is important to support merchants who treat customers and others in an honest and caring manner.  </li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I put on my favorite lotion and then these.  </li>
            <li> Many reviews comment that these gloves are nothing but cotton gloves</li>
            <li> These gloves feel more sturdy that my Avon ones I have used for years</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more now</li>
            <li> When they arrived, I thought they seemed okay</li>
            <li> this pair wasn&#x27;t any better.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, I do appreciate your gesture of good will and I am glad to know that some people have had positive experiences with the gloves.  </li>
            <li> They are so form fitting that it is easy to work with them on.</li>
            <li> I love the snug fit.  </li>
            <li> Love the fit and design.</li>
            <li> I can still type easily and even still use the touchscreen on my tablet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle&#x27;s make these fantastic gloves in the USA, they also have the BEST customer service, supporting their products!</li>
            <li> Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle has a loyal customer as long as they continue to make and stand by these excellent gloves.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable and I can easily type with them on, as well as use the touchscreen on my phone.</li>
            <li> But they are still fine.</li>
            <li> They were snug and comfortable for wearing to bed and easy to wash.</li>
            <li> The design is super cute as well.</li>
            <li> These are super cute gloves, they just don&#x27;t do a thing to keep your hands moisturized.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Customer service is truly helpful, quick to respond, and genuine too about these!</li>
            <li> Touch/Snuggle worthy hands!</li>
            <li> and I can accurately report that they did not tear when putting them on.  </li>
            <li> The company has gone to cheaper thinner fabric and the fit is looser.</li>
            <li> They fit snug, so you can still get work done where you need, at the computer, etc.</li>
            <li> (I wear about a 5 - 6 size glove) as a glove should fit.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise comfortable and fits well.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable and do the job.</li>
            <li> They are secure once on, and I haven&#x27;t had them slip off when I have worn them to sleep</li>
            <li> The fit is snug, offering support and relief when my skin is cracked and sore.</li>
            <li> so I can have them available all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought them to use at work; I work with manila folders filled with documents.  </li>
            <li> They fit well and do not come off at night, and they hold the moisture.</li>
            <li> and they fit just like the picture.  </li>
            <li> The package of the gloves came covered with dust, and the gloves feel cheap and like a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> They are a snug fit, which helps keep them on.  </li>
            <li> Now it is finally time for a  replacement, and will happily retire one of the senior pairs  </li>
            <li> Soon after the Amazon refund arrived I received an e-mail note from the company wanting to know the nature of the problem and offering me a free pair of gloves.  </li>
            <li> They are simply light cotton/spandex gloves which hold in the lotion all night in my hands and don&#x27;t interfere with my sleeping.</li>
            <li> This is an update based on the free pair I received from the seller.  </li>
            <li> gloves wash beautifully, and fit well, except fingers are long, but I am sleeping, so who cares!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone needing to wear gloves at night.</li>
            <li> Quality was not great at the time of purchase but the seller was wonderful as she wanted to know the issues, very easy to deal with.  </li>
            <li> One of the gloves of my first pair --the LOVE gloves--tore at the seam after wearing them twice.  </li>
            <li> I now own 11 pairs, have given them as gifts, and will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> My old gloves weren&#x27;t nearly as well made as these are so I am happy with my purchase and their easy to get on and off</li>
            <li> but nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Adorable really.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, if you are looking for cotton gloves (because a doctor told you or a loved one to buy them, but has no idea with their fancy medical degree with where to)</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t recommend these gloves and company more highly!</li>
            <li> they stay on all night, my hands stay warm, and are soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> Its not a bad thing but its not a solution.</li>
            <li> I returned them to Amazon and quickly received a full refund.</li>
            <li> These will not be comfortable for those who wear large gloves!)</li>
            <li> I use a super moisturizing cream and put these on over night, man what a difference.  </li>
            <li> Having fingernails would most likely speed up this process, and let&#x27;s face it - most of the people who are going to use these will be women, who have fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I expected them to contain aloe or some kind of lotion or moisturizer - should have read up on them better, I suppose.  </li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m updating this review from the original one (you can see the original below).  </li>
            <li> as I had hoped for) overnight while wearing them and fit snug, but not too tight, which is good as many are a bit large and fall off during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, I had no problem with the fit or the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> While they are fairly comfortable, as soon a i put them on for the first time a rip formed along the seams of the gloves.  </li>
            <li> The seam ripped when I put them on the very first time.  </li>
            <li> I know that after many years, my long fingers will once again poke through the tops, and I will  darn them and then purchase another comfortable pair through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I read some mixed reviews, but ordered and I am so glad that I did!</li>
            <li> These gloves feel really soft and comfortable, and they&#x27;re easy to wash too.</li>
            <li> Do wonders to moisturize my skin and make them feel baby fresh again.</li>
            <li> I put these on at night and within two nites, my hands were back to being soft and happy.  </li>
            <li> overall quality looks fair, and the decoration (swirled) is nice, but most likely you would want to buy these gloves to help your hands from cracking/peeling/drying and a glove with a very short shelf life (like this one)</li>
            <li> These did not seem to hold in any moisture, rather, they just absorbed the lotion on my hands.</li>
            <li> so I like the fit even more compared to my last pair which was made of 100% cotton.  </li>
            <li> These gloves are wonderful during the long winter months when skin gets dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> Even though, I would consider getting another pair, because they feel so good when they are on compared to the other ones I have.</li>
            <li> right out of your hands.</li>
            <li> They have a nice fit (woman with fairly average length fingers and a largish palm).</li>
            <li> However, the stitching did break in one spot, because I have very large hands.</li>
            <li> thing to note is that if you have VERY large hands, these are probably not for you.  </li>
            <li> Just wanted to note that today, 12/24/12 I received a new, free pair of these gloves unsolicited from the seller.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and easy to sleep in.</li>
            <li> The owner tried to tell me they just made the fabric thicker-thicker than what exactly?</li>
            <li> As with any skin care product, you must be consistent to see the results.</li>
            <li> They are soft to the touch and fit my hand</li>
            <li> most likely is not going to help you in this</li>
            <li> I am always washing my hands, doing my nails, and using cleaning products without the proper gloves so my hands are drying out more than I would like them to.</li>
            <li> They really do work!</li>
            <li> medium weight, might be hot in summer</li>
            <li> First time buying these type of gloves.</li>
            <li> These look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> I can even use these with my ipad and iphone, which is an absolute bonus!  </li>
            <li> had ordered two pair after reading the reviews stating that some gloves ripped or split when first tried on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would most definitely recommend these gloves if you are looking for moisturizing gloves.</li>
            <li> First, the gloves.  </li>
            <li> but THIS IS EXACTLY</li>
            <li> that I know they are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> These are pretty pricey for just two uses.  </li>
            <li> They fit snug but not tight, which I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I also own two pair of moisturizing gloves made by other companies.  </li>
            <li> These are a bit more expensive but a good value.  </li>
            <li> Well, I made him use them because his knuckles crack in the winter, to the point of bleeding, so after a few nights - he was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> They fit well - not too snug but definitely not loose.</li>
            <li> but I am certain they will serve my purpose.  </li>
            <li> While they do help, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it miraculous.  </li>
            <li> My hope is that this company will be an example for others, including large corporations.</li>
            <li> These fit very well and actually noticed a difference the first night with my Jergen&#x27;s Shea Butter lotion.  </li>
            <li> I would caution you if you are a person who has large hands, as the fit will be too tight, and the collar that goes around the wrist will barely fit below the meat of your thumb.  </li>
            <li> For real moisturizing, apply castor oil and wear the gloves overnight (put it on your feet and wear your socks).  </li>
            <li> The accompanying moisturizer works really well also.</li>
            <li> Talk about fast delivery . .</li>
            <li> all thanks to being a member of Prime.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like these gloves for treating my hard-working hands.  </li>
            <li> And the absorption time for lotion is fast-</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these gloves.</li>
            <li> They have made a real difference when I lotion my hands before bed.  </li>
            <li> lotion absorbing advantage that the rest of my hand is getting, but they still really work.  </li>
            <li> When the gloves arrived, she tried one pair on, and even though she has smaller hands, the gloves fit well.</li>
            <li> I wash them on gentle in my wash with</li>
            <li> Each e-mail note I received was signed by a real person together with a phone number.  </li>
            <li> Thanks -&lt;br /&gt;Chris Bell</li>
            <li> These gloves are very well made also.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Lynn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> They are much, much nicer than most other cotton gloves I&#x27;ve used with lotion at night.</li>
            <li> The light stretchy fabric was comfortable on my large hands even though these were too small for me.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;- machine wash, hang dry - easy care</li>
            <li> I have long fingers, albeit my hands are not chubby, and these fit very well.</li>
            <li> These are appropriate tight on my large (size 7.5/8 ) hands, and do not slip off during the night.</li>
            <li> I am grateful that I could find these tried and true gloves of the same quality on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I know because I have the older pairs too.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the floral pattern, but it was the only style available, as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference in my hands although I used a nice thick quality lotion with them.</li>
            <li> Initially the code did not go through and each time the company persistently and quickly responded and contacted Amazon in an effort to get the code to work.  </li>
            <li> Gloves like these might be more helpful at moisturizing old, rough hands if there was a layer of plastic between 2 layers of cloth.</li>
            <li> And it ripped in exactly the same place as it did with the first pair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these gloves and in fact I purchased three additional pair yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the company.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these</li>
            <li> The gloves are pretty tight and do not expand well to fit hand.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these and they fit snug enough to fit under my work gloves, while not being too tight and restrictive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classy act and much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> I would stay away from harsh chemicals that are found in most moisturizers ladies.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that she wanted to stand behind her merchandise and to keep good will with her customers.  </li>
            <li> I tried them with a typical moisturizer and have to admit my hands felt amazing the next day after wearing them overnight.</li>
            <li> nice thick fabric, very stretchy, but they also fit my little size 6 hands.</li>
            <li> the bands quickly became stretched at the wrists.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll re-rate these in a couple of weeks based on the new pair.  </li>
            <li> Then a few months ago, after doing research on Amazon and reading the reviews, I discovered these wonderful, comfortable gloves, that not only do they &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; and moisturize, but are thin enough that I can type and write with them on!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to return the gloves, but just sent an email to the company through Amazon, and within a day or two, the actual owner of the company emailed me back, offering to replace the gloves, free of charge, with a pattern of my choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not only is it pretty</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd pair of these (i wore the first pair out).  </li>
            <li> If your hands are even average size.. they wont fit in these.</li>
            <li> First of all, be in the know: there are currently (as of 1/6/2014)</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and not a small person.</li>
            <li> I have two small children in diapers and between them and many animals</li>
            <li> I tried looking at the reviews to see if they would fit a person with large sized hands and even tried the suggestion to get one style over the other, as the reviewer claimed they were slightly larger.  </li>
            <li> I weighed them on my scale and the old pairs weighed 28 grams and the new pair weighs 23 grams.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a major problem, but if your hands are very large and or you have very short fingers, this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Love these but even for my very tiny hands they are far too tight.</li>
            <li> it was a bit disappointing on top of the fit.  </li>
            <li> and they were on my front porch early this afternoon, Sept 17th.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using 100%pure Petroleum Jelly followed with Alba Botanica Natural Hawaiian hand and body lotion</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since these are almost 100% cotton, I would think that they will most likely shrink if they were to be machine dried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are not comfortable enough to wear for more than 30 minutes - forget wearing them overnight!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get how these are better than a thin pair of gloves.</li>
            <li> I get dry hands in the winter, so I bought these because of all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> and voila, my hands were back to normal.</li>
            <li> , the first time I pulled them on, I was pulling kind of hard (probably since they&#x27;re so snug) and the outside seam ripped a few stitches.  </li>
            <li> I am kind of rough when I do things, so maybe I pulled too hard.</li>
            <li> After I responded that I had already received a refund I received a second e-mail with a discount code for a new pair of gloves.  </li>
            <li> I wear these to bed with my pick of moisturizer, and in the morning I have such soft supple skin!</li>
            <li> I wash these gloves at least twice a week and they are holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> These gloves are thick and feel super!</li>
            <li> Now, to be clear, I have what I would consider average sized hands, so it&#x27;s not as though they are ripping because my hands are large.  </li>
            <li> I have a pair of GEL filled gloves from Bath &amp; Body Works which I find uncomfortable and hot to sleep in (not to mention my cat cannot stand me petting her while wearing them).</li>
            <li> They really do help when I&#x27;ve spent the day in the yard or in the work shop painting</li>
            <li> The gloves are a soft white cotton material.</li>
            <li> I have even used an old pair to pull weeds that are intertwined with some of my low ground covering.</li>
            <li> I do not have big hands at all and was surprised at the ease these gloves ripped.  </li>
            <li> There are two old (10-20 years) pairs of Moisture Jamzz that I have used several nights a week.</li>
            <li> At the same time, your lotion(s) do not travel through the gloves and the outsides remain dry (unlike pure cotton gloves).</li>
            <li> Seriously, Malcolm either raise the price and continue providing a quality product or stop selling these cheap pieces of junk.</li>
            <li> After wearing them, my hands were still dry and it did not make my hands soft.</li>
            <li> I even went so far as to fill the fingers with lotion and then put my hand in, and in the morning the skin on my fingers felt as dry as ever.  </li>
            <li> They keep my hands and feet soft and they also help keep my  cuticles from getting dry.  </li>
            <li> First off, they are very tight, so they rub off any lotion on your hands when you put them on.  </li>
            <li> and my hands aren&#x27;t large, but they aren&#x27;t small either.</li>
            <li> Not normal looking enough to wear outside.</li>
            <li> I must say that they do not last as long as I had hoped</li>
            <li> The only issue I have (and it&#x27;s minor)</li>
            <li> After just two uses the seam was already splitting open and there was a little hole near the palm.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these gloves to anyone who has dry hands.  </li>
            <li> and my wife uses the gloves occasionally for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried wearing latex gloves at night, but that experiment ultimately failed--the cracks seemed to deepen, I think because too much moisture was being trapped and the gloves did not breathe.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order this pair again, but would order the other ones mentioned above -- and they were about the same price.rice.</li>
            <li> My skin was so bad, it was starting to crack and bleed, especially on my right hand.</li>
            <li> The fabric lacks the softness of cotton,  may be too rough for problematic skin, especially those with rash and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t worn it for long.</li>
            <li> These gloves are snug, which they should be, but not soft.</li>
            <li> I can see myself getting long use out of these.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I have larger woman&#x27;s hands, these gloves seemed a little snug on my hands/fingers, yet they fingers are way long (and I don&#x27;t have a short hand either).  </li>
            <li> My only wish is that they came in patterns/colors other than floral, swirl, and words.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I thought this would help with my severely dry skin/flare up</li>
            <li> I wear them in bed after applying hand cream to moisturize my dry winter hands</li>
            <li> I purchased these to help with my dry hands..</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;my whites or pastels and dry in my dryer.  </li>
            <li> Not so the Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle gloves, which even after continued use feel quite dry and have never come off.  </li>
            <li> My hands had gotten to the point of being extremely dry, all the time, even after putting lotion on throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I am a guy with dry hands</li>
            <li> The Floral and Words are the same small size (medium female, small male), while the Swirl are a bit larger (medium male ...</li>
            <li> After wearing it a day, one glove developed a small split along the seam of one of the fingers.</li>
            <li> Recently I ordered more, and I was SOOO disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> My hands get very dry and the cuticles start to snag and tear.  </li>
            <li> I have only worn these a few times.</li>
            <li> Also my gloves don&#x27;t get saturated and feel wet...</li>
            <li> The soft, thick stretchy cotton material protects my fingers, without getting greasy ointments and lotions all over everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hands are not large but as well made as these look, they should not have split after one use and one hand soaking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> fabric on one did tear a little between my middle and ring fingers after less than a week of wearing them.</li>
            <li> is that a couple of the fingers are a little long</li>
            <li> My husband calls them &amp;#34;Granny Gloves&amp;#34; due to the pattern.</li>
            <li> While snug, they are not restrictive due to the stretch.</li>
            <li> The seams are small enough not to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Due to hand eczema, sometimes my fingers crack and bleed, so</li>
            <li> Ordered these and  2 other styles.</li>
            <li> I did not have some of the problems that other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Mine are medium-large and they are snug on me -- but they stay on which had been a problem with other gloves!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They stay on all night, when other gloves come off.</li>
            <li> Will try other products.</li>
            <li> I am going to order another pair so that I will have one when the other is in the wash.  </li>
            <li> I read a few reviews about the gloves being too tight and ripping, but those reviewers might have been weight-lifting in them with giant hands or something.</li>
            <li> However, that tightness makes it a little harder to get on without smearing the lotion that I put on a bit</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I was overly rough with them, but they do require a little tugging to get the fingers</li>
            <li> Not useful for around the house.</li>
            <li> I had recently bought two different types locally and found both to be be disappointing.  </li>
            <li> So far we have not experienced those issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it down and work it off finger by finger.  </li>
            <li> They got a little down your wrist and stay on tight all night.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use with hand cream to avoid making a mess.</li>
            <li> I did not find them small, and I have somewhat wide hands.  </li>
            <li> Its so tight that I could not even bend my fingers.</li>
            <li> However, the Floral and Words were too tight for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they were still tight.</li>
            <li> but they were way too tight on my small-medium sized hands.</li>
            <li> I wanted them to be tight enough to do things while wearing them - type, etc - but they are not soft and are a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> so there is still a little bit of excess material at the fingertips but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> They come up over the wrist a little, which I like.</li>
            <li> One size does not fit all</li>
            <li> the pricey lotion that I bought is going to waste.</li>
            <li> the fingers are slightly tight and slightly long for my small to medium hands so not suitable for thick fingers</li>
            <li> I get dry hands frequently and these past few times my hands have been so bad they almost look like I have cuts in the palms of my hands...</li>
            <li> I have been using these gloves every few nights for the past month.</li>
            <li> My hands are medium to small, but these were soooo tight!</li>
            <li> If you have any lotions/creams that are incredibly thick or greasy and hard to get all the way rubbed into your skin; use them with these gloves at night—you get the benefit of the extreme moisture without getting your greasy hands all over everything.  </li>
            <li> These other gloves retain a wet and uncomfortable feeling caused by the moisturizing cream and also sometimes come off during sleep.  </li>
            <li> They are not much better than the inexpensive cotton gloves from CHINA.</li>
            <li> I have a small hand</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with.  </li>
            <li> and I have small hands</li>
            <li> I have generally small hands</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this product, I was concerned that they might be too small for my hands.</li>
            <li> The seams are uncomfortable (especially at the fingertips).</li>
            <li> I did have to stitch a small seam after a&lt;br /&gt;month or so.  </li>
            <li> My hands are small.</li>
            <li> I have small hands but these gloves are still very tight!  </li>
            <li> For those who have trouble washing them, it seems silly that you wouldn&#x27;t wash these in your lingerie bag with your other delicates.  </li>
            <li> They also decreased the amount of spandex from 10% down to 6%.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t yank on the gloves too hard, I did pop a seem at the bottom.</li>
            <li> When I go to bed now, I rub on some thick, moisturizing hand cream and put these gloves on</li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t mean my hands are always protected.  </li>
            <li> Jamzz Moisturizing Gloves  were very small Could not wear  </li>
            <li> I bought the Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle Moisture Moisturizing Gloves because I always get dry, cracked hands during the winter and this year has been particularly bad.  </li>
            <li> Although it is designed to keep lotion on the hand, it must allow a thin layer of breathing ground for the skin.</li>
            <li> but the secret is these gloves.  </li>
            <li> Seems poorly made.</li>
            <li> Reading the negative reviews, I was afraid these gloves would rip.</li>
            <li> If you were using some occlusion at night and wearing them, I can see them rolling up and being uncomfortable for large-handed people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t sleep with them on, way too uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need expensive lotion, these gloves work well with any lotion...and</li>
            <li> The thing about them is that the benefits of moisture delivery over a period of time without being cumbersome and feeling weird while wearing them.</li>
            <li> Sorry Lynn, but</li>
            <li> I have really bad eczema, exacerbated by wearing non-latex gloves at work.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s painful to touch anything.</li>
            <li> which is painful.</li>
            <li> three variations of these gloves, distinguished by the patterns on them: (1) Floral, (2)</li>
            <li> I hate them.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have smaller hands, yet my fingertips could not push all the way in. The gloves are pretty tight and do not expand well to fit hand.  The fabric lacks the softness of cotton,  may be too rough for problematic skin, especially those with rash and cuts.  Although it is designed to keep lotion on the hand, it must allow a thin layer of breathing ground for the skin. Its so tight that I could not even bend my fingers.</li>
            <li> I have bought these gloves for years. Recently I ordered more, and I was SOOO disappointed in the quality. The company has gone to cheaper thinner fabric and the fit is looser. Used to be I couldn&#x27;t see through the fabric when I had them on, and now I can. I hate them. They also decreased the amount of spandex from 10% down to 6%. I know because I have the older pairs too. I weighed them on my scale and the old pairs weighed 28 grams and the new pair weighs 23 grams. The owner tried to tell me they just made the fabric thicker-thicker than what exactly? The proof is in the reading on the scale. Seriously, Malcolm either raise the price and continue providing a quality product or stop selling these cheap pieces of junk. They are not much better than the inexpensive cotton gloves from CHINA.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizing glove I could wear that would not interfere with some of my activities.  First, I had no problem with the fit or the quality of the product.  Not only is it pretty but it is well-made.  The gloves contain sufficient spandex in addition to the absorbent cotton that allows stretch as the gloves are put on or taken off.  As with any glove, don&#x27;t just yank and jam it on your on the hand, &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; it down and work it off finger by finger.  I have a small hand so there is still a little bit of excess material at the fingertips but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I can still read a book (turn pages in a hardcopy or touchscreen the KINDLE), text or use a keyboard without a problem.  For real moisturizing, apply castor oil and wear the gloves overnight (put it on your feet and wear your socks).  After two overnight uses, my fingertips and cuticles have lost their dryness.  As with any skin care product, you must be consistent to see the results.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for female warehouse worker. She wears them at night. Says they have made quite a difference and took a couple night to get used to. But now she just needs them a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> These gloves are wonderful during the long winter months when skin gets dry and cracked.  The accompanying moisturizer works really well also.</li>
            <li> however, after one hand washing, the seams split.  my hands are not large but as well made as these look, they should not have split after one use and one hand soaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**the company has contacted me and will be replacing the defective pair. Very fair and quite satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement pair arrived today as promised. These have been the BEST brand if moisturizing gloves I&#x27;ve used. This makes 7 pairs I own, one for each night of the week, and often during the day also since my sclerodermic arthritis is quite eased by these great gloves. Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle has a loyal customer as long as they continue to make and stand by these excellent gloves. The moisturizing Google&#x27;s are my next purchase. Thank you Malcolm&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My husband knows that my hands crack from dryness. Got these as a gift. Very cute. Adorable really.  Do wonders to moisturize my skin and make them feel baby fresh again.</li>
            <li> Did a great job of keeping my lotion on my hands instead of everywhere else. They fit snug, so you can still get work done where you need, at the computer, etc. Washable and still will retain shape.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd pair of these (i wore the first pair out).  I have really dry skin so these get a lot of use at my house.  I use a super moisturizing cream and put these on over night, man what a difference.  I like them because they are washable also.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use them every night.  Feel great.</li>
            <li> I have really bad eczema, exacerbated by wearing non-latex gloves at work. I ordered these and they fit snug enough to fit under my work gloves, while not being too tight and restrictive. The design is super cute as well. These work just perfectly! (As a side note, i wear a small-medium glove. These will not be comfortable for those who wear large gloves!)</li>
            <li> I have only worn these a few times. The seam in one glove is already coming apart. I don&#x27;t recommend them</li>
            <li> Kudos to Amazon and Prime.  I ordered two pairs of the Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle  Moisturizing Gloves about 9:00-9:30 pm EST last night, Sept 16th and they were on my front porch early this afternoon, Sept 17th.  Talk about fast delivery . . all thanks to being a member of Prime.  As for the gloves, I love the look, feel and fit!. They are soft to the touch and fit my hand (I wear about a 5 - 6 size glove) as a glove should fit.  I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use them with my Working Hands cream that I will be applying tonight but I am certain they will serve my purpose.  Thank you Amazon, Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle Moisture Jamzz Moisturizing Gloves for a service and product that deserves the 5 stars that I rated.&lt;br /&gt;A very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Im a dude and I still think this is the best no-fuss way to stop your hands from cracking into a million pieces. Wish they had a version without the flowers.</li>
            <li> I have been using these gloves every few nights for the past month. My hands are definitely softer. I like to use Eucerin lotion with these gloves.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t worn it for long. Not useful for around the house. Not normal looking enough to wear outside. Otherwise comfortable and fits well.</li>
            <li> I bought these to help keep my skin from cracking all winter, and they did help but the seams at the fingertips opened up after 2 months of use. I wash them one a week to keep them from feeling greasy and they seemed to hold up well until now.</li>
            <li> The material was a good quality.  I have mixed feelings about the tightness of the product.  Being form fitting makes it easier if you want to handle any objects with the gloves on.  However, that tightness makes it a little harder to get on without smearing the lotion that I put on a bit and I also would take them off part way through the night because they started to fill restrictive.  That being said, the product is good for the purpose it was designed.</li>
            <li> These are very comfortable, well fitting gloves. They are much, much nicer than most other cotton gloves I&#x27;ve used with lotion at night. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like these gloves a lot for nighttime moisturizing. They got a little down your wrist and stay on tight all night. They are comfortable and do the job. Will get more once I need to</li>
            <li> These did the trick.  I am a housekeeper and believe me, after cleaning homes for 8 hours a day, my paws take a beating.  I wear rubber gloves but that doesn&#x27;t mean my hands are always protected.  I put these on at night and within two nites, my hands were back to being soft and happy.  Put on cuticle cream, hand lotion &amp; you have happy hands and nails and cuticles and don&#x27;t look like a hand monster!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these to use with hand cream to avoid making a mess. They have a nice fit (woman with fairly average length fingers and a largish palm). They come up over the wrist a little, which I like. They are comfortable and I can easily type with them on, as well as use the touchscreen on my phone. They are secure once on, and I haven&#x27;t had them slip off when I have worn them to sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric on one did tear a little between my middle and ring fingers after less than a week of wearing them. I don&#x27;t think I was overly rough with them, but they do require a little tugging to get the fingers just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the floral pattern, but it was the only style available, as far as I could tell. My husband calls them &amp;#34;Granny Gloves&amp;#34; due to the pattern.</li>
            <li> These gloves did not do anything for my hands. I will have to save up for the bliss gloves. After wearing them, my hands were still dry and it did not make my hands soft.</li>
            <li> I really like these gloves for treating my hard-working hands.  I must say that they do not last as long as I had hoped but I use them while I&#x27;m doing chores as well.  Perfect for intended use though.</li>
            <li> They have held up beautifully through many washings. They fit well - not too snug but definitely not loose. Should I need to, I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> These are super cute gloves, they just don&#x27;t do a thing to keep your hands moisturized.  First off, they are very tight, so they rub off any lotion on your hands when you put them on.  Second, the material absorbs the lotion!  I even went so far as to fill the fingers with lotion and then put my hand in, and in the morning the skin on my fingers felt as dry as ever.  Use them to keep your hands warm, but don&#x27;t bother if your intention is to hold in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update*** I was contacted by the owner of the company when she read my review, and she immediately offered me a replacement or refund.  Great customer service, thank you.</li>
            <li> I tried looking at the reviews to see if they would fit a person with large sized hands and even tried the suggestion to get one style over the other, as the reviewer claimed they were slightly larger.  I would caution you if you are a person who has large hands, as the fit will be too tight, and the collar that goes around the wrist will barely fit below the meat of your thumb.  If you were using some occlusion at night and wearing them, I can see them rolling up and being uncomfortable for large-handed people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since these are almost 100% cotton, I would think that they will most likely shrink if they were to be machine dried.  Even just washing them and air drying alone however, does not seem like they would stretch out any better.  I would guess after about ten washes however, the gloves seem like they would fall apart.  Having fingernails would most likely speed up this process, and let&#x27;s face it - most of the people who are going to use these will be women, who have fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall quality looks fair, and the decoration (swirled) is nice, but most likely you would want to buy these gloves to help your hands from cracking/peeling/drying and a glove with a very short shelf life (like this one) most likely is not going to help you in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am immediately returning the gloves after they were tried on just one time, and appreciate the fact that I am able to return them with the Amazon refund policy.  I just wish that the size would be better disclosed, instead of having to go through this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you are looking for cotton gloves (because a doctor told you or a loved one to buy them, but has no idea with their fancy medical degree with where to), I recommend that you look at hardware places like Harbor Freight, Ace Hardware, TSC (Tractor Supply Company) or the like.  Don&#x27;t bother going to Home Depot, or to Lowe&#x27;s, Wal-Mart or Target you won&#x27;t find anything related to cotton gloves at either ofthese places.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type of glove for most of my eczema ridden life. These are my favorite. The fit is snug, offering support and relief when my skin is cracked and sore. While snug, they are not restrictive due to the stretch. The seams are small enough not to irritate my skin. I wash these gloves at least twice a week and they are holding up just fine. I will be purchasing these in the future.</li>
            <li> It has just enough elastic to stay on, unlike 100% cotton gloves.  And the absorption time for lotion is fast- I only needed these on for 10 minutes before I could take them off and work glove-free.  Although not perfect, I am able to type with them at work too. Also able to access my iphone.  Great for the price too!</li>
            <li> I love these gloves.  I had some before that I was not pleased with.  I use them every night and am very happy with the results.  I am going to order a couple more pairs so I can have them available all the time.</li>
            <li> Jamzz Moisturizing Gloves  were very small Could not wear  One size does not fit all and I have small hands</li>
            <li> I LOVE these Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle Moisture Jamzz Moisturizing Gloves!  Due to hand eczema, sometimes my fingers crack and bleed, so it&#x27;s painful to touch anything. Then a few months ago, after doing research on Amazon and reading the reviews, I discovered these wonderful, comfortable gloves, that not only do they &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; and moisturize, but are thin enough that I can type and write with them on! I wear them to bed, around the house, at the office and in the car. The soft, thick stretchy cotton material protects my fingers, without getting greasy ointments and lotions all over everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle&#x27;s make these fantastic gloves in the USA, they also have the BEST customer service, supporting their products! After wearing it a day, one glove developed a small split along the seam of one of the fingers. I didn&#x27;t even have to return the gloves, but just sent an email to the company through Amazon, and within a day or two, the actual owner of the company emailed me back, offering to replace the gloves, free of charge, with a pattern of my choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend these gloves and company more highly! I now own 11 pairs, have given them as gifts, and will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rate these gloves - my dog ate them before i had a chance to try them out, lol.</li>
            <li> If you have psoriasis or eczema, don&#x27;t use! I thought this would help with my severely dry skin/flare up but your skin needs to breathe. Wearing the glove just becomes more irritated!</li>
            <li> I love the snug fit.  I bought them to use at work; I work with manila folders filled with documents.  These gloves protect my hands and wrists from paper cuts.</li>
            <li> These gloves are generously cut and have plenty of stretch to allow a great fit for most hand sizes.  I had recently bought two different types locally and found both to be be disappointing.  These are a bit more expensive but a good value.  They made an amazing difference overnight when used with O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s &amp;#34;Working Hands&amp;#34;  cream.</li>
            <li> My old gloves weren&#x27;t nearly as well made as these are so I am happy with my purchase and their easy to get on and off</li>
            <li> Love these but even for my very tiny hands they are far too tight. I wake up with marks on my hands from the seams in the cloth. If your hands are even average size.. they wont fit in these.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the OCD type with your hands, these are a must ave! I am always washing my hands, doing my nails, and using cleaning products without the proper gloves so my hands are drying out more than I would like them to. I bought these and the night I got them in the mail I was thrilled. They really do work! I would stay away from harsh chemicals that are found in most moisturizers ladies. IT PAYS TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK. Find a moisturizer that is truly going to benefit your hands. I wear these to bed with my pick of moisturizer, and in the morning I have such soft supple skin!</li>
            <li> First of all, be in the know: there are currently (as of 1/6/2014) three variations of these gloves, distinguished by the patterns on them: (1) Floral, (2) Words, and (3) Swirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are all the same material: 94% cotton, 6% spandex. This creates a night-time breathable environment for your hands, so they don&#x27;t get all sticky or slimy like with plastic/latex gloves (or those reusable rubber finger gloves). At the same time, your lotion(s) do not travel through the gloves and the outsides remain dry (unlike pure cotton gloves). This is such a miracle material! My doctor prescribed me medicated lotions to wear at night, and I started using regular cotton gloves which became saturated with the lotions on the outside; plastic gloves just made my hands feel like they were being soaked in water. These gloves (94% cotton, 6% spandex) are made of the perfect combination of materials!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they are not all the same size! The Floral and Words are the same small size (medium female, small male), while the Swirl are a bit larger (medium male ... I&#x27;m referring to my knowledge of glove sizes based on golf glove sizes). I have medium male hands, and I initially ordered the Swirl, and later ordered a Floral and Words (since I wear them at night, I don&#x27;t mind the feminine look). However, the Floral and Words were too tight for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is truly helpful, quick to respond, and genuine too about these! I am very happy about my purchase and would recommend them to others who need (or want) to wear lotion at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these with lotion and I like that I can still type easily and even still use the touchscreen on my tablet.</li>
            <li> I wear them in bed after applying hand cream to moisturize my dry winter hands&lt;br /&gt;- the fingers are slightly tight and slightly long for my small to medium hands so not suitable for thick fingers&lt;br /&gt;- medium weight, might be hot in summer but I likely won&#x27;t use them in summer&lt;br /&gt;- machine wash, hang dry - easy care&lt;br /&gt;- keeps cream on my hands and off my bedding&lt;br /&gt;- a bit pricey for cotton gloves at $10</li>
            <li> Washes well great comfort fit</li>
            <li> They fit well and do not come off at night, and they hold the moisture. They really do help when I&#x27;ve spent the day in the yard or in the work shop painting</li>
            <li> I received these as a gift.  I love them.  My hands get very dry and the cuticles start to snag and tear.  These gloves are thick and feel super!</li>
            <li> Quality was not great at the time of purchase but the seller was wonderful as she wanted to know the issues, very easy to deal with.  I don&#x27;t have eczema on my hands anymore so don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> These were not for me but the person who used them told me that they were not the greatest thing. Its not a bad thing but its not a solution.</li>
            <li> We have not tried this yet, but will try it in the future.  I think we&#x27;ll like it once tried..</li>
            <li> These gloves are snug, which they should be, but not soft. I have generally small hands and they were still tight. I wanted them to be tight enough to do things while wearing them - type, etc - but they are not soft and are a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> First time buying these type of gloves. My skin was so bad, it was starting to crack and bleed, especially on my right hand. So I read some stuff on the interwebs and decided to buy these gloves along with some moisturizer. Used both for several nights and voila, my hands were back to normal. The gloves are a soft white cotton material. I have big man hands, being a man and all, and the gloves did the trick. Don&#x27;t yank on the gloves too hard, I did pop a seem at the bottom. But they are still fine.</li>
            <li> I just bought these gloves. My hands are medium to small, but these were soooo tight! They have spandex in them, perhaps that&#x27;s why. I couldn&#x27;t sleep with them on, way too uncomfortable.  So I wore them while awake. I didn&#x27;t see much difference in my hands although I used a nice thick quality lotion with them. Guess I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
            <li> I not only use these gloves for night time hand repair but also use them for &amp;#34;fluffing&amp;#34; Christmas trees and garland. They are so form fitting that it is easy to work with them on. I have even used an old pair to pull weeds that are intertwined with some of my low ground covering.</li>
            <li> These look exactly like the picture and they fit just like the picture.  I can even use these with my ipad and iphone, which is an absolute bonus!  I will buy another pair.  These fit very well and actually noticed a difference the first night with my Jergen&#x27;s Shea Butter lotion.  You don&#x27;t need expensive lotion, these gloves work well with any lotion...and the topper?  My HUSBAND used them too! Well, I made him use them because his knuckles crack in the winter, to the point of bleeding, so after a few nights - he was very pleased.  Touch/Snuggle worthy hands!</li>
            <li> I have several types of gloves to use when moisturing my hands. These are the best, best, best.  However, the stitching did break in one spot, because I have very large hands.( My grandmother called them piano hands. They can reach one octave to the next.)  I am kind of rough when I do things, so maybe I pulled too hard. Even though, I would consider getting another pair, because they feel so good when they are on compared to the other ones I have.</li>
            <li> The package of the gloves came covered with dust, and the gloves feel cheap and like a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these gloves. Along with the cute design they are very comfortable and shipping came promptly. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this product, I was concerned that they might be too small for my hands. I decided to try them anyhow. I am 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and not a small person. I have long fingers, albeit my hands are not chubby, and these fit very well. They were snug and comfortable for wearing to bed and easy to wash. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> These gloves work as I hoped.  They have made a real difference when I lotion my hands before bed.  They are a snug fit, which helps keep them on.  The only issue I have (and it&#x27;s minor) is that a couple of the fingers are a little long so I don&#x27;t feel like all of my cuticles are getting that snug, lotion absorbing advantage that the rest of my hand is getting, but they still really work.  And unless gloves are custom, I don&#x27;t see how they can fix that problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to help with my dry hands.. While they are fairly comfortable, as soon a i put them on for the first time a rip formed along the seams of the gloves.  the bands quickly became stretched at the wrists.  I do not have big hands at all and was surprised at the ease these gloves ripped.  I messaged the seller asking for assistance but did not get a response back .</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get how these are better than a thin pair of gloves. The seams are uncomfortable (especially at the fingertips). I just wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> I have small hands but these gloves are still very tight!  By the time I have put my fingers in, the cream has come off!</li>
            <li> I use these gloves and also use the moisturing socks.  I love them.  They keep my hands and feet soft and they also help keep my  cuticles from getting dry.  Keep selling !!  Martha from Katy, Texas</li>
            <li> Works great.  Keeps my hands moisturized at night.  Love the fit and design.</li>
            <li> They have been a great benefit to me. They are soft and easy to sleep in. Thank you for making them in the USA!!</li>
            <li> I bought these in the middle of winter, hoping to get some relief from splitting fingers. These did not seem to hold in any moisture, rather, they just absorbed the lotion on my hands.</li>
            <li> I get dry hands frequently and these past few times my hands have been so bad they almost look like I have cuts in the palms of my hands...which is painful. I started looking for gloves to be able to moisturize overnight.  Ordered these and  2 other styles. These are just what I was looking for (so I am back to order a 2nd pair so as not to be without while washing one pair) They fit snug but not tight, which I was looking for. They are soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin. I have been using 100%pure Petroleum Jelly followed with Alba Botanica Natural Hawaiian hand and body lotion (that I purchased on Amazon) and my hands are already better overnight...but the secret is these gloves.  Also my gloves don&#x27;t get saturated and feel wet...they are just perfect.[[ASIN:B000ZZU97O ALBA BOTANICA Hawaiian Cocoa Butter Hand &amp; Body Lotion Value Size 24 OZ]]</li>
            <li> There are two old (10-20 years) pairs of Moisture Jamzz that I have used several nights a week. Now it is finally time for a  replacement, and will happily retire one of the senior pairs  I am grateful that I could find these tried and true gloves of the same quality on Amazon.  These are appropriate tight on my large (size 7.5/8 ) hands, and do not slip off during the night. I know that after many years, my long fingers will once again poke through the tops, and I will  darn them and then purchase another comfortable pair through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I get dry hands in the winter, so I bought these because of all the positive reviews.  While they do help, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it miraculous.  I guess I expected them to contain aloe or some kind of lotion or moisturizer - should have read up on them better, I suppose.  Things I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Swirl Pattern and received Floral.&lt;br /&gt;They are not comfortable enough to wear for more than 30 minutes - forget wearing them overnight!&lt;br /&gt;I feel they absorb a lot of the lotion that should be going into my hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this, though.  I did not have some of the problems that other reviewers have mentioned.  I did not find them small, and I have somewhat wide hands.  Also, they did not rip, I find them good quality.  For those who have trouble washing them, it seems silly that you wouldn&#x27;t wash these in your lingerie bag with your other delicates.  Just my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they do help, but I think I will buy a pair that has moisturizing gel or something in them next time, so I don&#x27;t feel like the pricey lotion that I bought is going to waste.</li>
            <li> I paid 20 bucks for cotton gloves, so I guess I deserved what I got. They&#x27;re cotton, so they suck the moisture from any ointment or cream right out of your hands. There were awesome reviews for this product, so I thought they would be awesome. Splitting at the seams after washing, and wearing holes on the finger tips after a couple weeks of wearing them.</li>
            <li> I ordered two pair of these gloves for my wife, who wanted something to keep lotion on her hands overnight. When the gloves arrived, she tried one pair on, and even though she has smaller hands, the gloves fit well. She is able to do most anything needed while wearing her gloves, including using her smartphone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered two pair after reading the reviews stating that some gloves ripped or split when first tried on. So far we have not experienced those issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would most definitely recommend these gloves if you are looking for moisturizing gloves.</li>
            <li> love these gloves! nice thick fabric, very stretchy, but they also fit my little size 6 hands. i apply moisturizer-lavender scented no-crack for hands, and pop the gloves on. they stay on all night, my hands stay warm, and are soft in the morning. a good value.</li>
            <li> I bought the Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle Moisture Moisturizing Gloves because I always get dry, cracked hands during the winter and this year has been particularly bad.  I had previously tried wearing latex gloves at night, but that experiment ultimately failed--the cracks seemed to deepen, I think because too much moisture was being trapped and the gloves did not breathe.  I have had the Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle gloves for three nights now and am already seeing improvement.  My fingers are no longer so cracked and my hands feel so much better.  I would definitely recommend these gloves to anyone who has dry hands.  My only wish is that they came in patterns/colors other than floral, swirl, and words.  I would really love a solid-color glove.</li>
            <li> gloves wash beautifully, and fit well, except fingers are long, but I am sleeping, so who cares!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone needing to wear gloves at night.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m updating this review from the original one (you can see the original below).  I&#x27;m doing this because after posting the 1st review, I was contacted by the company and they very kindly and respectfully asked if they could replace the first pair as they believed they were defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I believe they were correct!  They sent me a replacement pair and I can accurately report that they did not tear when putting them on.  (And I gave them a good tug to test them out)  Also, I wore them for several nights and have washed them and they&#x27;ve held up great!  So, my rating has changed to 5 stars!!!  They&#x27;ve been great at keeping the moisture in (as I had hoped for) overnight while wearing them and fit snug, but not too tight, which is good as many are a bit large and fall off during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing to note is that if you have VERY large hands, these are probably not for you.  Mine are medium-large and they are snug on me -- but they stay on which had been a problem with other gloves!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Original Review below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this pair of gloves at the same time as another I ordered (see my review of them here:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Earth-Therapeutics-1-pair/product-reviews/B000JF8XEQ/ref&#x3D;dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;showViewpoints&#x3D;1  ).&lt;br /&gt;While I have larger woman&#x27;s hands, these gloves seemed a little snug on my hands/fingers, yet they fingers are way long (and I don&#x27;t have a short hand either).  It isn&#x27;t a major problem, but if your hands are very large and or you have very short fingers, this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the first time I pulled them on, I was pulling kind of hard (probably since they&#x27;re so snug) and the outside seam ripped a few stitches.  Not a big deal as I can stitch it back together, but it was a bit disappointing on top of the fit.  I wouldn&#x27;t order this pair again, but would order the other ones mentioned above -- and they were about the same price.rice.</li>
            <li> I am still using my LOVE gloves.  They are lasting a&lt;br /&gt;long time.  I did have to stitch a small seam after a&lt;br /&gt;month or so.  I wash them on gentle in my wash with&lt;br /&gt;my whites or pastels and dry in my dryer.  I put&lt;br /&gt;cream on my hands and then my gloves.  My&lt;br /&gt;hands are beautiful and I am 68.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Dariah Morgan</li>
            <li> I want to address both the quality of the gloves and the integrity of the company that sells them.  First, the gloves.  One of the gloves of my first pair --the LOVE gloves--tore at the seam after wearing them twice.  I returned them to Amazon and quickly received a full refund. The second pair--WORDS--I have now worn many times and washed once without any problem.  I also own two pair of moisturizing gloves made by other companies.  These other gloves retain a wet and uncomfortable feeling caused by the moisturizing cream and also sometimes come off during sleep.  Not so the Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle gloves, which even after continued use feel quite dry and have never come off.  I highly recommend these gloves and in fact I purchased three additional pair yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the company.  Soon after the Amazon refund arrived I received an e-mail note from the company wanting to know the nature of the problem and offering me a free pair of gloves.  After I responded that I had already received a refund I received a second e-mail with a discount code for a new pair of gloves.  Initially the code did not go through and each time the company persistently and quickly responded and contacted Amazon in an effort to get the code to work.  It finally did.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m very appreciative of this company&#x27;s personal involvement and great customer service.  This is no anonymous internet company.  Each e-mail note I received was signed by a real person together with a phone number.  I think that it is important to support merchants who treat customers and others in an honest and caring manner.  My hope is that this company will be an example for others, including large corporations.</li>
            <li> Have used this over and over again. They wash up nicely. Extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> gloves started to rip after a couple washings, but they did help to retain moisture when used and protect my hands.</li>
            <li> I bought them as a gift, my daughter loves them. They stay on all night, when other gloves come off.</li>
            <li> Seams ripped on second use of gloves. I only wear them at night. My hands are small. Seems poorly made. I&#x27;ll buy different brand in future.</li>
            <li> Will try other products. My wife has used thes and they didnt hold up well.&lt;br /&gt;We tossed them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not on my BUY list.</li>
            <li> Gloves like these might be more helpful at moisturizing old, rough hands if there was a layer of plastic between 2 layers of cloth. Still, they have been helpful and unless I invent something better, they are the best I&#x27;ve seen.  Thanks -&lt;br /&gt;Chris Bell</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this purchase.  I read some mixed reviews, but ordered and I am so glad that I did! My hands take a beating every day.  I have two small children in diapers and between them and many animals I wash my hands to the point that they crack. I needed something to help moisturize my hands the only time that I don&#x27;t need to wash them: overnight.  I put on my favorite lotion and then these.  Within 2-3 days I noticed results.  The cracks in my hands started to go away and my hands felt smoother.  Best of all, they didn&#x27;t hurt anymore!  These gloves are very well made also.  I can see myself getting long use out of these.  I am going to order another pair so that I will have one when the other is in the wash.  Also very pleased that these are made in the USA.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> These gloves do the trick.  My hands had gotten to the point of being extremely dry, all the time, even after putting lotion on throughout the day.  When I go to bed now, I rub on some thick, moisturizing hand cream and put these gloves on and I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference.  I probably wear them 5 nights a week and am very satisfied with the product.  If you have any lotions/creams that are incredibly thick or greasy and hard to get all the way rubbed into your skin; use them with these gloves at night—you get the benefit of the extreme moisture without getting your greasy hands all over everything.  Satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> Reading the negative reviews, I was afraid these gloves would rip. But I&#x27;ve used them for more than a month now, every night, and they haven&#x27;t ripped! I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4 and my hands aren&#x27;t large, but they aren&#x27;t small either. These gloves feel really soft and comfortable, and they&#x27;re easy to wash too. Five stars!</li>
            <li> Many reviews comment that these gloves are nothing but cotton gloves but THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. They are simply light cotton/spandex gloves which hold in the lotion all night in my hands and don&#x27;t interfere with my sleeping. I have a pair of GEL filled gloves from Bath &amp; Body Works which I find uncomfortable and hot to sleep in (not to mention my cat cannot stand me petting her while wearing them). I had a pair of 100% cotton lotion/sleep gloves from Avon and they have fallen apart and I needed a replacement.  I do not find these gloves in any stores locally so I turned to Amazon. These Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle Moisture gloves have some spandex added so I like the fit even more compared to my last pair which was made of 100% cotton.  These gloves feel more sturdy that my Avon ones I have used for years and I am VERY happy with the product. I plan to buy more now that I know they are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am a guy with dry hands and my wife uses the gloves occasionally for dry skin. I tried them with a typical moisturizer and have to admit my hands felt amazing the next day after wearing them overnight. The thing about them is that the benefits of moisture delivery over a period of time without being cumbersome and feeling weird while wearing them. The light stretchy fabric was comfortable on my large hands even though these were too small for me. I read a few reviews about the gloves being too tight and ripping, but those reviewers might have been weight-lifting in them with giant hands or something. I am going to wear them instead of my drumming gloves at my band&#x27;s next rehearsal and check back in about durability.</li>
            <li> I purchased these gloves specifically because of all the rave reviews.  When they arrived, I thought they seemed okay but nothing special.  Still, I looked forward to using them.  After just two uses the seam was already splitting open and there was a little hole near the palm.  These are pretty pricey for just two uses.  I definitely would not recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  Just wanted to note that today, 12/24/12 I received a new, free pair of these gloves unsolicited from the seller.  I appreciate that she wanted to stand behind her merchandise and to keep good will with her customers.  It&#x27;s a classy act and much appreciated.  I&#x27;ll re-rate these in a couple of weeks based on the new pair.  Thanks, Lynn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit # 2:  12/30/12  This is an update based on the free pair I received from the seller.  Sorry Lynn, but this pair wasn&#x27;t any better.  The seam ripped when I put them on the very first time.  And it ripped in exactly the same place as it did with the first pair.  (Outer seam below fingers at meaty part of hand) I took a picture of it, in fact.  Now, to be clear, I have what I would consider average sized hands, so it&#x27;s not as though they are ripping because my hands are large.  I just think the sewing is inadequate or maybe they are not using the proper thread for a stretchy item.  At any rate, I do appreciate your gesture of good will and I am glad to know that some people have had positive experiences with the gloves.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these but they were way too tight on my small-medium sized hands. Returned them ASAP.</li>
