            <li>Great razor for the money!</li>
            <li>One of the problems I have with it is that it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job at shaving the mustache area.  </li>
            <li>It was a great shaver</li>
            <li>-great</li>
            <li>These razors work great, even if you do not use an electric razor every day.</li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t arrive in time to be under the tree, he was thrilled!  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>It got here in good time with no hassle.</li>
            <li>Gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>Because the product is a good quality Norelco electric shaver, I gave 2 stars.</li>
            <li>A good, reliable shaver.</li>
            <li>The Norelco delivers a much-soother, more-comfortable shave and has an amazing number a shaves between battery recharges.</li>
            <li>Also the ability to clean it under running water is a great timesaver.</li>
            <li>Very nice razor, but my original 7310 had a leather travel bag, this one didn&#x27;t have it, i missed it.</li>
            <li>I love my razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad, because it met every expectation.</li>
            <li>I woud have prefered a re-charge coiled cord rather than the straight one provided but all in all a good buy.</li>
            <li>Gives a shave very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I heartily recommend this shaver to anyone needing a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Shaves close and just an overall great product.</li>
            <li>clean it under running water  -lightweight    </li>
            <li>(I find it&#x27;s still hard to get a perfect line up by my sideburns</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good enough.)  </li>
            <li>My Remington foil shavor did a better job in that area and that was with older blades.  </li>
            <li>Not as close as with a non-electric razor and shaving cream, but certainly amazingly quick.  </li>
            <li>cuts the hair off my face quickly and painlessly.... get aftershave balm with aloe.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just looking for a cheap electric razor and you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, maybe this will be fine for you.  </li>
            <li>I hope that if proves its worth and value, but time will tell.  </li>
            <li>I bought this when my old Norelco 985RX (from about 1992 -- I think it was the top of Norelco&#x27;s line)</li>
            <li>When I tried it I was pleasantly surprised that it got most of the hairs -- with a bit of manipulation I found it got almost all of them.</li>
            <li>It feels a bit rougher on my skin than my old Norelco, but it&#x27;s still better than dragging a blade across my face.  </li>
            <li>he charged it right up and gave it a whirl and pronounced it \\&quot;just what I wanted...\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It is very light in weight and quiet.</li>
            <li>When I first started shaving over 30 years ago, I used a Norelco tripleheader.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve bought over many years.</li>
            <li>Each one is improved better than the last one.</li>
            <li>This was his first razor.</li>
            <li>It was professional, quick and fast with the service.</li>
            <li>So with this replacement I wasa just looking for a decent razor that would allow me to do that first pass.</li>
            <li>I purchased to  whole razor for the price of the heads.</li>
            <li>Upon opening, the box was very damaged with every corner smashed and dented.</li>
            <li>, I researched this norelco, Not only does it do a better job than my old remington, I now use this instead of my blade razor, It cuts very close.</li>
            <li>I was dubious about buying an electronic from a private dealer, but it was in the original packageing and did have all the warranty info...,</li>
            <li>I had used that razor regularly for a first pass, then would follow with a regular safety razor as the Norelco always missed many hairs on my neck and along my jawline.  </li>
            <li>A full charge lasts about ten shaves for me (almost an hour of runtime?).  </li>
            <li>full charge takes 8 hours -- only an inconvenience if you don&#x27;t plan ahead</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried Norelco in the past with great success, but noticed that the different models have vastly differing prices, so</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase it for less than the cost of replacement heads.</li>
            <li>An inexpensive razor that does a decent job of shaving.  </li>
            <li>Works well, though I miss the LED indicator that shows how much battery life remains, like my old Norelco had.</li>
            <li>This item was exactly what I wanted and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>but it was very loud and eventually I could not find replacement blades.</li>
            <li>At first, I couldn&#x27;t believe this could possibly shave my beard, but it did.</li>
            <li>Ever since I&#x27;ve received this razor I&#x27;ve used it exclusively -- the first time in my life I haven&#x27;t had to use a regular razor to touch up areas</li>
            <li>I bought a lower end one for my 17 year old.</li>
            <li>My old reminington just up and quit on me</li>
            <li>any more than any other electric shaver -- I regularly shave off several days of hair</li>
            <li>I needed a new razor to replace my Braun, which just doesn&#x27;t get all the different types of whiskers on a guys face.  </li>
            <li>Dont know about the super heavy beards.</li>
            <li>But if your skin is sensitive to multiple passes from a razor, this is not the one to buy.</li>

            <li> This is a good product.  I was just looking for replacement heads when I bought this.  I purchased to  whole razor for the price of the heads.</li>
            <li> This shaver replaced a Remington triple-head \\&quot;floating \\&quot; electric shaver. The Norelco delivers a much-soother, more-comfortable shave and has an amazing number a shaves between battery recharges. Great razor for the money!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my hubby a few days before Christmas.  While it didn&#x27;t arrive in time to be under the tree, he was thrilled!

            <li> When I first started shaving over 30 years ago, I used a Norelco tripleheader. For some reason, I stopped using an electric and began using a blade. A couple years ago, I went back to electrics and used a Remington. It was a great shaver but it was very loud and eventually I could not find replacement blades. After agonizing over reviews on multiple sites, I decided to give this shaver a try. What a shock! I haven&#x27;t had a shave this close in years and without any irritation. It is very light in weight and quiet. At first, I couldn&#x27;t believe this could possibly shave my beard, but it did. I was able to purchase it for less than the cost of replacement heads. I heartily recommend this shaver to anyone needing a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I love my razor. It got here in good time with no hassle. The only negative is that I saw it at my local grocery for the same price.</li>
            <li> I needed a new razor to replace my Braun, which just doesn&#x27;t get all the different types of whiskers on a guys face.  I&#x27;d tried Norelco in the past with great success, but noticed that the different models have vastly differing prices, so I read the reviews on Amazon and several of them pointed me to this model.  I&#x27;m glad, because it met every expectation.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I wanted and exactly what I expected. It was professional, quick and fast with the service.</li>
            <li> Works well, though I miss the LED indicator that shows how much battery life remains, like my old Norelco had. Gives a good shave. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve received this razor I&#x27;ve used it exclusively -- the first time in my life I haven&#x27;t had to use a regular razor to touch up areas my electric couldn&#x27;t get.  I bought this when my old Norelco 985RX (from about 1992 -- I think it was the top of Norelco&#x27;s line) finally died.  I had used that razor regularly for a first pass, then would follow with a regular safety razor as the Norelco always missed many hairs on my neck and along my jawline.  Back in the early 1990&#x27;s prior to using the Norelco I had used both a Remington and Braun and concluded that electric razors just couldn&#x27;t completely replace a regular razor -- at least for me. So with this replacement I wasa just looking for a decent razor that would allow me to do that first pass. When I tried it I was pleasantly surprised that it got most of the hairs -- with a bit of manipulation I found it got almost all of them. (I find it&#x27;s still hard to get a perfect line up by my sideburns but it&#x27;s good enough.)  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s changed with the Norelco technology but it&#x27;s a vast improvement. Also the ability to clean it under running water is a great timesaver. It is also much lighter than my nearly 20-year old Norelco which I used to leave behind on flights as I didn&#x27;t care for the extra weight in my carry-on. It feels a bit rougher on my skin than my old Norelco, but it&#x27;s still better than dragging a blade across my face.  Some reviewers commented that with longer stubble it yanked hairs, but I haven&#x27;t it do that any more than any other electric shaver -- I regularly shave off several days of hair and I just move it a bit slower when doing that.  A full charge lasts about ten shaves for me (almost an hour of runtime?).  Blade speed seems to slow a bit if you let the battery get close to empty.    Pros:  -great shave  -inexpensive  -can clean it under running water  -lightweight    Cons:  -no battery charge level indicator  -a full charge takes 8 hours -- only an inconvenience if you don&#x27;t plan ahead</li>
            <li> Because the product is a good quality Norelco electric shaver, I gave 2 stars. Be wary of this seller, my package arrived in a thin USPS envelope... Upon opening, the box was very damaged with every corner smashed and dented. This is a Christmas gift for someone, so I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> ORDERED&lt;br /&gt;WAITED AND WAITED&lt;br /&gt;BANGED MY CARD AND NEVER SHIPPED.&lt;br /&gt;MYSTERIOUSLY THERE WERE ONLY 2 LEFT AND BOTH WERE DAMAGED.&lt;br /&gt;RETURNED THE MONEY AND OFFERED NOTHING AS ALTERNATIVE.&lt;br /&gt;PRETTY SHADY FOLKS IF YOU ASK ME.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, I would buy it again</li>
            <li> An inexpensive razor that does a decent job of shaving.  One of the problems I have with it is that it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job at shaving the mustache area.  My Remington foil shavor did a better job in that area and that was with older blades.  Even with the cheek and neck areas though, the Norelco razor needs multiple passes to get a semi-close shave.  If you&#x27;re just looking for a cheap electric razor and you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, maybe this will be fine for you.  But if your skin is sensitive to multiple passes from a razor, this is not the one to buy.</li>
            <li> This product is exactlt what I was looking for. These razors work great, even if you do not use an electric razor every day.</li>
            <li> Gives a shave very quickly.  Not as close as with a non-electric razor and shaving cream, but certainly amazingly quick.  I find it somewhat irritating on my neck, however, so if I want a reasonably close shave there I&#x27;ll get out the standard razor and cream.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve bought over many years. Why? Because it&#x27;s a fantastic product. They have always lasted at least 1 1/2 year beyond what they&#x27;re supposed to. Each one is improved better than the last one. I used this one to shave for 12 days before it needed recharged. (And that even included trimming my mustache.)</li>
            <li> cuts the hair off my face quickly and painlessly.... get aftershave balm with aloe. It&#x27;s a serious time saver does what it says. I bought a lower end one for my 17 year old.</li>
            <li> My old reminington just up and quit on me, I researched this norelco, Not only does it do a better job than my old remington, I now use this instead of my blade razor, It cuts very close. I wold recomend this shaver to anyone. Dont know about the super heavy beards.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, the unit seemed to have a weaker motor than earlier models.  But it works well enough.  I woud have prefered a re-charge coiled cord rather than the straight one provided but all in all a good buy.</li>
            <li> A good, reliable shaver.</li>
            <li> ordered this for my dad and he loves it!!!!!!! Shaves close and just an overall great product. This was his first razor.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor, but my original 7310 had a leather travel bag, this one didn&#x27;t have it, i missed it.</li>
