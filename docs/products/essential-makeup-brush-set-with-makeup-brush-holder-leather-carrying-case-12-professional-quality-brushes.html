            <li>a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and they miss out on important brushes like your blending brushing and highlighting brush.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean too.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with the contour brush, that&#x27;s my absolute favorite.</li>

            <li>I love discovering new makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>In case you aren&#x27;t aware!</li>
            <li>brush itself is made of pony hair which is very sturdy and smooth on touch.</li>
            <li>so it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>The quality seems nice but my pickiness noticed a few things I was not in love with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually has its own lid.  </li>
            <li>Makeup Brush Set - 6 Professional Quality Brushes in a Stylish Leopard Print Travel Case&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to see the case and handles in another color, like charcoal or even an deep purple, etc.</li>
            <li>The case, the super high quality brushes, the labelled brushes!!</li>
            <li>In addition, if you have to move your makeup brushes daily because you don’t have enough room to keep them out when you do your makeup they are very easy to move around because of the nice leather cases this comes with.</li>
            <li>It picks up just the right about of product and evenly appies it to your face.</li>
            <li>Filberts / Chisels are a bit firmer, where you need them to be, each brush has the right angle for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>With some companies the case looks good on the outside and you find that it is mostly for looks, but even on the inside, you can tell this case is meant not only to look cute, but to last, and protect your brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also is easy to travel with because you just put one of the cylinder holders on top of the other with all your brushes inside and woolah.</li>
            <li>It is important to clean and condition your brushes regularly.</li>
            <li>Granddaughter says they are perfect &amp; they look so expensive.</li>
            <li>The blending quality of the brushes are exactly what you want from a makeup brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are several things I like about these brushes compared to most on the market.</li>
            <li>I feel like many blush brushes are way to big!  </li>
            <li>I have received so many different compliments on my makeup since I started using these.</li>
            <li>This balance is important for functionality and frequent use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda odd,but its soft, lightweight and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Washing them first will prevent the shedding onto your face while doing your makeup.</li>
            <li>While most sets have these they are different to these as these are more of your short blending and your tapered brush</li>
            <li>I am hoping with time they will go away but some other brushes I own have never shed at all.</li>
            <li>They feel good in your hand, there&#x27;s very little product fallout, there wasn&#x27;t any &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; that came out of the brushes (This is a well known issue with other brush lines), and best of all there was little to no shedding when I washed them.  </li>
            <li>and I never guarantee a positive review</li>
            <li>Large Wider Mop (1.75&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Aluminium is remarkable for the metal&#x27;s low density and for its ability to resist corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation.</li>
            <li>I tried the &amp;#34;tug test&amp;#34; and I had none come loose, which is a good sign they are properly glued.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thoughts: The mops and rounds have a sweet spot - they are meant to be used in the central top part, initially, then once most of the powder is blended the other areas of the brush come in to play.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended makeup brush set with case!</li>
            <li>Not as much color pay off&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a flight attendant</li>
            <li>I really like these handles</li>

            <li>The brushes blend any foundation very well whether it&#x27;s a liquid, powder and cream foundation.</li>

            <li>They all have long smooth handles and the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>This set has all the key important brushes you could possible need.</li>
            <li>The brushes tend to not pick up as much color and instead will fan it around meaning you get more loose powder that drifts off into the air or into other areas of the skin.</li>
            <li>This product was received at low cost for review and inspection purposes, No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>this formula the same way as you would any commercial spray or quick dip brush cleaner.  </li>

            <li>I noticed they grabbed a lot of powder, if used directly from a palette or pot, which is prone to leaving excess and not blending as well.</li>
            <li>It made me wonder if there are combo brushes (natural hair &amp; synthetic)?</li>
            <li>If you use a lot of natural hair brushes, you MUST condition them periodically.</li>

            <li>The pink leather holder was a nice addition to my cosmetic vanity and is thick and very well made.</li>

            <li>Worth the $17 or so dollars I paid for it but definitely not worth the $59 or so dollars I saw as the retail price.</li>
            <li>brush is light pink with pink metal and ultra-soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Most makeup brushes I have tried shed like crazy which wasn&#x27;t fun when it would shed by my eyes.</li>
            <li>Worth a discounted price of $20 or less though.</li>
            <li>It made my shadow pretty powdery as well which other brushes don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not at all surprising that they don&#x27;t rank right beside them</li>
            <li>It fits very well in the small places as well as the large places on your face.  </li>

            <li> I love discovering new makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> In case you aren&#x27;t aware!</li>
            <li> brush itself is made of pony hair which is very sturdy and smooth on touch.</li>
            <li> so it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> The quality seems nice but my pickiness noticed a few things I was not in love with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually has its own lid.  </li>
            <li> Makeup Brush Set - 6 Professional Quality Brushes in a Stylish Leopard Print Travel Case&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to see the case and handles in another color, like charcoal or even an deep purple, etc.</li>
            <li> The case, the super high quality brushes, the labelled brushes!!</li>
            <li> In addition, if you have to move your makeup brushes daily because you don’t have enough room to keep them out when you do your makeup they are very easy to move around because of the nice leather cases this comes with.</li>
            <li> It picks up just the right about of product and evenly appies it to your face.</li>
            <li> Filberts / Chisels are a bit firmer, where you need them to be, each brush has the right angle for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> With some companies the case looks good on the outside and you find that it is mostly for looks, but even on the inside, you can tell this case is meant not only to look cute, but to last, and protect your brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also is easy to travel with because you just put one of the cylinder holders on top of the other with all your brushes inside and woolah.</li>
            <li> It is important to clean and condition your brushes regularly.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter says they are perfect &amp; they look so expensive.</li>
            <li> The blending quality of the brushes are exactly what you want from a makeup brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are several things I like about these brushes compared to most on the market.</li>
            <li> I feel like many blush brushes are way to big!  </li>
            <li> I have received so many different compliments on my makeup since I started using these.</li>
            <li> This balance is important for functionality and frequent use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda odd,but its soft, lightweight and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Washing them first will prevent the shedding onto your face while doing your makeup.</li>
            <li> While most sets have these they are different to these as these are more of your short blending and your tapered brush</li>
            <li> I am hoping with time they will go away but some other brushes I own have never shed at all.</li>
            <li> They feel good in your hand, there&#x27;s very little product fallout, there wasn&#x27;t any &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; that came out of the brushes (This is a well known issue with other brush lines), and best of all there was little to no shedding when I washed them.  </li>
            <li> and I never guarantee a positive review</li>
            <li> Large Wider Mop (1.75&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Aluminium is remarkable for the metal&#x27;s low density and for its ability to resist corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation.</li>
            <li> I tried the &amp;#34;tug test&amp;#34; and I had none come loose, which is a good sign they are properly glued.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thoughts: The mops and rounds have a sweet spot - they are meant to be used in the central top part, initially, then once most of the powder is blended the other areas of the brush come in to play.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended makeup brush set with case!</li>
            <li> Not as much color pay off&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a flight attendant</li>
            <li> I really like these handles</li>

            <li> The brushes blend any foundation very well whether it&#x27;s a liquid, powder and cream foundation.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a combo of synthetic (most likely Nylon) and natural goat hair.</li>

            <li> They all have long smooth handles and the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how large the set was when it arrived in the mail.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the bushes are gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> This set has all the key important brushes you could possible need.</li>
            <li> The brushes tend to not pick up as much color and instead will fan it around meaning you get more loose powder that drifts off into the air or into other areas of the skin.</li>
            <li> This product was received at low cost for review and inspection purposes, No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li> this formula the same way as you would any commercial spray or quick dip brush cleaner.  </li>

            <li> I noticed they grabbed a lot of powder, if used directly from a palette or pot, which is prone to leaving excess and not blending as well.</li>
            <li> It made me wonder if there are combo brushes (natural hair &amp; synthetic)?</li>
            <li> If you use a lot of natural hair brushes, you MUST condition them periodically.</li>

            <li> The pink leather holder was a nice addition to my cosmetic vanity and is thick and very well made.</li>

            <li> Worth the $17 or so dollars I paid for it but definitely not worth the $59 or so dollars I saw as the retail price.</li>
            <li> brush is light pink with pink metal and ultra-soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Most makeup brushes I have tried shed like crazy which wasn&#x27;t fun when it would shed by my eyes.</li>
            <li> Worth a discounted price of $20 or less though.</li>
            <li> It made my shadow pretty powdery as well which other brushes don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not at all surprising that they don&#x27;t rank right beside them</li>
            <li> It fits very well in the small places as well as the large places on your face.  </li>

            <li> Although, it was nothing to serious I would still suggest purchasing this set for the beauty and the other brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li> This comes with a complete set of brushes all with different shapes and sizes for different purposes.</li>
            <li> They come in a very sleek black box.  </li>
            <li> All of the other sets I have bought or reviewed never come with these two particular brushes and they are an essential.</li>
            <li> Large Round (1.75&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> have own several sets of make up brushes and had high expectations for this set which is why I may have been a little disappointed when they didn&#x27;t meet my high standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> : After my initial use, I started adding a little bit of the powders or liquids, I wanted to use, on my left hand at the base of my thumb - it was easier to portion the amount on the brush head this way, and I prefer to work this way as well, the overall blending on the skin was then, flawless - with these brushes - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too soft or too firm</li>
            <li> The wooden part of the brush is sturdy and in no way flimsy, and the ends are soft, and you can tell that they won&#x27;t she&#x27;d like some other brands, they are connected tightly to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the brushes cost much less than my much more expensive ones</li>

            <li> This is my review of the Essential Makeup Brush Set. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off, the case is gorgeous, sturdy and we&#x27;ll made. I love the material and the color. With some companies the case looks good on the outside and you find that it is mostly for looks, but even on the inside, you can tell this case is meant not only to look cute, but to last, and protect your brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the brushes themselves, which are amazing I must say. You really do get every brush that you could possibly need in this collecrion. The brushes are incredibly soft, I can&#x27;t even feel the powder brush against my face, and it smooths everything so evenly. I am in love with the contour brush, that&#x27;s my absolute favorite. The shadow brushes work perfectly, everything goes on smoothly and evenly. The blending quality of the brushes are exactly what you want from a makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very best thing about this set though. Ever single brush is LABELED. For someone like me who is kind of new to pampering myself with nice makeup tools. It&#x27;s nice to know exactly what each brush is for and what it can do. And I must say just one more time. The brushes are very good quality. The wooden part of the brush is sturdy and in no way flimsy, and the ends are soft, and you can tell that they won&#x27;t she&#x27;d like some other brands, they are connected tightly to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love these brushes and I would be happy to but more products from the seller that I purchased these from.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:8d5866345e796d22ae13d72a79e44d37]]This Essential Makeup Brush Set is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set includes 12 makeup brushes which include:&lt;br /&gt;Foundation Brush&lt;br /&gt;Blush Brush&lt;br /&gt;Powder Brush&lt;br /&gt;Concealer Brush&lt;br /&gt;Contouring Brush&lt;br /&gt;Lip Brush&lt;br /&gt;2 Eye Blending Brushes&lt;br /&gt;Eye Shading&lt;br /&gt;Eye Definer&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrow Brush&lt;br /&gt;Lip Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this set everyday and it hasn&#x27;t had any major shedding.  The brushes are very soft and they feel fantastic on your skinThey blend your makeup perfectly and leave your makeup looking flawless.&lt;br /&gt;I love the container that you store your brushes in while not in use.  This container ensures that your brushes don&#x27;t get dust on your brushes.  This is a really awesome brush set.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to purchase during a promotion to test and review.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:2942eade8cd83785505fdd9b66eb9e30]]This review is for the Essential Makeup Brush Set - With Makeup Brush Holder - Leather Carrying Case 12 Professional Quality Brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a BEAUTIFUL brush set with 12 different options for putting on makeup. I was surprised by how large the set was when it arrived in the mail. The brushes came nestled in a container and each brush was individually wrapped. The brushes are truly lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush is light pink with pink metal and ultra-soft bristles. The brushes apply makeup without any streaks or lines. The ends are so soft and high quality that it picks up my makeup perfectly and goes on smooth. There are several different brushes for mineral make up powder (which I use), contouring, eye makeup, eyebrow makeup and lips! I find that it applies my face powder which is mineral powder perfectly and quickly and the makeup doesn&#x27;t fall off the brushes and get all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is high quality synthetic leather and light pink much like the rest of the set. It is great for travel or displaying your brushes. I set it on my counter and it keeps my brushes nice and safe. I love this set! 5/5 stars for value, quality and design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a discounted promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes! This comes with a complete set of brushes all with different shapes and sizes for different purposes. It has all kinds of different brushes for any need you have. This set will help you to get the look that want when applying your makeup. They all have long smooth handles and the brushes are very soft. I love the blush brush a lot and the angled eyeliner brush. It helps to blend in my eyeliner so it looks more natural. In addition to the makeup brushes, you also get the brush holder, which helps to keep all your brushes neat and organized all together. It also is easy to travel with because you just put one of the cylinder holders on top of the other with all your brushes inside and woolah. They can easily travel with you. Now you can always have all your makeup brushes together when you travel. This was a great idea and I love that. None of the brushes will ever be squished or lost in this cylinder case. The makeup brushes stay protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also looks quite nice on your dresser or in your bathroom; wherever it is you apply your makeup. The leather pink cylinder cases are cute and attractive and hold all the brushes nicely. In addition, if you have to move your makeup brushes daily because you don’t have enough room to keep them out when you do your makeup they are very easy to move around because of the nice leather cases this comes with. Just pop the lid of one case onto the other case and they are protected from dust and the little pink case looks like a decorative item. I was so excited to buy this product with a discount for an honest review and I could not be more pleased with it. Highly recommended makeup brush set with case!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:92d582c35bd8f31490e2bf88c4e9b490]] Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great Looking Set&lt;br /&gt;- GREAT Variety of Brushes&lt;br /&gt;- Each is labeled for use.&lt;br /&gt;- Nice Packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Bristles came off&lt;br /&gt;- Some stray hair&lt;br /&gt;- Not as much color pay off&lt;br /&gt;- Made shadows powdery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have own several sets of make up brushes and had high expectations for this set which is why I may have been a little disappointed when they didn&#x27;t meet my high standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several things I like about these brushes compared to most on the market. I love the case and packaging but most of all I LOVE the variety of brushes. So many other sets come with the same brush but in different sizes and they miss out on important brushes like your blending brushing and highlighting brush. This set has all the key important brushes you could possible need. The quality seems nice but my pickiness noticed a few things I was not in love with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few stray bristles. This typically doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and it didn&#x27;t here. What was a bit upsetting was the bristles coming off when I used them even after washing them. I am hoping with time they will go away but some other brushes I own have never shed at all. Another thing was the color pay off. That has become something I look for the most because it is important but we don&#x27;t think about it. The brushes tend to not pick up as much color and instead will fan it around meaning you get more loose powder that drifts off into the air or into other areas of the skin. It made my shadow pretty powdery as well which other brushes don&#x27;t. I also have to use about three swipes of color to skin to get the same pigmentation as brushes that use 2 swipes. Just something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the brushes cost much less than my much more expensive ones so it&#x27;s not at all surprising that they don&#x27;t rank right beside them but I was hoping for a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they would still make a great gift and are affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at a complimentary discount for my honest and unbiased review.ew.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this brush set.  I was so impressed as soon as I opened the package.  They come in a very sleek black box.  The pink container is so well made.  I love that it protects the brushes from being smashed!  It can also be used to hold your brushes on your vanity, both the top and bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that all of the brushes are labeled with their name.  They look so &amp;#34;high end!&amp;#34;  On the other side of each brush is the brand name, Thammik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are so soft. Not one hair has fallen out.  I have washed and used these several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is the face contour brush.  I like the shape.  It fits very well in the small places as well as the large places on your face.  I have used it for finishing powder and contour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the powder brush for powder!  It picks up just the right about of product and evenly appies it to your face. It leaves a flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blush brush is the perfect size for me.  I feel like many blush brushes are way to big!  Not this one! It applies product evenly and not messy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip brush is so fun!  I had no idea until I received it.  It actually has its own lid.  (Picture included)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors used for this set are astounding.  The metal and pink look very expensive.  I am so happy with this set!</li>
            <li> These make up brushes art all this seller says and MORE!!! Honestly I even purchase another set from them. I work in a salon and have for 20 years. I Promise you will LOVE these  brushes and the case they come in is FANTASTIC!!! You will be thrilled with these!</li>
            <li> I love everything about this set! The case, the super high quality brushes, the labelled brushes!! I&#x27;m a flight attendant so I bought both Thammik sets. The compact set for travel and this set or home. Professional quality. Wishes I&#x27;d bought sooner. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great high-quality make up brushes</li>
            <li> I am a big makeup fanatic but I always have a hard time finding quality makeup brushes to use.&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited when I saw how beautiful these brushes are and how high quality they are.&lt;br /&gt;They are nice and soft which makes it very easy to apply makeup. The eyeshadow brush blends my shadow beautifully and makes it so easy to get the shadow look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes in a beautiful leather case with 12 different brushes that are labeled on each one so you know what to use it for. Most makeup brushes I have tried shed like crazy which wasn&#x27;t fun when it would shed by my eyes. These brushes Don&#x27;t shed at all and I even tugged on them and nothing came loose which is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister in law is a makeup artist and she was even impressed with these brushes and very jealous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are made from premium goat hair and top of the line synthetic bristles but I can&#x27;t tell which is which because they are all so soft.&lt;br /&gt;My makeup has never looked this great before. I have received so many different compliments on my makeup since I started using these. My friends asked me what expensive makeup I purchased. When in reality i&#x27;m still using the same makeup that I have been. So I guess the brush you use makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really love that you can store your makeup brushes in the leather case that they come in. I do clean my brushes after use so they stay looking nice and makeup doesn&#x27;t get all over the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** This product was received at low cost for review and inspection purposes, No compensation for a positive review was provided.

            <li> When choosing brushes - do not get sucked into gimmicky finishes on the ferrules or handles, you need brushes that are functional. Don&#x27;t always assume price is a decider on quality - that isn&#x27;t always the case! Especially with brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What You Get: (1) Apricot Colored Faux-leather case / holder (8 1/2&amp;#34; inch height x 80mm [outer circumference] 70mm [inner circumference] / 3.25&amp;#34; inch x 2.25&amp;#34; inch width total), Brushes with apricot colored, straight sided, rounded composite handles, apricot tinted aluminum ferrules, Toe to heel measurements:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Large Wider Mop (1.75&amp;#34; inch height x 2&amp;#34; inch at widest point) , Powder Brush,&lt;br /&gt;(1) Large Round (1.75&amp;#34; inch height x 1.5&amp;#34; inch at widest point) - Angled, Face Contour Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1) Medium Mop (1.25&amp;#34; inch height x 1.33&amp;#34; inches at widest point) , Blush Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1) Medium Filbert / Chisel (1.25&amp;#34; inch height x .75&amp;#34; inch at widest point) , Foundation Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1) Small Mop - Angled (.75&amp;#34; inch height x .75&amp;#34; inch at widest point), Eye highlight Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1) Small Filbert / Chisel  (.64&amp;#34; inch height x .80&amp;#34; inch at widest point) Concealer Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1) Small Square / Flat  (.45&amp;#34; inch height x .45&amp;#34; inch at widest point) Eye Definer Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1) Small Round - Angled (.60&amp;#34; inch height x .30&amp;#34; inch at widest point) Eye Blending Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1) Small Filbert / Chisel (.50&amp;#34; inch height x .30&amp;#34; inch at widest point) Eye Blending Brush,&lt;br /&gt;(1) Small Angled Shader (.30&amp;#34; inch height x .30&amp;#34; inch at widest point) Eyebrow Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1) Small Filbert / Chisel (.40&amp;#34; inch height x .30&amp;#34; inch at widest point) Eye Shader Brush&lt;br /&gt;(1) Small Fine Filbert / Chisel (.50&amp;#34; inch height x .25&amp;#34; inch at widest point) Lip Brush with Aluminum Lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Brushes. These brushes are a combo of synthetic (most likely Nylon) and natural goat hair. It is common for a few hairs to come loose in a new set - I tried the &amp;#34;tug test&amp;#34; and I had none come loose, which is a good sign they are properly glued.  It is important to clean and condition your brushes regularly. (see cons below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts: The mops and rounds have a sweet spot - they are meant to be used in the central top part, initially, then once most of the powder is blended the other areas of the brush come in to play. I noticed they grabbed a lot of powder, if used directly from a palette or pot, which is prone to leaving excess and not blending as well. It made me wonder if there are combo brushes (natural hair &amp; synthetic)? These brushed tend to streak powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Filberts / Chisels are a bit firmer, where you need them to be, each brush has the right angle for it&#x27;s purpose. I found the angle of lip brush to be very helpful as well, in getting that perfect cupids bow ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: After my initial use, I started adding a little bit of the powders or liquids, I wanted to use, on my left hand at the base of my thumb - it was easier to portion the amount on the brush head this way, and I prefer to work this way as well, the overall blending on the skin was then, flawless - with these brushes - a little goes a long way. These brushes glide over the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Ferrules. Aluminium is remarkable for the metal&#x27;s low density and for its ability to resist corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation. This is a rust-free material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush ferrule contains multiple crimp rings at the base - this is important, as just gluing a ferrule to the handle, without crimping, is a sign of poor craftsmanship and makes for no durability. The size of the ferrule is balanced with the handle size and brush head, as well. This balance is important for functionality and frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the that they had both form and functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Handles. These handles are Apricot colored composite, with a matte finish. They are all straight barrel (round) handleswith a rounded end. I really like these handles, their thickness is dependant on their brush heads, so they are thicker for the larger mops and thinner with the smaller filberts. I found them to be really comfortable to grip, because they have straight sides you can slide your fingers closer toward the ferrule for more control - depending on the brush and makeup application. They are very light, as well which helps ease hand fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ If your brushes have solid hardwood or composite wood handles…DO NOT submerge them in water. Wood handles are porous and will absorb water. This will cause the handle to expand (when wet) and contract (when dry). The expanding wood will stretch the ferrule where the handle is inserted and cause the entire brush head to become loose or possibly fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Brushes CAN NOT be submerged in water. If you are cleaning, you must only clean the bristles. You can use a Detox shampoo found in most salons, that will help strip residue off your bristles - but shampoo will NOT disinfect them. See the recipes / techniques below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix 1 part shampoo to 4 parts warm (not hot) water in a small bowl or mug.  Dip the brush head in the solution then gently massage it through the bristles.  Rinse the bristles well with warm water and squeeze the excess water out of the brush with a towel.  Reshape the bristles and lay them out on paper towels.  If you can, lay the brushes on a counter with the bristles hanging over the edge.  This will allow air to circulate all around the brush head to dry faster.  NEVER stand your brushes up to dry.  The moisture will seep back into the handle, loosen glue, and rot or warp the wood.  It will also cause the bristles to ‘splay’ or fan out and dry in a different shape than desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For disinfection and regular cleaning:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin’s Homemade Brush Cleaner (updated formula – December 2014)&lt;br /&gt;Mix together:&lt;br /&gt;13 oz of 70% Isopropyl or Ethyl Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;2 oz Cosmetic Grade Acetone (available at reputable beauty suppliers)&lt;br /&gt;1 oz Dow Corning 244 Fluid (available at all pro makeup resources).&lt;br /&gt;Essential fragrance oils to scent the cleaner (optional)&lt;br /&gt;Liquid food color to tint the cleaner (optional)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This formula does not contain emulsifying ingredients (which are unnecessary), so it must be shaken before each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my favorite fragrance combinations are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grapefruit/Rose&lt;br /&gt;Lavender/Amber&lt;br /&gt;Ginger/Bergamot&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Orange/Vanilla/Mint&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential oils of Tea Tree or Grapefruit Seed will add antibacterial properties to your homemade brush cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;Use this formula the same way as you would any commercial spray or quick dip brush cleaner.

Massage some Jojoba, Flax Seed or Hemp Oil into the DRY bristles and let it sit for about 5 minutes.  DO NOT RINSE.  Add a small amount of shampoo directly to the bristles and massage it into the oil.  Now begin to add small amounts of water until lather appears.  Rinse and dry as described previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[source:COSMETICS JUNKIE™ Blog, &amp;#34;Cleaning Makeup Brushes Correctly&amp;#34;,05/18/2013 by Kevin James Barnett]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These may not be top of line, but they are in no way poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received the  Essential Makeup Brush Set  - Leather Carrying Case, 12 Professional Quality Brushes from Thammik, at a discount, in exchange for providing honest feedback - All views expressed here are of my own and not influenced as a result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to write this feedback as to cheer both the quality and pricing for this Thammik brush set and another &amp;#34;Compact Makeup Brush Set - 6 Professional Quality Brushes in a Stylish Leopard Print Travel Case&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve recently purchased both brush sets for my wife and she just loves both of them.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied Customer</li>
            <li> Worth the $17 or so dollars I paid for it but definitely not worth the $59 or so dollars I saw as the retail price. They do shed a bit, mostly the &#x27;contouring&#x27; brush, even after a good wash. Worth a discounted price of $20 or less though.</li>
            <li> Look very nice, but left hairs on my face during application. Do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> A great set of brushes! This brushes are great for anyone whether you&#x27;re a beginner or a pro that&#x27;s one of the reasons why I love this set of makeup brushes. They aren&#x27;t too soft or too firm they are just perfect I have sensitive skin and the bushes are gentle on my skin they didn&#x27;t irritate my face or neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this set of brushes on a daily basis for a couple of weeks without any problems the brushes are very well made super sturdy with minimal shedding. The brushes blend any foundation very well whether it&#x27;s a liquid, powder and cream foundation. I have combination skin so liquid  foundation work best for me and these brushes just apply/blend everything so well not just my foundation they also blend my blush, highlight/contour and setting powder beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush is labeled so if you are a beginner you will know what each brush is for and they come in a cylindrical case to protect the brushes and it doubles as a makeup brush holder I have them on my vanity dresser and they just look so beautiful my friends have asked me where I bought the brushes because they love them they work great and look gorgeous I absolutely recommend this brushes to anyone you get high quality brushes for a great price!</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes as a &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; set to see how they performed and whether they&#x27;d irritate my skin.  I must say, I LOVE these brushes!  They feel good in your hand, there&#x27;s very little product fallout, there wasn&#x27;t any &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; that came out of the brushes (This is a well known issue with other brush lines), and best of all there was little to no shedding when I washed them.  Thank you Thammik for the coupon, I will definitely be ordering many more sets for our store!!!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with these make up brushes. Not only are they of amazing quality but they look gorgeous too. These brushes come in this beautiful baby pink colored box and the brush handles too are of the same baby pink color. This is so unique and looks awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is made of pony hair which is very sturdy and smooth on touch. They brushes blend the make up very well and they are quite easy to clean as well. The one thing i love most about these brushes is that they are named. On each brush its written what they are used for making it so easy for beginners to identify and use the brushes exactly what its supposed to be used for. Totally recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes.  And, for the price - you can&#x27;t beat it.  My favorites are the &amp;#34;eyebrow&amp;#34; brush and the &amp;#34;eye shader&amp;#34;...great control with the bristles.  I&#x27;ve added them to my small but functional makeup brushes from MAC.  It would be nice to see the case and handles in another color, like charcoal or even an deep purple, etc.</li>
            <li> Oh my these brushes are amazing. They are SO soft, but the brushes that are supposed to be stiff, are stiff without being too stiff to use. I mean I can&#x27;t tell you which brushes are synthetic and which are goat hair as they are all just so soft. I did not experience any shedding from these brushes. They cam intact, the handle isn&#x27;t plastic,but isn&#x27;t wood either? It&#x27;s kinda odd,but its soft, lightweight and smooth.  Each brush is just amazing, you won&#x27;t need another set! I like how they are labeled for their uses. In case you aren&#x27;t aware! They are engraved too, so they aren&#x27;t rubbing off. My favorite brushes are the two eyeshadow blending brushes, they are just small enough to fit into my crease, and give me a flawless application. I do like the eyebrow highlight, it&#x27;s bigger, so I wont use it for that, probably but, blending out my crease.  They are easy to clean too.  The brushes come individually wrapped, and then placed in another bag, inside the tube. I love the tube for storage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided.</li>
            <li> I love discovering new makeup brushes. I am a makeup artist and brushes are essential in what I do. My first thought of these brushes was how beautiful they are! The pink leather holder was a nice addition to my cosmetic vanity and is thick and very well made. If nothing else the holder is worth the price alone! The brushes all come individually and nicely wrapped inside this beautiful leather case. One of the brushes even has a brush shaper on it to hold the shape of the brush so it is not damages. Like most new makeup brushes you will want to wash them first as they do shed but very little. Washing them first will prevent the shedding onto your face while doing your makeup. The handles on the brushes are pink to match the leather case making this set even more beautiful. I loved how this particular set has an eye shader brush (es01) and the blending brush (eb01). While most sets have these they are different to these as these are more of your short blending and your tapered brush and I LOVE these two particularly. All of the other sets I have bought or reviewed never come with these two particular brushes and they are an essential. The brushes are made of good quality and very soft. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the EB02 brush felt a little rough to my eyes. I have sensitive eyes and this one was a little irritating. Although, it was nothing to serious I would still suggest purchasing this set for the beauty and the other brushes are amazing. *I received this product free/discounted in exchange for my review. My reviews are completely honest and 100% my own.*</li>
