            <li>Big fan. :-)</li>
            <li>Oh well.. I guess when it comes to fragrances one must try them on first rather than reading about them.</li>
            <li>and it comes in a really big bottle witch I love but</li>
            <li>I tried to spray it on me the first day I got it and</li>
            <li>Sticks on me throughout the whole day!</li>
            <li>The perfume was right on time which was really fast</li>

            <li>the only thing is .it does not smell like that the whole day but other than that I love it</li>

            <li>It smells very sweet and delicate</li>
            <li>... I usually go by the customer reviews and 90% of the times they are accurate...</li>
            <li>This was the exact thing I wanted, and for less</li>

            <li> This product is really AWESOME! Heard some good and bad reviews but I had to try the product myself! I would rebuy this product again! The smell is good also, but it doesn&#x27;t stick.. maybe like for a hour.. but otherwise the smell is still amazing!</li>
            <li> This was the exact thing I wanted, and for less then I could have purchased it in the store. I&#x27;m very happy. This is my favorite smell from bath and body. Very similar to what I would call a cotton candy scent.</li>
            <li> I just love this. I got this scent for Christmas from my boyfriends mother, and I just fell in love with it. So when I ran out instead of paying for gas to go buy more, I just bought some on here.(:</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and lasts all day long !! :)</li>

            <li> I recently bought the perfume to accommodate my lonely lotion (Paris Amour also) and the duo is magical! I get so many compliments.

            <li> I received this as a gift in recent months and love the scent.  Would recommend to many others. Buy it!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing! I did not irritate my skin at all. And it didn&#x27;t have a strong odor. The scent doesn&#x27;t last so i do have to spray it on about 3 times a day. I love the colors and design on the bottle and i carry this around everywhere i go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great smelling spray to use during the days when you don&#x27;t want to use your more expensive perfumes.  Sweet and soothing aroma.</li>

            <li> My teen daughter wears this.  I love Bath &amp; Body Works sprays.  They last so well throughout the day.  Big fan. :-)</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent but very very mild</li>
            <li> The product was perfect...I absolutely love this mist and it was exactly what I expected! I will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever and I have so many compliments, on how good I smell all day long. I recommend this to all the ladies.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but scent dosen&#x27;t keep as lonh as the one I bought the first time,&lt;br /&gt; from the store.</li>
            <li> On time shipping, I love this fragrance</li>
            <li> I bought this spray mist because of the reviews. They were incredible like &amp;#34;This smells great&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;I always get compliments when I wear it&amp;#34;... I usually go by the customer reviews and 90% of the times they are accurate... This is one of those &amp;#34;It didn&#x27;t work for me&amp;#34; cases,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it and it just smells for a few seconds. I even sprayed it like 10 times and NOTHING! Oh well.. I guess when it comes to fragrances one must try them on first rather than reading about them.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance so much.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my girlfriend as a birthday guft, her favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Favorite smell love it</li>
            <li> I went to the mall and bought the perfume and lotion version of this and it smells really good!! I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Never will I purchase another item from bath and body. This place is cheap and good to it&#x27;s word I&#x27;ve loved this perfume ever since I got it and it came in great shipping and very fast.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite body sprays!</li>
            <li> The perfume was right on time which was really fast and it smells amazing but you can really smell it after a really short period of time which sucks</li>
            <li> thanks, very good condition Product</li>
            <li> A really soft, feminine scent. The price is unbeatable too! It smells very sweet and delicate - I can&#x27;t stop smelling my hands where I sprayed a little on to test it!</li>
            <li> Love this. Fish shipping to</li>
            <li> I love this product it smells so good and it comes in a really big bottle witch I love but the only thing is .it does not smell like that the whole day but other than that I love it</li>
            <li> Large quantity for a great price. The spray is a bit too sweet for me. Makes me feel like I&#x27;ve been eating cotton candy at a fair.</li>
            <li> I tried to spray it on me the first day I got it and the top got stuck disappointment</li>
            <li> I like this scent because it is girly, but not an airy scent.  It lingers for a while; it doesn&#x27;t just wear off.  If you like lighter, airier scents, go for something fresher.  If you like a girly but heavy smell, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Smells great!! Sticks on me throughout the whole day!</li>
            <li> It is very good. The only thing I hate is the loud smell of alcohol in the product. This tell me that it is a very cheap perfume. Other than that it would be a five because it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> My step daughter had this perfume and when she got into the car one day I just couldn&#x27;t get over how good her perfume smelled. Just had to buy it for myself!!! Very pleased in the size of the bottle it will last awhile which is great because I love it!!</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d as a gift. Very cloying and the fragrance unpleasant. That&#x27;s just sniffing it in the air. I would not have chosen this scent. I&#x27;m not a fan of Bath and Body Works anyway.</li>
            <li> I have some of this and my husband loves it. Its very sweet and sexy smell that last</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because Bath &amp; Body Works Paris Amour Fine Fragrance Mist smells awesome. Even my 79 year old mom loves it. The scent lasts long too. It was also a great price.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for a gift</li>
            <li> I got my order yesterday was delivered fast but, as for the product... it smelled nice for about a minute. i&#x27;m not sure how old this is but it was not for me... put it on and that was the end of the smell. i have to say that i have never ever got a bath and body product that was this bad. the two stars is for the shipping.  i give a zero for the product it self...  i&#x27;m so sorry i got this on line... next time i&#x27;ll walk uptown and buy it form the store that way if i have a dislike for it i can bring it right back...</li>
            <li> daughter loves this and the lostion and body wash by the same manufacturer. havent seen her with any other type or brand since.</li>
            <li> i had no idea what this smelled like before i ordered it, but it does smell pretty good. i wish the scent lasted longer than a couple mins tho.</li>
            <li> Smells great! &amp; shipped really fast. Love it</li>
