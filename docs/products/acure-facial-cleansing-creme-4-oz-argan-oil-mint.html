            <li>This is one of the best facial cleansers I have ever used!</li>
            <li>i was unsure about buying this product for a while, but i&#x27;m glad i did.</li>
            <li>proir to this product i used st. ives which worked well with my skin, but this work better.</li>
            <li>I love the tingle on my skin and the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reviewed many acure products and I love most all of them.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>but I LOVE it for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>So glad I finally found a skin care line that I feel great about using!</li>
            <li>Love love love the brightening face scrub though.</li>
            <li>This is smooth and smells good and rinses off clean.  </li>
            <li>The best cleanser ever for dry and sensetive skin :)</li>
            <li>My success could also be in part that I&#x27;m also using the eye cream, gotu kola day cream, and the night cream, and have been very satisfied with those.</li>
            <li>All of the ingredients are recognizable and its fair trade.</li>
            <li>Love that the products are free of all the cap that many skin care products contain.</li>
            <li>The entire line is very good.</li>
            <li>There may be better products available.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and cool mint feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many face products and am so far very pleased with Acure.</li>
            <li>Using as a preshave which works fine except for stinging of the eyes.  </li>
            <li>It cleans fine.</li>
            <li>Thanks Acure!!:-)</li>
            <li>This works as a great facial cleanser, takes off all my makeup.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and goes on/rinses off nicely.</li>
            <li>i wash my face twice a day (morning and night) because i do wear light makeup.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That too isn&#x27;t a great smell, but earthy, not gross.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t quite sure if this was as good as one I tried, but the same product from somewhere else.</li>
            <li>I use several Acure products and am very happy with them and the cost is reasonable .Will</li>
            <li>My skin is bright, smooth, no dry spots.</li>
            <li>Oh &amp; worth the money!</li>
            <li>Works great on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I could not belive the version of clean that I saw in the mirror and felt on my skin.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this because of the amazing ingredients..not worth it..</li>
            <li>I like how clean this product is in terms of ingredients and that it is gluten-free, but the mint makes my eyes stingy...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean but still natural-smelling.</li>
            <li>It is minty and refreshing, and really uplifting.</li>
            <li>It makes my face fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using a week, but am very pleased and have noticed that my complexion has improved and my acne has lessened.</li>
            <li>the few times I did use it, it was gentle and moisturizing and I love that it has a great EWG rating.</li>
            <li>I like the organic ingredients very much!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite fave wash</li>
            <li>I love the truly natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>However, for the cost you would be hard pressed to get these incredible results.</li>
            <li>it is really soothing and smooth and hydrating.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to fond a face wash that didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and my face feels clean and not dry after use.</li>
            <li>I must admit its worth the price and my skin has changed drastically.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a safe cleanser, that would remove makeup easily and not leave my face dry.</li>
            <li>I love everything from Acure -- so naturally, I fell in love with the facial cleansing creme with argan oil + mint as well.</li>
            <li>Not harsh or full of chemicals!</li>
            <li>I normally just use coconut oil to clean my skin</li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning, leaves your face feeling fresh not stiff or dried out.  </li>
            <li>The results were even better than last night.</li>
            <li>I recommend going to a store to smell this first.  </li>
            <li>It actually does foam up, make sure your face is damp &amp; massage in circles.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Cleans face pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shall not repurchase.</li>
            <li>I would not like this product as much without the smell!</li>
            <li>Love this Face Wash, Ive always had that tiny bit of stubborn acne.</li>
            <li>Have never broken out w/ this cleanser…&amp; you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>my face is super soft after.</li>
            <li>I use this product for a few days after I do glycolic and latic acid peels on my face foe hydration while cleansing and love it!</li>
            <li>If you use too much of the Bell essence it does leave a shiny residue.</li>
            <li>Acure products suits my skin very well for my nighttime cleansing ritual.</li>
            <li>Personally, I really like it, perhaps because I prefer &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scents to flowery or perfumy smells.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle and moisturizing for after my peel applications and it does not irritate.</li>
            <li>so I am really picky.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product 5 stars, but it really would be 4½.</li>
            <li>texture of the creme is really creamy</li>
            <li>It scores low risk on the Environmental Working Group database which was important to me.</li>
            <li>but really the smell was the problem for me.</li>
            <li>It really removes my makeup and leaves my skin feeling clean and not dry.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a gentle, more natural facial cleanser, I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite facial cleansing cream I have found.</li>
            <li>I purchased it in addition to some other products that the esthetician recommended and my skin is gorgeous, elastic feeling and younger looking!</li>
            <li>It keeps the face clean and hydrated at the same time!</li>
            <li>I have combo skin and wear light makeup everyday so a good cleanser is key in my daily routine.</li>
            <li>Gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>The same is true of this</li>
            <li>Smells slightly earthy-minty, which I can see people not being so into, but I just love it.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and moisturized from afar, but upon touch it&#x27;s slightly dry.</li>
            <li>The last time was ten or more years ago).</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, but it felt a bit &amp;#34;stingy,&amp;#34; and the smell was off-putting.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, non-drying and leaves the skin soft but not oily.</li>
            <li>use an acure facial gel or creme every day; makes my face feel fresh and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>This is a huge plus for me as my skin tends to be very dry in the winter (I also live in the desert).</li>
            <li>I wash my face and it is soothing and does not dry out my skin , very gentle .</li>
            <li>Not sure why, because all the other things they make smell great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although other users said they didnt like the smell, I actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li>either was left with too much grease or too much</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle facial cleansing creme.</li>
            <li>The regular local price is approx $2.00 MORE than the current price here.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a considerable decrease in the breakouts I was having (I am NOT a teenager by any stretch!).  </li>
            <li>Other reviewers comment on the smell being a problem, but I guess this is another example of how different we all are because I love the smell.</li>
            <li>If you like aromatherapy, you will likely enjoy this product (I did notice a little tingle in my eyes when removing mascara, but just plan to make sure I have them tightly closed and rinsed</li>
            <li>The cleansing cream makes my face feel fresh without feeling overly dry.</li>
            <li>It does a good job at removing my mascara and eye liner (I don&#x27;t usually wear other make-up).</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my sensitive skin, nor does it make me break out.</li>
            <li>The surface of my facial skin felt and looked much smoother.</li>
            <li>It completely dries my skin out.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li>its a little minty and smells clean to me.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time last night prior to going to bed.</li>
            <li>Please consider as a guy I have simply been using my bar soap (Tom&#x27;s or Dove) on my face while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Whole Foods and asked a young lady to recommend a facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>We have super harsh water</li>
            <li>I also love their seriously firming facial serum, eye cream and day cream.</li>
            <li>(once I got used to it, I stopped noticing but that first week I hated the smell), but as a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; product it works great.</li>
            <li>Since our water is so hard most body soaps leave my skin so incredibly dry.</li>
            <li>I have used tons of different facial cleansers throughout the years and only had decent results from Proactiv which became pricy.  </li>
            <li>This face cleanser does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>This product does not dry out my skin, and leaves me face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 48 year old African American male.</li>
            <li>This facewash is extremely drying to my normal skin.</li>

            <li> Cleans face pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shall not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I would not like this product as much without the smell!</li>
            <li> Love this Face Wash, Ive always had that tiny bit of stubborn acne.</li>
            <li> Have never broken out w/ this cleanser…&amp; you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> my face is super soft after.</li>
            <li> I use this product for a few days after I do glycolic and latic acid peels on my face foe hydration while cleansing and love it!</li>
            <li> If you use too much of the Bell essence it does leave a shiny residue.</li>
            <li> Acure products suits my skin very well for my nighttime cleansing ritual.</li>
            <li> Personally, I really like it, perhaps because I prefer &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scents to flowery or perfumy smells.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle and moisturizing for after my peel applications and it does not irritate.</li>
            <li> so I am really picky.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars, but it really would be 4½.</li>
            <li> texture of the creme is really creamy</li>
            <li> It scores low risk on the Environmental Working Group database which was important to me.</li>
            <li> but really the smell was the problem for me.</li>
            <li> It really removes my makeup and leaves my skin feeling clean and not dry.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a gentle, more natural facial cleanser, I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite facial cleansing cream I have found.</li>
            <li> I purchased it in addition to some other products that the esthetician recommended and my skin is gorgeous, elastic feeling and younger looking!</li>
            <li> It keeps the face clean and hydrated at the same time!</li>
            <li> I have combo skin and wear light makeup everyday so a good cleanser is key in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> The same is true of this</li>
            <li> Smells slightly earthy-minty, which I can see people not being so into, but I just love it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smooth and moisturized from afar, but upon touch it&#x27;s slightly dry.</li>
            <li> The last time was ten or more years ago).</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it felt a bit &amp;#34;stingy,&amp;#34; and the smell was off-putting.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, non-drying and leaves the skin soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> use an acure facial gel or creme every day; makes my face feel fresh and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> This is a huge plus for me as my skin tends to be very dry in the winter (I also live in the desert).</li>
            <li> I wash my face and it is soothing and does not dry out my skin , very gentle .</li>
            <li> Not sure why, because all the other things they make smell great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although other users said they didnt like the smell, I actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li> either was left with too much grease or too much</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle facial cleansing creme.</li>
            <li> The regular local price is approx $2.00 MORE than the current price here.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a considerable decrease in the breakouts I was having (I am NOT a teenager by any stretch!).  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers comment on the smell being a problem, but I guess this is another example of how different we all are because I love the smell.</li>
            <li> If you like aromatherapy, you will likely enjoy this product (I did notice a little tingle in my eyes when removing mascara, but just plan to make sure I have them tightly closed and rinsed</li>
            <li> The cleansing cream makes my face feel fresh without feeling overly dry.</li>
            <li> It does a good job at removing my mascara and eye liner (I don&#x27;t usually wear other make-up).</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my sensitive skin, nor does it make me break out.</li>
            <li> The surface of my facial skin felt and looked much smoother.</li>
            <li> It completely dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li> its a little minty and smells clean to me.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time last night prior to going to bed.</li>
            <li> Please consider as a guy I have simply been using my bar soap (Tom&#x27;s or Dove) on my face while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Whole Foods and asked a young lady to recommend a facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> We have super harsh water</li>
            <li> I also love their seriously firming facial serum, eye cream and day cream.</li>
            <li> (once I got used to it, I stopped noticing but that first week I hated the smell), but as a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; product it works great.</li>
            <li> Since our water is so hard most body soaps leave my skin so incredibly dry.</li>
            <li> I have used tons of different facial cleansers throughout the years and only had decent results from Proactiv which became pricy.  </li>
            <li> This face cleanser does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This product does not dry out my skin, and leaves me face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 48 year old African American male.</li>
            <li> This facewash is extremely drying to my normal skin.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dried out after washing, and that&#x27;s saying something, since I live on the high plains of Colorado!</li>
            <li> It also takes the size of a pea to wash my face, so it is lasting a long time, even with washing twice a day.</li>
            <li> My face is dry with blotchiness, black heads, and frequent acne.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any improved on black heads yet, although the only thing I&#x27;ve found so far that does work on black heads is getting a facial.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that I wish the bottle was a little bigger b/c I use it daily!</li>
            <li> Also, a couple of dabs goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and bouts of eczema.</li>
            <li> (Tom&#x27;s Moisturizer now, Dove before that), this product did not make my skin feel unnaturally dry or oily.</li>
            <li> I am also using the Acure Night cream and both of them have done wonders for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It smells similar to some clay/seaweed masks that I&#x27;ve tried, and the cleanser actually has a hint of green.  </li>
            <li> This same young lady has made recommendations for me in the past and has never let me down.</li>
            <li> It left my skin a little dry</li>
            <li> But my point is my skin is soft and getting clearer and clearer everyday and my breakouts are less and less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other ones made me dry on my chin and cheeks, blemish, and break out.</li>
            <li> I love ACURE products, but this one smells really bad.</li>
            <li> once I finish this tube (which will take a while, little bit goes a long way).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> my skin is so tight and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other ones from Acure</li>
            <li> I got this, along with a couple other items in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I have used other cleansers &amp; have always returned to this one!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m darker skinned and has slight breakouts.</li>
            <li> but when my breakout heals they leave a black scar on my face.</li>
            <li> when i want to exfoilate with something i add a little bit of baking soda to my face and rub it in.</li>
            <li> I find its a little harsh for my face</li>
            <li> I use it with the clarisonic a few times a week</li>
            <li> In the past, I had always had trouble getting my makeup off at night.</li>
            <li> The size of my face is proportionate with my height and weight yet it took very little of this product to thoroughly cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Hard to rinse out of my eyes.</li>
            <li> other faical washes irritated my skin and it would flare either really bad or just slightly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad about the smell (and the slight sting) because this product did not make my skin feel too tight after washing.</li>
            <li> The picture is wrong</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> sadly i suffer from both hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation.</li>
            <li> I am now mad with myself for not knowing about this product years ago</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells fantastic!  Works great on my dry skin. Not harsh or full of chemicals!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and bouts of eczema. This face cleanser does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff fried my eyes.  I made sure I didn&#x27;t get it in my eyes.  But whenever I used this on my face my eyes would sting terribly.  And I&#x27;d wake up the next morning with them all bloodshot.  So while I was impressed by how nicely it left my skin.  I had to stop using it for the sake of my eyes.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle facial cleansing creme. It&#x27;s not a gel but it does suds well. I use it with my Clarisonic Mia. It does not irritate my sensitive skin, nor does it make me break out. The scent is pleasant and lightly minty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 48 year old African American male. I have always looked younger than my age. I have worked-out off and on for decades, which has helped me to retain a youthful appearance and vigor. I decided to focus on retarding the appearance of age in my face in preparation for my life ten years from now (Yes I do sometimes think ahead). Please consider as a guy I have simply been using my bar soap (Tom&#x27;s or Dove) on my face while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Whole Foods and asked a young lady to recommend a facial cleaner. She went srait to this product and said she loves it. This same young lady has made recommendations for me in the past and has never let me down. The same is true of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time last night prior to going to bed. I could not belive the version of clean that I saw in the mirror and felt on my skin. I was totally amazed! Unlike bar soaps that I have been using for years (Tom&#x27;s Moisturizer now, Dove before that), this product did not make my skin feel unnaturally dry or oily. The surface of my facial skin felt and looked much smoother. It was almost as though I had a facial (I&#x27;ve had two facials in my entire life. The last time was ten or more years ago). I followed up with a Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment - Intensive Anti Aging, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula (another amazing product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product again this morning before work. The results were even better than last night. I am now mad with myself for not knowing about this product years ago (Oh well). There may be better products available. However, for the cost you would be hard pressed to get these incredible results. Also, a couple of dabs goes a long way. I am 6&#x27;2\\&quot; at 205lbs. The size of my face is proportionate with my height and weight yet it took very little of this product to thoroughly cleanse my face. I am one of those people that likes to see the lather. So to say it did not take a lot of this product to accommodate me says a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Although I purchased this locally I do a lot of shopping on Amazon. Although the sale price was $11.99 locally, that is temporary. The regular local price is approx $2.00 MORE than the current price here. Regardless of where you purchase it BY THIS PRODUCT!!! Also consider Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment - Intensive Anti Aging, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula. If you use too much of the Bell essence it does leave a shiny residue. I then then take a piece of tissue and wipe away any excess of the Bell Essence (not this product) that I can&#x27;t massage into my skin. As for this product I have all PROS and no CONS to report at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just a guy enjoying this thing called life and hope that you do as well...</li>
            <li> This facewash is extremely drying to my normal skin. It smells good and removed my eye make up well but at the cost of making my eyes sting terribly. I really wanted to like this because of the amazing ingredients..not worth it..my skin is so tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Cleans well but the smell is unpleasant and the mint gets in my eyes and burns.  Hard to rinse out of my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect cleanser to use with my Clairasonic b/c it is really soothing and smooth and hydrating. The only downfall is that I wish the bottle was a little bigger b/c I use it daily!</li>
            <li> This works as a great facial cleanser, takes off all my makeup. I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my pores and it doesn&#x27;t smell great (once I got used to it, I stopped noticing but that first week I hated the smell), but as a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; product it works great.</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing.  I have never been able to fond a face wash that didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  This is smooth and smells good and rinses off clean.  It also takes the size of a pea to wash my face, so it is lasting a long time, even with washing twice a day.</li>
            <li> My face is dry with blotchiness, black heads, and frequent acne. I&#x27;ve tried many face products and am so far very pleased with Acure. The cleansing cream makes my face feel fresh without feeling overly dry. It smells similar to some clay/seaweed masks that I&#x27;ve tried, and the cleanser actually has a hint of green.  I&#x27;ve only been using a week, but am very pleased and have noticed that my complexion has improved and my acne has lessened. It does a good job at removing my mascara and eye liner (I don&#x27;t usually wear other make-up). I have not noticed any improved on black heads yet, although the only thing I&#x27;ve found so far that does work on black heads is getting a facial. My success could also be in part that I&#x27;m also using the eye cream, gotu kola day cream, and the night cream, and have been very satisfied with those. This definitely burns if you get it in your eyes!</li>
            <li> This cleansing creme cleans face with out drying the skin. Perfect for me! It keeps the face clean and hydrated at the same time!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it felt a bit &amp;#34;stingy,&amp;#34; and the smell was off-putting. It&#x27;s too bad about the smell (and the slight sting) because this product did not make my skin feel too tight after washing. Also, I like multi-purpose products, but the mint rules this out for removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Great product, and the smell is very nice. Different, and not chemically.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face wash! In the past, I had always had trouble getting my makeup off at night. I tried face wipes and make up removers and I either was left with too much grease or too much make up. I just assumed I would always have residual makeup and then I found this last week. My towels no longer have mascara eye patches in them and my face has never felt cleaner. I am also using the Acure Night cream and both of them have done wonders for my dry skin. My skin feels smoother than it ever has before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although other users said they didnt like the smell, I actually enjoy it. its a little minty and smells clean to me.</li>
            <li> I recommend going to a store to smell this first.  Others like the smell, but I found it unbearable.  I tried holding my breath, breathing through my mouth... but I just can&#x27;t use this cleanser.  It&#x27;s too bad bc the few times I did use it, it was gentle and moisturizing and I love that it has a great EWG rating.</li>
            <li> This is the worst face wash I have ever used. It completely dries my skin out. It doesn&#x27;t remove makeup and the burning sensation in your eyes is unbearable.</li>
            <li> I like how clean this product is in terms of ingredients and that it is gluten-free, but the mint makes my eyes stingy...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years!! &amp; I love it !! It actually does foam up, make sure your face is damp &amp; massage in circles.&lt;br /&gt;Very gentle &amp; feels good on my skin!! Have never broken out w/ this cleanser…&amp; you don&#x27;t have to use very much. this lasts for months. I have used other cleansers &amp; have always returned to this one! Thanks Acure!!:-) Oh &amp; worth the money! Best price I found was on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love everything from Acure -- so naturally, I fell in love with the facial cleansing creme with argan oil + mint as well. Acure products suits my skin very well for my nighttime cleansing ritual.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best facial cleansers I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Although it is marketed to women I like this, It seems to have cleared up my acne without drying my skin. The picture is wrong it actually comes in the same type of tube as as the Acure shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners. All of the ingredients are recognizable and its fair trade. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is as nice as any I&#x27;ve tried plus some. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dried out after washing, and that&#x27;s saying something, since I live on the high plains of Colorado! I noticed that some reviewers mentioned they didn&#x27;t care for the smell. Personally, I really like it, perhaps because I prefer &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scents to flowery or perfumy smells.</li>
            <li> I just reordered my 2nd tube.  It does a great job cleaning, leaves your face feeling fresh not stiff or dried out.  I have noticed a considerable decrease in the breakouts I was having (I am NOT a teenager by any stretch!).  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product for a few days after I do glycolic and latic acid peels on my face foe hydration while cleansing and love it! It is so gentle and moisturizing for after my peel applications and it does not irritate. The scent is also very refreshing too!</li>
            <li> I have used tons of different facial cleansers throughout the years and only had decent results from Proactiv which became pricy.  The other ones made me dry on my chin and cheeks, blemish, and break out. I just stumbled across this brand and started reading reviews. I took a chance and I&#x27;m definitely stuck on this face wash. My skin is bright, smooth, no dry spots. I have combo skin and wear light makeup everyday so a good cleanser is key in my daily routine. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other ones from Acure once I finish this tube (which will take a while, little bit goes a long way).</li>
            <li> This product does not dry out my skin, and leaves me face feeling refreshed. It is very creamy and goes on/rinses off nicely. I love the truly natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> The best!! Not drying, but takes off all makeup. Smells slightly earthy-minty, which I can see people not being so into, but I just love it. It&#x27;s clean but still natural-smelling.</li>
            <li> Gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Using as a preshave which works fine except for stinging of the eyes.  Cleans face pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shall not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I got this, along with a couple other items in 2 days. I had this used on me at a high-end spa in Santa Fe, the esthetician recommended I get it to moisturize my skin. My skin looks smooth and moisturized from afar, but upon touch it&#x27;s slightly dry. After having this in a facial my skin felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom. I purchased it in addition to some other products that the esthetician recommended and my skin is gorgeous, elastic feeling and younger looking! I also saved about $50 on each product ordering from this shop. Thank you and plan to order more as I run out!</li>
            <li> I still prefer my Origins cleanser but this ACURE is really nice.  I have sensitive skin on my face so I am really picky.  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> It cleans fine. I also like the creamy texture.&lt;br /&gt;However, it smells like Chinese medicine which I used to take a lot and it is still unbearable to me.&lt;br /&gt;For this only reason, I regret with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fry my eyes o.O&lt;br /&gt;I use an acure facial gel or creme every day; makes my face feel fresh and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Great ingredients and LOVE that they use fair trade ingredients too!&lt;br /&gt;Acure is amazing and has great customer service as well.</li>
            <li> i was unsure about buying this product for a while, but i&#x27;m glad i did. this cleanser smells amazing and feels amazing on my skin. i&#x27;m darker skinned and has slight breakouts. but when my breakout heals they leave a black scar on my face. sadly i suffer from both hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation. other faical washes irritated my skin and it would flare either really bad or just slightly. proir to this product i used st. ives which worked well with my skin, but this work better. I love the tingle on my skin and the smell of it. when i want to exfoilate with something i add a little bit of baking soda to my face and rub it in. my face is super soft after. i wash my face twice a day (morning and night) because i do wear light makeup. I also use the day cream and night cream from this brand. But my point is my skin is soft and getting clearer and clearer everyday and my breakouts are less and less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed many acure products and I love most all of them. This is no exception. It really removes my makeup and leaves my skin feeling clean and not dry. This is a huge plus for me as my skin tends to be very dry in the winter (I also live in the desert). I use it with the clarisonic a few times a week and it works well with that. Love that the products are free of all the cap that many skin care products contain.</li>
            <li> I have used the cleanser for about two weeks and it works as described. It&#x27;s gentle, non-drying and leaves the skin soft but not oily. I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a safe cleanser, that would remove makeup easily and not leave my face dry. This one is perfect. It even took off my mascara without having to use a cottonball with oil.  Other reviewers comment on the smell being a problem, but I guess this is another example of how different we all are because I love the smell. It is minty and refreshing, and really uplifting. I would not like this product as much without the smell! If you like aromatherapy, you will likely enjoy this product (I did notice a little tingle in my eyes when removing mascara, but just plan to make sure I have them tightly closed and rinsed well before I open them during washing next time).  :)</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars, but it really would be 4½. We have super harsh water and this does a good job cleaning, almost too good of a job. I find its a little harsh for my face but I LOVE it for the rest of my body. Since our water is so hard most body soaps leave my skin so incredibly dry. This leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the creme is really creamy and I rather like the smell. If we lived where we used to (or if we had a water softener), this would be great for my face. I normally just use coconut oil to clean my skin but you need to put it on before you get in the water so I was looking for something that I can use for the times when I forget. This is it!</li>
            <li> The best cleanser ever for dry and sensetive skin :)</li>
            <li> I have been using ACURE Argan Oil + Mint Cleansing Creme for a couple of months now and I am very pleased with it. It has a pleasant and refreshing scent and is moisturizing without clogging the pores. It also removes make up well. If you are looking for a gentle, more natural facial cleanser, I would recommend this one. It scores low risk on the Environmental Working Group database which was important to me.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite facial cleansing cream I have found. It leaves your face with a healthy glow. I also love their seriously firming facial serum, eye cream and day cream. So glad I finally found a skin care line that I feel great about using!</li>
            <li> The entire line is very good. After a week I happened to notice my pores were much smaller.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and my face feels clean and not dry after use.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of mint.A little goes a long way. It makes my face fresh and clean. I like the organic ingredients very much!</li>
            <li> Love this Face Wash, Ive always had that tiny bit of stubborn acne. Also some skin discoloration, Ive used this product for a solid year now. I must admit its worth the price and my skin has changed drastically. I love the smell and cool mint feel. Best face wash, I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun even proactive. This is the Winner! *Also recommend which hazel or rose water as toner after you wash your face.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite sure if this was as good as one I tried, but the same product from somewhere else. Didn&#x27;t seem like the same product. Not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I wash my face and it is soothing and does not dry out my skin , very gentle . I use several Acure products and am very happy with them and the cost is reasonable .Will buy again</li>
            <li> Strong, but pleasant smell. Non-drying. This is my new favorite fave wash</li>
            <li> I love ACURE products, but this one smells really bad. Not sure why, because all the other things they make smell great. It left my skin a little dry but really the smell was the problem for me. Love love love the brightening face scrub though. That too isn&#x27;t a great smell, but earthy, not gross.</li>
