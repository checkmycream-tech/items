            <li>My husband grabbed the bar by accident and after his shower asked me what kind of soap it was.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of spicy</li>
            <li>It is so creamy and it leaves your skin soft and great smelling, too!  </li>

            <li>It has a pleasant clean smell, not a perfume type smell.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, and does not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>I sent a collection of products to my parents in Wisconsin and they have enjoyed all the them.  </li>
            <li>most would think I look thirty.  </li>
            <li>There is NO finer soap available!</li>
            <li>You CAN pay a LOT More</li>
            <li>but you will NEVER get a FINER or BETTER soap than Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap.  </li>
            <li>more so I was given the task of finding it.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have been using this soap for a couple of years now and we love it.</li>
            <li>We were extremely pleased to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am so glad i found this product.  </li>
            <li>It is safe to use on your face.</li>
            <li>I actually love all the Canus products I have tried - I&#x27;d write a smashing review on all of them</li>
            <li>The manager told me that they carry 2500 different soaps, and THIS soap is their best seller.</li>
            <li>Will order more as Chritmas presents soon.</li>
            <li>We love the product and use it exclusively in our bath room.</li>
            <li>I was like \\&quot;Wow, this Canus soap smells good!</li>
            <li>Along with this product by Canus they have many other wonderful products and my favorite is the Body Butter.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, mild soap.  </li>
            <li>It dosent dry my skin out and it has a wonderful scent to it.</li>
            <li>I got the free shipping option when I purchased it so that was all the better.  </li>
            <li>An all natural soap...Smells great, wont burn ur eyes and helps protect the animals and enviroment....</li>
            <li>Good packaging and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Canus needs to really upgrade their product to have a much better fragrance that is rich and long-lasting with better moisturizers---put more goat&#x27;s milk in it!</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest folks trying all of these products.</li>
            <li>It smells great, cleans well and does not dry our skin.</li>
            <li>This soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is my second order of this great soap.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful (not quite floral, very fresh: my boyfriend has no problem using it), lasts a long time, and this price is much cheaper than buying it at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay the price because of how my skin felt and more importantly how my husband&#x27;s skin responded.  </li>
            <li>I got a new job last year and was so happy to find this soap here at Amazon!</li>
            <li>It helps to relieve dry skin and smells wonderful, plus it lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>The soap smelled pretty okay inside the box, BUT.... when I lathered it up to wash my face, the smell seemed to change</li>
            <li>The scent is clean, soapy-smelling and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>This product works great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>(is it clove, or carnation?) and clean smelling, and my boyfriend always goes,</li>
            <li>I have been using this soap for almost three years now and we often give it as presents for special occasions, as X-mas, birthdays, etc.  </li>
            <li>I found the soap to be good for washing up, had no odor and left my skin feeling clean and hydrated</li>
            <li>If Goat&#x27;s Milk was good enough for the Queen of the Nile, it certainly is good enough for me!</li>
            <li>Amazingly, a Google search revealed that it was available through Amazon and if I ordered enough I would get free shipping.</li>
            <li>Then I thought to check [...] and was pleased to find the whole line.  </li>
            <li>This soap is mild like it was advertized</li>
            <li>It is very reasonably priced!  </li>
            <li>Such a nice smell.</li>
            <li>the soap has a nice scent to it, I would definitely recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>I placed the order, it came a week later and wifey was thrilled.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m happy with them all, especially the Butter.  </li>
            <li>I have actually never felt so clean inall my life!!</li>
            <li>This would probably be fine for someone with normal or oily skin.</li>
            <li>Clean smelling, long lasting and great price.</li>
            <li>bars are very large, lather up well, and are long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>This is good soap...but definitely not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>A nice, all purpose soap which won&#x27;t dry your skin.  </li>
            <li>but so does Dove Pink, and Dove smells so much better!</li>
            <li>My father has had skin problems for most of his life and he uses the moisturizing lotion over his entire body.  </li>
            <li>It keeps it most but no film left over.</li>
            <li>Wifey was given a bar of the Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Bar Soap by a neighbor who swore by its ability leave the skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>but it lasted a long time and the whole bathroom smells nice.</li>
            <li>We find the price much better than buying it locally.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t make bubbles, but he just doesn&#x27;t understand the difference between superfatted soap which is good for your skin and harsh, bubbly soap that dries it.</li>
            <li>He said it made his skin so soft and he has exzema so any type of soap that would help it was well worth the price!</li>
            <li>We will continue to buy this product for as long as it is available!</li>
            <li>My skin was left soft, and SQEEKY CLEAN!!</li>
            <li>It does not leave a scum in the shower but does leave a light, refreshing scent on the body which seems to last most of the day.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent, because it&#x27;s so strong that I can smell it when I walk into my bedroom.  </li>
            <li>and I personally find it to be a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>Having one kind of soap that all of us will use makes life a little simpler.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat moisturizing, but I really just use it for the scent.</li>
            <li>Although I would give the unscented option 5 stars, the description led me to believe that this would be a very benign scent</li>
            <li>My whole family loves this soap.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li>The Natural fragrance fills my bath area and takes me away to the pools of Egypt and fresh flower petals strewn upon the water.</li>
            <li>It very luxurious and creats alot of lather.</li>
            <li>We have been using this soap for the past 4 years and love it!</li>
            <li>well, normal!  </li>
            <li>I was actually pleased with the fragrance, and it did not seem any stronger than any other bar soap I have purchased.</li>
            <li>The hand soap is so mild that a woman can use it on her face and not dry her skin out.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing (I hardly ever use moisturizer when I get out of the shower) and it smells so fresh and clean!  </li>
            <li>I have used more expensive soap, but this is much better.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Bar Soap in the unscented version and really liked the long lasting, not over-sudsy bar that was quite solid in the hand.  </li>
            <li>I first used this soap when the owner of the small gym I belonged to had free samples she&#x27;d somehow received.  </li>
            <li>I had also read about the fragrance from previous reviews, and how it was too strong for some.</li>
            <li>this is a very natural product and it cleans &amp; softens the skin.  </li>
            <li>Goat&#x27;s Milk is LOADED with butter fat and other good things from nature and has protected me against sun damage and the harsh winter&#x27;s of New England.</li>
            <li>Our children first put us on to it, we bought it, and now it is our only shower soap.</li>
            <li>I have not found that to be true with other goat&#x27;s milk soaps.</li>
            <li>It has the richest lather and the mildest touch on my sensitive skin of any soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It did not leave my skin soft, but it works well as a cleanser....</li>
            <li>Everyone that we have given this soap to are completely hooked on it.  </li>
            <li>A complete savings of over $1.00 per bar plus tax.   </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft after bathing and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my children as they have sensitive skin and they like it.</li>
            <li>It rinses away completly but leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>This soap makes your skin soft and takes away the dryness &amp; itching.</li>
            <li>I have sent samples to all my family who have sensitive, irritated skin and we&#x27;ll see how they respond, but</li>
            <li>I bought this soap last summer at Whole Foods, put it away, and forgot about it.</li>
            <li>I went back to Whole Foods today to stock up.</li>
            <li>I had purchased some goat&#x27;s milk soap from a Mennonite or Amish store in the past, and it was so full of fat, that it was very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I would describe it as a healthy smelling soap as opposed to an artificial or flowery scent, so it&#x27;s received a full 4 stars from me.</li>
            <li>I had purchase the canus goat milk soap it cleans very well, it does not leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li>We could only get this soap locally at a gift store and we paid over twice as much for it there.</li>
            <li>I was unable to buy this product locally, and was delighted when I found it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a few bars of the original scented version</li>
            <li>I bought a bar and brought it home thinking that I would be the only one to use it because it had a very nice scent, but was I wrong!</li>
            <li>We have been married for 12 years and all this time his skin has been rough, red and irritated no matter what lotions or soaps he used.  </li>
            <li>I had read the previous reviews before I had ordered it, and they all seem to imply that it was very gentle and creamy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely great in these cold Mid-West winters when your skin tends to dry out.</li>
            <li>In the dry (humidity) Upper Midwest during the Winter, this product really moisturizes, but is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be willing to pay almost anything for these results, but with this deal, the 5 oz bar is less than $1.50 a bar.</li>
            <li>My hair was clean, thick and wavy.</li>
            <li>(I live in Arizona where the humidity is very low and everyone has dry skin.)</li>
            <li>The soap is very soft and gentle but doesn&#x27;t leave any residue like some common \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; soaps at drug stores.  </li>

            <li> It helps to relieve dry skin and smells wonderful, plus it lathers really well.  </li>
            <li> The soap smelled pretty okay inside the box, BUT.... when I lathered it up to wash my face, the smell seemed to change</li>
            <li> The scent is clean, soapy-smelling and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> This product works great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> (is it clove, or carnation?) and clean smelling, and my boyfriend always goes,</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for almost three years now and we often give it as presents for special occasions, as X-mas, birthdays, etc.  </li>
            <li> I found the soap to be good for washing up, had no odor and left my skin feeling clean and hydrated</li>
            <li> If Goat&#x27;s Milk was good enough for the Queen of the Nile, it certainly is good enough for me!</li>
            <li> Amazingly, a Google search revealed that it was available through Amazon and if I ordered enough I would get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Then I thought to check [...] and was pleased to find the whole line.  </li>
            <li> This soap is mild like it was advertized</li>
            <li> It is very reasonably priced!  </li>
            <li> Such a nice smell.</li>
            <li> the soap has a nice scent to it, I would definitely recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I placed the order, it came a week later and wifey was thrilled.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m happy with them all, especially the Butter.  </li>
            <li> I have actually never felt so clean inall my life!!</li>
            <li> This would probably be fine for someone with normal or oily skin.</li>
            <li> Clean smelling, long lasting and great price.</li>
            <li> bars are very large, lather up well, and are long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> This is good soap...but definitely not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> A nice, all purpose soap which won&#x27;t dry your skin.  </li>
            <li> but so does Dove Pink, and Dove smells so much better!</li>
            <li> My father has had skin problems for most of his life and he uses the moisturizing lotion over his entire body.  </li>
            <li> It keeps it most but no film left over.</li>
            <li> Wifey was given a bar of the Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Bar Soap by a neighbor who swore by its ability leave the skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> but it lasted a long time and the whole bathroom smells nice.</li>
            <li> We find the price much better than buying it locally.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t make bubbles, but he just doesn&#x27;t understand the difference between superfatted soap which is good for your skin and harsh, bubbly soap that dries it.</li>
            <li> He said it made his skin so soft and he has exzema so any type of soap that would help it was well worth the price!</li>
            <li> We will continue to buy this product for as long as it is available!</li>
            <li> My skin was left soft, and SQEEKY CLEAN!!</li>
            <li> It does not leave a scum in the shower but does leave a light, refreshing scent on the body which seems to last most of the day.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent, because it&#x27;s so strong that I can smell it when I walk into my bedroom.  </li>
            <li> and I personally find it to be a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> Having one kind of soap that all of us will use makes life a little simpler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat moisturizing, but I really just use it for the scent.</li>
            <li> Although I would give the unscented option 5 stars, the description led me to believe that this would be a very benign scent</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this soap.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li> The Natural fragrance fills my bath area and takes me away to the pools of Egypt and fresh flower petals strewn upon the water.</li>
            <li> It very luxurious and creats alot of lather.</li>
            <li> We have been using this soap for the past 4 years and love it!</li>
            <li> well, normal!  </li>
            <li> I was actually pleased with the fragrance, and it did not seem any stronger than any other bar soap I have purchased.</li>
            <li> The hand soap is so mild that a woman can use it on her face and not dry her skin out.  </li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing (I hardly ever use moisturizer when I get out of the shower) and it smells so fresh and clean!  </li>
            <li> I have used more expensive soap, but this is much better.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Bar Soap in the unscented version and really liked the long lasting, not over-sudsy bar that was quite solid in the hand.  </li>
            <li> I first used this soap when the owner of the small gym I belonged to had free samples she&#x27;d somehow received.  </li>
            <li> I had also read about the fragrance from previous reviews, and how it was too strong for some.</li>
            <li> this is a very natural product and it cleans &amp; softens the skin.  </li>
            <li> Goat&#x27;s Milk is LOADED with butter fat and other good things from nature and has protected me against sun damage and the harsh winter&#x27;s of New England.</li>
            <li> Our children first put us on to it, we bought it, and now it is our only shower soap.</li>
            <li> I have not found that to be true with other goat&#x27;s milk soaps.</li>
            <li> It has the richest lather and the mildest touch on my sensitive skin of any soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It did not leave my skin soft, but it works well as a cleanser....</li>
            <li> Everyone that we have given this soap to are completely hooked on it.  </li>
            <li> A complete savings of over $1.00 per bar plus tax.   </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft after bathing and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my children as they have sensitive skin and they like it.</li>
            <li> It rinses away completly but leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> This soap makes your skin soft and takes away the dryness &amp; itching.</li>
            <li> I have sent samples to all my family who have sensitive, irritated skin and we&#x27;ll see how they respond, but</li>
            <li> I bought this soap last summer at Whole Foods, put it away, and forgot about it.</li>
            <li> I went back to Whole Foods today to stock up.</li>
            <li> I had purchased some goat&#x27;s milk soap from a Mennonite or Amish store in the past, and it was so full of fat, that it was very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I would describe it as a healthy smelling soap as opposed to an artificial or flowery scent, so it&#x27;s received a full 4 stars from me.</li>
            <li> I had purchase the canus goat milk soap it cleans very well, it does not leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> We could only get this soap locally at a gift store and we paid over twice as much for it there.</li>
            <li> I was unable to buy this product locally, and was delighted when I found it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a few bars of the original scented version</li>
            <li> I bought a bar and brought it home thinking that I would be the only one to use it because it had a very nice scent, but was I wrong!</li>
            <li> We have been married for 12 years and all this time his skin has been rough, red and irritated no matter what lotions or soaps he used.  </li>
            <li> I had read the previous reviews before I had ordered it, and they all seem to imply that it was very gentle and creamy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely great in these cold Mid-West winters when your skin tends to dry out.</li>
            <li> In the dry (humidity) Upper Midwest during the Winter, this product really moisturizes, but is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be willing to pay almost anything for these results, but with this deal, the 5 oz bar is less than $1.50 a bar.</li>
            <li> My hair was clean, thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> (I live in Arizona where the humidity is very low and everyone has dry skin.)</li>
            <li> The soap is very soft and gentle but doesn&#x27;t leave any residue like some common \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; soaps at drug stores.  </li>
            <li> Also, this particular soap left my face feeling tight and somewhat stingy.</li>
            <li> The milling of the soap is such that it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I thought it might get moushy since it did not seem dry enough</li>
            <li> It is fanastic at helping moisturize dry winter skin and the bars are long lasting.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t drying and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> plus I didn&#x27;t have any strange urges to eat tin cans:</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about 5 years and my dry flakey skin is gone.</li>
            <li> My skin has been dry and itchy due to harse winter.</li>
            <li> I was given a Canus gift pack a few years back</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are complaining about\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I do not have to worry about reactions to chemicals that are in other soaps..</li>
            <li> Our local store that used to carry it, does no more, and it is the one soap I am not allergic to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold, and continue to try other Canus products.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s light fragrance is so bad that I am going to throw it away.  </li>
            <li> ALL other soaps that I have used dried my skin and made it itch....</li>
            <li> so I can continue to look half my age.</li>
            <li> if they have half the improvement that my husband and I have, I know they will be fans like we are.  </li>
            <li> I also use the Canus Li&#x27;l Goat&#x27;s Milk Tearless Shampoo/Body Wash on my little one</li>
            <li> I use to stock up at a little gift shop up north when we&#x27;d go to the lake each summer.</li>
            <li> This seemed a little too drying for my skin.</li>
            <li> It is actually less expensive here than it was at my old job even with the shipping charges.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only scented soaps that I can use without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I am SO grateful to Canus and those darling little goats!</li>
            <li> Have found no better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Amazon sells this scent.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for at least eight years now.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys....</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you wont be sorry!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a nice, mild soap.  The 5 oz. bars are very large, lather up well, and are long-lasting.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent, because it&#x27;s so strong that I can smell it when I walk into my bedroom.  Next time I&#x27;ll buy the unscented version (which I didn&#x27;t see when I ordered this).</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this soap.  It helps to relieve dry skin and smells wonderful, plus it lathers really well.  I have not found that to be true with other goat&#x27;s milk soaps.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive my 4 boxes of St. Ives&#x27; goat&#x27;s milk soap. None of my local pharmacies carry this product anymore. It has the richest lather and the mildest touch on my sensitive skin of any soap I&#x27;ve used. I gave a bar to a friend and she said she, too, had never used a richer, cleaner soap. Sometimes I think this soap&#x27;s so good I&#x27;ll eat it for breakfast, ha, ha. J.Z. Brooks</li>
            <li> I was given a Canus gift pack a few years back and I&#x27;ve loved it ever since. The scent is clean, soapy-smelling and long-lasting. It&#x27;s somewhat moisturizing, but I really just use it for the scent. I also use the Canus Li&#x27;l Goat&#x27;s Milk Tearless Shampoo/Body Wash on my little one so she smells good too!</li>
            <li> This soap smells great, in fact it make my bathroom smell good just by having a bar of soap in the shower. My skin has been dry and itchy due to harse winter. And after using this product my skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> We have been using this soap for the past 4 years and love it! I worked at a mail order seed company and this was one of the products that we offered in our garden products section. I bought a bar and brought it home thinking that I would be the only one to use it because it had a very nice scent, but was I wrong! My husband grabbed the bar by accident and after his shower asked me what kind of soap it was. He said it made his skin so soft and he has exzema so any type of soap that would help it was well worth the price! I got a new job last year and was so happy to find this soap here at Amazon! It is actually less expensive here than it was at my old job even with the shipping charges. We will continue to buy this product for as long as it is available!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Bar Soap in the unscented version and really liked the long lasting, not over-sudsy bar that was quite solid in the hand.  I recently purchased a few bars of the original scented version and I personally find it to be a strong scent.  My bathroom smells like the soap and the closet smells like the remaining unopened boxes of soap.  Although I would give the unscented option 5 stars, the description led me to believe that this would be a very benign scent and it&#x27;s not.  I would describe it as a healthy smelling soap as opposed to an artificial or flowery scent, so it&#x27;s received a full 4 stars from me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years. I have always ordered it thru Amazon but the price has now gone thru the roof.  Sorry guys....I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li> This soap is mild like it was advertized but it&#x27;s light fragrance is so bad that I am going to throw it away.  I have never before been told that I don&#x27;t smell very good until I bathed with this soap.  JLA</li>
            <li> I was very happy to come across the Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk products and have tried them all.  The hand soap is so mild that a woman can use it on her face and not dry her skin out.  Along with this product by Canus they have many other wonderful products and my favorite is the Body Butter.  I sent a collection of products to my parents in Wisconsin and they have enjoyed all the them.  My father has had skin problems for most of his life and he uses the moisturizing lotion over his entire body.  I strongly suggest folks trying all of these products. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is one of the only scented soaps that I can use without irritating my skin. It smells wonderful (not quite floral, very fresh: my boyfriend has no problem using it), lasts a long time, and this price is much cheaper than buying it at the grocery store. I also grate it to use in homemade laundry soap.</li>
            <li> This is good soap...but definitely not worth the price tag. It did not leave my skin soft, but it works well as a cleanser....but so does Dove Pink, and Dove smells so much better!</li>
            <li> This product works great for dry skin.  It keeps it most but no film left over.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap! My girlfriend and I use to stock up at a little gift shop up north when we&#x27;d go to the lake each summer. I&#x27;ve never seen it anywhere else. It&#x27;s kind of spicy (is it clove, or carnation?) and clean smelling, and my boyfriend always goes, \\&quot;Mmm...\\&quot; and nuzzles me when I&#x27;ve just showered with it. Amazon has the best pricing, and the automatic subscription program can&#x27;t be beat. I often wrap up 2-3 bars with tissue and ribbon and give it as a hostess gift.</li>
            <li> Such a nice smell. It cleans good too. Definitely a bargain if you get them here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had purchase the canus goat milk soap it cleans very well, it does not leave my skin dry. the soap has a nice scent to it, I would definitely recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this soap. It isn&#x27;t drying and lasts a long time.  Having one kind of soap that all of us will use makes life a little simpler.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  It does not leave a scum in the shower but does leave a light, refreshing scent on the body which seems to last most of the day.  Good packaging and fast shipping.  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Have tried lots of soaps in my 50 years and would not use anything else!</li>
            <li> I recently received this soap today. I was like \\&quot;Wow, this Canus soap smells good! I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are complaining about\\&quot;. The soap smelled pretty okay inside the box, BUT.... when I lathered it up to wash my face, the smell seemed to change and it wasn&#x27;t ideally pleasant. Also, this particular soap left my face feeling tight and somewhat stingy. Canus needs to really upgrade their product to have a much better fragrance that is rich and long-lasting with better moisturizers---put more goat&#x27;s milk in it! Do something that&#x27;s a lot better than this!</li>
            <li> (This review is being written by David&#x27;s wife, Sharon). I have been using this soap for almost three years now and we often give it as presents for special occasions, as X-mas, birthdays, etc.  Everyone that we have given this soap to are completely hooked on it.  I was amazed at the value we received by buying it on-line.  A complete savings of over $1.00 per bar plus tax.   It is so creamy and it leaves your skin soft and great smelling, too!  Even the guys like it! Now we don&#x27;t have to purchase this great soap by the bar...We buy it by the case! It&#x27;s extremely great in these cold Mid-West winters when your skin tends to dry out.</li>
            <li> If Goat&#x27;s Milk was good enough for the Queen of the Nile, it certainly is good enough for me! I have been using Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk soap for decades and although I am in my 50&#x27;s most would think I look thirty.  Goat&#x27;s Milk is LOADED with butter fat and other good things from nature and has protected me against sun damage and the harsh winter&#x27;s of New England. The Natural fragrance fills my bath area and takes me away to the pools of Egypt and fresh flower petals strewn upon the water. There is NO finer soap available! Understand what I am saying...You CAN pay a LOT More but you will NEVER get a FINER or BETTER soap than Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap.  I hope they NEVER run out so I can continue to look half my age. I am SO grateful to Canus and those darling little goats! Dennis R. Troy, Worcester, MA  Or DENNISTHEMENACE48 ON EBAY</li>
            <li> Wifey was given a bar of the Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Bar Soap by a neighbor who swore by its ability leave the skin smooth and soft. So wifey used it in the shower and really liked it, thus convinced that it was safe would do me no harm I tried it. I found the soap to be good for washing up, had no odor and left my skin feeling clean and hydrated plus I didn&#x27;t have any strange urges to eat tin cans:&gt;) We liked it and wanted more \\&quot;Goat Soap\\&quot; but didn&#x27;t want to beg the neighbor for more so I was given the task of finding it. Amazingly, a Google search revealed that it was available through Amazon and if I ordered enough I would get free shipping. I placed the order, it came a week later and wifey was thrilled. Happy wife, happy life.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I no longer get any skin rashes now that I use this product. Yay!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!! It is fanastic at helping moisturize dry winter skin and the bars are long lasting.  It has a pleasant clean smell, not a perfume type smell.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this soap for a couple of years now and we love it. Don&#x27;t let the name fool you... this soap smells great! The best benefit is the moisturizing effect of the goat&#x27;s milk. We could only get this soap locally at a gift store and we paid over twice as much for it there. We were extremely pleased to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This soap feels like the soap you had whn you were a kid.  It smells wonderful, and does not dry out your skin.  I have used more expensive soap, but this is much better.</li>
            <li> A nice, all purpose soap which won&#x27;t dry your skin.  My husband doesn&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t make bubbles, but he just doesn&#x27;t understand the difference between superfatted soap which is good for your skin and harsh, bubbly soap that dries it.</li>
            <li> Canus has great goat&#x27;s milk products and here is another one.  It leaves your skin soft after bathing and no irritation.  I use this on my children as they have sensitive skin and they like it.</li>
            <li> I first used this soap when the owner of the small gym I belonged to had free samples she&#x27;d somehow received.  I thought it was great, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Then I thought to check [...] and was pleased to find the whole line.  I got the free shipping option when I purchased it so that was all the better.  The soap is very soft and gentle but doesn&#x27;t leave any residue like some common \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; soaps at drug stores.  It rinses away completly but leaves my skin soft.  I like it enough to actually write a review!</li>
            <li> Canus is a wonderful soap. It smells great, cleans well and does not dry our skin. Our children first put us on to it, we bought it, and now it is our only shower soap. We just hope it never goes away!! Kolman and Sharon Kleinbord</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful..ALL other soaps that I have used dried my skin and made it itch....This soap makes your skin soft and takes away the dryness &amp; itching.I am so glad i found this product.  I do not have to worry about reactions to chemicals that are in other soaps..this is a very natural product and it cleans &amp; softens the skin.  It is safe to use on your face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful soap.  It is very moisturizing (I hardly ever use moisturizer when I get out of the shower) and it smells so fresh and clean!  I am often complimented on how good I smell - I now buy it as gifts for people!  It is very reasonably priced!  I actually love all the Canus products I have tried - I&#x27;d write a smashing review on all of them but I have twin two year olds and don&#x27;t have time!!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this soap! It dosent dry my skin out and it has a wonderful scent to it.Would recommend .</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years as has my family. Have found no better. In the dry (humidity) Upper Midwest during the Winter, this product really moisturizes, but is not greasy. The milling of the soap is such that it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I was unable to buy this product locally, and was delighted when I found it at Amazon. Our local store that used to carry it, does no more, and it is the one soap I am not allergic to.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Canus Goat Milk Bar Soap by buying it in a specialty shop in a resort town for $3.99 a bar.  I went home,I used it and loved it! (I live in Arizona where the humidity is very low and everyone has dry skin.) I was willing to pay the price because of how my skin felt and more importantly how my husband&#x27;s skin responded.  We have been married for 12 years and all this time his skin has been rough, red and irritated no matter what lotions or soaps he used.  We noticed a difference in a few days but after a few weeks, the irritation began to ease and now his skin is cleared up, smooth and...well, normal!  I&#x27;d be willing to pay almost anything for these results, but with this deal, the 5 oz bar is less than $1.50 a bar. I&#x27;m sold, and continue to try other Canus products.  So far, I&#x27;m happy with them all, especially the Butter.  I have sent samples to all my family who have sensitive, irritated skin and we&#x27;ll see how they respond, but if they have half the improvement that my husband and I have, I know they will be fans like we are.  We love goat milk!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap last summer at Whole Foods, put it away, and forgot about it. Last week I found it in my linen closet and tried it. I was amazed and so happy with it. It very luxurious and creats alot of lather. My skin was left soft, and SQEEKY CLEAN!! I have actually never felt so clean inall my life!! I even used it towash my hair. My hair was clean, thick and wavy. I bought the Lavender scented soap, and my skin smelled wonderful. I have been giving it to friends and family. I went back to Whole Foods today to stock up. The manager told me that they carry 2500 different soaps, and THIS soap is their best seller. I bought the lavender scented soap again for 3/$6.00. I&#x27;m not sure if Amazon sells this scent. If they did I could save some money.</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic. Clean smelling, long lasting and great price. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not too drying, pleasant smell. I thought it might get moushy since it did not seem dry enough but it lasted a long time and the whole bathroom smells nice.</li>
            <li> An all natural soap...Smells great, wont burn ur eyes and helps protect the animals and enviroment....Give it a try, you wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for at least eight years now. Great price and great shipping. Will order more as Chritmas presents soon.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this great soap. We find the price much better than buying it locally. We love the product and use it exclusively in our bath room. Amazons price and service can not be beat.  Jack McNeal</li>
            <li> I had read the previous reviews before I had ordered it, and they all seem to imply that it was very gentle and creamy. I had purchased some goat&#x27;s milk soap from a Mennonite or Amish store in the past, and it was so full of fat, that it was very moisturizing. It was also much more expensive than this brand. This seemed a little too drying for my skin. I had also read about the fragrance from previous reviews, and how it was too strong for some. I was actually pleased with the fragrance, and it did not seem any stronger than any other bar soap I have purchased. The multi pack was the best value, but I wish I had just bought one bar first before ordering a dozen bars. This would probably be fine for someone with normal or oily skin.</li>
            <li> A good product, I like the way it smells and the softness it leaves your skin feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about 5 years and my dry flakey skin is gone. The same for a granddaughter who has a lot of skin allergies.</li>
