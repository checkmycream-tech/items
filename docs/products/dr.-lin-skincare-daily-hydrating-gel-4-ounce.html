            <li>I like this product and it feels nice on my skin</li>

            <li>a huge plus in my book!</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff, I use it as an aftershave/ moisturizer / blemish cream...</li>
            <li>Lin&#x27;s Daily Hydrating Gel is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I love it, and my skin is so drenched.</li>
            <li>an acne treatment I can&#x27;t say for sure,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews</li>
            <li>Really glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>You might be tempted like I was to use all over, but it goes very quickly if you do.</li>
            <li>you can easily contaminate the product.</li>
            <li>Honestly saw improvement&#x27;s in my skins texture and redness the morning after the first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny because our whole family tried it and we all think it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Not pore clogging and feels light.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an inexpensive light gel moisturizer and found this at ulta.</li>
            <li>Does a good job at hydrating sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a light clear gel that features some great actives such as, arbutin(both as arbutin and bearberry extract) which helps lighten acne marks, sodium hyaluronate and glycerin which are good humectants, and a handful of soothing ingredients that might help calm irritated</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this face gel.</li>
            <li>It feels so cool and light when applied.</li>
            <li>It sinks in beautifully and keeps my skin hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
            <li>Good value overall.</li>
            <li>My skin does fairly well with jojoba oil as a moisturizer during the warmer months, but it&#x27;s never enough during the colder ones</li>
            <li>When I put it on after my toner it has a nice cooling affect and does not sting the sensitive parts of my face.</li>
            <li>Not hydrating enough for my dry skin, but may be perfect for oily skin types.</li>
            <li>found that this moisturizer on its own was not enough for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>My main problems are trying to find an effective skincare routine that treats my acne, but doesn&#x27;t aggravate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very into natural skin care and feel that my skin behaves better when I use more natural products.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by how the gel soaks right in, looks totally natural (as a man, I don&#x27;t want to look like I am wearing anything) and makes the skin smooth and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Also, I find myself having to apply the product a second time in dryer months but not a big deal because of the great price.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Definitely going to try more from the Dr. Lin product line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had mild chronic acne for most of my adult life, tapering out from severe cystic acne as a teen.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many expensive products and this works much better!</li>
            <li>Those products were much too pricey for the advertised amount of product, as well as ineffective on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very sticky after I apply this gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works very well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, helps with my acne, and even helps with controlling oil.</li>
            <li>Really helps before and after a golf games too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped me trough my stressful skin concerns.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I have become more sensitive to the sun and end up turning red if I did not reapply my sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Poor kid, been there myself and I am all for anything that makes my daughter feel more confident.  </li>
            <li>For some reason it makes my skin MORE dry and irritated it!!!</li>
            <li>so I was really interested in its soothing claims and natural</li>
            <li>It works fantastically, and it has become my new holy grail product!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sting, dries quickly and gets ride of red spots..</li>
            <li>she has acne, it moisturizes without leaving oily residue,it feels like water on the skin that quickly absorbs, it feels sticky for a few minutes until it dries, then leaves your skin smooth and soft, makeup goes on very well, highly recommend</li>
            <li>I have Combination skin a little more on the oily side.</li>
            <li>It works nicely, apply a little only, too much your face will feel sticky.  </li>
            <li>There is completely no odor and the gel leaves my face feeling cool and hydrated.</li>
            <li>She says it works and feels as good as many of the other high end expensive products she buys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought it for the first time at CVS when I was in the mood for trying something different.</li>
            <li>I use this gel to calm my irritated skin as well as seal in any moisture I have applied from any other products (mostly oils - a few drops of jojoba and rosehip oils).</li>
            <li>We did a little before and after comparison test and to me, she looks younger and more rested with the gel on.  </li>
            <li>However, this product leaves my skin feeling soft, supple, and invigorated everytime</li>
            <li>It works seamlessly and contains no parabens or silicones -</li>
            <li>I actually like the whole line.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin with acne.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my teenage daughter, affordable and very helpful bc</li>
            <li>It has a somewhat sticky texture if you put it on too thickly, but doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and does make my skin feel more hydrated.</li>
            <li>Skin is smooth and clear and no more itching.</li>
            <li>Contamination is a big concern for me because of my newly acquired acne so I wish they offered a bottle option.</li>
            <li>Developed adult acne last year and needed a moisturizer that would help sooth my skin and replenish it.</li>
            <li>All in all, I would definitely recommend this to those with sensitive, acne-prone skin who need some soothing moisture!</li>
            <li>It is clear and has the same consistency of aloe vera.</li>
            <li>I have ultra dry, itchy, sensitive, temperamental skin that is prone to bouts of eczema depending on the weather.</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Other moisturizers (mainly lotion ones) burned my skin like the dickens and had gross scents</li>

            <li> Other moisturizers (mainly lotion ones) burned my skin like the dickens and had gross scents</li>
            <li> I have highly reactive, pale, rosacean (subtype 2) skin that is both oily and dehydrated.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this hydrating gel after researching a plethora of products that claimed to soothe dry and irritated skin...but to no avail.</li>
            <li> bought the gel because I get dry skin a lot from being outside in the sun driving and sporting around and from being inside the office or on plane rides with air conditioning all day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not enough for my dry skin in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Also, a little old age kicking in too</li>
            <li> With my skin&#x27;s difficulties, I&#x27;m usually disappointed in most products I purchase, experiencing clogs, rashes or break-outs: until now!</li>
            <li> It does dry matte, helping with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I had to use a heavier cream on my dry spots.</li>
            <li> As much as I like this, I&#x27;m anxious to try the other products as well!</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use this product in my everyday skin care.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I thought I bought expensive aloe vera gel, as it is one of the first ingredients.</li>
            <li> Along with the other Dr. Lin products, she says it helps with sun and with prevention and recovery from breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It cant be quite sticky to apply, it does dry non sticky, but can make my makeup go on uneven.</li>
            <li> I usually carry a little bit with me in a smaller jar to leave in my purse.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why they would put this in there, but it is way down on the list and hasn&#x27;t seemed to cause me any problems yet.</li>
            <li> It did seem to help my acne marks fade a little quicker, but I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> so Amazon is the way to go, even a few cents cheaper....</li>
            <li> I found this a few weeks ago at Walmart when I was looking for something to use after shaving my armpits and bikini area which decided they were going to be irritated and itchy this year and not react to cortisone cream.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re supposed to wipe it off after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I checked the ingredients at the COSDNA website (analyzes ingredients) and the only ingredient that was of concern is sodium hydroxide (AKA caustic soda or lye) which scores a 5 on the irritant scale.</li>
            <li> I saw this recommended in a forum called SkinCareAddicts as an alternative for people who have reactions to fatty alcohols.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sometimes not easy to find in stores</li>
            <li> You have to use at least SPF 30 with this product.</li>
            <li> So I desperate to find something that would fix the problem.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always desperately seeking something to quench the dryness and soothe the irritation.</li>
            <li> However, I am very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I took it after seeing so many great reviews on this product. didnt do anything good on my skin. I thrashed this product finally.</li>
            <li> I have ultra dry, itchy, sensitive, temperamental skin that is prone to bouts of eczema depending on the weather. I recently purchased this hydrating gel after researching a plethora of products that claimed to soothe dry and irritated skin...but to no avail. Those products were much too pricey for the advertised amount of product, as well as ineffective on my skin. However, this product leaves my skin feeling soft, supple, and invigorated everytime I apply it onto my face! I use it daily - once in the morning and once at night after I have applied my own managerie of oils and serums on top of my skin. I use this gel to calm my irritated skin as well as seal in any moisture I have applied from any other products (mostly oils - a few drops of jojoba and rosehip oils). It works fantastically, and it has become my new holy grail product! It works seamlessly and contains no parabens or silicones - a huge plus in my book!</li>
            <li> great product- arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> This is basically watery aloe vera gel. My skin feels very sticky after I apply this gel. My skin dries out if I use only Dr. Lin&#x27;s morning and night. To use it up without wasting, I&#x27;m using it as my &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; morning moisturizer with a thicker cream one at night. Not hydrating enough for my dry skin, but may be perfect for oily skin types.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good. Does a good job at hydrating sensitive skin. I actually like the whole line. Bought it for the first time at CVS when I was in the mood for trying something different.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews. However, I am very disappointed. For some reason it makes my skin MORE dry and irritated it!!! Isn&#x27;t it not supposed to do that? Oh well...</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer, but the tub packaging can be unsanitary. Please put this in a tube or pump!</li>
            <li> This does moisturize my face. It is clear and has the same consistency of aloe vera. I was skeptical at first because I thought I bought expensive aloe vera gel, as it is one of the first ingredients. It does dry matte, helping with my oily skin. However, this gel moisturizer only lasts about 6 hours before I see some oil pop up on my T-Zone. I usually carry a little bit with me in a smaller jar to leave in my purse. At work, I will reapply the moisturizer and my sunscreen. You have to use at least SPF 30 with this product. I noticed that I have become more sensitive to the sun and end up turning red if I did not reapply my sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it feels nice on my skin but it doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this face gel. It is a great summer moisturizer. Good value overall.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, I use it as an aftershave/ moisturizer / blemish cream... Doesn&#x27;t sting, dries quickly and gets ride of red spots.. It&#x27;s sometimes not easy to find in stores so Amazon is the way to go, even a few cents cheaper....</li>
            <li> By PKH (Hawaii)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Lin&#x27;s Daily Hydrating Gel is wonderful!  It&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t oily.  It leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, and refreshed.  I will definitely continue to use this product in my everyday skin care.  I liked it so much, I bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Light and hydrating, great during the day under makeup, doesn&#x27;t make me oily or break out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I love it, and my skin is so drenched.</li>
            <li> Really love this product! The best moisturizer I have found for my problem skin, and trust me I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin with acne. I love this moisturizer! It&#x27;s works very well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, helps with my acne, and even helps with controlling oil. I have tried so many expensive products and this works much better!</li>
            <li> I found this a few weeks ago at Walmart when I was looking for something to use after shaving my armpits and bikini area which decided they were going to be irritated and itchy this year and not react to cortisone cream. So I desperate to find something that would fix the problem. This was in the Acne skincare area and it says on it that it was good to use for after shaving too. So I tried it. It works beautifully! Skin is smooth and clear and no more itching. You might be tempted like I was to use all over, but it goes very quickly if you do. The directions say it&#x27;s the last part of a 3 part system and you&#x27;re supposed to wipe it off after a few seconds. I don&#x27;t unless I&#x27;ve put baby oil on in the shower. It tends to bead with it. I guess you use it after you apply lotion if you&#x27;re going to apply lotion.&lt;br /&gt;As an acne treatment I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I think I see a difference when I use it on areas that have gotten a blemish. It has Hyaluronic Acid instead of salicylic acid or that peroxide stuff. It&#x27;s made with a lot of extracts instead of oils.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but I thought this one deserved one.  It&#x27;s funny because our whole family tried it and we all think it&#x27;s a great product.  Great value, definitely worth buying and trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the gel because I get dry skin a lot from being outside in the sun driving and sporting around and from being inside the office or on plane rides with air conditioning all day.  Also, a little old age kicking in too I guess.  I was really surprised by how the gel soaks right in, looks totally natural (as a man, I don&#x27;t want to look like I am wearing anything) and makes the skin smooth and healthy looking.  Really helps before and after a golf games too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife tried it as she saw the results it had on my skin and my willingness to use any product at all and she really likes it.  We bought her a container too.  We did a little before and after comparison test and to me, she looks younger and more rested with the gel on.  She says it works and feels as good as many of the other high end expensive products she buys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife gave it to our daughter to try and she thinks it helps with her problemed teenager skin.  Along with the other Dr. Lin products, she says it helps with sun and with prevention and recovery from breakouts.  Poor kid, been there myself and I am all for anything that makes my daughter feel more confident.  She got a container too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I think this is a good product and a good line.  Definitely going to try more from the Dr. Lin product line.  There&#x27;s also a bunch of online videos on the products too. [...]</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if this is working or not. It cant be quite sticky to apply, it does dry non sticky, but can make my makeup go on uneven. This maybe good for warmer humid months or climates. It&#x27;s not enough for my dry skin in the winter months.</li>
            <li> This is great for my girls with acne. Not pore clogging and feels light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very into natural skin care and feel that my skin behaves better when I use more natural products. I have highly reactive, pale, rosacean (subtype 2) skin that is both oily and dehydrated. I&#x27;ve also had mild chronic acne for most of my adult life, tapering out from severe cystic acne as a teen. My main problems are trying to find an effective skincare routine that treats my acne, but doesn&#x27;t aggravate my very sensitive skin. My skin does fairly well with jojoba oil as a moisturizer during the warmer months, but it&#x27;s never enough during the colder ones and I&#x27;m always desperately seeking something to quench the dryness and soothe the irritation. With my skin&#x27;s difficulties, I&#x27;m usually disappointed in most products I purchase, experiencing clogs, rashes or break-outs: until now! This aloe-based moisturizing gel from Dr. Lin Skincare is AMAZING! It feels so cool and light when applied. It immediately soothes any irritation I may have, yet doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. It sinks in beautifully and keeps my skin hydrated all day. I came across this by accident, having never heard of the line before and just stumbling upon it at a recent trip to CVS. As much as I like this, I&#x27;m anxious to try the other products as well! I checked the ingredients at the COSDNA website (analyzes ingredients) and the only ingredient that was of concern is sodium hydroxide (AKA caustic soda or lye) which scores a 5 on the irritant scale. I have no idea why they would put this in there, but it is way down on the list and hasn&#x27;t seemed to cause me any problems yet. I will edit if needed. All in all, I would definitely recommend this to those with sensitive, acne-prone skin who need some soothing moisture!</li>
            <li> I saw this recommended in a forum called SkinCareAddicts as an alternative for people who have reactions to fatty alcohols. It has a somewhat sticky texture if you put it on too thickly, but doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and does make my skin feel more hydrated.</li>
            <li> This is a light clear gel that features some great actives such as, arbutin(both as arbutin and bearberry extract) which helps lighten acne marks, sodium hyaluronate and glycerin which are good humectants, and a handful of soothing ingredients that might help calm irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this moisturizer on its own was not enough for my combination skin. I had to use a heavier cream on my dry spots. It dries a bit sticky which I didn&#x27;t like. It did seem to help my acne marks fade a little quicker, but I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I have Combination skin a little more on the oily side. Developed adult acne last year and needed a moisturizer that would help sooth my skin and replenish it. Other moisturizers (mainly lotion ones) burned my skin like the dickens and had gross scents so I was really interested in its soothing claims and natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the product does what is says it will. When I put it on after my toner it has a nice cooling affect and does not sting the sensitive parts of my face. There is completely no odor and the gel leaves my face feeling cool and hydrated. The price is also excellent for the amount of product you get. Great for a budget.&lt;br /&gt; The only cons for me is that it is in a jar and not a bottle with a pump. Contamination is a big concern for me because of my newly acquired acne so I wish they offered a bottle option. Also, I find myself having to apply the product a second time in dryer months but not a big deal because of the great price. Really glad I found this product. It has really helped me trough my stressful skin concerns.</li>
            <li> Love the gel,  good price, works good</li>
            <li> Amazing! I use this every night. I have dry sensitive skin. Honestly saw improvement&#x27;s in my skins texture and redness the morning after the first use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter, affordable and very helpful bc she has acne, it moisturizes without leaving oily residue,it feels like water on the skin that quickly absorbs, it feels sticky for a few minutes until it dries, then leaves your skin smooth and soft, makeup goes on very well, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive light gel moisturizer and found this at ulta. I checked the ingredients on cosdna and it seems alright.  Great price, no fragrance or colorant,  watery like gel. It works nicely, apply a little only, too much your face will feel sticky.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the packageing,  anything in a jar you can easily contaminate the product. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
