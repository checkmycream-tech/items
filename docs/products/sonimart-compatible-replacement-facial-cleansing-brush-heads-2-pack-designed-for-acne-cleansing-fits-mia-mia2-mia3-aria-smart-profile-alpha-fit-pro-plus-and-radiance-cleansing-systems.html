            <li>They fit my Clarisonic perfectly and worked just fine</li>
            <li>I own a clarisonic mia 2, which I bought in Korea, and I bought this brush and have been using it for two weeks.</li>
            <li>Purchased these and they seem every bit as good as originals at a much better price.</li>
            <li>so I decided to stick with that kind of head when I decided to give these a try.  </li>
            <li>needed for it to be as cost effective as the Clarisonic brushes.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great quality!</li>
            <li>As advertised, the brushes are softer than the original but still work great</li>

            <li>One of the better brush heads for my Mia that is way cheaper than name brand.  </li>
            <li>These replacement brush heads were a great price and worked very well.</li>
            <li>They fit the Mia 2 perfectly, and I find that they&#x27;re softer than the brush for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I have found these.</li>
            <li>SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>These are cheaper and more convenient.</li>
            <li>It helps my cleanser that I use work a bit better as my face does need some clearin&#x27; up.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are better than the Clarisonic ones imo</li>
            <li>I love my Clarisonic and knew it was time to replace the heads.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are virtually identical to Clarisonic&#x27;s heads in most respects.</li>
            <li>but at a much better price.</li>
            <li>These replacement brush heads were a great price and worked very well.</li>

            <li>I clean my face with these or the clarisonic ones and have always been happy with how fresh it makes my face look and feel  :)</li>
            <li>Much more cost friendly!</li>

            <li>They fit the Mia 2 perfectly, at such a great deal, I&#x27;ll be getting my brush heads from this seller from now on!</li>
            <li>As good as the real thing.</li>
            <li>I like the way it feels more than the original, though that may just be me.</li>
            <li>At this price, I can replace them easily.</li>
            <li>Nice to find replacements that are reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>These generics are pretty nice</li>
            <li>Great for keeping my skin clean and clear.  </li>
            <li>and they work fine.</li>
            <li>Fits my mia2 just fine</li>
            <li>fits perfect on my clarisonic and for half the cost</li>
            <li>and they work fine.</li>
            <li>I found no significant differances from the name brand Clarisonic brush head and they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>The heads fit in Clarisonic Aria</li>
            <li>I purchased for my teenage daughter and she is happy with the quality of these products</li>
            <li>Such a great barggain.</li>
            <li>I genuinely cannot tell a difference, and I&#x27;ve been using one of the brushes for a month now.</li>
            <li>they are gentle and the brush fibers make my face feel nice</li>
            <li>The brush heads fit and work just like the ones that came with my Aria</li>
            <li>The brush heads fit with out problem and work just like the ones that came with my Aria originally.</li>
            <li>Luckily Ulta was great enough to replace the pack, no questions asked.</li>
            <li>They are comparable to the original brushes.</li>
            <li>They are even better than the ones I used before and the price is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Each brush head comes with it&#x27;s own clear cap.</li>
            <li>Good value for such a close copy to the origianl Clarisonic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, but the Clarisonic heads</li>
            <li>super smooth on my skin and works really well getting rid of my acne!!</li>
            <li>It fit just right</li>
            <li>These generic replacement brush heads were a great price and worked out very well.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and when in use, it performed without any sort of problems.  </li>
            <li>These Sonimart brush heads are by far the most comparable to original ones.</li>
            <li>These are the exact brush heads sold by Clarisonic to fit your device, just cheaper</li>
            <li>These are less expsnsive and work great.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very comparable to the OEM replacement brushes!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are better than the Clarisonic ones actually IMO, I have definitely seen better results with my skin since using them that I did not notice until after many uses of the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>they are worth it.  </li>
            <li>The softness of my acne heads is just right.</li>
            <li>They clean very well</li>
            <li>This product arrived super fast.  </li>
            <li>Not as harsh on my skin as I thought it would be, in fact, they&#x27;re very soft and I love them even more than the Clarisonic heads!</li>
            <li>Just like the expensive brand name but at a great price!  </li>
            <li>They are the exact quality as the $25 replacements I buy for my clarisonic mia.</li>
            <li>Love this brush even though it’s a generic.  </li>
            <li>Got them fast!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my Clarisonic Aria.</li>
            <li>Such a steal too because it&#x27;s so cheaper :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Clarisonic brand acne brush heads in the past, and I can tell you, these are just as good at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>This product is just as good if not better than the head that came with my Mia.</li>
            <li>My wife says her heads are real delicate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product does work and fit my Clarisonic handle, but it just doesn&#x27;t have that same feel when you scrub your face with it.  </li>
            <li>and I can hardly distinguish them from each other, a very good deal!</li>
            <li>Exactly same with original clarisonic one.</li>
            <li>Great for the price, very comprobale to the ridiculously expensive one</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend the product</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>No complaints so far!!</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I feel give a little better performance.  </li>
            <li>Work just as great as the expensive sonicare ones.</li>
            <li>They snap right in and work in the same manner that the Clarisonic heads do.</li>
            <li>In terms of helping reduce the acne, I&#x27;m not so certain, but it feels soft and good, so I recommend this product to those who might be skeptical of this product due to the cheap price.</li>
            <li>Very soft compared to the originals.  </li>
            <li>Just like the original more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>They are the exact same as the $25 replacements for my Mia2.</li>
            <li>they look exactly like original brush head, but they dont spin and they are very harsh.</li>
            <li>I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they are great!</li>
            <li>After contacting Clairsonic, they told me they couldn&#x27;t replace it because I didn&#x27;t buy it from them directly and that I needed to go to Ulta to try to replace it.</li>
            <li>This brush head is SO soft and I think it&#x27;s been helping my Acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend the product as its the same as the clarisonic brand</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the bristles are a little too soft but other than that I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend these to anybody who wants to clear their face up from a few belemishes.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same as my Clarisonic head I bought previously except for the different labelling</li>

            <li> They fit my Clarisonic perfectly and worked just fine</li>
            <li> I own a clarisonic mia 2, which I bought in Korea, and I bought this brush and have been using it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> Purchased these and they seem every bit as good as originals at a much better price.</li>
            <li> so I decided to stick with that kind of head when I decided to give these a try.  </li>
            <li> needed for it to be as cost effective as the Clarisonic brushes.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great quality!</li>
            <li> As advertised, the brushes are softer than the original but still work great</li>
            <li> Very pleased that it fit my clarasonic!</li>
            <li> These are more cost friendly and work great.</li>
            <li> Not only did the seller get them to me before the delivery date, but they are great quality and worked great with my Clarisonic Mia.</li>

            <li> One of the better brush heads for my Mia that is way cheaper than name brand.  </li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads were a great price and worked very well.</li>
            <li> They fit the Mia 2 perfectly, and I find that they&#x27;re softer than the brush for sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> These are cheaper and more convenient.</li>

            <li> These brush heads are better than the Clarisonic ones imo</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic and knew it was time to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are virtually identical to Clarisonic&#x27;s heads in most respects.</li>
            <li> but at a much better price.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads were a great price and worked very well.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic and knew it was time to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t love this product.</li>

            <li> I clean my face with these or the clarisonic ones and have always been happy with how fresh it makes my face look and feel  :)</li>

            <li> As good as the real thing.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels more than the original, though that may just be me.</li>
            <li> At this price, I can replace them easily.</li>
            <li> Nice to find replacements that are reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> These generics are pretty nice</li>
            <li> Great for keeping my skin clean and clear.  </li>

            <li> and they work fine.</li>
            <li> I found no significant differances from the name brand Clarisonic brush head and they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> The heads fit in Clarisonic Aria</li>
            <li> I purchased for my teenage daughter and she is happy with the quality of these products</li>
            <li> Such a great barggain.</li>
            <li> I genuinely cannot tell a difference, and I&#x27;ve been using one of the brushes for a month now.</li>
            <li> they are gentle and the brush fibers make my face feel nice</li>
            <li> The brush heads fit and work just like the ones that came with my Aria</li>
            <li> The brush heads fit with out problem and work just like the ones that came with my Aria originally.</li>
            <li> Luckily Ulta was great enough to replace the pack, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> They are comparable to the original brushes.</li>
            <li> They are even better than the ones I used before and the price is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Each brush head comes with it&#x27;s own clear cap.</li>
            <li> Good value for such a close copy to the origianl Clarisonic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, but the Clarisonic heads</li>
            <li> super smooth on my skin and works really well getting rid of my acne!!</li>
            <li> It fit just right</li>
            <li> These generic replacement brush heads were a great price and worked out very well.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and when in use, it performed without any sort of problems.  </li>
            <li> These Sonimart brush heads are by far the most comparable to original ones.</li>
            <li> These are the exact brush heads sold by Clarisonic to fit your device, just cheaper</li>
            <li> These are less expsnsive and work great.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very comparable to the OEM replacement brushes!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are better than the Clarisonic ones actually IMO, I have definitely seen better results with my skin since using them that I did not notice until after many uses of the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> they are worth it.  </li>
            <li> The softness of my acne heads is just right.</li>
            <li> They clean very well</li>
            <li> This product arrived super fast.  </li>
            <li> Not as harsh on my skin as I thought it would be, in fact, they&#x27;re very soft and I love them even more than the Clarisonic heads!</li>
            <li> Just like the expensive brand name but at a great price!  </li>
            <li> They are the exact quality as the $25 replacements I buy for my clarisonic mia.</li>
            <li> Love this brush even though it’s a generic.  </li>
            <li> Got them fast!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my Clarisonic Aria.</li>
            <li> Such a steal too because it&#x27;s so cheaper :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Clarisonic brand acne brush heads in the past, and I can tell you, these are just as good at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good if not better than the head that came with my Mia.</li>
            <li> My wife says her heads are real delicate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product does work and fit my Clarisonic handle, but it just doesn&#x27;t have that same feel when you scrub your face with it.  </li>
            <li> and I can hardly distinguish them from each other, a very good deal!</li>
            <li> Exactly same with original clarisonic one.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, very comprobale to the ridiculously expensive one</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend the product</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> No complaints so far!!</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> I feel give a little better performance.  </li>
            <li> Work just as great as the expensive sonicare ones.</li>
            <li> They snap right in and work in the same manner that the Clarisonic heads do.</li>
            <li> In terms of helping reduce the acne, I&#x27;m not so certain, but it feels soft and good, so I recommend this product to those who might be skeptical of this product due to the cheap price.</li>
            <li> Very soft compared to the originals.  </li>
            <li> Just like the original more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> They are the exact same as the $25 replacements for my Mia2.</li>
            <li> they look exactly like original brush head, but they dont spin and they are very harsh.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they are great!</li>
            <li> After contacting Clairsonic, they told me they couldn&#x27;t replace it because I didn&#x27;t buy it from them directly and that I needed to go to Ulta to try to replace it.</li>
            <li> This brush head is SO soft and I think it&#x27;s been helping my Acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend the product as its the same as the clarisonic brand</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bristles are a little too soft but other than that I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend these to anybody who wants to clear their face up from a few belemishes.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as my Clarisonic head I bought previously except for the different labelling</li>
            <li> I can feel the bristles never go flat when on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Even if these don&#x27;t last as long (I don&#x27;t know yet)</li>
            <li> Then after using my first brush, I went to replace with the second one in the box, and it was broken.</li>
            <li> Same quality as the original sonic replacement heads but much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The generic heads I have tried in the past are either too stiff or too soft that the bristles fell apart.</li>
            <li> I had the regular brush head that came with the Clarisonic which was a little too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used other type of brush heads in the past, with delicate too soft &amp; normal too stiff.</li>
            <li> I purchased four acne heads for me and two delicate heads for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles of the acne and delicate do feel a difference.</li>
            <li> Just like the clarisonic brush heads but less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they did not disappoint me when I used them</li>
            <li> Ultimately I was frustrated because I already had to return the product once</li>
            <li> Two of the prongs on the inside brush were broken.</li>
            <li> I used to have very serious pore issues.</li>
            <li> I am unable to even to tell the difference between these and the originals</li>
            <li> The name brand heads are so expensive that it makes replacing them prohibitive.</li>
            <li> Sadly dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> The result is quite disappointing</li>
            <li> Just like the expensive Clarisonic heads!</li>
            <li> I will never pay for expensive replacement heads again!</li>
            <li> The bristles are well attached to the base.</li>
            <li> Grrr!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just as good as the Clarisonic brand</li>
            <li> Wow!! these brushes are just as good as clarisonic! I&#x27;m super happy!</li>
            <li> Of course Clarisonic original acne brush heads have the best quality. I will not deny on that. I used to have very serious pore issues. I have used other type of brush heads in the past, with delicate too soft &amp; normal too stiff. Acne brush works the best to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well though I am a bit of Clarisonic fan, I look for alternative replacement brush heads because of the pricey originals. The result is quite disappointing I have to admit. The generic heads I have tried in the past are either too stiff or too soft that the bristles fell apart. These Sonimart brush heads are by far the most comparable to original ones. I purchased four acne heads for me and two delicate heads for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The bristles of the acne and delicate do feel a difference. It is not just the color which is different. My wife says her heads are real delicate.&lt;br /&gt;* The softness of my acne heads is just right. Stiffer than my wife&#x27;s, but not hard.&lt;br /&gt;* The bristles are well attached to the base. I can feel the bristles never go flat when on my oily skin. The quality is outstanding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone with larger pores or oily combination skin like me.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price! No complaints so far!! Save your money and give them a try.</li>
            <li> great price. good product.</li>
            <li> These are great over the name brand from Clarisonic! I can&#x27;t complain as I can&#x27;t even tell the difference between this and the name brand!</li>
            <li> Just like the expensive brand name but at a great price!  I Love them!</li>
            <li> The brush heads fit with out problem and work just like the ones that came with my Aria originally.</li>
            <li> They work just like the brand name ones</li>
            <li> As good as the real thing.</li>
            <li> I clean my face with these or the clarisonic ones and have always been happy with how fresh it makes my face look and feel  :)</li>
            <li> Just like the expensive Clarisonic heads!</li>
            <li> I own a clarisonic mia 2, which I bought in Korea, and I bought this brush and have been using it for two weeks. They are even better than the ones I used before and the price is much cheaper. In terms of helping reduce the acne, I&#x27;m not so certain, but it feels soft and good, so I recommend this product to those who might be skeptical of this product due to the cheap price. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> One of the better brush heads for my Mia that is way cheaper than name brand.  Recommend.</li>

            <li> As advertised, the brushes are softer than the original but still work great</li>
            <li> Love this brush even though it’s a generic.  The quality and cost make this a product I will purchae again.</li>
            <li> For the price I thought I would give these brushes a try. I will definitely order them again as the quality is impressive and it functions just fine.</li>
            <li> Glad I decided to try them!  They work pefect!</li>
            <li> Just as effective as the overpriced name brand ones!</li>
            <li> At a fraction of the price, its no wonder these are getting such favorable reviews compared to the name brand version. I use these with my Mia system by Clarisonic and they are practically the same thing.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Clarisonic brand</li>
            <li> Got them fast!  Work just as great as the expensive sonicare ones.</li>
            <li> they look exactly like original brush head, but they dont spin and they are very harsh. I am going to return it.</li>
            <li> These are better and cheaper than the Clarisonic acne cleaning heads!</li>
            <li> Great deal! The heads fit in Clarisonic Aria great and I am very happy with the purchase. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my teenage daughter and she is happy with the quality of these products</li>
            <li> They fit the Mia 2 perfectly, and I find that they&#x27;re softer than the brush for sensitive skin. Such a great barggain.</li>
            <li> I bought these to for my Clairsonic Mia 2 and they work fine. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I will never pay for expensive replacement heads again! I am so glad I have found these. I got a Clarisonic for Christmas as well as the twin pack replacement heads. When I opened the gift, I found out someone had stolen one out of the box. Luckily Ulta was great enough to replace the pack, no questions asked. Then after using my first brush, I went to replace with the second one in the box, and it was broken. Two of the prongs on the inside brush were broken. After contacting Clairsonic, they told me they couldn&#x27;t replace it because I didn&#x27;t buy it from them directly and that I needed to go to Ulta to try to replace it. Ultimately I was frustrated because I already had to return the product once, I didn&#x27;t want to have to do it again when it is THEIR defective product. The closest Ulta is 30 miles from my house so I went online to find these and took a chance. SO glad I did. I genuinely cannot tell a difference, and I&#x27;ve been using one of the brushes for a month now. These are cheaper and more convenient. I will keep purchasing these.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are better than the Clarisonic ones actually IMO, I have definitely seen better results with my skin since using them that I did not notice until after many uses of the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase! I will order again</li>
            <li> Works just as well as my original clarisonic ones!</li>
            <li> The quality seems to be as good as the official brush heads. It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the brushes. Great price and fit my original Clarisonic perfectly. My only complaint is that the bristles are a little too soft but other than that I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. I&#x27;ll definitely buy these brush heads again.</li>
            <li> Purchased these and they seem every bit as good as originals at a much better price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had acne for a while, but I used to use the Clarisonic Acne Cleansing heads so I decided to stick with that kind of head when I decided to give these a try.  They clean very well and I can hardly distinguish them from each other, a very good deal!</li>
            <li> It helps my cleanser that I use work a bit better as my face does need some clearin&#x27; up. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> These work perfect with my Mia but didn&#x27;t ding my bank account as much!</li>
            <li> These brush heads are better than the Clarisonic ones imo</li>
            <li> they are gentle and the brush fibers make my face feel nice</li>
            <li> These are more cost friendly and work great. I am unable to even to tell the difference between these and the originals</li>
            <li> I found no significant differances from the name brand Clarisonic brush head and they fit perfectly. I will definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit perfectly on my Clarisonic Mia! Each brush head comes with it&#x27;s own clear cap. I will defiantly buy these replacement heads again from Sonimart</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit perfectly on my Clarisonic Mia!  Thank You!!!1</li>
            <li> Just like the original more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> These are just as good as the ones you purchase in the store. I would buy again and tell my friends too!</li>
            <li> These work perfect with my Mia. Much more cost friendly!</li>
            <li> Just likek the the ones from Clarisonic</li>
            <li> super smooth on my skin and works really well getting rid of my acne!!(;</li>
            <li> Compared ot the clarisonic head I have at home these are almost identical, 5 stars here!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference from the manufacturer&#x27;s overpriced replacements.</li>
            <li> Just like the Clarisonic at a price I can agree with.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any issues and everything has been great!  Five Stars!</li>
            <li> Wow! What a value these brush heads were!!! Not only did the seller get them to me before the delivery date, but they are great quality and worked great with my Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li> Great product, five star quality.</li>
            <li> Just like the clarisonic brush heads but less expensive.  An excellent value all around.</li>
            <li> Fit my Clarisonic Mia perfectly and worked just fine</li>
            <li> Great for the price, very comprobale to the ridiculously expensive one</li>
            <li> They fit my Clarisonic perfectly and worked just fine</li>
            <li> I purchased for my wife and she is happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me &amp; my  Clarisonic MIA2!  I will continue to buy these brush heads-they fit perfectly and I cannot tell the difference between them and the branded brush heads.  Branded heads are about $30 a piece from Clarisonic.  That&#x27;s 600% more!! Even if these don&#x27;t last as long (I don&#x27;t know yet) they are worth it.  The brush head has lasted 2.5 weeks.  That&#x27;s longer than the 1/6 of 3 months (2weeks) needed for it to be as cost effective as the Clarisonic brushes.  I do use my Mia2 twice a day &amp; the brush Has yet to show signs of use.</li>
            <li> The price of these is very good as is the quality.  These generics are pretty nice and I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Fits the Mia brushhead perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Fits my mia2 just fine</li>
            <li> The quality seems to be as good as the official brush heads. It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the name brand!</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic and knew it was time to replace the heads. I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they did not disappoint me when I used them</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first, but after using it, I am now happy with my purchase and I will order again</li>
            <li> The brush heads fit and work just like the ones that came with my Aria</li>
            <li> I see no difference in these brushes and the ones from Clarisonic</li>
            <li> Good value for such a close copy to the origianl Clarisonic</li>
            <li> These brushes are very comparable to the OEM replacement brushes!!  I bought these to for my Clairsonic Mia 2. Would highly recommend this great product.</li>
            <li> What a great value these brush heads are!!!  They are excellent quality (Clarisonic standards) and worked great with my Clarisonic Mia!</li>
            <li> great price. good product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased that it fit my clarasonic!</li>
            <li> These are the best generics I&#x27;ve found online.  The name brand heads are so expensive that it makes replacing them prohibitive.</li>
            <li> These generic replacement brush heads were a great price and worked out very well.</li>
            <li> This product arrived super fast.  It&#x27;s an excellent product that had just saved my wife a ton of money. I bought two packages for the price of $20.00 and some change. Just one of these brushes in the department stores cost well over $25.00. These fit the original clarisonic perfectly and feel great on my face and the quality is superb.  Will be ordering again when needed.</li>
            <li> This purchase went perfectly.  The item arrived quickly and when in use, it performed without any sort of problems.  Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> These work perfect with my Mia but at a much better price than their Clarisonic counterparts.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend the product</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit my Mia 2 perfectly. I&#x27;ve used the Clarisonic brand acne brush heads in the past, and I can tell you, these are just as good at a fraction of the price. I will buy more!</li>
            <li> t they are excellent quality and worked great with my Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my Clarisonic Aria. Fast delivery and great quality!</li>
            <li> Will buy from this brand again.</li>
            <li> Same quality as the original sonic replacement heads but much less expensive.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit perfectly on my Clarisonic Mia!  The brush heads are virtually identical to Clarisonic&#x27;s heads in most respects.</li>
            <li> So glad I ordered these! They are the exact same as the $25 replacements for my Mia2.</li>
            <li> I had the regular brush head that came with the Clarisonic which was a little too rough on my skin. This brush head is SO soft and I think it&#x27;s been helping my Acne prone skin. I will definitely purchase again! Such a steal too because it&#x27;s so cheaper :)</li>
            <li> Purchased these and they seem every bit as good as name brand but at a much better price.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes I have ever ordered. They are comparable to the original brushes.</li>
            <li> Wow!! these brushes are just as good as the name brand! I&#x27;m very happy indeed!</li>
            <li> These brushes are just as good as clarisonic! I feel like I&#x27;ve been overpaying for Clarisonic heads all these years!  Grrr!!!</li>
            <li> Great alternative! I&#x27;d recommend to people I know.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin looking clearer after a sweaty day working.  Thse are wonderful!</li>
            <li> works pretty good.!! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Save your money and definitely purchase these!</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads were a great price and worked very well.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic and knew it was time to replace the heads. I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they are great!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, just like the one from Clarisonic</li>
            <li> They fit the Mia 2 perfectly, at such a great deal, I&#x27;ll be getting my brush heads from this seller from now on!</li>
            <li> It fit just right and they were a fraction of the cost. At this price, I can replace them easily.</li>
            <li> fits perfect on my clarisonic and for half the cost</li>
            <li> my face is thanking me for buying this</li>
            <li> The product does work and fit my Clarisonic handle, but it just doesn&#x27;t have that same feel when you scrub your face with it.  It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, but the Clarisonic heads I feel give a little better performance.  These however are priced very nicely so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li> I bought these to for my Clairsonic Mia 2 and they work fine. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t love this product. It is nothing like the the actual brush heads. Sadly dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> they are gentle and the brush fibers make my face feel great</li>
            <li> These are the exact brush heads sold by Clarisonic to fit your device, just cheaper</li>
            <li> So glad I ordered these, and I will continue to do so as they work great!</li>
            <li> A great value for those on a budget!  This product is just as good if not better than the head that came with my Mia.</li>
            <li> Very soft compared to the originals.  I like the way it feels more than the original, though that may just be me.</li>
            <li> Not as harsh on my skin as I thought it would be, in fact, they&#x27;re very soft and I love them even more than the Clarisonic heads!</li>
            <li> great price. good product.</li>
            <li> I use the Mia system by Clarisonic and am very pleased with the performance these have delivered.  They snap right in and work in the same manner that the Clarisonic heads do.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping my skin clean and clear.  I&#x27;d recommend these to anybody who wants to clear their face up from a few belemishes.</li>
