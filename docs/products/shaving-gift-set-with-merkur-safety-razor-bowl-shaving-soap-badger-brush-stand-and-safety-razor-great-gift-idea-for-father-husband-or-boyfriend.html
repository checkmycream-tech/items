            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful set</li>

            <li>Great shaving set, all the parts of this set are of very good quality, good shave and great looks.  </li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>I keep a disposable around for cleanup duty around the edges, and that works great.  </li>
            <li>but now that I have Tabac, it lathers excellent and the brush applicator is a nice feeling in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>happy</li>
            <li>I get a really great shave now instead of using the foam out of a can and a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>The brush and razor with stand are great.  </li>
            <li>Seems like a great quality set.</li>
            <li>This is a great set to get you started.</li>
            <li>I will say, the shaves are not as close as would be with a Mac 3 or something, but are still great shaves.</li>
            <li>Both the bowl and stand are made in Taiwan, the brush is from Great Britain and the razor is made in Germany.  </li>
            <li>The brush is great too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush you think is great until you buy a quality one and realize it&#x27;s not so great, heh.  </li>
            <li>The cup is a great size.  </li>
            <li>Great value, great product.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great safety razor set.</li>
            <li>If a beginner and want to have a matching set at a great price, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>The stand is great for keeping everything organized.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Great set-up.</li>

            <li>and i am happy that he is happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do suggest Googling \\&quot;how to shave w/ a safety razor\\&quot; to spare yourself and your skin the torture I went through in the beginning, lol.</li>
            <li>Great size for me.  </li>
            <li>The blade it came with worked great</li>

            <li>I would have liked the lather bowl to be a bit heavier</li>
            <li>This set is very attractive and cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>Plus the stainless makes them perfect for keeping in the shower if needed.</li>
            <li>You honestly can&#x27;t put a price on this experience,  every man should own one of these.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that its going to be nice</li>
            <li>Great product, great doing bussiness with you, I&#x27;ll highly recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li>On a more positive note, the shaving soap has a wonderful smell and it really is a nice looking set.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers up nicely and changing the blade is very easy.</li>
            <li>Great idea for that special man in your life.  </li>
            <li>The price was good for such an excellent item.</li>
            <li>Diamond pattern in handle makes it easy to keep a good grip</li>
            <li>The Merkur razor is very nice, the stand is pretty nice, the bowl looks nice</li>
            <li>I think this is a great first-time set for anyone interested in giving a safety razor a try!</li>
            <li>So I highly suggest buying a sampler pack of better blades along with this kit, so you can find which works best for you.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The sample blade that comes with this razor is ok, but I tried Feather blades on a friend&#x27;s recommendation; they are amazing.  </li>
            <li>The razor is a brilliant silver-blue stainless which makes it stand out and look as if it doesn&#x27;t go with the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I got another one of those he didn&#x27;t like that but was great the rest of it worth the price</li>
            <li>Merkurs are nice but they pulled more then cut.</li>
            <li>The person getting this as a gift will enjoy a good shave</li>
            <li>the brush around when you swirl it through the soap to work up a better lather nice and</li>
            <li>Awesome set for the guy who loves old school ways.</li>
            <li>A very rich, sophisticated set, I was very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the best blade exposure and is very mild, but you can get a very close shave with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, good quality!</li>
            <li>The stand is nicely weighted at the bottom and the whole kit looks great with it&#x27;s chrome finish.  </li>
            <li>soap is great, suitable for hot days when you&#x27;re looking to complement it with a citrus/Summer cologne.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and smooth and product arrived in perfect shape.</li>
            <li>It gives him a beautiful close shave and never clogs, like modern multi-blade razors do.</li>
            <li>This is a great starter kit, or shaving kit for the seasoned shaver.</li>
            <li>But the brush felt great on my skin and the shave soap left a pleasant smell on my face.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think he would like it, but the razor is weighted so nicely that it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It came with everything he needed to get started which was a huge selling point for me!</li>
            <li>I had to spend more money and get presentable boxes to give as a gift.</li>
            <li>Because I use it so sparingly, I have yet to replace the razor after more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells better</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t think of a better razor to start out with.</li>
            <li>There is much better brushes out there no doubt.</li>
            <li>I also get more shaves than with a disposable.</li>
            <li>A better way to shave?</li>
            <li>What the heck, I think, after all it&#x27;s a better shave, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and now we have a \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot; 5 blade system - after all what could be better than 3-blades?</li>
            <li>Of course I could forgo shaving altoghether and sport a more grizzled look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I love this shaving kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to a brand called Proraso which is much better in my opinion.(litterally)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I love this shaving kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to a brand called Proraso which is much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>, Merkur makes a great razor and with the stand, bowl, soap and badger brush you are ready to go as soon as it arrives.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Every face and beard is different, so a sampler pack will let you determine which blade works best for you.</li>
            <li>Husband has the best shave with all above.</li>
            <li>bowl is okay and hasn&#x27;t started rusting for me.</li>
            <li>If you know you will love this shaving system, buy a set with a ceramic mug.  </li>
            <li>Brush is good, Stand is necessary, and razor works great.</li>
            <li>Have truly enjoyed transitioning to shaving like a man&#x27;s man.  </li>
            <li>Yeah some people are ok with it, most are not.  </li>
            <li>Most people agree that Feather is the sharpest/best, but remember that sharpest also means mistake</li>
            <li>so you make sure you like</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s like a $1, and most pharmacies like CVS have it.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite,</li>
            <li>I love the razor.</li>
            <li>stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the product and love to shave with it.</li>
            <li>Shaving Made Enjoyable.</li>
            <li>It is probably best for someone that has no idea what they actually want/need.  </li>
            <li>It is easily my favorite item in the kit.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>is okay to start with and lasts for awhile.  </li>
            <li>The brush is okay and holding up well.  </li>
            <li>Though after trying my roommate&#x27;s better brush I can see that this badger brush is a lower quality one (but still better than boar hair).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve learn most are when purchased for the Col&#x27;s soaps.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic!</li>

            <li>- Fifth Edition: Shaving Made Enjoyable]]</li>
            <li>It hold&#x27;s the Merkur Top-Rated razor; a better than the cheapest badger brush (that doesn&#x27;t noticeably smell) and a sturdy functional stand that doesn&#x27;t fall over.  </li>
            <li>but he hasn&#x27;t cut himself yet with the Merkur. :-)</li>
            <li>I am sure he will love it.</li>
            <li>brush is just okay.</li>
            <li>It lathers better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>bowl is kind of cheap looking but it works.</li>
            <li>I assumed there would be more than one blade with the set, there was not.</li>
            <li>While this does not show any fault on the provider I think a warning in the description would be a good idea, many people buy this bundle as a starter set and may find the clarification useful.</li>
            <li>cup are okay.  </li>
            <li>Videos on youtube will help for sure.</li>
            <li>Just wish it came with more razors.</li>
            <li>Love this set, wish the brush was nicer quality.  </li>
            <li>, make sure you order blades to go with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving with a badger hair brush is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>What I like about it is that it comes with a Merkur #180 safety razor and it is one of the better razor you can start off with.</li>
            <li>Item arrived on time and in good condition, and is working well so far, and would seem to be a good long-term investment.</li>
            <li>ive used it more then 10 times</li>
            <li>If the brush worked better I would give the set a 5.</li>
            <li>I tried the col conk shaving soap and I had a body shop shaving cream for men , the shaving cream gave me a distinctly better shave.</li>
            <li>It shed a bit, but it has been holding up much better than my Van Der Hagen brush.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my Merkur razor.  </li>
            <li>He feels he gets a closer shave using the safety razor and is glad he&#x27;s made the switch.</li>
            <li>Having used this for a month now I feel that the razor, brush, stand, and bowl are all top quality.  </li>
            <li>I was realy expecting more.</li>
            <li>He truly enjoys it and loves that he has more control.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is the next best thing to a barber shave.</li>
            <li>I tried every technique anybody ever recommended until I read about safety razors and how they were basically the magic trick for people in my situation.</li>
            <li>Very happy was present for boyfriend</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: He&#x27;s used the razor many times now, and he loves it more every time.</li>
            <li>I like the longer handle on this model because I think it gives me better control than I would have with a shorter handle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li>Solid, elegant product that made a perfect gift for my boss.  </li>
            <li>I love the badger brush.  </li>
            <li>very well finished chrome great ensemble.</li>
            <li>I love the razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure after spending a year in Africa.&lt;br /&gt;SSG, USA</li>

            <li>Well, now that I&#x27;ve bought it, I can confidently say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know better</li>
            <li>Razor is great and the stand is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be comparable.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the experience and will continue to use this product daily.</li>
            <li>you want to try out this style of shaving, go for it; you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>so I was glad for the on time delivery.</li>
            <li>I have been using for about a month now and feel after some practice, I get a better shave with this razor vs. Mach3.</li>
            <li>I love the play pen.</li>
            <li>and they just love it.  </li>
            <li>Really glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I also paired it with an Art of Shaving starter set in Sandlewood, I really love this sent on him :)</li>
            <li>In the end, more than satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Love the blade and the stand.</li>
            <li>The Merkur razor is a fabulous razor that shaves nice and close.</li>
            <li>and they love them.  </li>
            <li>All top notch in construction.  </li>
            <li>To replace blades, you have to unscrew the top and separate it from the handle.  </li>
            <li>Razor is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The stand is ok.  </li>
            <li>Parker makes a better brush.  </li>
            <li>Love the kit</li>
            <li>A great alternative to modern day razors.  </li>
            <li>I love the Merkur safety razor.</li>
            <li>The one thing that would be awesome is if they gave directions for soup mixture and basic use of the razor for nubes like me.</li>
            <li>I think any man would love this.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this razor is a huge step forward for me.  </li>
            <li>Just received my shaving set and love it.</li>
            <li>My 30-year old son loved it!</li>
            <li>Great shaving kit for new shaver!</li>
            <li>it gives a nice clean shave</li>
            <li>Decent lather production, great price.  </li>
            <li>Not a thick lather, however, it provides a great protective layer on your skin for  shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now the brush is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This was my first &amp;#34;dive&amp;#34; into the world of wet-shaving and because of the reviews of this product I decided it would be a good place to start.</li>
            <li>The razor shaved great, very smooth, and so far no bumps.  </li>
            <li>A friend at work told me about the &#x27;great&#x27; experience he had shaving with his new DE razor</li>
            <li>The bowl looks good but seems too deep for mixing a good lather IMO.</li>
            <li>This set is nice with real badger brush and a nice substantial feel to the razor.  </li>
            <li>SimplyBeautiful was great about handling the issue and so I&#x27;m happy with them but might go for one of the higher end brushes next time</li>
            <li>This is an amazing shaving kit, it has everything you need to get started right away, anybody will love this kit.</li>
            <li>You honestly can&#x27;t put a price on this experience,  every man should own one of these.s set looks perfect together and as you touch each piece of the set in feels natural in your hands and clean up is very easy,  just a simple rinse</li>
            <li>Keep your equipment clean!</li>
            <li>He just runs it under the water to gently clean the blade!</li>
            <li>The chrome colored cup is a nice touch making this all in all a fine set that also looks cool by the sink.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it is important for me to have a nice, clean shaved face 5-6 days out of the week.</li>
            <li>And it looks very cool in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>The merkur safety razor is very good and solid.</li>
            <li>Overall I was happy with my purchase and more importantly he is!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was definately the closest, most comfortable shave I have EVER had.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how many choices and price ranges were available.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not confident it will look great for any great length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>His face is sooo smooth &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Great as a gift, as the set is complete.</li>
            <li>This offers a great shave at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>So far, he says the shave is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the military and I take pride in my appearance because people look at us as the best,  </li>
            <li>The stand is very convenient, and looks good on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s kind of exciting activities in preparation for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Had been looking for something special for my dad and this was it!</li>
            <li>One of the best things that has happened since my husband started using the single blade razor is that he doesn&#x27;t wake me up in the morning banging the 3-blade razor against the sink to get the soap &amp; whiskers out of it!!</li>
            <li>Best money I ever spent!</li>
            <li>I may have even saved a few bucks--not sure, but what matters is that it worked out perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Looks great and should last for many years to come.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend a good styptic pencil and aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Good high quality items across the board.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great gift that looks fabulous in his bathroom and he is enjoying using it.</li>
            <li>Really good for a bigger especially when you are trying to figure out what technique works out the best for</li>
            <li>The soap cup is also pretty nice and durable.</li>
            <li>After 3.5 weeks of back and forth emails to DB Roth, and an &amp;#34;out of the blue&amp;#34; email from Simply Beautiful stating they have nothing to do with this</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re completely new you might as well go for it and try it out, and its def good as a present.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t used it yet, because we&#x27;re remodeling the bathrooms and he doesn&#x27;t want his gorgeous new razor getting ruined.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be fine if they didn&#x27;t charge me $100 for the kit.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor, and I couldn&#x27;t be any more satisfied with a well crafted set as this is.</li>
            <li>He found the soap to be fine but now uses another brand.</li>
            <li>seems totally fine.</li>
            <li>.. fine.....</li>
            <li>this really is more a quick \\&quot;just get something to start\\&quot; kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The streamlined head allows for easy shaving under your nose and the longer handle fit my huge hand</li>
            <li>We did buy more blades at Walmart of all places, and super cheap.</li>
            <li>The product was what I expected and is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>Perfect gift for the young adult men in your life.</li>
            <li>The Merkur HD razor that came in the kit is fantastic.</li>
            <li>set is great overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been Gillette free</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t fit in the stand.</li>
            <li>: So the stand is nice however when I pulled it out of the box it was really wobbly.</li>
            <li>The soap didn&#x27;t work for me, so I just bought the cheap cake of soap at Wal-Mart for like a dollar.</li>
            <li>Cheap junk.</li>
            <li>:B002UB3BF8 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Chrome Handle) and Free Shaving Brush Stand from Parker Safety Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Or if you want to have some fun and try things out (I LOVE an adventure)</li>
            <li>This razor gives a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li>It leaves him really smooth.</li>
            <li>Great present.</li>
            <li>feels light but works excelent</li>
            <li>However, overall it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>The brush performs well and the entire set is attractive to observe.</li>
            <li>the soap, blade, and badger brush are fantastic.</li>
            <li>lather bin is cheap, but that doesn&#x27;t lessen the over zeal for this product</li>
            <li>Once I run out I&#x27;m going to buy a package of cheap disposables for those purposes.</li>
            <li>It has stayed rust free.</li>
            <li>My husband has never had such a great shave, and his face feels  smoother than mine</li>
            <li>They still look great 2 years later</li>
            <li>But I enjoy this product because when I got it for my fiance</li>
            <li>, His face was as smooth as a baby butts.</li>
            <li>This set will let you enjoy shaving.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy shaving with this set.</li>
            <li>The quality of this product is well, it was comfortable to use and stable.</li>
            <li>His shaving is close and nick free.</li>
            <li>and they really look nice.</li>
            <li>Great starting kit for beginners!</li>
            <li>The razor clogs up with hair like my cheap disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>Stand, brush, and soap dish all have a nice polished stainless finish.  </li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t one I personally enjoy</li>
            <li>This piece is masculine, classy, and a perfect addition to any mans bathroom.</li>
            <li>The shave it gives is far superior to those throw-away types on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this kit for about six weeks now and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>The workmanship is good and the chrome finish looks professional.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a whole&#x27;nother subjective topic and is probably best solved with a blade sampler of about 10 blades of 10 different kinds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purchased the shaving set as a gift for my son and he absolutley loves the results he gets from the good \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; technique of shaving with a brush and safety razor.</li>
            <li>I really believe he&#x27;s going to love it, also, and get many years of use.</li>
            <li>The razor has some nice heft to it and the texture of the handle gives you a good grip, even when wet.</li>
            <li>The hardest thing is finding the right shave soap which costs about as much as this kit, but well worth it for a happy hubby</li>
            <li>Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck finding the right</li>
            <li>Solid metal which is very nice.  </li>
            <li>The soap is pretty good, smells nice, but once you use it up there are other brands that are perhaps better.</li>
            <li>My first double-edge shave was more comfortable than any 2-</li>
            <li>I chose this one because I liked the classic look</li>
            <li>Super easy to assemble and disassemble.</li>
            <li>I really liked this set because it contained all high end instrument.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure more experienced wet-shavers would turn their nose down at this, preferring higher quality (and price) items.</li>
            <li>All I know is that instead of paying $15 for 4 new blades I&#x27;m paying more and more money.</li>
            <li>I can tell you the exact moment it happened - the moment that I decided to stop taking out loans in order to be able to afford a shave.</li>
            <li>Now I get why folks are excited about this style of shaving again.</li>
            <li>A significant amount of the badger bristles have fallen out at this point and it can no longer be used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I could pull all of the bristles out if I wanted to.</li>
            <li>That means it&#x27;s a hit, and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll love it even more when he finally gets to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally began piecing together all the items separately, but thought otherwise when I saw this set.</li>
            <li>First of all I love the razor.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m a little more experienced</li>
            <li>So now he has his own set to shave with and I am keeping the new one.</li>
            <li>Safety razor blades are so darn cheap and do such a good job at clean shave.</li>
            <li>The stand that comes with the kit looks great and helps to dry out all the shaving apparatus.</li>
            <li>The soap is ok, but we discovered that Proraso shave cream is better for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Since I am soldier, I need to be clean shaven at all times.  </li>
            <li>If it can please my Dad, it should please any man who likes to be clean shaven.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone clean shaven in the two months</li>
            <li>The razor was nice and heavy, good quality as well as the brush.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, very grippable, even with wet soapy hands.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;brush is VERY soft and nice on your face&lt;br /&gt;soap</li>
            <li>Never before has he had such a nice smooth and clean shave!</li>
            <li>Great shaving kit for a single blade beginner.</li>
            <li>The razor is fine too, holding up just fine, but since it&#x27;s my first, I can&#x27;t compare it&#x27;s angle or draw against others.</li>
            <li>soap isn&#x27;t anything special, and that&#x27;s why you&#x27;d may as well abandon this gift set and buy it all separate.</li>
            <li>But again, the soap isn&#x27;t anything special, and I&#x27;m already going to just buy some Proraso soap and pre-shave cream to replace the soap that comes with this set,</li>
            <li>Just pure smooth shave!  </li>
            <li>The brush is comfortable and feels FANTASTIC when you&#x27;re applying the hot, foamed soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great gift for those looking into getting their feet wet with double-edged/wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment on the shaving soap, except for that its better than Edge shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>Love this but don&#x27;t care to much for the brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a smooth purchasing experience!</li>
            <li>Splash face with cool water</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really imagine any way it could be better.</li>
            <li>Overall, this shaving set is good.</li>
            <li>I also love the shiny chrome handle on it, very luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this thing so much.</li>
            <li>It is well made and the brush gets really soft when used with warm water.</li>
            <li>Overall, yes, good products and do recommend these products.</li>
            <li>Good quality products that seem built to last.</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>The badger brush is soft and makes a nice foam.</li>
            <li>The stand is nice and classy.  </li>
            <li>Shaving actually felt good and was fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not a bad soap.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loved his new razor so much that I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and the razors can be found dirt cheap in many barber shops or even at some cigar shops that carry men&#x27;s grooming tools.</li>
            <li>The brush provides an easy, consistent lather while stimulating my skin and beard.  </li>
            <li>first impression was that these blades could cut skin easily, however that seems incorrect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his first time shaving with this type of razor, and he says it&#x27;s easy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have experience with other safety razors, but I am very pleased with this set and it is a much better shave than with disposable blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly fine in the plastic in which it ships, but a nice wooden bowl would look classier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice set, I was new to wet shaving and this looked like a good starter kit.  </li>
            <li>The Col. Conk soap that came in the kit is decent, but there are better soaps out there for the money.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, as advertised.</li>
            <li>It lathers up fairly quickly and lasts a an acceptable about of time after bushed on.  </li>
            <li>May not be adequate for someone who is into DE shaving for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will attempt to super glue it.</li>
            <li>They clean easily and are very durable.</li>
            <li>Just as described and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Just something to be aware of the first time you grab the top to remove the blade.</li>
            <li>And the refills are so inexpensive, it pays for itself really quick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with everything so far; the brush seems to work very well at creating a lather with every soap and cream I&#x27;ve used so far and feels nice on the face while applying said lather.</li>
            <li>Definitely a gift which I was happy to receive, and would recommend for anyone willing to take the time for a good wet shave.</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful and refreshing way start your day should be cherished, not to mention replacement blades go for as little as 50¢</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this set.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>First let me shine some light on this.  </li>
            <li>It had a good lather and didn&#x27;t take long to set up and put on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited at how quickly it arrived, and how pretty the set was.</li>
            <li>Speaking of advice, be sure to buy a sampler pack of blades to try with your new razor.</li>
            <li>I love my new shaving set.</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve, but you can watch any of the YouTube videos on the subject to get great tips and advice.</li>
            <li>The razor feels very sturdy and is easy for me to handle.</li>
            <li>it comes with is good, but be aware that it&#x27;s a short handle.</li>
            <li>he love the razor and was very surprised the lather bar or soap</li>
            <li>The soap that came with this kit smelled refreshing and uniformly smooth matching the high quality of the whole set.</li>
            <li>The soap smells nice, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, makes a good lather - even with the switch to a safety, I&#x27;ve still had less irritation and a better experience than with any electric or disposable.</li>
            <li>next set, I will be sure to go for quality!</li>
            <li>got this as part of a set for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the first package was lost in the mail but the vendor resent it.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it!</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves this thing!!</li>
            <li>) so don&#x27;t shave with this kit right before heading off for an important  meeting at the office - practice on the weekend first.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t shave with this kit right before heading off for an important  meeting at the office - practice on the weekend first.</li>
            <li>Expected a bloodbath (being new to DE shaving) and instead got a great comfortable shave, no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>this is great for everyday shaving but for me 2 days it will not shave at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy and sturdy, great construction.</li>
            <li>Everything in the set matches great and are all a heavy metal chrome-plated-like material.</li>
            <li>It is heavy, well made and attractive.  </li>
            <li>At almost 90 dollars they should come in a nice box that you could actually give as a gift since they recommend this as A gift set.</li>
            <li>Even after daily use (and associated water and soap spots) it cleans up really nicely.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of good stuff about wet shaving and thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li>Something satisfying with the ritual of the old fashioned lather shave.</li>
            <li>how economical it is that I ordered a Merkur long-handle safety razor for myself.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Just have fun with it...</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really expect the top to be removable ., thought it would of been more like two side opening and in place and only would have to remove the blade.</li>
            <li>The razor was as good as i expected it to be.</li>
            <li>In fact, the brush handle is heavier than I expected, and I imagine this feels good in a man&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>Mach lll and Barbasol better so far.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make me like it better is if the bowl fit under the brush on the stand.</li>
            <li>I just gave away almost $100 worth of disposable razor junk...</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s always wanted a professional, stylish shaving stand and soap dish for years.</li>
            <li>I love this product so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This proves it... again.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my husband and he doesn&#x27;t use these kind of razors anymore because they cause razor bumps and don&#x27;t cut close enough.</li>
            <li>I keep them outside in a really nice area</li>
            <li>Could not do better as far as the razor goes, at any cost.  </li>
            <li>This was by far my boyfriends favorite Christmas gift and he tells me all of the time.</li>
            <li>So over all this is a pretty good buy but just know that the stand will not look good or work well for as long as the other parts of the set.</li>
            <li>This set has held up after two solid years of use (originally purchased in 2011) and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Other than the soap its an awesome kit for someone starting out with safety razors.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve tried about 5 other kinds of blades and they all fit nice and snug.</li>
            <li>gave to my son-in-law as a Christmas gift, he currently uses an old safety razor, this was a pleasant surprise to get the Merkur razor, the gift set was complete with all the necessary items to get a great shave, would recommend this gift set.</li>
            <li>It evidently takes a little getting use to, but is great for the closer shave.</li>
            <li>Other than that, everything esle is good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to try the Proraso soap), but it leaves out so much stuff that you can&#x27;t just buy this kit and assume everything is taken care of, and that defeats the point of it to me.</li>
            <li>I jumped right in after studying technique.</li>
            <li>the right way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finish flakes right off within 15 months.  </li>
            <li>only the very top of the razor housing comes off, making it much easier to replace blades.</li>
            <li>is very easy,  just a simple rinse</li>
            <li>The shaving set is attractive for display as well as useful for the man who prefers an old fashioned wet shave.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ve got a wonderful gift for an \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; man, or a younger gent looking to upgrade his personal habits in a classy and time-tested way.  </li>
            <li>no dull spots like you get on cheap stuff</li>
            <li>This seems like cheap junk that I&#x27;m fine with if I only paid $19.99 at shavkits.com, not when it&#x27;s from Merkur, through Amazon and at a quality-product price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this as my first DE razor and I made the right decision.</li>
            <li>But after reading a few tips online and with more practice I got better at avoiding nics and cuts.</li>
            <li>While I think it&#x27;s a good set for the price, he has only been using it for a month now and the brush included is completely falling apart.</li>
            <li>The first shave took some time,  however it was pretty fun believe it or not.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, they are right.</li>
            <li>B002RJC1HC 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand from Parker Safety Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks good hard to keep it clean though, I stopped using it after 4 months.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t quite as nice as some of the more expensive items, but for a classy guy on a tight budget this is perfect</li>
            <li>The price is high enough where you think you have something really nice.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest trying it for the first time before a date</li>
            <li>Even better, I haven&#x27;t found myself constantly wiping water spots off of it</li>
            <li>you put yourself through in this most artful, comforatble, and traditional way of shaving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to put it up against, but electrics and multi-blade systems just don&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li>The shaving set is amazinga and came in exactly as I pictured.</li>
            <li>First of all, yes, this set comes with a short-handle razor.</li>
            <li>you can see the price is almost the same or maybe a bit more than this package, but then you can customize as to how you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap search for anything</li>
            <li>He has enjoyed shaving with it these last couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Okay to start off with but wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for future purchases.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, like I said, this is an okay starter kit if you don&#x27;t actually know what you want.  </li>
            <li>After more than a year of battling with Merkur they finally replaced my razor.</li>
            <li>It will only help improve an already enjoyable process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaving kit seems pretty well made.  </li>
            <li>I feel that I did much better by going with this than I might have if I picked each piece individually.  </li>
            <li>first</li>
            <li>This was my first attempt at shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I received exactly what is shown on the picture.</li>
            <li>Part way through its first use the brush head detached itself from the metal body.</li>
            <li>Some of the hairs started to come out after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I had to purchase another higher quality one.  </li>
            <li>And so, with proper holding, the shorter handle allows for better control over the razor without having to choke up on it.</li>
            <li>I always shave after a hot shower, etc.</li>
            <li>Even from my first shave I could tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to shave daily without being in pain.</li>
            <li>the whole set is a class act!</li>
            <li>Just watch out - you&#x27;re going to start buying more soaps and razors than you actually need, just to try it all!</li>
            <li>stand is pretty crucial to me because I just wouldn&#x27;t want the brush or the razor touching the counter.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving set</li>
            <li>First time buying this type of shaver</li>
            <li>I would recommend to any one interested in buying</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fairly confident that he&#x27;ll be set for the next five years.</li>
            <li>So, I just went back to using some Gillette gel along with the razor shown here, and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with it until I finally learned how to use it</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>brush works pretty darn well.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend absolutely loves this set!</li>
            <li>aware when ordering.</li>
            <li>he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>First use of the Badger Brush the hairs started falling out.  </li>
            <li>I would get a better shave soap next time.</li>
            <li>I do recommend putting coconut oil or grape seed oil on first.</li>
            <li>I just had my first shave and with it</li>
            <li>As far as technique goes, it&#x27;s all a matter of finding the right amount of pressure and the right tilt for YOU!</li>
            <li>I wished this set held up, when you goto shave the single blade gets stopped up very easy making shaving take longer...</li>
            <li>This is a good set and as you learn more about wet shaving you&#x27;ll start to find other things to add to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone as long as they are realize that they WILL be replacing most of the items at some point in the future (bigger bowl, better soap/blades, better brush, etc etc).  </li>
            <li>I could not recommend the Merkur razor highly enough - it&#x27;s a joy to shave with, and normally I&#x27;m content to let my facial hair go.</li>
            <li>length and weight seem to work nicely with each other.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since purchased a Parker brand silvertip badger brush )which coincedentally has the exact same handle but with a Parker engraving) but the bristles are much more densly packed into the handle, and have much softer tips.</li>
            <li>and as you touch each piece of the set in feels natural in your hands and clean up</li>
            <li>The soap is okay, but I ended up buying something different since I couldn&#x27;t get it to lather very well</li>
            <li>He was really scared to wet shave the first time, after hearing horror stories of cuts, but he experienced no cuts on his first try or the ones following.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price; after all, holding a razor to one&#x27;s face on a daily basis is not something to take lightly.</li>
            <li>The handle is pretty heavy and short, making for an easy, smooth, mostly nick-free shave.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend bought other blades and they work fine, but they didn&#x27;t provide as smooth of a shave as the Gilette razor that this came with.</li>
            <li>Contacted vendor for replacement and waiting for a positive response.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for a young shaver, but not before driving myself crazy and spending 40 hours looking at razors, stands, brushes, and reading 1,000&#x27;s of reviews trying to figure out what would fit in what and which was the best; you know the drill.</li>
            <li>I received this set as a gift not too long ago, and have to say that I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend the gift set to anyone who is interested in using a straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>The blades are so much cheaper than modern ones too!</li>
            <li>for the other things this set comes with, they look really good, old fashioned and manly, but I find I just keep my razor in the shower and don&#x27;t use the rest.</li>
            <li>Old School Cool</li>
            <li>This is everything you need to shave, perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds up well, durable, allows a super clean shave convenient and store-able you will not be disappointed by the quality and durability, AND it looks nice!!</li>
            <li>overall, it&#x27;s not a *bad* product by any stretch of the imagination, but I just think you&#x27;re better off using it as a basic template of stuff you should get, then assembling it all yourself: a Merkur blade, a nice stand, a brush, some Proraso soap and cream, Baxter of California aftershave balm, Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel, and some quality, sharp blades like Feathers.</li>
            <li>This has slightly concerned me, as I don&#x27;t know what kind of metal they used underneath the coating/plating, but you can&#x27;t see it with a bar of soap in there anyway.</li>
            <li>All pieces were exactly as advertised, and better quality than expected.</li>
            <li>Stand isnt marked with and branding and while constructed well enough, it required a fair amount of work with a dremel and a fine sanding drum to make the brush slot wide enough that the brush fit in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All high quality and ready to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li>It is fine on the outside.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Knowing now what I know, if I could go back, I&#x27;d buy the stand and brush separately, the blade any merkur is fine.  </li>
            <li>No irritation,  no serious scrapes nothing!  </li>
            <li>The shave was great, the bowl could be a little larger, of course I do not use the provided soap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: The product is still great, but after using this a few times every week since I purchased it, the bottom of the bowl has worn away and corroded, and now looks like a different color underneath.</li>
            <li>the stand does as it is supposed to, and the razor is amazing, it has such a different feel than the cartridged ones do.</li>
            <li>Being in an industry that deal with mechanical design, this one looks very well built and the chrome on interior parts were as smooth as the outside.</li>
            <li>but you really have to look to notice.</li>
            <li>However for the price this kit is really a winner in my eyes.</li>
            <li>I also bought a separate butterfly razor to give him an option but he much prefers the Merkur Safety Razor.  </li>
            <li>The bowl not so much.  </li>
            <li>I mentioned my predicament to a coworker who then proceeded to school me on the days when men were men, and every manly-man shaved with a real razor blade that didn&#x27;t require pre-approval credit checks and financing.</li>
            <li>Instead of sandalwood he went and got a whole lot from art of shaving and uses the razor and brush from this kit</li>
            <li>The design does allow for the set to sit in a reasonable amount of space on a bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>But now, after about three times, I&#x27;m started to really get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The picture doesn&#x27;t show this very well</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the razor so much I would have given this set 3 stars.</li>
            <li>Thus was a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This is an okay all-in-one package for wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>While basic and not the most expensive of products, these do what they need to do and are great learning pieces.  </li>
            <li>and he is at the moment packing it for a two night trip because he wants to &amp;#34;show it off.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>None are stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy construction.</li>
            <li>and i can tell you, if you use it carefully you can get much better close cut shaves compared to any cartridge</li>
            <li>He says it shaves really close.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;razor gave me a very close cut</li>
            <li>air dries the razor and brush very well</li>
            <li>and it still is holding together very well.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it some real use before I wrote my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor gives a very close shave without gumming up.  </li>
            <li>The process of shaving is very zen now.</li>
            <li>Gave the shaving set as a gift to my son and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li>I wanted the whole set</li>
            <li>This gives me a close, comfortable shave, without the issue of whiskers getting caught between the multiple blades you have in disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Just be careful and take your time :)</li>
            <li>He had been considering a (much cheaper) product that was being advertised on TV.</li>
            <li>He loves anything old-timey, and he hates the way modern razors shave.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>I bought this set for my husband, who had become really enamored with the idea of shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>The razor and brush work very well.</li>
            <li>I was very upset.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with shaving brushes, so this works for me.</li>
            <li>, I ended up putting too much pressure on and cut myself a couple times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard so much about how with DE razors you aren&#x27;t supposed to press on it at all, that the blade will do all the work and cut through like butter, that I couldn&#x27;t help but be worried that it wasn&#x27;t doing that with this blade.</li>
            <li>The brush handle is also very heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also company was very helpful ...</li>
            <li>Very close shave,</li>
            <li>He really likes it…</li>
            <li>The brush and safety razor are very well made; their weight confirms the quality of craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Well packaged and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Gentlemen receiving it really enjoys using it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend after doing a lot of research on the different safety razors that are available.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, the razor is fantastic in both form and function.  </li>
            <li>The soap doesn&#x27;t foam up much and does not lubricate as well as gel.  </li>
            <li>the sound Merkur makes when going through facial hair.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Even as a newbie to this whole think</li>
            <li>Still trying different blades, hoping to find a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First things I plan to upgrade are:  adding a silvertip badger brush, some alternate shave soaps (as mentioned) and perhaps a nice container in which to keep the current shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and heavy.  </li>
            <li>The shaving cream bowl is nice with a firm feeling as is the brush.  </li>
            <li>And replecment blades are super cheap compared to other razors!</li>
            <li>Also, this stuff looks really smart and classic in the bathroom, products for a debonair gentleman.</li>
            <li>would pay the little bit more to get exactly what I want, but that&#x27;s because I bought this set to experiment.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to seeing what other items I might be able to purchase from this company.  </li>
            <li>and he was excited to open it.</li>
            <li>The stand is very heavy and feel sturdy, and the brush and razor fit securely in it.</li>
            <li>The piece is heavy enough to feel sturdy while comfortable enough to get a good shave with.</li>
            <li>The brush did feel a little scratchy at first, but after reading about how to shampoo and condition it before use it&#x27;s become pretty comfortable for me.</li>
            <li>I am still very pleased with the product, just know that you will not be getting the 34C HD, some pics can be confusing.</li>
            <li>Was shipped on time (maybe even a day early), it was packed well and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Sent back to Amazon for a full refund.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good deal especially for someone just starting out with a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>and I think should be bigger but its not bad at all.</li>
            <li>As I reach for the blades I see a shiny new box - Mach 3 TURBO!</li>
            <li>Ron often mentioned how much the new razors cost and wished he had an old-fashioned razor with blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally new to DE shaving because I haven&#x27;t really shaved in let&#x27;s say 4 or 5 years.</li>
            <li>Keeping these dry is important.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent beginners kit.</li>
            <li>:B002A8JO48 Merkur Classic Safety Razor,</li>
            <li>Rn6 Contemporary Chrome Plated Shaving Soap Bowl,</li>
            <li>though more expensive) items to replace most of the kit.  </li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush, stand and bowl are decent quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really is a nice set for someone starting wet shaving.</li>
            <li>but you can still get a decent lather going in it.</li>
            <li>both the top and bottom pieces which hold the blade in place come off, making it a bit more difficult to replace blades.</li>
            <li>Otherwise is decent starter set.</li>
            <li>The razor and the bowl are just so classic</li>
            <li>,  I noticed that if you listen to your razor it will give you hints such as the blade will stop gliding once you need to apply more shaving cream and will move the cream around if you don&#x27;t have the proper angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is a decent product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The are both of a high quality.</li>
            <li>For this, I highly  recommend checking out [...]  if you are unfamiliar with safety shaving.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it</li>
            <li>After you install the first blade and bring that sharp, naked, unrelenting edge to your face, you will be glad you have the knowledge that the youtube videos</li>
            <li>This was a christmas gift and my Husband loves it, it was a real surprise to him, he collects old shaving sets.</li>
            <li>A much closer shave than my old Tripel blade.</li>
            <li>, like so many others, have never had the opportunity to know the world of double-edge shaving until recently - and being only 31 years old</li>
            <li>I have used the soap a few times, its OK, I use a cream now.</li>
            <li>: He just found economical double-edge blades at a local department store.]</li>
            <li>After doing extensive research on my first double edge shaving set, I discovered that the razor that comes in the kit is the one most recommended for beginners on sites such as [...].</li>
            <li>Overall it works well enough, but the only part I really liked was the razor itself; the rest was just no-name filler.</li>
            <li>The brush seems OK, but some hairs began to dislodge after just a few uses (maybe this is normal for a brush?)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>(2) I am losing about 2-3 bristles on the badger brush with every shave, but maybe this is normal.</li>
            <li>It takes a few more minutes to use a safety razor system.</li>
            <li>Finding the right blade was crucial as well-</li>
            <li>Only a few dollars more!?</li>
            <li>Its sturdy and easy to set up or take down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using a safety razor, and would recommend this kit to anyone thinking of getting started.  </li>
            <li>NEW Hi-stainless</li>
            <li>I bought him a new stand.</li>
            <li>but like I said, I&#x27;m new to all this</li>
            <li>so now he has no razor if we don&#x27;t buy a new one.</li>
            <li>and I take it to heart to live up to that.  </li>
            <li>and so I shave my face and head everyday, and this razor and the double edge razor theory is amazing, and in expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle has a nice weight and feel, but the bristles were rough, and not very dense.</li>
            <li>Never got a decent shave with electric and frequently used a disposable blade to touch up spots where the electric just wouldn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li>: Don&#x27;t try and save money on the cheap replacement blades, spend the extra 50 cents per blade and get the nicer ones, they make all the difference on your face and also last longer.</li>
            <li>buy replacement blades anywhere (Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, etc), they are so much cheaper, and they last much longer.</li>
            <li>I got the 3-pack of Col. Conk Almond, which is a nice subtle smell.  </li>
            <li>I made the initial shave, rinsed lathered up again and made a second pass and am baby smooth.</li>
            <li>I thought the stand was going to be flimsy, and possibly topple over when holding the razor and brush, but to my amazement; it is very, very sturdy.</li>
            <li>First I recommend doing some reading - plenty of websites offer advice on how to properly shave.</li>
            <li>you are really interested in wetshaving I would recommend reading the following book:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After numerous uses of soaking the brush in hot water in the bowl, the glue softened and the plate came</li>
            <li>I pulled on the bristles to check it out and the it was pretty solid.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and i will never be going back to disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Other heads have three blades or more, so if you go over the same spot 3 times</li>
            <li>I received this safety razor shaving kit for Christmas along with a styptic pencil to help with the shaving nicks that my wife was sure I would inevitably receive due to never having used an &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; safety razor before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks elagent on my bathroom sink, I feel so classy!</li>
            <li>Obviously the first step is to look the part.  </li>
            <li>Not the right razor, comes with a long handled razor instead.</li>
            <li>I prefer a three piece razor and this one is easy to change the blades and locks firmly in place.  </li>
            <li>A word of WARNING - I watched nearly ALL of the &#x27;wet-shaving&#x27; videos on youtube by mantic59 several times before attempting to shave with this razor for the first time.</li>
            <li>This is my first saftey razor and brush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything except regular old cartridge shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far better (fluffier, denser, softer, soaks up nicely, dries quickly and regularly, lathers like a beast with rabies) than any other brush I&#x27;ve found or seen available locally, and it&#x27;s much less expensive.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really have a smell to it when I received it which I was a little worried about, but I still cleaned it out with some mild natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>Like a good little consumer I walk over to the shaving section ready to throw down another $15 or so dollars for 4 blades that will barely last a month.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s probably good, at least maybe until I pack it for travel or something, otherwise I can&#x27;t imagine that it will become loose again.</li>
            <li>I expected some discomfort and cuts the first time, but there was nothing!  </li>
            <li>but it seems to slow down the growth, 4 stars because we&#x27;re having issues with the bowl and soap puck, it doesn&#x27;t exactly match up, may need to purchase a new bowl in order to properly use the puck to get a good lather or whip otherwise the puck just spins in circles and doesn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li>It comes with one sample blade, and it&#x27;s a Merkur, and it&#x27;s not sharp enough for my beard hair, so my first shave</li>
            <li>The soap you should just upgrade immediately to something exceptional instead of ordinary, and you&#x27;ll be buying all the extra creams and aftershaves and such separately anyway, so why bother on the kit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone interested in getting into DE wet shaving.</li>
            <li>The only time I&#x27;ve ever had a shave this close was by a professional barber with a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All I can say is &#x27;WOW&#x27;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I did not shave for nearly 2 weeks before it arrived.</li>
            <li>The soap is near rock-like and I have to use a pocket knife to cut pieces out for shaving.</li>
            <li>The soap is near rock-like and I have to use a pocket knife to cut pieces out for shaving.</li>
            <li>As far as purchasing, I had no problems at all.</li>
            <li>The razor is the 180 as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>So damn classy</li>
            <li>He had no trouble switching from disposable razors.</li>
            <li>He really loves the set, even though he had never actually considered using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Has only gone through one blade since Christmas, shaving everyday, however, soap included was not his favorite, he prefers the Taylor old bond shaving cream I got him after.</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t know about the included soap because I added TOBS avocado soap to the box as well as a sample pack of razors  for the complete experience.  </li>
            <li>The brush completely fell apart.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for my 84 year old Father.  </li>
            <li>The set is quite classy.</li>
            <li>And his face is sooo soft.</li>
            <li>Gift for friend who has everything, except an old time razor.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s German and he over-engineers everything, so he really appreciates the Merkur quality.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t support this product enough, my husband loves it!</li>
            <li>Its like shaving with a wild animal tail to spread your lather on your face.</li>
            <li>I cut myself when starting out but learned the correct way to use it very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Twist</li>
            <li>Is there an advantage to using the bowl instead of putting it directly on my face?</li>
            <li>kit came complete with Merkur safety razor, badger tail shaving brush, soap, bowl and razor/brush</li>
            <li>shaving has been one task needed to complete.</li>
            <li>For now I&#x27;ll be using it at night before I add it to my early morning routine.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore,  I have extremely sensitive skin,  also from my job</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried the set wouldn&#x27;t match very well because chrome and all materials have various finishes,  </li>
            <li>Husband uses this now all the time but the soap it comes with sucks and we will be getting a different kind of soap.</li>
            <li>but you can feel an empty screw hole in the center, just below where the pole is on the top side.</li>
            <li>The stand looks nice initially, but I&#x27;ve already started to see very small rust/pitting on it.  </li>
            <li>Had it now less than a week and the brush is in full shedding mode.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a single blade safety razor.  </li>
            <li>After reading about how much I have been missing by shaving with electric and disposable razors I finally took the plunge and bought this kit to start shaving using the tried and true safety razor.</li>
            <li>Okay,  I just finished my first shave with this set,  needless to say I&#x27;m breathless.  </li>
            <li>I tried the soap that came with this, plus other versions of this style of soap, and could never get the lather like it felt right</li>
            <li>If at all possible, go for the long (or extra long if available) handle!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this to someone just getting into wet-shaving with a DE razor, although I think eventually I&#x27;ll upgrade or maybe just add to my collection with some different razors and brushes.</li>
            <li>The badger brush is still in use over a year after purchasing it and it has not shed any major hairs whatsoever; quite well made!</li>
            <li>(not thick enough for me).</li>
            <li>normally have a goatee and shave only my cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li>as everyone says(slightly rough, just let it set in some hot water while you shower)</li>
            <li>The quality of the pieces was higher than expected.  </li>
            <li>This is my first wet shave kit</li>
            <li>LOVE using this type of razor now after coming from the old disposable type.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick facial hair, and this thing still works great.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It did shed hair for the first week and a half or so but it seems to have broken in and is staying together nicely.</li>
            <li>that is almost non-existent, which could be good or bad depending whether you really want to smell your soap during/after your shave.  </li>
            <li>Although some people depending on hair growth allow a blade to last a week, normally, the general consensus is each blade lasts you</li>
            <li>Luck!h allow a blade to last a week, normally, the general consensus is each blade lasts you</li>
            <li>I started with this then slowly bought better longer lasting (</li>
            <li>nick me more and far worse.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product is pretty satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Despite what other reviewers said I received exactly what is displayed here.</li>
            <li>Son did say that if you&#x27;re not careful you can cut yourself, but I&#x27;ve cut myself with a 3 blade Gillete Mach 3, so no surprise!  </li>
            <li>Yeah there&#x27;s a few pictures with the green lime I got, but the main picture has a white soap that led me to believe it would be a different kind of soap...</li>
            <li>The brush has a nice heavy handle, although it&#x27;s a little big for my face</li>
            <li>The bowl, on the other hand, feels cheap and flimsy and I&#x27;ve read in other reviews that it comes apart eventually.  </li>
            <li>yourself a favor - order this product, learn about wet-shaving techniques, and set your morning alarms back 10 minutes - the ten minutes of sleep you lose is made up for ten times by the absolute &#x27;zen&#x27;</li>
            <li>I have been using a boar bristle brush and some old school shaving soap since back in January.</li>
            <li>my 30 year old Gillete never flaked in the same water.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend to dudes who like an old school shave.  </li>
            <li>I finally decide to go old school and try a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>My 15 year old son recently started shaving to my surprise ( not his face but his manhood)</li>
            <li>In the future, I&#x27;ll add bay rum or some sandalwood from Taylor of Old Bond St.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only difference is, it isn&#x27;t as close on the first swipe which is too be expected.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I had grown tired of the expense of cartridge shaving.</li>
            <li>The stand is nice and heavy, the flat plate to hold the brush and razor is a little flimsy, the razor is a little on the cheap side, the brush is beginning to loose some hairs already.</li>
            <li>The soap is not too bad while the soap bowl is very nice.</li>
            <li>He loves it  and says it really  makes a difference  fromthe other shavers he used .</li>
            <li>my other son wants one too.</li>
            <li>I am still a little scared because this is my first safety razor, but my sink didn&#x27;t look like a murder scene when I got done</li>
            <li>only gave the whole thing 4 stars because the rest of the set is not very useful to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face and neck would burn the entire first half of the day.</li>
            <li>It felt pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>It can be confusing and was hoping for the 34C hd, but all in all this is not a bad set.  </li>
            <li>Just enough old world barber shop charm, without bringing on the flat edged blade!  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the stand began to rust almost immediately, even when kept in a clean, well-ventilated bathroom.</li>
            <li>This set has everything that the new wet shaver needs to get started: a quality, German-made safety razor, shaving soap, a bowl, a stand and a badger hair</li>
            <li>and i was new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been interested in using an old-school double edged safety razor for a few months, now.</li>
            <li>Ehhhh pretty much sums up my opinion of this, not a great soap</li>
            <li>Remember to shave to reduce hair, not remove completely with a single stroke.  </li>
            <li>Though you&#x27;ll need to buy new blades at least they&#x27;re very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Though you&#x27;ll need to buy new blades at least they&#x27;re very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is a praise to his dexterity, but definitely don&#x27;t be deterred by the new wet shaving experience..</li>
            <li>It is a fine set and a must to have for men tired of shaving with cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>but I was able to bend it back into place and the glue holding the base to the cup wore out fairly quickly and won&#x27;t stick anymore.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure that I would have a challenging time to say the least, cutting through my THICK beard without nicking myself especially since this was my first time using this type of razor.</li>
            <li>They were almost completely unapologetic about the failure and basically blamed it on me saying that I probably left it wet, full of soap and in the bowl instead of rinsing it, drying it and hanging it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this set and it has nice quality; however, I am disappointed because they as per as their advertisement I should get Merkur Classic Safety Razor #178, but I got Merkuer 180 Long.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li>I plan on using the last few cartridges for the Fusion for when I travel and for trimming certain body parts.</li>
            <li>The kit may seem a little pricey, but considering that you can purchase a hundred double edge blades for around 10 dollars really helps eliminate the chance of buyers remorse.</li>
            <li>of this stuff is bad; I actually really like everything on display (with the exception of the soap which is just OK</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful set and he loves the close shave he gets with it.</li>
            <li> It was advertised as sold by Simply Beautiful, but once in my cart, it said &amp;#34;sold by DB Roth.  </li>
            <li> It was beautiful and well received.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful set</li>

            <li> The set is very handsome; my husband was impressed with the appearance as well.  </li>
            <li> Great shaving set, all the parts of this set are of very good quality, good shave and great looks.  </li>
            <li> Great quality.</li>
            <li> I keep a disposable around for cleanup duty around the edges, and that works great.  </li>
            <li> but now that I have Tabac, it lathers excellent and the brush applicator is a nice feeling in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> happy</li>
            <li> I get a really great shave now instead of using the foam out of a can and a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> The brush and razor with stand are great.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a great quality set.</li>
            <li> This is a great set to get you started.</li>
            <li> I will say, the shaves are not as close as would be with a Mac 3 or something, but are still great shaves.</li>
            <li> Both the bowl and stand are made in Taiwan, the brush is from Great Britain and the razor is made in Germany.  </li>
            <li> The brush is great too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush you think is great until you buy a quality one and realize it&#x27;s not so great, heh.  </li>
            <li> The cup is a great size.  </li>
            <li> Great value, great product.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great safety razor set.</li>
            <li> If a beginner and want to have a matching set at a great price, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> The stand is great for keeping everything organized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great quality.</li>

            <li> Great kit.</li>
            <li> Great quality and</li>
            <li> the razor is great.</li>
            <li> Everything is great except the soap.</li>
            <li> The one it comes with dosnt lather well and dosnt smell great.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Learning to use the set well is what will make it great.</li>

            <li> Everything is great in the set except the brush.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s why I decided to get into the DE shaving crowd, and this seemed like a great place to start.</li>
            <li> the set is great, but i didn&#x27;t receive a blade with the razor.</li>
            <li> Great set-up.</li>
            <li> badger hair brush feels great, but again, I just don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mate and I are both extremely happy with this set.</li>
            <li> and i am happy that he is happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do suggest Googling \\&quot;how to shave w/ a safety razor\\&quot; to spare yourself and your skin the torture I went through in the beginning, lol.</li>
            <li> Great size for me.  </li>
            <li> The blade it came with worked great</li>
            <li> It now sits on the bathroom counter looking great, and he uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> This model feels great in the</li>

            <li> holder thing is great, the blade is great, the brush is okay.  </li>
            <li> The bright spot is the metal stand and Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took awhile to find a good soap to use with the brush -</li>
            <li> I feel good knowing that I won&#x27;t have to go to the drug store for disposables or cartridges.</li>
            <li> He loved it.  </li>

            <li> so I thought this would be a good set.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t get a shave as good as this with store bought razors.</li>
            <li> Good quality...</li>
            <li> Everything is good in the set except the brush.</li>
            <li> Brush seems good quality but have nothing to compare it to, will give it a 5 star.</li>

            <li> He loved it.</li>

            <li> However, he said the shaving cream doesn&#x27;t lather really good.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush and razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was delighted to receive this as a gift.</li>

            <li> I just received this today &amp; it&#x27;s absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s amazing.</li>

            <li> It looks nice and has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> nice almond scent.</li>
            <li> After reading an article on wetshaving, I decided to buy my own kit.  </li>
            <li> The razor has nice weight and the brush seems robust.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really liked it too.</li>
            <li> Displays nicely and works well</li>
            <li> I liked the design of the Razor Stand because it would hold both the brush and razor.  </li>
            <li> i would recomend if you wanted a nice set.</li>
            <li> and I liked it.</li>
            <li> All Col. Conk soaps that I have tried have lathered up quite nicely and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice starter set.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, and  </li>
            <li> That would&#x27;ve been great to have to shave better &amp; have a better shaving experience from using it.</li>
            <li> The bowl is nice too</li>
            <li> The soap lathers well, and he gets a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li> My husband liked the soap.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked the lather bowl to be a bit heavier</li>
            <li> This set is very attractive and cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> Plus the stainless makes them perfect for keeping in the shower if needed.</li>
            <li> You honestly can&#x27;t put a price on this experience,  every man should own one of these.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that its going to be nice</li>
            <li> Great product, great doing bussiness with you, I&#x27;ll highly recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> On a more positive note, the shaving soap has a wonderful smell and it really is a nice looking set.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers up nicely and changing the blade is very easy.</li>
            <li> Great idea for that special man in your life.  </li>
            <li> The price was good for such an excellent item.</li>
            <li> Diamond pattern in handle makes it easy to keep a good grip</li>
            <li> The Merkur razor is very nice, the stand is pretty nice, the bowl looks nice</li>
            <li> I think this is a great first-time set for anyone interested in giving a safety razor a try!</li>
            <li> So I highly suggest buying a sampler pack of better blades along with this kit, so you can find which works best for you.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The sample blade that comes with this razor is ok, but I tried Feather blades on a friend&#x27;s recommendation; they are amazing.  </li>
            <li> The razor is a brilliant silver-blue stainless which makes it stand out and look as if it doesn&#x27;t go with the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I got another one of those he didn&#x27;t like that but was great the rest of it worth the price</li>
            <li> Merkurs are nice but they pulled more then cut.</li>
            <li> The person getting this as a gift will enjoy a good shave</li>
            <li> the brush around when you swirl it through the soap to work up a better lather nice and</li>
            <li> Awesome set for the guy who loves old school ways.</li>
            <li> A very rich, sophisticated set, I was very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the best blade exposure and is very mild, but you can get a very close shave with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, good quality!</li>
            <li> The stand is nicely weighted at the bottom and the whole kit looks great with it&#x27;s chrome finish.  </li>
            <li> soap is great, suitable for hot days when you&#x27;re looking to complement it with a citrus/Summer cologne.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and smooth and product arrived in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> It gives him a beautiful close shave and never clogs, like modern multi-blade razors do.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter kit, or shaving kit for the seasoned shaver.</li>
            <li> But the brush felt great on my skin and the shave soap left a pleasant smell on my face.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think he would like it, but the razor is weighted so nicely that it works just fine.</li>
            <li> It came with everything he needed to get started which was a huge selling point for me!</li>
            <li> I had to spend more money and get presentable boxes to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> Because I use it so sparingly, I have yet to replace the razor after more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells better</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t think of a better razor to start out with.</li>
            <li> There is much better brushes out there no doubt.</li>
            <li> I also get more shaves than with a disposable.</li>
            <li> A better way to shave?</li>
            <li> What the heck, I think, after all it&#x27;s a better shave, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and now we have a \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot; 5 blade system - after all what could be better than 3-blades?</li>
            <li> Of course I could forgo shaving altoghether and sport a more grizzled look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I love this shaving kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to a brand called Proraso which is much better in my opinion.(litterally)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I love this shaving kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to a brand called Proraso which is much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> , Merkur makes a great razor and with the stand, bowl, soap and badger brush you are ready to go as soon as it arrives.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Every face and beard is different, so a sampler pack will let you determine which blade works best for you.</li>
            <li> Husband has the best shave with all above.</li>
            <li> bowl is okay and hasn&#x27;t started rusting for me.</li>
            <li> If you know you will love this shaving system, buy a set with a ceramic mug.  </li>
            <li> Brush is good, Stand is necessary, and razor works great.</li>
            <li> Have truly enjoyed transitioning to shaving like a man&#x27;s man.  </li>
            <li> Yeah some people are ok with it, most are not.  </li>
            <li> Most people agree that Feather is the sharpest/best, but remember that sharpest also means mistake</li>
            <li> so you make sure you like</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s like a $1, and most pharmacies like CVS have it.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite,</li>
            <li> I love the razor.</li>
            <li> stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the product and love to shave with it.</li>
            <li> Shaving Made Enjoyable.</li>
            <li> It is probably best for someone that has no idea what they actually want/need.  </li>
            <li> It is easily my favorite item in the kit.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> is okay to start with and lasts for awhile.  </li>
            <li> The brush is okay and holding up well.  </li>
            <li> Though after trying my roommate&#x27;s better brush I can see that this badger brush is a lower quality one (but still better than boar hair).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve learn most are when purchased for the Col&#x27;s soaps.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastic!</li>
            <li> topic/thread number for more dissatisfied customers.</li>
            <li> - Fifth Edition: Shaving Made Enjoyable]]</li>
            <li> It hold&#x27;s the Merkur Top-Rated razor; a better than the cheapest badger brush (that doesn&#x27;t noticeably smell) and a sturdy functional stand that doesn&#x27;t fall over.  </li>
            <li> but he hasn&#x27;t cut himself yet with the Merkur. :-)</li>
            <li> I am sure he will love it.</li>
            <li> brush is just okay.</li>
            <li> It lathers better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> bowl is kind of cheap looking but it works.</li>
            <li> I assumed there would be more than one blade with the set, there was not.</li>
            <li> While this does not show any fault on the provider I think a warning in the description would be a good idea, many people buy this bundle as a starter set and may find the clarification useful.</li>
            <li> cup are okay.  </li>
            <li> Videos on youtube will help for sure.</li>
            <li> Just wish it came with more razors.</li>
            <li> Love this set, wish the brush was nicer quality.  </li>
            <li> , make sure you order blades to go with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving with a badger hair brush is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> What I like about it is that it comes with a Merkur #180 safety razor and it is one of the better razor you can start off with.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and in good condition, and is working well so far, and would seem to be a good long-term investment.</li>
            <li> ive used it more then 10 times</li>
            <li> If the brush worked better I would give the set a 5.</li>
            <li> I tried the col conk shaving soap and I had a body shop shaving cream for men , the shaving cream gave me a distinctly better shave.</li>
            <li> It shed a bit, but it has been holding up much better than my Van Der Hagen brush.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Merkur razor.  </li>
            <li> He feels he gets a closer shave using the safety razor and is glad he&#x27;s made the switch.</li>
            <li> Having used this for a month now I feel that the razor, brush, stand, and bowl are all top quality.  </li>
            <li> I was realy expecting more.</li>
            <li> He truly enjoys it and loves that he has more control.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is the next best thing to a barber shave.</li>
            <li> I tried every technique anybody ever recommended until I read about safety razors and how they were basically the magic trick for people in my situation.</li>
            <li> Very happy was present for boyfriend</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: He&#x27;s used the razor many times now, and he loves it more every time.</li>
            <li> I like the longer handle on this model because I think it gives me better control than I would have with a shorter handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> Solid, elegant product that made a perfect gift for my boss.  </li>
            <li> I love the badger brush.  </li>
            <li> very well finished chrome great ensemble.</li>
            <li> I love the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure after spending a year in Africa.&lt;br /&gt;SSG, USA</li>
            <li> love it...</li>
            <li> Well, now that I&#x27;ve bought it, I can confidently say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know better</li>
            <li> Razor is great and the stand is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would be comparable.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the experience and will continue to use this product daily.</li>
            <li> you want to try out this style of shaving, go for it; you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> so I was glad for the on time delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about a month now and feel after some practice, I get a better shave with this razor vs. Mach3.</li>
            <li> I love the play pen.</li>
            <li> and they just love it.  </li>
            <li> Really glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I also paired it with an Art of Shaving starter set in Sandlewood, I really love this sent on him :)</li>
            <li> In the end, more than satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the blade and the stand.</li>
            <li> The Merkur razor is a fabulous razor that shaves nice and close.</li>
            <li> and they love them.  </li>
            <li> All top notch in construction.  </li>
            <li> To replace blades, you have to unscrew the top and separate it from the handle.  </li>
            <li> Razor is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The stand is ok.  </li>
            <li> Parker makes a better brush.  </li>
            <li> Love the kit</li>
            <li> A great alternative to modern day razors.  </li>
            <li> I love the Merkur safety razor.</li>
            <li> The one thing that would be awesome is if they gave directions for soup mixture and basic use of the razor for nubes like me.</li>
            <li> I think any man would love this.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this razor is a huge step forward for me.  </li>
            <li> Just received my shaving set and love it.</li>
            <li> My 30-year old son loved it!</li>
            <li> Great shaving kit for new shaver!</li>
            <li> it gives a nice clean shave</li>
            <li> Decent lather production, great price.  </li>
            <li> Not a thick lather, however, it provides a great protective layer on your skin for  shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now the brush is pretty good.</li>
            <li> This was my first &amp;#34;dive&amp;#34; into the world of wet-shaving and because of the reviews of this product I decided it would be a good place to start.</li>
            <li> The razor shaved great, very smooth, and so far no bumps.  </li>
            <li> A friend at work told me about the &#x27;great&#x27; experience he had shaving with his new DE razor</li>
            <li> The bowl looks good but seems too deep for mixing a good lather IMO.</li>
            <li> This set is nice with real badger brush and a nice substantial feel to the razor.  </li>
            <li> SimplyBeautiful was great about handling the issue and so I&#x27;m happy with them but might go for one of the higher end brushes next time</li>
            <li> This is an amazing shaving kit, it has everything you need to get started right away, anybody will love this kit.</li>
            <li> You honestly can&#x27;t put a price on this experience,  every man should own one of these.s set looks perfect together and as you touch each piece of the set in feels natural in your hands and clean up is very easy,  just a simple rinse</li>
            <li> Keep your equipment clean!</li>
            <li> He just runs it under the water to gently clean the blade!</li>
            <li> The chrome colored cup is a nice touch making this all in all a fine set that also looks cool by the sink.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it is important for me to have a nice, clean shaved face 5-6 days out of the week.</li>
            <li> And it looks very cool in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> The merkur safety razor is very good and solid.</li>
            <li> Overall I was happy with my purchase and more importantly he is!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was definately the closest, most comfortable shave I have EVER had.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how many choices and price ranges were available.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not confident it will look great for any great length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> His face is sooo smooth &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great as a gift, as the set is complete.</li>
            <li> This offers a great shave at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> So far, he says the shave is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military and I take pride in my appearance because people look at us as the best,  </li>
            <li> The stand is very convenient, and looks good on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s kind of exciting activities in preparation for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Had been looking for something special for my dad and this was it!</li>
            <li> One of the best things that has happened since my husband started using the single blade razor is that he doesn&#x27;t wake me up in the morning banging the 3-blade razor against the sink to get the soap &amp; whiskers out of it!!</li>
            <li> Best money I ever spent!</li>
            <li> I may have even saved a few bucks--not sure, but what matters is that it worked out perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Looks great and should last for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend a good styptic pencil and aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Good high quality items across the board.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great gift that looks fabulous in his bathroom and he is enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> Really good for a bigger especially when you are trying to figure out what technique works out the best for</li>
            <li> The soap cup is also pretty nice and durable.</li>
            <li> After 3.5 weeks of back and forth emails to DB Roth, and an &amp;#34;out of the blue&amp;#34; email from Simply Beautiful stating they have nothing to do with this</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re completely new you might as well go for it and try it out, and its def good as a present.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t used it yet, because we&#x27;re remodeling the bathrooms and he doesn&#x27;t want his gorgeous new razor getting ruined.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would be fine if they didn&#x27;t charge me $100 for the kit.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor, and I couldn&#x27;t be any more satisfied with a well crafted set as this is.</li>
            <li> He found the soap to be fine but now uses another brand.</li>
            <li> seems totally fine.</li>
            <li> .. fine.....</li>
            <li> this really is more a quick \\&quot;just get something to start\\&quot; kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The streamlined head allows for easy shaving under your nose and the longer handle fit my huge hand</li>
            <li> We did buy more blades at Walmart of all places, and super cheap.</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected and is a very good product.  </li>
            <li> Perfect gift for the young adult men in your life.</li>
            <li> The Merkur HD razor that came in the kit is fantastic.</li>
            <li> set is great overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been Gillette free</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t fit in the stand.</li>
            <li> : So the stand is nice however when I pulled it out of the box it was really wobbly.</li>
            <li> The soap didn&#x27;t work for me, so I just bought the cheap cake of soap at Wal-Mart for like a dollar.</li>
            <li> Cheap junk.</li>
            <li> :B002UB3BF8 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Chrome Handle) and Free Shaving Brush Stand from Parker Safety Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Or if you want to have some fun and try things out (I LOVE an adventure)</li>
            <li> This razor gives a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li> It leaves him really smooth.</li>
            <li> Great present.</li>
            <li> feels light but works excelent</li>
            <li> However, overall it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> The brush performs well and the entire set is attractive to observe.</li>
            <li> the soap, blade, and badger brush are fantastic.</li>
            <li> lather bin is cheap, but that doesn&#x27;t lessen the over zeal for this product</li>
            <li> Once I run out I&#x27;m going to buy a package of cheap disposables for those purposes.</li>
            <li> It has stayed rust free.</li>
            <li> My husband has never had such a great shave, and his face feels  smoother than mine</li>
            <li> They still look great 2 years later</li>
            <li> But I enjoy this product because when I got it for my fiance</li>
            <li> , His face was as smooth as a baby butts.</li>
            <li> This set will let you enjoy shaving.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy shaving with this set.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is well, it was comfortable to use and stable.</li>
            <li> His shaving is close and nick free.</li>
            <li> and they really look nice.</li>
            <li> Great starting kit for beginners!</li>
            <li> The razor clogs up with hair like my cheap disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> Stand, brush, and soap dish all have a nice polished stainless finish.  </li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t one I personally enjoy</li>
            <li> This piece is masculine, classy, and a perfect addition to any mans bathroom.</li>
            <li> The shave it gives is far superior to those throw-away types on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kit for about six weeks now and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> The workmanship is good and the chrome finish looks professional.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a whole&#x27;nother subjective topic and is probably best solved with a blade sampler of about 10 blades of 10 different kinds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchased the shaving set as a gift for my son and he absolutley loves the results he gets from the good \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; technique of shaving with a brush and safety razor.</li>
            <li> I really believe he&#x27;s going to love it, also, and get many years of use.</li>
            <li> The razor has some nice heft to it and the texture of the handle gives you a good grip, even when wet.</li>
            <li> The hardest thing is finding the right shave soap which costs about as much as this kit, but well worth it for a happy hubby</li>
            <li> Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck finding the right</li>
            <li> Solid metal which is very nice.  </li>
            <li> The soap is pretty good, smells nice, but once you use it up there are other brands that are perhaps better.</li>
            <li> My first double-edge shave was more comfortable than any 2-</li>
            <li> I chose this one because I liked the classic look</li>
            <li> Super easy to assemble and disassemble.</li>
            <li> I really liked this set because it contained all high end instrument.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure more experienced wet-shavers would turn their nose down at this, preferring higher quality (and price) items.</li>
            <li> All I know is that instead of paying $15 for 4 new blades I&#x27;m paying more and more money.</li>
            <li> I can tell you the exact moment it happened - the moment that I decided to stop taking out loans in order to be able to afford a shave.</li>
            <li> Now I get why folks are excited about this style of shaving again.</li>
            <li> A significant amount of the badger bristles have fallen out at this point and it can no longer be used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I could pull all of the bristles out if I wanted to.</li>
            <li> That means it&#x27;s a hit, and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll love it even more when he finally gets to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally began piecing together all the items separately, but thought otherwise when I saw this set.</li>
            <li> First of all I love the razor.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m a little more experienced</li>
            <li> So now he has his own set to shave with and I am keeping the new one.</li>
            <li> Safety razor blades are so darn cheap and do such a good job at clean shave.</li>
            <li> The stand that comes with the kit looks great and helps to dry out all the shaving apparatus.</li>
            <li> The soap is ok, but we discovered that Proraso shave cream is better for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Since I am soldier, I need to be clean shaven at all times.  </li>
            <li> If it can please my Dad, it should please any man who likes to be clean shaven.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone clean shaven in the two months</li>
            <li> The razor was nice and heavy, good quality as well as the brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, very grippable, even with wet soapy hands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;brush is VERY soft and nice on your face&lt;br /&gt;soap</li>
            <li> Never before has he had such a nice smooth and clean shave!</li>
            <li> Great shaving kit for a single blade beginner.</li>
            <li> The razor is fine too, holding up just fine, but since it&#x27;s my first, I can&#x27;t compare it&#x27;s angle or draw against others.</li>
            <li> soap isn&#x27;t anything special, and that&#x27;s why you&#x27;d may as well abandon this gift set and buy it all separate.</li>
            <li> But again, the soap isn&#x27;t anything special, and I&#x27;m already going to just buy some Proraso soap and pre-shave cream to replace the soap that comes with this set,</li>
            <li> Just pure smooth shave!  </li>
            <li> The brush is comfortable and feels FANTASTIC when you&#x27;re applying the hot, foamed soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great gift for those looking into getting their feet wet with double-edged/wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on the shaving soap, except for that its better than Edge shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> Love this but don&#x27;t care to much for the brush.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a smooth purchasing experience!</li>
            <li> Splash face with cool water</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really imagine any way it could be better.</li>
            <li> Overall, this shaving set is good.</li>
            <li> I also love the shiny chrome handle on it, very luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this thing so much.</li>
            <li> It is well made and the brush gets really soft when used with warm water.</li>
            <li> Overall, yes, good products and do recommend these products.</li>
            <li> Good quality products that seem built to last.</li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> The badger brush is soft and makes a nice foam.</li>
            <li> The stand is nice and classy.  </li>
            <li> Shaving actually felt good and was fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not a bad soap.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved his new razor so much that I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and the razors can be found dirt cheap in many barber shops or even at some cigar shops that carry men&#x27;s grooming tools.</li>
            <li> The brush provides an easy, consistent lather while stimulating my skin and beard.  </li>
            <li> first impression was that these blades could cut skin easily, however that seems incorrect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s his first time shaving with this type of razor, and he says it&#x27;s easy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with other safety razors, but I am very pleased with this set and it is a much better shave than with disposable blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfectly fine in the plastic in which it ships, but a nice wooden bowl would look classier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice set, I was new to wet shaving and this looked like a good starter kit.  </li>
            <li> The Col. Conk soap that came in the kit is decent, but there are better soaps out there for the money.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, as advertised.</li>
            <li> It lathers up fairly quickly and lasts a an acceptable about of time after bushed on.  </li>
            <li> May not be adequate for someone who is into DE shaving for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will attempt to super glue it.</li>
            <li> They clean easily and are very durable.</li>
            <li> Just as described and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Just something to be aware of the first time you grab the top to remove the blade.</li>
            <li> And the refills are so inexpensive, it pays for itself really quick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with everything so far; the brush seems to work very well at creating a lather with every soap and cream I&#x27;ve used so far and feels nice on the face while applying said lather.</li>
            <li> Definitely a gift which I was happy to receive, and would recommend for anyone willing to take the time for a good wet shave.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful and refreshing way start your day should be cherished, not to mention replacement blades go for as little as 50¢</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this set.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> First let me shine some light on this.  </li>
            <li> It had a good lather and didn&#x27;t take long to set up and put on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited at how quickly it arrived, and how pretty the set was.</li>
            <li> Speaking of advice, be sure to buy a sampler pack of blades to try with your new razor.</li>
            <li> I love my new shaving set.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve, but you can watch any of the YouTube videos on the subject to get great tips and advice.</li>
            <li> The razor feels very sturdy and is easy for me to handle.</li>
            <li> it comes with is good, but be aware that it&#x27;s a short handle.</li>
            <li> he love the razor and was very surprised the lather bar or soap</li>
            <li> The soap that came with this kit smelled refreshing and uniformly smooth matching the high quality of the whole set.</li>
            <li> The soap smells nice, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, makes a good lather - even with the switch to a safety, I&#x27;ve still had less irritation and a better experience than with any electric or disposable.</li>
            <li> next set, I will be sure to go for quality!</li>
            <li> got this as part of a set for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the first package was lost in the mail but the vendor resent it.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it!</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves this thing!!</li>
            <li> ) so don&#x27;t shave with this kit right before heading off for an important  meeting at the office - practice on the weekend first.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t shave with this kit right before heading off for an important  meeting at the office - practice on the weekend first.</li>
            <li> Expected a bloodbath (being new to DE shaving) and instead got a great comfortable shave, no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> this is great for everyday shaving but for me 2 days it will not shave at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and sturdy, great construction.</li>
            <li> Everything in the set matches great and are all a heavy metal chrome-plated-like material.</li>
            <li> It is heavy, well made and attractive.  </li>
            <li> At almost 90 dollars they should come in a nice box that you could actually give as a gift since they recommend this as A gift set.</li>
            <li> Even after daily use (and associated water and soap spots) it cleans up really nicely.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of good stuff about wet shaving and thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> Something satisfying with the ritual of the old fashioned lather shave.</li>
            <li> how economical it is that I ordered a Merkur long-handle safety razor for myself.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just have fun with it...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really expect the top to be removable ., thought it would of been more like two side opening and in place and only would have to remove the blade.</li>
            <li> The razor was as good as i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> In fact, the brush handle is heavier than I expected, and I imagine this feels good in a man&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> Mach lll and Barbasol better so far.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make me like it better is if the bowl fit under the brush on the stand.</li>
            <li> I just gave away almost $100 worth of disposable razor junk...</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s always wanted a professional, stylish shaving stand and soap dish for years.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This proves it... again.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he doesn&#x27;t use these kind of razors anymore because they cause razor bumps and don&#x27;t cut close enough.</li>
            <li> I keep them outside in a really nice area</li>
            <li> Could not do better as far as the razor goes, at any cost.  </li>
            <li> This was by far my boyfriends favorite Christmas gift and he tells me all of the time.</li>
            <li> So over all this is a pretty good buy but just know that the stand will not look good or work well for as long as the other parts of the set.</li>
            <li> This set has held up after two solid years of use (originally purchased in 2011) and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Other than the soap its an awesome kit for someone starting out with safety razors.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve tried about 5 other kinds of blades and they all fit nice and snug.</li>
            <li> gave to my son-in-law as a Christmas gift, he currently uses an old safety razor, this was a pleasant surprise to get the Merkur razor, the gift set was complete with all the necessary items to get a great shave, would recommend this gift set.</li>
            <li> It evidently takes a little getting use to, but is great for the closer shave.</li>
            <li> Other than that, everything esle is good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to try the Proraso soap), but it leaves out so much stuff that you can&#x27;t just buy this kit and assume everything is taken care of, and that defeats the point of it to me.</li>
            <li> I jumped right in after studying technique.</li>
            <li> the right way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finish flakes right off within 15 months.  </li>
            <li> only the very top of the razor housing comes off, making it much easier to replace blades.</li>
            <li> is very easy,  just a simple rinse</li>
            <li> The shaving set is attractive for display as well as useful for the man who prefers an old fashioned wet shave.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve got a wonderful gift for an \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; man, or a younger gent looking to upgrade his personal habits in a classy and time-tested way.  </li>
            <li> no dull spots like you get on cheap stuff</li>
            <li> This seems like cheap junk that I&#x27;m fine with if I only paid $19.99 at shavkits.com, not when it&#x27;s from Merkur, through Amazon and at a quality-product price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this as my first DE razor and I made the right decision.</li>
            <li> But after reading a few tips online and with more practice I got better at avoiding nics and cuts.</li>
            <li> While I think it&#x27;s a good set for the price, he has only been using it for a month now and the brush included is completely falling apart.</li>
            <li> The first shave took some time,  however it was pretty fun believe it or not.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, they are right.</li>
            <li> B002RJC1HC 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand from Parker Safety Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks good hard to keep it clean though, I stopped using it after 4 months.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t quite as nice as some of the more expensive items, but for a classy guy on a tight budget this is perfect</li>
            <li> The price is high enough where you think you have something really nice.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest trying it for the first time before a date</li>
            <li> Even better, I haven&#x27;t found myself constantly wiping water spots off of it</li>
            <li> you put yourself through in this most artful, comforatble, and traditional way of shaving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to put it up against, but electrics and multi-blade systems just don&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li> The shaving set is amazinga and came in exactly as I pictured.</li>
            <li> First of all, yes, this set comes with a short-handle razor.</li>
            <li> you can see the price is almost the same or maybe a bit more than this package, but then you can customize as to how you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap search for anything</li>
            <li> He has enjoyed shaving with it these last couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Okay to start off with but wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for future purchases.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, like I said, this is an okay starter kit if you don&#x27;t actually know what you want.  </li>
            <li> After more than a year of battling with Merkur they finally replaced my razor.</li>
            <li> It will only help improve an already enjoyable process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaving kit seems pretty well made.  </li>
            <li> I feel that I did much better by going with this than I might have if I picked each piece individually.  </li>
            <li> first</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what is shown on the picture.</li>
            <li> Part way through its first use the brush head detached itself from the metal body.</li>
            <li> Some of the hairs started to come out after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I had to purchase another higher quality one.  </li>
            <li> And so, with proper holding, the shorter handle allows for better control over the razor without having to choke up on it.</li>
            <li> I always shave after a hot shower, etc.</li>
            <li> Even from my first shave I could tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to shave daily without being in pain.</li>
            <li> the whole set is a class act!</li>
            <li> Just watch out - you&#x27;re going to start buying more soaps and razors than you actually need, just to try it all!</li>
            <li> stand is pretty crucial to me because I just wouldn&#x27;t want the brush or the razor touching the counter.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving set</li>
            <li> First time buying this type of shaver</li>
            <li> I would recommend to any one interested in buying</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fairly confident that he&#x27;ll be set for the next five years.</li>
            <li> So, I just went back to using some Gillette gel along with the razor shown here, and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with it until I finally learned how to use it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> brush works pretty darn well.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend absolutely loves this set!</li>
            <li> aware when ordering.</li>
            <li> he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> First use of the Badger Brush the hairs started falling out.  </li>
            <li> I would get a better shave soap next time.</li>
            <li> I do recommend putting coconut oil or grape seed oil on first.</li>
            <li> I just had my first shave and with it</li>
            <li> As far as technique goes, it&#x27;s all a matter of finding the right amount of pressure and the right tilt for YOU!</li>
            <li> I wished this set held up, when you goto shave the single blade gets stopped up very easy making shaving take longer...</li>
            <li> This is a good set and as you learn more about wet shaving you&#x27;ll start to find other things to add to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone as long as they are realize that they WILL be replacing most of the items at some point in the future (bigger bowl, better soap/blades, better brush, etc etc).  </li>
            <li> I could not recommend the Merkur razor highly enough - it&#x27;s a joy to shave with, and normally I&#x27;m content to let my facial hair go.</li>
            <li> length and weight seem to work nicely with each other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since purchased a Parker brand silvertip badger brush )which coincedentally has the exact same handle but with a Parker engraving) but the bristles are much more densly packed into the handle, and have much softer tips.</li>
            <li> and as you touch each piece of the set in feels natural in your hands and clean up</li>
            <li> The soap is okay, but I ended up buying something different since I couldn&#x27;t get it to lather very well</li>
            <li> He was really scared to wet shave the first time, after hearing horror stories of cuts, but he experienced no cuts on his first try or the ones following.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price; after all, holding a razor to one&#x27;s face on a daily basis is not something to take lightly.</li>
            <li> The handle is pretty heavy and short, making for an easy, smooth, mostly nick-free shave.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought other blades and they work fine, but they didn&#x27;t provide as smooth of a shave as the Gilette razor that this came with.</li>
            <li> Contacted vendor for replacement and waiting for a positive response.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for a young shaver, but not before driving myself crazy and spending 40 hours looking at razors, stands, brushes, and reading 1,000&#x27;s of reviews trying to figure out what would fit in what and which was the best; you know the drill.</li>
            <li> I received this set as a gift not too long ago, and have to say that I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend the gift set to anyone who is interested in using a straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> The blades are so much cheaper than modern ones too!</li>
            <li> for the other things this set comes with, they look really good, old fashioned and manly, but I find I just keep my razor in the shower and don&#x27;t use the rest.</li>
            <li> Old School Cool</li>
            <li> This is everything you need to shave, perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds up well, durable, allows a super clean shave convenient and store-able you will not be disappointed by the quality and durability, AND it looks nice!!</li>
            <li> overall, it&#x27;s not a *bad* product by any stretch of the imagination, but I just think you&#x27;re better off using it as a basic template of stuff you should get, then assembling it all yourself: a Merkur blade, a nice stand, a brush, some Proraso soap and cream, Baxter of California aftershave balm, Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel, and some quality, sharp blades like Feathers.</li>
            <li> This has slightly concerned me, as I don&#x27;t know what kind of metal they used underneath the coating/plating, but you can&#x27;t see it with a bar of soap in there anyway.</li>
            <li> All pieces were exactly as advertised, and better quality than expected.</li>
            <li> Stand isnt marked with and branding and while constructed well enough, it required a fair amount of work with a dremel and a fine sanding drum to make the brush slot wide enough that the brush fit in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All high quality and ready to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li> It is fine on the outside.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Knowing now what I know, if I could go back, I&#x27;d buy the stand and brush separately, the blade any merkur is fine.  </li>
            <li> No irritation,  no serious scrapes nothing!  </li>
            <li> The shave was great, the bowl could be a little larger, of course I do not use the provided soap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: The product is still great, but after using this a few times every week since I purchased it, the bottom of the bowl has worn away and corroded, and now looks like a different color underneath.</li>
            <li> the stand does as it is supposed to, and the razor is amazing, it has such a different feel than the cartridged ones do.</li>
            <li> Being in an industry that deal with mechanical design, this one looks very well built and the chrome on interior parts were as smooth as the outside.</li>
            <li> but you really have to look to notice.</li>
            <li> However for the price this kit is really a winner in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also bought a separate butterfly razor to give him an option but he much prefers the Merkur Safety Razor.  </li>
            <li> The bowl not so much.  </li>
            <li> I mentioned my predicament to a coworker who then proceeded to school me on the days when men were men, and every manly-man shaved with a real razor blade that didn&#x27;t require pre-approval credit checks and financing.</li>
            <li> Instead of sandalwood he went and got a whole lot from art of shaving and uses the razor and brush from this kit</li>
            <li> The design does allow for the set to sit in a reasonable amount of space on a bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> But now, after about three times, I&#x27;m started to really get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t show this very well</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the razor so much I would have given this set 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Thus was a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This is an okay all-in-one package for wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> While basic and not the most expensive of products, these do what they need to do and are great learning pieces.  </li>
            <li> and he is at the moment packing it for a two night trip because he wants to &amp;#34;show it off.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> None are stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> and i can tell you, if you use it carefully you can get much better close cut shaves compared to any cartridge</li>
            <li> He says it shaves really close.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;razor gave me a very close cut</li>
            <li> air dries the razor and brush very well</li>
            <li> and it still is holding together very well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it some real use before I wrote my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor gives a very close shave without gumming up.  </li>
            <li> The process of shaving is very zen now.</li>
            <li> Gave the shaving set as a gift to my son and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li> I wanted the whole set</li>
            <li> This gives me a close, comfortable shave, without the issue of whiskers getting caught between the multiple blades you have in disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Just be careful and take your time :)</li>
            <li> He had been considering a (much cheaper) product that was being advertised on TV.</li>
            <li> He loves anything old-timey, and he hates the way modern razors shave.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my husband, who had become really enamored with the idea of shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> The razor and brush work very well.</li>
            <li> I was very upset.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with shaving brushes, so this works for me.</li>
            <li> , I ended up putting too much pressure on and cut myself a couple times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard so much about how with DE razors you aren&#x27;t supposed to press on it at all, that the blade will do all the work and cut through like butter, that I couldn&#x27;t help but be worried that it wasn&#x27;t doing that with this blade.</li>
            <li> The brush handle is also very heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also company was very helpful ...</li>
            <li> Very close shave,</li>
            <li> He really likes it…</li>
            <li> The brush and safety razor are very well made; their weight confirms the quality of craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Well packaged and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen receiving it really enjoys using it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend after doing a lot of research on the different safety razors that are available.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, the razor is fantastic in both form and function.  </li>
            <li> The soap doesn&#x27;t foam up much and does not lubricate as well as gel.  </li>
            <li> the sound Merkur makes when going through facial hair.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Even as a newbie to this whole think</li>
            <li> Still trying different blades, hoping to find a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First things I plan to upgrade are:  adding a silvertip badger brush, some alternate shave soaps (as mentioned) and perhaps a nice container in which to keep the current shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and heavy.  </li>
            <li> The shaving cream bowl is nice with a firm feeling as is the brush.  </li>
            <li> And replecment blades are super cheap compared to other razors!</li>
            <li> Also, this stuff looks really smart and classic in the bathroom, products for a debonair gentleman.</li>
            <li> would pay the little bit more to get exactly what I want, but that&#x27;s because I bought this set to experiment.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing what other items I might be able to purchase from this company.  </li>
            <li> and he was excited to open it.</li>
            <li> The stand is very heavy and feel sturdy, and the brush and razor fit securely in it.</li>
            <li> The piece is heavy enough to feel sturdy while comfortable enough to get a good shave with.</li>
            <li> The brush did feel a little scratchy at first, but after reading about how to shampoo and condition it before use it&#x27;s become pretty comfortable for me.</li>
            <li> I am still very pleased with the product, just know that you will not be getting the 34C HD, some pics can be confusing.</li>
            <li> Was shipped on time (maybe even a day early), it was packed well and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Sent back to Amazon for a full refund.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good deal especially for someone just starting out with a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> and I think should be bigger but its not bad at all.</li>
            <li> As I reach for the blades I see a shiny new box - Mach 3 TURBO!</li>
            <li> Ron often mentioned how much the new razors cost and wished he had an old-fashioned razor with blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally new to DE shaving because I haven&#x27;t really shaved in let&#x27;s say 4 or 5 years.</li>
            <li> Keeping these dry is important.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent beginners kit.</li>
            <li> :B002A8JO48 Merkur Classic Safety Razor,</li>
            <li> Rn6 Contemporary Chrome Plated Shaving Soap Bowl,</li>
            <li> though more expensive) items to replace most of the kit.  </li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush, stand and bowl are decent quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really is a nice set for someone starting wet shaving.</li>
            <li> but you can still get a decent lather going in it.</li>
            <li> both the top and bottom pieces which hold the blade in place come off, making it a bit more difficult to replace blades.</li>
            <li> Otherwise is decent starter set.</li>
            <li> The razor and the bowl are just so classic</li>
            <li> ,  I noticed that if you listen to your razor it will give you hints such as the blade will stop gliding once you need to apply more shaving cream and will move the cream around if you don&#x27;t have the proper angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is a decent product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The are both of a high quality.</li>
            <li> For this, I highly  recommend checking out [...]  if you are unfamiliar with safety shaving.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it</li>
            <li> After you install the first blade and bring that sharp, naked, unrelenting edge to your face, you will be glad you have the knowledge that the youtube videos</li>
            <li> This was a christmas gift and my Husband loves it, it was a real surprise to him, he collects old shaving sets.</li>
            <li> A much closer shave than my old Tripel blade.</li>
            <li> , like so many others, have never had the opportunity to know the world of double-edge shaving until recently - and being only 31 years old</li>
            <li> I have used the soap a few times, its OK, I use a cream now.</li>
            <li> : He just found economical double-edge blades at a local department store.]</li>
            <li> After doing extensive research on my first double edge shaving set, I discovered that the razor that comes in the kit is the one most recommended for beginners on sites such as [...].</li>
            <li> Overall it works well enough, but the only part I really liked was the razor itself; the rest was just no-name filler.</li>
            <li> The brush seems OK, but some hairs began to dislodge after just a few uses (maybe this is normal for a brush?)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> (2) I am losing about 2-3 bristles on the badger brush with every shave, but maybe this is normal.</li>
            <li> It takes a few more minutes to use a safety razor system.</li>
            <li> Finding the right blade was crucial as well-</li>
            <li> Only a few dollars more!?</li>
            <li> Its sturdy and easy to set up or take down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using a safety razor, and would recommend this kit to anyone thinking of getting started.  </li>
            <li> NEW Hi-stainless</li>
            <li> I bought him a new stand.</li>
            <li> but like I said, I&#x27;m new to all this</li>
            <li> so now he has no razor if we don&#x27;t buy a new one.</li>
            <li> and I take it to heart to live up to that.  </li>
            <li> and so I shave my face and head everyday, and this razor and the double edge razor theory is amazing, and in expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle has a nice weight and feel, but the bristles were rough, and not very dense.</li>
            <li> Never got a decent shave with electric and frequently used a disposable blade to touch up spots where the electric just wouldn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> : Don&#x27;t try and save money on the cheap replacement blades, spend the extra 50 cents per blade and get the nicer ones, they make all the difference on your face and also last longer.</li>
            <li> buy replacement blades anywhere (Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, etc), they are so much cheaper, and they last much longer.</li>
            <li> I got the 3-pack of Col. Conk Almond, which is a nice subtle smell.  </li>
            <li> I made the initial shave, rinsed lathered up again and made a second pass and am baby smooth.</li>
            <li> I thought the stand was going to be flimsy, and possibly topple over when holding the razor and brush, but to my amazement; it is very, very sturdy.</li>
            <li> First I recommend doing some reading - plenty of websites offer advice on how to properly shave.</li>
            <li> you are really interested in wetshaving I would recommend reading the following book:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After numerous uses of soaking the brush in hot water in the bowl, the glue softened and the plate came</li>
            <li> I pulled on the bristles to check it out and the it was pretty solid.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and i will never be going back to disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Other heads have three blades or more, so if you go over the same spot 3 times</li>
            <li> I received this safety razor shaving kit for Christmas along with a styptic pencil to help with the shaving nicks that my wife was sure I would inevitably receive due to never having used an &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; safety razor before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks elagent on my bathroom sink, I feel so classy!</li>
            <li> Obviously the first step is to look the part.  </li>
            <li> Not the right razor, comes with a long handled razor instead.</li>
            <li> I prefer a three piece razor and this one is easy to change the blades and locks firmly in place.  </li>
            <li> A word of WARNING - I watched nearly ALL of the &#x27;wet-shaving&#x27; videos on youtube by mantic59 several times before attempting to shave with this razor for the first time.</li>
            <li> This is my first saftey razor and brush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything except regular old cartridge shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far better (fluffier, denser, softer, soaks up nicely, dries quickly and regularly, lathers like a beast with rabies) than any other brush I&#x27;ve found or seen available locally, and it&#x27;s much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really have a smell to it when I received it which I was a little worried about, but I still cleaned it out with some mild natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> Like a good little consumer I walk over to the shaving section ready to throw down another $15 or so dollars for 4 blades that will barely last a month.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s probably good, at least maybe until I pack it for travel or something, otherwise I can&#x27;t imagine that it will become loose again.</li>
            <li> I expected some discomfort and cuts the first time, but there was nothing!  </li>
            <li> but it seems to slow down the growth, 4 stars because we&#x27;re having issues with the bowl and soap puck, it doesn&#x27;t exactly match up, may need to purchase a new bowl in order to properly use the puck to get a good lather or whip otherwise the puck just spins in circles and doesn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li> It comes with one sample blade, and it&#x27;s a Merkur, and it&#x27;s not sharp enough for my beard hair, so my first shave</li>
            <li> The soap you should just upgrade immediately to something exceptional instead of ordinary, and you&#x27;ll be buying all the extra creams and aftershaves and such separately anyway, so why bother on the kit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone interested in getting into DE wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The only time I&#x27;ve ever had a shave this close was by a professional barber with a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I can say is &#x27;WOW&#x27;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I did not shave for nearly 2 weeks before it arrived.</li>
            <li> The soap is near rock-like and I have to use a pocket knife to cut pieces out for shaving.</li>
            <li> The soap is near rock-like and I have to use a pocket knife to cut pieces out for shaving.</li>
            <li> As far as purchasing, I had no problems at all.</li>
            <li> The razor is the 180 as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> So damn classy</li>
            <li> He had no trouble switching from disposable razors.</li>
            <li> He really loves the set, even though he had never actually considered using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Has only gone through one blade since Christmas, shaving everyday, however, soap included was not his favorite, he prefers the Taylor old bond shaving cream I got him after.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t know about the included soap because I added TOBS avocado soap to the box as well as a sample pack of razors  for the complete experience.  </li>
            <li> The brush completely fell apart.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my 84 year old Father.  </li>
            <li> The set is quite classy.</li>
            <li> And his face is sooo soft.</li>
            <li> Gift for friend who has everything, except an old time razor.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s German and he over-engineers everything, so he really appreciates the Merkur quality.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t support this product enough, my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Its like shaving with a wild animal tail to spread your lather on your face.</li>
            <li> I cut myself when starting out but learned the correct way to use it very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Twist</li>
            <li> Is there an advantage to using the bowl instead of putting it directly on my face?</li>
            <li> kit came complete with Merkur safety razor, badger tail shaving brush, soap, bowl and razor/brush</li>
            <li> shaving has been one task needed to complete.</li>
            <li> For now I&#x27;ll be using it at night before I add it to my early morning routine.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore,  I have extremely sensitive skin,  also from my job</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried the set wouldn&#x27;t match very well because chrome and all materials have various finishes,  </li>
            <li> Husband uses this now all the time but the soap it comes with sucks and we will be getting a different kind of soap.</li>
            <li> but you can feel an empty screw hole in the center, just below where the pole is on the top side.</li>
            <li> The stand looks nice initially, but I&#x27;ve already started to see very small rust/pitting on it.  </li>
            <li> Had it now less than a week and the brush is in full shedding mode.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a single blade safety razor.  </li>
            <li> After reading about how much I have been missing by shaving with electric and disposable razors I finally took the plunge and bought this kit to start shaving using the tried and true safety razor.</li>
            <li> Okay,  I just finished my first shave with this set,  needless to say I&#x27;m breathless.  </li>
            <li> I tried the soap that came with this, plus other versions of this style of soap, and could never get the lather like it felt right</li>
            <li> If at all possible, go for the long (or extra long if available) handle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this to someone just getting into wet-shaving with a DE razor, although I think eventually I&#x27;ll upgrade or maybe just add to my collection with some different razors and brushes.</li>
            <li> The badger brush is still in use over a year after purchasing it and it has not shed any major hairs whatsoever; quite well made!</li>
            <li> (not thick enough for me).</li>
            <li> normally have a goatee and shave only my cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li> as everyone says(slightly rough, just let it set in some hot water while you shower)</li>
            <li> The quality of the pieces was higher than expected.  </li>
            <li> This is my first wet shave kit</li>
            <li> LOVE using this type of razor now after coming from the old disposable type.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick facial hair, and this thing still works great.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It did shed hair for the first week and a half or so but it seems to have broken in and is staying together nicely.</li>
            <li> that is almost non-existent, which could be good or bad depending whether you really want to smell your soap during/after your shave.  </li>
            <li> Although some people depending on hair growth allow a blade to last a week, normally, the general consensus is each blade lasts you</li>
            <li> Luck!h allow a blade to last a week, normally, the general consensus is each blade lasts you</li>
            <li> I started with this then slowly bought better longer lasting (</li>
            <li> nick me more and far worse.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product is pretty satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Despite what other reviewers said I received exactly what is displayed here.</li>
            <li> Son did say that if you&#x27;re not careful you can cut yourself, but I&#x27;ve cut myself with a 3 blade Gillete Mach 3, so no surprise!  </li>
            <li> Yeah there&#x27;s a few pictures with the green lime I got, but the main picture has a white soap that led me to believe it would be a different kind of soap...</li>
            <li> The brush has a nice heavy handle, although it&#x27;s a little big for my face</li>
            <li> The bowl, on the other hand, feels cheap and flimsy and I&#x27;ve read in other reviews that it comes apart eventually.  </li>
            <li> yourself a favor - order this product, learn about wet-shaving techniques, and set your morning alarms back 10 minutes - the ten minutes of sleep you lose is made up for ten times by the absolute &#x27;zen&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have been using a boar bristle brush and some old school shaving soap since back in January.</li>
            <li> my 30 year old Gillete never flaked in the same water.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend to dudes who like an old school shave.  </li>
            <li> I finally decide to go old school and try a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> My 15 year old son recently started shaving to my surprise ( not his face but his manhood)</li>
            <li> In the future, I&#x27;ll add bay rum or some sandalwood from Taylor of Old Bond St.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only difference is, it isn&#x27;t as close on the first swipe which is too be expected.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I had grown tired of the expense of cartridge shaving.</li>
            <li> The stand is nice and heavy, the flat plate to hold the brush and razor is a little flimsy, the razor is a little on the cheap side, the brush is beginning to loose some hairs already.</li>
            <li> The soap is not too bad while the soap bowl is very nice.</li>
            <li> He loves it  and says it really  makes a difference  fromthe other shavers he used .</li>
            <li> my other son wants one too.</li>
            <li> I am still a little scared because this is my first safety razor, but my sink didn&#x27;t look like a murder scene when I got done</li>
            <li> only gave the whole thing 4 stars because the rest of the set is not very useful to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face and neck would burn the entire first half of the day.</li>
            <li> It felt pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> It can be confusing and was hoping for the 34C hd, but all in all this is not a bad set.  </li>
            <li> Just enough old world barber shop charm, without bringing on the flat edged blade!  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the stand began to rust almost immediately, even when kept in a clean, well-ventilated bathroom.</li>
            <li> This set has everything that the new wet shaver needs to get started: a quality, German-made safety razor, shaving soap, a bowl, a stand and a badger hair</li>
            <li> and i was new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in using an old-school double edged safety razor for a few months, now.</li>
            <li> Ehhhh pretty much sums up my opinion of this, not a great soap</li>
            <li> Remember to shave to reduce hair, not remove completely with a single stroke.  </li>
            <li> Though you&#x27;ll need to buy new blades at least they&#x27;re very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Though you&#x27;ll need to buy new blades at least they&#x27;re very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is a praise to his dexterity, but definitely don&#x27;t be deterred by the new wet shaving experience..</li>
            <li> It is a fine set and a must to have for men tired of shaving with cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> but I was able to bend it back into place and the glue holding the base to the cup wore out fairly quickly and won&#x27;t stick anymore.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure that I would have a challenging time to say the least, cutting through my THICK beard without nicking myself especially since this was my first time using this type of razor.</li>
            <li> They were almost completely unapologetic about the failure and basically blamed it on me saying that I probably left it wet, full of soap and in the bowl instead of rinsing it, drying it and hanging it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this set and it has nice quality; however, I am disappointed because they as per as their advertisement I should get Merkur Classic Safety Razor #178, but I got Merkuer 180 Long.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li> I plan on using the last few cartridges for the Fusion for when I travel and for trimming certain body parts.</li>
            <li> The kit may seem a little pricey, but considering that you can purchase a hundred double edge blades for around 10 dollars really helps eliminate the chance of buyers remorse.</li>
            <li> of this stuff is bad; I actually really like everything on display (with the exception of the soap which is just OK</li>
            <li> He normally has to shave every morning, as his facial hair grows like weeds, but this set and razor gets his shave close enough to have him last a day and a half, and also stopped the problems he was having with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Amazing to have you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any issues with the bowl flaking, like other reviewers have.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone, beginner or pro!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offers a variety of shaving soaps as well as other shaving accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The biggest complaint that I&#x27;ve noticed is people commenting that the razor handle was too short, and at first I was of the same persuasion.</li>
            <li> I keep a wraparound and used the Fusion 5 to shave around it to avoid accidentally chopping out part of it with the safety razor and realized how much pressure I had to put on the cartridge razor to get even close to the shave I got with the safety razor with very little pressure.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to someone who wants to try DE shaving and yet not spend a fortune on something you are not sure of.</li>
            <li> Very well made, Heavy, and durable, a lifetime set that just keeps turning out quality shaves!</li>
            <li> Only one blade included, which was not clear when ordering, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I found the Conk stuff to not last very long, either.</li>
            <li> This has revolutionized my morning (and sometimes evening) routine by enabling me to get a much closer shave quite a bit faster plus saves money both in blades and in shaving cream (that one soap block that came with this set will probably last me at least 6 months).  </li>
            <li> I find that blades last longer if you take the razor apart and dry the blade.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I usually shave with a straight razor, but wanted something that didn&#x27;t take so long.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll end up like the old cartoons with little cuts all over your face.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed about it just coming in the shipping box, but the pieces are still great quality.</li>
            <li> a little closer shave overall - although it is more difficult around the chin with the safety razor.  </li>
            <li> kit came with a Merkur 180 long handle razor, one Merkur razor blade, one stand, one badger bristle brush, one piece of Colonel Conk Rum soap and one bowl.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> lost my razor long ago and bought this kit.  </li>
            <li> you like long handle:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]]&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are several youtube videos on wet shaving with a safety razor that are helpful to the novice.</li>
            <li> Once it was jammed back together tons of hairs came out of the brush while lathering.</li>
            <li> His set came in a neat box along with the Lime-scented Colonel Conk glycerin soap, badger brush, Merker long handle razor with one blade, stand, and cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I used the Merker long handle</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was that the brush was not the quality I was expected.  </li>
            <li> With proper brush technique (wetting the soap, the brush, letting it soak for a minute), this is absolutely not the case.</li>
            <li> Two minor problems.</li>
            <li> If you want a long handle, buy separate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just be extra careful when using them.</li>
            <li> The Merkur 180 is a long handle and</li>
            <li> a Merkur 180 (long) which is just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Now, after several shaves, I&#x27;d recommend the 2- or 3-pass system (go with the grain on the first pass, across the grain on the 2nd and against the grain on the 3rd for difficult areas, under the chin, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it is necessary to be stored carefully to rust after use.</li>
            <li> The bristles on it are a little stiff at first</li>
            <li> (very tough and full), and how long blades last.  </li>
            <li> only last about a week and a half per.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now I always have a sharp razor and after just over a year this entire set has paid for itself.  </li>
            <li> Everything you get is essential, while other things you can get separately.</li>
            <li> Seller must have just accumulated the different pieces from other companies and started selling them with the Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> The Merkur blade that came with it was not quite sharp enough for my beard</li>
            <li> simply turning the handle used in other models.</li>
            <li> The only disappointing part was the bowl which was cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> I kept my feet dry and my beard</li>
            <li> do not know how we as a society could have possibly gotten away from this practice over the last few decades,</li>
            <li> This extra length razor is a bit heavy and not as nimble as I&#x27;d like, I should have gotten the regular length.  </li>
            <li> The one I have is a single part bowl, while the pictured one has a built in stand/ring on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> He had complained in the past about irritation/bumps/general unpleasantness from his super pricey drugstore razors, and I thought this might be to his liking.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m an average 5&#x27;8\\&quot;, 155# American guy).</li>
            <li> Other have complained about it being much like a &amp;#34;cheap glycerin soap&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> But, they bring down the overall rating because they are made in Taiwan.</li>
            <li> Spent last 5 years in the military shaving nearly everyday of my life, constantly battling shave bumps.</li>
            <li> Plus, it looks very classy in our bathroom unlike the other shaving apparatuses he had in the past.</li>
            <li> You can probably get all the components for less than the total kit if you shop around a bit.</li>
            <li> Looks super expensive.</li>
            <li> I have a beard tough enough for a bush hog, with skin that is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My dad always used a single blade razor with brush and soap, when I was growing up as a kid and never had issues while shaving or the expense of razors today!.</li>
            <li> /&gt;bowl is a little too big for soap, doesnt seat well</li>
            <li> /&gt;razor could be a little heavier, but again personal opinion&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bowl is small, barely holds the brush!</li>
            <li> It will take a little getting used to if you currently use a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> I figured if I didn&#x27;t like it; I would only be out a little</li>
            <li> a little over a year later</li>
            <li> I watched several videos on how to properly shave with a safety razor and believe me it is not as hard as you think.</li>
            <li> I am choosing this rating not because it&#x27;s a bad product, but I wish there was more blades for this.</li>
            <li> And a different bowl (the thing is tiny, at least in my man-hand), and the hitting of the brush on it is a bit</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the packaged arrived later that it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> The razor feels heavy and well-built, as you&#x27;d expect from a German razor, and it comes with one blade to get you started.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to the beginner to read up on wet shaving with a safety razor before diving in...</li>
            <li> - Your face must be WET at all times while shaving</li>
            <li> You must be careful when you start up with one of these razors, or you&#x27;ll end up nicking yourself a bit.</li>
            <li> Not really a set, none of the metals match.</li>
            <li> So everything came as expected.</li>
            <li> I can say that the handle, being chrome is slippery when wet, even with the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stand is heavy enough and balanced so it is not prone to tipping.  </li>
            <li> I washed it several times with soap and shampoo to get it to the point where I can use it without the dead animal smell.</li>
            <li> The product arrived carefully packaged as well.</li>
            <li> but they gave me 2 extra soaps for my trouble.</li>
            <li> just received as a gift as i wanted to start wet</li>
            <li> I receive the package promptly as expected, it was fulfilled by amazon after all.  </li>
            <li> Also I had to get use the the brush it sheds and has the wet fur smell</li>
            <li> For instance, the reptacles for the razor and brush are heavy weight and would not likely ever bend or distort even if dropped.  </li>
            <li> He especially likes how heavy the handle of the razor is...</li>
            <li> I switched back to disposable a few months ago but this time with soap and brush.  </li>
            <li> Not much, but still.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent wet shave starter kit.</li>
            <li> it was twice as rough.</li>
            <li> The bowl is a little small, but so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> must due to work being a military officer.</li>
            <li> Should have just bought the razor, never really used any of the other stuff</li>
            <li> My order was exactly what I expected it to be, shy of one misconception.</li>
            <li> A little YouTube goes a long way learning how to use these</li>
            <li> That will probably last me 3 years, if not more.  </li>
            <li> - Your blade must be SHARP</li>
            <li> The other one keeps opening and knicks him without notice.</li>
            <li> However since then I&#x27;ve tried other shave soaps and realize Conk seems to be a lower quality soap.  </li>
            <li> : Yes, it is expensive to start at first</li>
            <li> I actually prefer a small tea cup to hold the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep it out on display on my towel shelf with my other vintage bathroom things.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to address some complaints that I saw other people listed with this set. 1)</li>
            <li> Watch out it is sharp.</li>
            <li> He loves the close shave and will never use any other razor but Merkur from Amazon.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably due to my lack of experience.</li>
            <li> Over time I have saved a lot of money not buying $15 replacement heads from other companies.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the item performs well.</li>
            <li> to give you some other information to you guys.  </li>
            <li> ingrown hairs and small scrapes on my face from doing various things.  </li>
            <li> Please be extreemly careful with razor blade as is very sharp.</li>
            <li> I am in the military and have thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> We use to buy the 3-blade expensive razors and decide to go back old school.</li>
            <li> After my first shave I was sure I made another expensive (and bloody) mistake.</li>
            <li> 1 pass down, and the other pass across the grain.</li>
            <li> By now I&#x27;m getting really, really skeptical what all those blades and comfort strips and vibrating handles and neon colors really do for my shave.</li>
            <li> brush occasionally loses bristles, but there&#x27;s no reason to expect any different from a brush of its sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only words of wisdom are to start doing this slowly and learn how to shave with a safety razor online.</li>
            <li> quality can sour the DE shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m still able to use it without the base.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick and coarse that I still get ingrown hairs and irritation with no shaving.</li>
            <li> I heard him yelling down the stairs for me to come up because he was bleeding.  </li>
            <li> I started off with a merkur blade and got my technique down (2 passes.</li>
            <li> The brush is eh when creating a lather and is why I knocked it down a star</li>
            <li> I was hesitant after doing a lot of research, but I was not let down at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp!  </li>
            <li> I sold it as the original was so bad</li>
            <li> and he showed me some youtube videos on the subject.</li>
            <li> The plating has come off roughly half of the inside of the bowl.</li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can beat this deal, much less get close.</li>
            <li> Brush started coming apart in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> It has everything one would need to start shaving with a DE safety razor except the blades (I had a bunch from a variety pack I previously ordered).  </li>
            <li> Its the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and doesn&#x27;t leave razor burn like the fuzion that I was using previously.</li>
            <li> The brush is about half the size of when I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth making the investment and not having to buy those expensive products that require such expensive replacements.</li>
            <li> The poor quality is apparent in the bowl.</li>
            <li> The bowl is a little small and the brush is a little too big for the stand (at least in the one I received).</li>
            <li> The soap I am using is also cheaper than buying cans - plus no aluminum is wasted.  </li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; loves the shave he gets with this set, though it took a few weeks to get the hang of the technique.</li>
            <li> Badger brush was missing and razor was a model #180</li>
            <li> but it is a stark difference in the set I have.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s an everyday</li>
            <li> Product received within a few days of ordering.</li>
            <li> I researched this type of product for a few hours trying to find just what I wanted to get for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I shave my head &amp; face everyday for work &amp;</li>
            <li> The head fell of within a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have had this item for a couple of months now under heavy use and it has held up without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrived missing the shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> The razor is heavy feels substantial.  </li>
            <li> He uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the handle of the razor is extremely SMALL!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I can keep the same blade in my razor for maybe a month (shaving at least 5 days a week).</li>
            <li> The soap bowl is a little small for my taste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very little trouble with nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money, only to discover I hated this type of shaving.</li>
            <li> missing the extra razors and stand from the order... sad as it was a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> After about a year of near daily use, the base of the bowl broke off.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I&#x27;m  a little disappointed that the boxes that the sets came in were totally smashed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it was meant to be used for if not to hold the soap.</li>
            <li> No more 3 minute shaves unless you want to look like you just hopped out of a Saw movie.</li>
            <li> , I usually shave about twice a week, but I can&#x27;t wait to use this set</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the razor every day though I don&#x27;t use the brush usually, nor the bowl.</li>
            <li> No more complaining about the cost of razors.</li>
            <li> NO MORE DISPOSABLE RAZORS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used fancy disposable razors like Mach 5, then switch to an expensive electric razor, and still had the same problem.  </li>
            <li> so again, the set just seems pointless to me beyond giving a newbie like myself an idea of some of the stuff I need to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen complaints about the bowl being too small; it might be a tad but too small</li>
            <li> The bowl is way too small.</li>
            <li> , 2) the brush is not very good.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of times, I tore my face up, yikes, it was bloody.</li>
            <li> However the stand is of really bad quality and looked dinghy after a relatively short time with rust spots and the base kept coming loose so the whole thing was wobbly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to pour thin glue down into the brush because it seems that it was held together with water soluble glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was spending $15 every couple months on disposable replacements - and using them till they were dull.  </li>
            <li> The little bowl is eh, what annoyed me was the soap.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT buy a pack of merkur blades with this, while merkur is known for the razors, I only found out later their blades are infamous for being bad.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set to replace the ugly old shaving mug and plastic bristled brush</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair but sensitive skin, which has always resulted in terrible razor burn.</li>
            <li> I think this set should include at least 5-10 blades, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard people claim theses razors are too dangerous; all blades are dangerous but this razor is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> It was annoying to return the whole set because of one piece.</li>
            <li> It came with one Merkur blade which is not my preference for a thick beard.</li>
            <li> I have parasso for thick beards and without the oil</li>
            <li> You save so much money using a safety razor over those ridiculous 6-bladed, battery-operated, pieces of crap</li>
            <li> No more razor burn!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the brush did have a bit of a weird smell,  due to the fact it&#x27;s made from animal hair.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for fathers day, he always breaks out bad when shaving using any type of razor, decided to give this a try, he loves it and now shaves almost daily, he usually has a five o&#x27;clock shadow by noon</li>
            <li> The razor I got in the package has a very small handle.</li>
            <li> Loves the alternative compared with traditional very expensive razor blades.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after a month and a half the head of the razor broke off.</li>
            <li> Not good alternatives.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap was mediocre - used it a few times, then moved on.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> Animal smell, maybe tanning, but it was unpleasant when wet.</li>
            <li> I tried expensive electric razors and &amp;#34;highly rated&amp;#34; less expensive razors.  </li>
            <li> I was wanting to cut shaving costs I have a tough beard a 1 pm shadow.</li>
            <li> Someone mentioned that the soap was too tough and they had to cut it up to use.</li>
            <li> During these cold spell we are having in Florida, my little guys are not use to it.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that this is just a matter of a bad spot slipping through quality control since I didn&#x27;t see anyone else mention it in their reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bowl is poor quality, flimsy metal.</li>
            <li> did pour thin glue into the brush and it helped a bit, but I&#x27;m still losing a lot of bristles.</li>
            <li> Seems like for a holiday gift set you couldn&#x27;t do much worse.  </li>
            <li> This morning was my second time using the product and the brissles came off the base as I was pulling the excess lather off.</li>
            <li> Not a great instrument</li>
            <li> All in all very ridiculous in my opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, you can&#x27;t go wrong with purchase as/for a beginner.  </li>
            <li> Although, they sent me the wrong sized brush</li>
            <li> They basically put together a random set, so you dont know which soap/razor/brush/bowl</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the quality of the soap.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say he loves it.</li>
            <li> have to say that Merkur never admitted to anything being wrong with the razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cant go wrong with the Merkur DE</li>
            <li> It was an expensive looking set.  </li>
            <li> After years of paying for expensive, disposable, 5 blade razors, I am now hooked on this safety razor.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed by the quality.</li>
            <li> No more expensive 3-blade razors for us!!</li>
            <li> I was somewhat afraid to try shaving again.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BE AFRAID TO USE FEATHER BRAND BLADES.</li>
            <li> So now when it gets cold</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve gotta say it&#x27;s not too bad at all.  </li>
            <li> I get bad acne,  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad: (1)</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Also the base of the stand has shedded it&#x27;s crome and is rusting as is the base of the bowl.</li>
            <li> The metal bowl seperated from its base after about a year.  </li>
            <li> The luster of the metal and the rust leads me to believe either the stand wasn&#x27;t plated well, or some non-stainless part of the base is rusting.</li>
            <li> The brush is  a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> The kit comes with one blade, which is horrible.  </li>
            <li> The stand began to RUST where it attaches to the base!?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Quality of shaving gift set was amazing.</li>
            <li> Recently switched to safety razor. Already seeing the savings. Safety razor blades are so darn cheap and do such a good job at clean shave. The razor I got in the package has a very small handle. Other than that the product is pretty satisfactory.</li>
            <li> The product is the best out there on the market. I bought these for all 13 of our groomsmen gifts. The only thing is I&#x27;m  a little disappointed that the boxes that the sets came in were totally smashed. I had to spend more money and get presentable boxes to give as a gift. At almost 90 dollars they should come in a nice box that you could actually give as a gift since they recommend this as A gift set.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set, I was new to wet shaving and this looked like a good starter kit.  Now that I&#x27;m a little more experienced I have two complaints 1) it was overpriced (I paid around $100), 2) the brush is not very good.  I immediately had to buy a replacement brush.  The Merkur razor is very nice, the stand is pretty nice, the bowl looks nice but you could probably get the same thing at the dollar store, and the soap last forever.</li>
            <li> Overpriced for what it is...had to return it</li>
            <li> Great quality. My son loves it.</li>
            <li> The set is gorgeous and works great.  The shaving took some getting used to, but I am doing well now.  It is not any slower than the disposables and it&#x27;s a little closer shave overall - although it is more difficult around the chin with the safety razor.  I keep a disposable around for cleanup duty around the edges, and that works great.  Because I use it so sparingly, I have yet to replace the razor after more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 100 safety razors for this for $15 from Amazon.  That will probably last me 3 years, if not more.  Insane!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took awhile to find a good soap to use with the brush - but now that I have Tabac, it lathers excellent and the brush applicator is a nice feeling in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was spending $15 every couple months on disposable replacements - and using them till they were dull.  Now I always have a sharp razor and after just over a year this entire set has paid for itself.  The soap I am using is also cheaper than buying cans - plus no aluminum is wasted.  Smells better too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy I took the plunge.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Despite what other reviewers said I received exactly what is displayed here. The piece is heavy enough to feel sturdy while comfortable enough to get a good shave with. The brush is comfortable and feels FANTASTIC when you&#x27;re applying the hot, foamed soap. The only words of wisdom are to start doing this slowly and learn how to shave with a safety razor online. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest trying it for the first time before a date or you&#x27;ll end up like the old cartoons with little cuts all over your face. This piece is masculine, classy, and a perfect addition to any mans bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for 20 years and I&#x27;ve always settled for crappy shaves--shaving bumps, razor burn and ingrown hairs.  After a couple months of consideration, I decided learn how to shave properly and started looking for a safety razor set to get started.  This set has everything that the new wet shaver needs to get started: a quality, German-made safety razor, shaving soap, a bowl, a stand and a badger hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  The razor feels heavy and well-built, as you&#x27;d expect from a German razor, and it comes with one blade to get you started.  The brush has a nice heavy handle, although it&#x27;s a little big for my face (I&#x27;m an average 5&#x27;8\\&quot;, 155# American guy). The bowl, on the other hand, feels cheap and flimsy and I&#x27;ve read in other reviews that it comes apart eventually.  The stand is nicely weighted at the bottom and the whole kit looks great with it&#x27;s chrome finish.  Even better, I haven&#x27;t found myself constantly wiping water spots off of it like I thought I would because the water sheets off the finish.  I can&#x27;t really comment on the shaving soap, except for that its better than Edge shaving gel.  I haven&#x27;t tried any others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you can&#x27;t go wrong with purchase as/for a beginner.  It came with everything I needed to get going, although I did rush out and buy an alum bar and a sampler pack of different blades to try.  I would recommend to the beginner to read up on wet shaving with a safety razor before diving in...there&#x27;s a lot to learn in the way of techniques.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he was very excited! The razor was nice and heavy, good quality as well as the brush. The is not as impressive and I think should be bigger but its not bad at all.The stand is slightly different color but you really have to look to notice. The soap is pretty good, smells nice, but once you use it up there are other brands that are perhaps better. Overall I was happy with my purchase and more importantly he is! He cant wait to shave now.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an engagement gift for my sensitive-skinned fianc&amp;eacute;. He had complained in the past about irritation/bumps/general unpleasantness from his super pricey drugstore razors, and I thought this might be to his liking. For starters, the set is beautiful. Even after daily use (and associated water and soap spots) it cleans up really nicely. The stand is very heavy and feel sturdy, and the brush and razor fit securely in it. My fianc&amp;eacute; loves the shave he gets with this set, though it took a few weeks to get the hang of the technique. Finding the right blade was crucial as well- I bought a variety pack of blades, and he found a few in there that really worked with his skin and beard. Overall, a great set and a perfect gift.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor set! It is great quality and such a great deal!</li>
            <li> All I can say is &#x27;WOW&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, like so many others, have never had the opportunity to know the world of double-edge shaving until recently - and being only 31 years old, I have never had the pleasure to have experienced that perfect &#x27;barbershop shave&#x27; so many men talk about. A friend at work told me about the &#x27;great&#x27; experience he had shaving with his new DE razor and he showed me some youtube videos on the subject. After some thought I went ahead and ordered this package to see what the fuss was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was definately the closest, most comfortable shave I have EVER had. Instead of the supplied soap I use a C.O.BIGELOW shave cream made by Proraso. A word of WARNING - I watched nearly ALL of the &#x27;wet-shaving&#x27; videos on youtube by mantic59 several times before attempting to shave with this razor for the first time. After you install the first blade and bring that sharp, naked, unrelenting edge to your face, you will be glad you have the knowledge that the youtube videos provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally have a goatee and shave only my cheeks and neck. I wanted to put this razor to the ultimate test so I did not shave for nearly 2 weeks before it arrived. I thought for sure that I would have a challenging time to say the least, cutting through my THICK beard without nicking myself especially since this was my first time using this type of razor. But having practiced what I learned from online forums and videos, I was elated at how effortlessly the blade sliced off even the thickest parts of my beard with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some KEY points to remeber:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Your face must be WET at all times while shaving&lt;br /&gt;2 - Your shaving lather must be the correct CONSISTANCY&lt;br /&gt;3 - Your blade must be SHARP&lt;br /&gt;4 - Keep the blade at the correct ANGLE&lt;br /&gt;5 - Let the WEIGHT of the razor do all the work&lt;br /&gt;6 - TAKE YOUR TIME&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know how we as a society could have possibly gotten away from this practice over the last few decades, perhaps the promise of saving time and effort by using a sub-standard disposable or ourageously priced multi-bladed vibrating contraption (my last razor). It is time to bring DE shaving back to the masses! Such a wonderful and refreshing way start your day should be cherished, not to mention replacement blades go for as little as 50¢ each!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was selling this product, I would say \\&quot;Do yourself a favor - order this product, learn about wet-shaving techniques, and set your morning alarms back 10 minutes - the ten minutes of sleep you lose is made up for ten times by the absolute &#x27;zen&#x27; you put yourself through in this most artful, comforatble, and traditional way of shaving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This set has everything you need to get started. Everything you get is essential, while other things you can get separately. The razor has some nice heft to it and the texture of the handle gives you a good grip, even when wet. The brush also has a weighty feel to it, which is really nice. The bristles on it are a little stiff at first but they eventually soften up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this set out, and if you feel like DE shaving is for you, don&#x27;t forget to order a park of different razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The product is still great, but after using this a few times every week since I purchased it, the bottom of the bowl has worn away and corroded, and now looks like a different color underneath. This has slightly concerned me, as I don&#x27;t know what kind of metal they used underneath the coating/plating, but you can&#x27;t see it with a bar of soap in there anyway.</li>
            <li> Love this but don&#x27;t care to much for the brush. Just wish the stand could hold the brush I want in there</li>
            <li> I ordered this set to begin my journey into wetshaving. In this fashion it has served me well. The Merkur HD razor that came in the kit is fantastic. I couldn&#x27;t think of a better razor to start out with. The brush does its job well enough for a starter brush. The stand that comes with the kit looks great and helps to dry out all the shaving apparatus. The bowl that comes in the kit is subpar. As some others have noted, after only a week of use the inside of the bowl was beginning to show plating loss. I&#x27;m not sure what it was meant to be used for if not to hold the soap. The Col. Conk soap that came in the kit is decent, but there are better soaps out there for the money. I found the Conk stuff to not last very long, either.</li>
            <li> Husband uses this now all the time but the soap it comes with sucks and we will be getting a different kind of soap.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to put it up against, but electrics and multi-blade systems just don&#x27;t compare.  The brush provides an easy, consistent lather while stimulating my skin and beard.  The soap lathers easily, works well, and smells great.  The stand is very convenient, and looks good on my bathroom counter.  So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any issues with the bowl flaking, like other reviewers have.  The handle is pretty heavy and short, making for an easy, smooth, mostly nick-free shave.  The sample blade that comes with this razor is ok, but I tried Feather blades on a friend&#x27;s recommendation; they are amazing.  I highly recommend a good styptic pencil and aftershave.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this set.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a decent beginners kit. I have used the soap a few times, its OK, I use a cream now. I like the stand its really nice the bowl is also really nice. Now the brush is pretty good. There is much better brushes out there no doubt. However for the price this kit is really a winner in my eyes. Other than the soap its an awesome kit for someone starting out with safety razors.</li>
            <li> Ron often mentioned how much the new razors cost and wished he had an old-fashioned razor with blades. As a Christmas idea, I started to search several sites for online possibilities. I could not believe how many choices and price ranges were available.  When I found this 5-piece kit, I knew immediately that this was &#x27;the one&#x27;!  Not only was the price affordable, but Ron loves the razor and the close shave that he gets [for me!]. I also bought a separate butterfly razor to give him an option but he much prefers the Merkur Safety Razor.  The other one keeps opening and knicks him without notice. We both recommend this set.&lt;br /&gt;[Tip: He just found economical double-edge blades at a local department store.]</li>
            <li> After reading about how much I have been missing by shaving with electric and disposable razors I finally took the plunge and bought this kit to start shaving using the tried and true safety razor. I have been using a boar bristle brush and some old school shaving soap since back in January. Let me keep it simple since there are plenty of Merkur safety razor reviews out there.&lt;br /&gt;My kit came with a Merkur 180 long handle razor, one Merkur razor blade, one stand, one badger bristle brush, one piece of Colonel Conk Rum soap and one bowl.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have is the brush started rusting after one use. It was only about 1/4 of the brush handle where it meets the bristles but the rust stained the bristles. SimplyBeautiful was great about handling the issue and so I&#x27;m happy with them but might go for one of the higher end brushes next time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set is great overall. I also bought a blade sampler pack to see which blades work best with my beard and head. I&#x27;m a notorious cheapskate at times but I bit the bullet and got this. I feel good knowing that I won&#x27;t have to go to the drug store for disposables or cartridges. Remember to set some time aside for your shave. No more 3 minute shaves unless you want to look like you just hopped out of a Saw movie.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Merkur safety razor set along with a badger brush and shaving soap bowl, shaving soap came with it.. I get a really great shave now instead of using the foam out of a can and a disposable razor. I also get more shaves than with a disposable.I recommend this set for any one to use. sincerly James Wilkinson</li>
            <li> I purchased this a gift for my husband. He loved it.  The brush and razor with stand are great.  The bowl not so much.  The plating has come off in chunks from the inside of the bowl.  It looks beyond tacky and I can only imagine what the inside of the dish is now leaking into the soap since the chrome plating is no longer there.  I would recommend getting this but have a second bowl on standby for when the plating comes off.  The poor quality is apparent in the bowl. Our bowl has had nothing but glicern soap in it and it has not been dropped or damaged in any way. The plating has come off roughly half of the inside of the bowl. It is fine on the outside.</li>
            <li> I can tell you the exact moment it happened - the moment that I decided to stop taking out loans in order to be able to afford a shave. I&#x27;m walking through my local \\&quot;big-box\\&quot; store with my buddy and I remember I need to pick up some disposable razor blades for my Mach 3. Like a good little consumer I walk over to the shaving section ready to throw down another $15 or so dollars for 4 blades that will barely last a month. As I reach for the blades I see a shiny new box - Mach 3 TURBO! What&#x27;s this? A better way to shave? Only a few dollars more!? What the heck, I think, after all it&#x27;s a better shave, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward about a year and now we have a \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot; 5 blade system - after all what could be better than 3-blades? By now I&#x27;m getting really, really skeptical what all those blades and comfort strips and vibrating handles and neon colors really do for my shave. All I know is that instead of paying $15 for 4 new blades I&#x27;m paying more and more money. I decided then and there that my relationship with my Gillette had to end. Out hundreds of dollars I began looking at my alternatives. There&#x27;s the cheapo Bic razors or Schick. Of course I could forgo shaving altoghether and sport a more grizzled look. Not good alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By chance I mentioned my predicament to a coworker who then proceeded to school me on the days when men were men, and every manly-man shaved with a real razor blade that didn&#x27;t require pre-approval credit checks and financing. Merkur was the name he insisted upon and this gift set is what I ordered for myself. I&#x27;ve been Gillette free ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve to shaving with a this kit. After my first shave I was sure I made another expensive (and bloody) mistake. But after reading a few tips online and with more practice I got better at avoiding nics and cuts. First I recommend doing some reading - plenty of websites offer advice on how to properly shave. Second, be prepared to be a bit red in the face (litterally) so don&#x27;t shave with this kit right before heading off for an important  meeting at the office - practice on the weekend first. Third, give yourself plenty of time to shave. Lastly, keep an emergency disposable razor blade around and use it when you&#x27;re in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I love this shaving kit. It comes with everything you need in one convenient package. Though you&#x27;ll need to buy new blades at least they&#x27;re very inexpensive. I didn&#x27;t give this kit 5-stars for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The included Merkur Saftey Razor hasa really short handle. I have gotten used to it but a longer handle would be better.&lt;br /&gt;2) Colonel Conks Shaving Soap that comes with this kit isn&#x27;t to my liking. The soap is near rock-like and I have to use a pocket knife to cut pieces out for shaving. I&#x27;ve switched to a brand called Proraso which is much better in my opinion.(litterally) so don&#x27;t shave with this kit right before heading off for an important  meeting at the office - practice on the weekend first.

            <li> I got this set as a gift for Christmas and tried it out that night. I usually shave with a straight razor, but wanted something that didn&#x27;t take so long. This set is awesome! The brush is very soft and the razors can be found dirt cheap in many barber shops or even at some cigar shops that carry men&#x27;s grooming tools. I already bought refills at the Briar Patch in the mall.</li>
            <li> The starter blade isn&#x27;t the best, but you can get an assortment of razor blades to use with it. The assortment I purchased to go with this shaving set was Double Edge Razor Blade Economy Sample Pack #1 - 60 Blades ([[ASIN:B001PZEHIK B001PZEHIK]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush occasionally loses bristles, but there&#x27;s no reason to expect any different from a brush of its sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a beginner to safety razors (as I was at the time of purchase and still somewhat am) you must take into consideration that this is not a regular multi-blade razor. You must be careful when you start up with one of these razors, or you&#x27;ll end up nicking yourself a bit. As far as technique goes, it&#x27;s all a matter of finding the right amount of pressure and the right tilt for YOU!</li>
            <li> He loves it. Instead of sandalwood he went and got a whole lot from art of shaving and uses the razor and brush from this kit</li>
            <li> Not the right razor, comes with a long handled razor instead. Not really a set, none of the metals match. Seller must have just accumulated the different pieces from other companies and started selling them with the Merkur razor. The bowl is poor quality, flimsy metal. Haven&#x27;t used the soap yet.</li>
            <li> Seems like a great quality set. Although, they sent me the wrong sized brush and it didn&#x27;t fit in the stand. It was annoying to return the whole set because of one piece.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a family member and have heard nothing but good things about it. As far as purchasing, I had no problems at all. Was shipped on time (maybe even a day early), it was packed well and exactly as advertised. I would definitely do business with the seller again. Thanks for a smooth purchasing experience!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son. It arrived as promised, and he loves it!</li>
            <li> The kit is good, but the bowl you get is not like the one pictured.  The one I have is a single part bowl, while the pictured one has a built in stand/ring on the bottom.  The brush did feel a little scratchy at first, but after reading about how to shampoo and condition it before use it&#x27;s become pretty comfortable for me. Having bought this kit I&#x27;d recommend saving yourself $20 and get the kit without the bowl.</li>
            <li> Nice kit, Merkur makes a great razor and with the stand, bowl, soap and badger brush you are ready to go as soon as it arrives.&lt;br /&gt;I lost my razor long ago and bought this kit.  I would recommend it to anyone, beginner or pro!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offers a variety of shaving soaps as well as other shaving accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS&lt;br /&gt;CC,TX</li>
            <li> The shaving set is amazinga and came in exactly as I pictured. This was the perfect gift for my finance. Great quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> So everything came as expected. The razor is the 180 as far as I can tell. It comes with one Merkur sample blade. This is my first saftey razor and brush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything except regular old cartridge shaving. But it&#x27;s totally awesome, I usually shave about twice a week, but I can&#x27;t wait to use this set everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: So the stand is nice however when I pulled it out of the box it was really wobbly. The bottom of the stand had a fabric glued to it but you can feel an empty screw hole in the center, just below where the pole is on the top side. You have to twist and twist the pole, but eventually it will tighten up. Now it&#x27;s probably good, at least maybe until I pack it for travel or something, otherwise I can&#x27;t imagine that it will become loose again.</li>
            <li> Best fathers day gift ever!</li>
            <li> I bought this set as my introduction to shaving with a safety razor. Like many others, I had grown tired of the expense of cartridge shaving. This is a great set to get you started. It comes with everything you need to start shaving. The Merkur razor is excellent and the whole set looks and performs well. There is a learning curve, but you can watch any of the YouTube videos on the subject to get great tips and advice. Speaking of advice, be sure to buy a sampler pack of blades to try with your new razor. Every face and beard is different, so a sampler pack will let you determine which blade works best for you.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day, he enjoys shaving now.</li>
            <li> My Grandson was very pleased with the gift</li>
            <li> Husband has the best shave with all above. Will never go back to throw aways in stores.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my husband who had just discovered the manly art of shaving with a safety razor. The design does allow for the set to sit in a reasonable amount of space on a bathroom counter. The only disappointing part was the bowl which was cheap and flimsy. It was replaced within a week. The badger brush is still in use over a year after purchasing it and it has not shed any major hairs whatsoever; quite well made! The razor itself has remained one of his favorites and is in regular rotation. I think this is a great first-time set for anyone interested in giving a safety razor a try! The shave it gives is far superior to those throw-away types on the market.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat afraid to try shaving again. With extremely sensitive skin, I had only trimmed my face using an electric razor for about three years, but never really shaved, just trimmed the stubble. I read a lot of good stuff about wet shaving and thought I&#x27;d try it. I will say, the shaves are not as close as would be with a Mac 3 or something, but are still great shaves. The first couple of times, I tore my face up, yikes, it was bloody. But now, after about three times, I&#x27;m started to really get the hang of it. This set is nice. The soap didn&#x27;t work for me, so I just bought the cheap cake of soap at Wal-Mart for like a dollar. It works good. Now I get why folks are excited about this style of shaving again. It&#x27;s worth making the investment and not having to buy those expensive products that require such expensive replacements. Also, this stuff looks really smart and classic in the bathroom, products for a debonair gentleman.</li>
            <li> Spent last 5 years in the military shaving nearly everyday of my life, constantly battling shave bumps. This has put an end to that, will be recommending to everyone.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item for my husband for Christmas as a starter set. While I think it&#x27;s a good set for the price, he has only been using it for a month now and the brush included is completely falling apart. A significant amount of the badger bristles have fallen out at this point and it can no longer be used. On a more positive note, the shaving soap has a wonderful smell and it really is a nice looking set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set for about 4 months and the brush started losing bristles about 1 month in and now deposits between 5 and 100 bristles on my face as I lather up. I&#x27;m pretty sure I could pull all of the bristles out if I wanted to. I&#x27;m going to have to pour thin glue down into the brush because it seems that it was held together with water soluble glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is okay and hasn&#x27;t started rusting for me. The razor is fine too, holding up just fine, but since it&#x27;s my first, I can&#x27;t compare it&#x27;s angle or draw against others. I can say that the handle, being chrome is slippery when wet, even with the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be fine if they didn&#x27;t charge me $100 for the kit. This seems like cheap junk that I&#x27;m fine with if I only paid $19.99 at shavkits.com, not when it&#x27;s from Merkur, through Amazon and at a quality-product price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__update__&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did pour thin glue into the brush and it helped a bit, but I&#x27;m still losing a lot of bristles. Also the base of the stand has shedded it&#x27;s crome and is rusting as is the base of the bowl. Cheap junk. I&#x27;m still using the razor every day though I don&#x27;t use the brush usually, nor the bowl. Seems like for a holiday gift set you couldn&#x27;t do much worse.  Oh and I contacted the company about it and they offered me $15 towards a $45 replacement brush, nice eh? They were almost completely unapologetic about the failure and basically blamed it on me saying that I probably left it wet, full of soap and in the bowl instead of rinsing it, drying it and hanging it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> After doing extensive research on my first double edge shaving set, I discovered that the razor that comes in the kit is the one most recommended for beginners on sites such as [...]. I have to agree. I jumped right in after studying technique. The chrome looks awesome in the bathroom as well, and the set has manliness to spare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kit for about six weeks now and so far, so good.  The workmanship is good and the chrome finish looks professional.  Both the bowl and stand are made in Taiwan, the brush is from Great Britain and the razor is made in Germany.  The soap is okay, but I ended up buying something different since I couldn&#x27;t get it to lather very well (probably my technique).  I&#x27;m new to using a safety razor, and would recommend this kit to anyone thinking of getting started.  FYI - There are videos on \\&quot;you tube\\&quot; on how to use a safety razor, this is how I learned.</li>
            <li> The system works well for a starter kit.  If you know you will love this shaving system, buy a set with a ceramic mug.  The metal bowl seperated from its base after about a year.  Brush is good, Stand is necessary, and razor works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because his Mach3 and shave gel routine left him with red, irritated skin every time he shaved. First of all, yes, this set comes with a short-handle razor. I recommend giving it a chance. I didn&#x27;t think he would like it, but the razor is weighted so nicely that it works just fine. The brush is great too. The soap is ok, but we discovered that Proraso shave cream is better for sensitive skin. My boyfriend loved his new razor so much that I bought one for myself. Neither of us will be going back to the cartridge system again any time soon.</li>
            <li> The bowl has not shown any defects, the brush is as everyone says(slightly rough, just let it set in some hot water while you shower) the stand does as it is supposed to, and the razor is amazing, it has such a different feel than the cartridged ones do.</li>
            <li> Have truly enjoyed transitioning to shaving like a man&#x27;s man.  I am very pleased with this purchase and have encouraged my buddies to give it a try.  This brush is astonishing!  It&#x27;s far better (fluffier, denser, softer, soaks up nicely, dries quickly and regularly, lathers like a beast with rabies) than any other brush I&#x27;ve found or seen available locally, and it&#x27;s much less expensive.  If I had to do it all over again... I&#x27;d buy two of these kits and give one to my best friend.</li>
            <li> Razor and brush good , bowl should be of better quality&lt;br /&gt;This was going to be  a gift and might not use as one now .</li>
            <li> This is like a 3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holder thing is great, the blade is great, the brush is okay.  The little bowl is eh, what annoyed me was the soap.  It&#x27;s glycerin soap.  Odds are if you are buying this you want the \\&quot;true\\&quot; and \\&quot;genuine\\&quot; feel of things, not a glycerin soap that feels like children&#x27;s soap.  Yeah there&#x27;s a few pictures with the green lime I got, but the main picture has a white soap that led me to believe it would be a different kind of soap...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush you think is great until you buy a quality one and realize it&#x27;s not so great, heh.  The biggest problem with this set is quality control, you can tell from the description, \\&quot;Brush, razor\\&quot;, that they&#x27;re trying to be non specific.  That&#x27;s why you&#x27;ll see a review saying one thing, and another saying another.  They basically put together a random set, so you dont know which soap/razor/brush/bowl you&#x27;ll get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing now what I know, if I could go back, I&#x27;d buy the stand and brush separately, the blade any merkur is fine.  And a different bowl (the thing is tiny, at least in my man-hand), and the hitting of the brush on it is a bit annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like long handle:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;Or Short:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002A8JO48 Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002RJC1HC 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand from Parker Safety Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002UB3BF8 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Chrome Handle) and Free Shaving Brush Stand from Parker Safety Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see the price is almost the same or maybe a bit more than this package, but then you can customize as to how you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap search for anything proraso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would pay the little bit more to get exactly what I want, but that&#x27;s because I bought this set to experiment.

            <li> Excellent Razor .......definitely get this long-handled one.....</li>
            <li> Badger brush was missing and razor was a model #180 even though model #178 was in the description.  Sent back to Amazon for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased when I opened the box.  The quality of the pieces was higher than expected.  The chrome on all pieces was evenly finished with no flaws I could see.  I prefer a three piece razor and this one is easy to change the blades and locks firmly in place.  The streamlined head allows for easy shaving under your nose and the longer handle fit my huge hand well.  The stand is heavy enough and balanced so it is not prone to tipping.  The cup is a great size.  The badger brush is silvertip and seems to be put together quite well.  It comes with Col Conk&#x27;s glycerine soap with avocado.  Not my favorite, but I prefer the sandalwood.  There is nothing wrong with the quality of the soap.  For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can beat this deal, much less get close.</li>
            <li> Got this set for Christmas this year. I love the razor. This razor gives a fantastic shave. I would recommend this set to anyone but would warn them of two things first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The razor doesn&#x27;t match the stand, brush handle, or bowl. The picture doesn&#x27;t show this very well but it is a stark difference in the set I have. The razor is a brilliant silver-blue stainless which makes it stand out and look as if it doesn&#x27;t go with the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The brush had a distinctive odor to it. Animal smell, maybe tanning, but it was unpleasant when wet. I washed it several times with soap and shampoo to get it to the point where I can use it without the dead animal smell. I suspect that this is just a matter of a bad spot slipping through quality control since I didn&#x27;t see anyone else mention it in their reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I didn&#x27;t like the razor so much I would have given this set 3 stars. If the smell from the brush didn&#x27;t improve I would have given it 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the product and love to shave with it. Something satisfying with the ritual of the old fashioned lather shave. Happy grooming!</li>
            <li> So damn classy I keep checking myself out in the mirror when I use it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. He had no trouble switching from disposable razors. No more complaining about the cost of razors.</li>
            <li> This set was purchased as a Christmas gift and my honey loved it. It looks nice and has a nice weight to it. He has enjoyed shaving with it these last couple of weeks. And the soap smells good... nice almond scent.</li>
            <li> Great value, great product.  Would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great safety razor set.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit for my husband for Christmas. Needless to say he loves it. I definitely would recommend this item. The price was good for such an excellent item.</li>
            <li> Thus was a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my husband as an anniversary present after I had done quite a bit of research. He really loves the set, even though he had never actually considered using a safety razor. I also purchased the Leisureguy&#x27;s Guide to Gourmet Shaving: Shaving Made Enjoyable. There are several youtube videos on wet shaving with a safety razor that are helpful to the novice. The shave is so close that he can shave at night when he is not pressed for time. I was so taken with how close the shave is and how economical it is that I ordered a Merkur long-handle safety razor for myself.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome gift for my husband. The only complaint is that the handle of the razor is extremely SMALL! If at all possible, go for the long (or extra long if available) handle! Otherwise, this was perfect!</li>
            <li> This is an okay all-in-one package for wet shaving.  It is probably best for someone that has no idea what they actually want/need.  Since everyone likes differing razors/soaps/etc this really is more a quick \\&quot;just get something to start\\&quot; kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I like the razor, it&#x27;s length and weight seem to work nicely with each other.  It is easily my favorite item in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;* The kit comes with one blade, which is horrible.  So I highly suggest buying a sampler pack of better blades along with this kit, so you can find which works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;* The bowl is a little small, but so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;* The Col. Conk shave soap is okay to start with and lasts for awhile.  It lathers up fairly quickly and lasts a an acceptable about of time after bushed on.  There is only a hint of almond scent, that is almost non-existent, which could be good or bad depending whether you really want to smell your soap during/after your shave.  However since then I&#x27;ve tried other shave soaps and realize Conk seems to be a lower quality soap.  Okay to start off with but wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for future purchases.&lt;br /&gt;* The brush is okay and holding up well.  Though after trying my roommate&#x27;s better brush I can see that this badger brush is a lower quality one (but still better than boar hair).&lt;br /&gt;* The stand looks nice initially, but I&#x27;ve already started to see very small rust/pitting on it.  So I&#x27;m not confident it will look great for any great length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, like I said, this is an okay starter kit if you don&#x27;t actually know what you want.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone as long as they are realize that they WILL be replacing most of the items at some point in the future (bigger bowl, better soap/blades, better brush, etc etc).  I started with this then slowly bought better longer lasting (though more expensive) items to replace most of the kit.  Of the lot, the razor handle is the one item that I haven&#x27;t looked into replacing at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a beginner safety razor set to see if it was something I could get in to.  While basic and not the most expensive of products, these do what they need to do and are great learning pieces.  The soap bowl is a little small for my taste but I&#x27;ve learn most are when purchased for the Col&#x27;s soaps.  I purchased another bowl which I use for proraso soaps and keep this bowl for traveling.  If a beginner and want to have a matching set at a great price, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic! And replecment blades are super cheap compared to other razors! And it looks very cool in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> The best and cheapest shave I have ever experienced. At this time I would like to say goodbye to overpriced five blade gillette razors. And thank you Merkur I have become a customer of yours for life. For anyone out there who shaves with disposable razors give this Merkur razor a try you won&#x27;t regret it. You will be doing the environment a favor in the process. NO MORE DISPOSABLE RAZORS</li>
            <li> Look at all of these dissatisfied customers in the badger and blade forum thread below.  I have had the same issues.  No backing from Merkur/Dovo.  Finish flakes right off within 15 months.  Merkur blames the water.  Hmmm... my 30 year old Gillete never flaked in the same water.  Shame on Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Badger and blade forums topic/thread number for more dissatisfied customers. Thread/topic id 135882&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up.........After more than a year of battling with Merkur they finally replaced my razor. I sold it as the original was so bad and if it were to have the same finish issues I would not want to battle with Merkur again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that Merkur never admitted to anything being wrong with the razor. They kept blaming it on me. At one point they even suggested I had acid come in contact with it. All in all very ridiculous in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Since I am soldier, I need to be clean shaven at all times.  Shaving has always been a pain for me since I am prone to razor burn and bumps.  After reading an article on wetshaving, I decided to buy my own kit.  I would recommend that you watch some videos on how to properly shave with a safety razor before you attempt shaving with one.  It will only help improve an already enjoyable process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cost of blades: 10 safety blades &#x3D; $1&lt;br /&gt;2. Smoothest shave you will ever have.&lt;br /&gt;3. Actually turns shaving into an experience rather than a chore.&lt;br /&gt;4. The shaving kit seems pretty well made.  The razor has nice weight and the brush seems robust.&lt;br /&gt;5. The stand is great for keeping everything organized.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Initial Costs: Yes, it is expensive to start at first but after time you will save money from the costs of blades.&lt;br /&gt;2. The Shaving Soap:  I am not a big fan of the shaving soap but it might just be me.  I don&#x27;t it lathers as well as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are really interested in wetshaving I would recommend reading the following book:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:1463595344 Leisureguy&#x27;s Guide to Gourmet Shaving - Fifth Edition: Shaving Made Enjoyable]]</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful set! Just wish it had a &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34;  opening for easier cleaning.</li>
            <li> Got it for my boyfriend as one of his Christmas gifts and he hates to shave but it&#x27;s an everyday must due to work being a military officer. Loves the alternative compared with traditional very expensive razor blades. Has only gone through one blade since Christmas, shaving everyday, however, soap included was not his favorite, he prefers the Taylor old bond shaving cream I got him after.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for a young shaver, but not before driving myself crazy and spending 40 hours looking at razors, stands, brushes, and reading 1,000&#x27;s of reviews trying to figure out what would fit in what and which was the best; you know the drill. It hold&#x27;s the Merkur Top-Rated razor; a better than the cheapest badger brush (that doesn&#x27;t noticeably smell) and a sturdy functional stand that doesn&#x27;t fall over.  The chrome colored cup is a nice touch making this all in all a fine set that also looks cool by the sink.  I still don&#x27;t know about the included soap because I added TOBS avocado soap to the box as well as a sample pack of razors  for the complete experience.  I feel that I did much better by going with this than I might have if I picked each piece individually.  I may have even saved a few bucks--not sure, but what matters is that it worked out perfectly.  My 18yo loves it.  When he opened the box he said that he felt as though he officially became a man that day and he is at the moment packing it for a two night trip because he wants to &amp;#34;show it off.&amp;#34;  Oh, and I also got him a styptic pencil but he hasn&#x27;t cut himself yet with the Merkur. :-)</li>
            <li> Great quality. Makes a good gift.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations in terms of quality. I was impressed and my husband (it was a gift for him) really liked it too. The product arrived carefully packaged as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this gift for my son for Christmas. I am sure he will love it. The quality is awesome. Looks great and should last for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I received this kist as a gift for Christmas. Overall it works well enough, but the only part I really liked was the razor itself; the rest was just no-name filler. I think I could have purchased nicer items for the same money if not cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Razor is a name brand Merkur model 180. Its works great and I can&#x27;t really imagine any way it could be better. It came with one Merkur blade which is not my preference for a thick beard. That&#x27;s a whole&#x27;nother subjective topic and is probably best solved with a blade sampler of about 10 blades of 10 different kinds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stand isnt marked with and branding and while constructed well enough, it required a fair amount of work with a dremel and a fine sanding drum to make the brush slot wide enough that the brush fit in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is just okay. The handle has a nice weight and feel, but the bristles were rough, and not very dense. I&#x27;ve since purchased a Parker brand silvertip badger brush )which coincedentally has the exact same handle but with a Parker engraving) but the bristles are much more densly packed into the handle, and have much softer tips. It lathers better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is kind of cheap looking but it works. I actually prefer a small tea cup to hold the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is good. It lathers well and has a plesant but not overpowering scent; mine is lime. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again in the 4-pack sampler.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it and uses it often. I keep it out on display on my towel shelf with my other vintage bathroom things.</li>
            <li> Should have just bought the razor, never really used any of the other stuff</li>
            <li> My order was exactly what I expected it to be, shy of one misconception. I assumed there would be more than one blade with the set, there was not. While this does not show any fault on the provider I think a warning in the description would be a good idea, many people buy this bundle as a starter set and may find the clarification useful.</li>
            <li> Brush started coming apart in less than a year.  Safety razor, stand, and cup are okay.  None are stainless steel.  But the brush is junk.</li>
            <li> Great quality product.  Solid metal which is very nice.  Not tinsey or flimsy.  Very sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> The brush completely fell apart. I bought this for my boyfriend from Valentine&#x27;s Day and I&#x27;m super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great buy for a beginner. May not be adequate for someone who is into DE shaving for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a gift and it worked out well. The lemon flavored soap smells good. Took a while to learn how to create lather. Videos on youtube will help for sure. I prefer Proraso, i would recommend buying an additional shaving soap/cream with this gift set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with a Merkur DE blade which is moderate sharpness. Really good for a bigger especially when you are trying to figure out what technique works out the best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush, stand and bowl are decent quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cant go wrong with the Merkur DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with a DE blade has a learning curve both for your skills and your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that these blades could cut skin easily, however that seems incorrect. I saw some videos on youtube and i can tell you, if you use it carefully you can get much better close cut shaves compared to any cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to someone who wants to try DE shaving and yet not spend a fortune on something you are not sure of.</li>
            <li> I bought for my husband he loved it. He says it shaves really close.It leaves him really smooth. Just wish it came with more razors.</li>
            <li> Purchased the shaving set as a gift for my son and he absolutley loves the results he gets from the good \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; technique of shaving with a brush and safety razor.</li>
            <li> I got this set as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it, says its the best shave ever. We did buy more blades at Walmart of all places, and super cheap. This looks great sitting out in the bathroom also. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for fathers day, he always breaks out bad when shaving using any type of razor, decided to give this a try, he loves it and now shaves almost daily, he usually has a five o&#x27;clock shadow by noon but it seems to slow down the growth, 4 stars because we&#x27;re having issues with the bowl and soap puck, it doesn&#x27;t exactly match up, may need to purchase a new bowl in order to properly use the puck to get a good lather or whip otherwise the puck just spins in circles and doesn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li> Bought this as my first DE razor and I made the right decision. No problems at all. Expected a bloodbath (being new to DE shaving) and instead got a great comfortable shave, no irritation at all. I only wish I stopped buying cartridge razors years ago.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing shaving kit, it has everything you need to get started right away, anybody will love this kit.</li>
            <li> Awesome starter set. I bought this to save money. It really is a nice set for someone starting wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday. He loves it! It definitely gives him the close shave that he was looking for. He will never go back to plastic shavers again! No issues at all with this product. No rust or faulty parts. I do believe that it will stand up to the test of time. Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this set, wish the brush was nicer quality.  The blade it came with is not the greatest, I ended up purchasing a sampler pack on Amazon and hopefully I find what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Purchased as a gift.</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas gift.  Loved it!  Definitely recommend to dudes who like an old school shave.  LIKE LIKE LIKE</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband.  Very nice set!  Displays nicely and works well, make sure you order blades to go with.  Blades were not included.</li>
            <li> Got for eldest son as part of graduation giftage.  He loves it, and so do I.  Well, I hinted so maybe I&#x27;ll get one for Christmas!  Son did say that if you&#x27;re not careful you can cut yourself, but I&#x27;ve cut myself with a 3 blade Gillete Mach 3, so no surprise!  It&#x27;s a razor blade!  It&#x27;s sharp!  I guess I&#x27;ll have to find out if it can handle my beard (very tough and full), and how long blades last.  I&#x27;ll try to remember to update.</li>
            <li> Great shaving kit for a single blade beginner. Shipping was delayed quite a bit but they gave me 2 extra soaps for my trouble. Great quality but I would recomend purchasing extra blades.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my 84 year old Father.  He has arthritis and had been having difficulty getting a close shave.  Dad has never worn a beard and, as he likes to tell it, \\&quot;During WWII in the Pacific, as soon as I got water, I shaved.  I kept my feet dry and my beard gone.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought him an electric razor, but he didn&#x27;t like it.  I bought him different shave creams and razors, but he looked scraggly.  I kept reading different reviews about what might work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found this set on Amazon.  I liked the design of the Razor Stand because it would hold both the brush and razor.  Keeping these dry is important.  I figured if he didn&#x27;t like the soap and bowl, I could go back online and look for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He LOVES everything!  He keeps telling me that he is getting the best shave he has ever gotten. He no longer gets a \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock\\&quot; shadow.  I even think the shave soap is improving the condition of his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great set.  If it can please my Dad, it should please any man who likes to be clean shaven.</li>
            <li> This set has held up after two solid years of use (originally purchased in 2011) and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this set to replace the ugly old shaving mug and plastic bristled brush I&#x27;d been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with a badger hair brush is MUCH better. I&#x27;m very much impressed with this set. A must have for any safety razor user.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get into &amp;#34;Wet Shaving&amp;#34; and I thought that this would be the best way to get the things I need. I knew what the start-up cost would be so I thought this would be a good set. What I like about it is that it comes with a Merkur #180 safety razor and it is one of the better razor you can start off with. I also like the stand. This is a good set and as you learn more about wet shaving you&#x27;ll start to find other things to add to it. Like silver-tip badger brushes. (I ordered two) Shaving mugs, different shaving soaps. Just have fun with it...</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and in good condition, and is working well so far, and would seem to be a good long-term investment.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality... Boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> I love my new shaving set. It works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Best money I ever spent! This is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. This set and using Feather Blades is my preference. You just can&#x27;t get a shave as good as this with store bought razors.</li>
            <li> This was my first &amp;#34;dive&amp;#34; into the world of wet-shaving and because of the reviews of this product I decided it would be a good place to start. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with everything so far; the brush seems to work very well at creating a lather with every soap and cream I&#x27;ve used so far and feels nice on the face while applying said lather. It did shed hair for the first week and a half or so but it seems to have broken in and is staying together nicely. It didn&#x27;t really have a smell to it when I received it which I was a little worried about, but I still cleaned it out with some mild natural shampoo. The bowl is great for pre-soaking the brush and I often use it to lather if I&#x27;m not face-lathering. The razor feels very sturdy and is easy for me to handle. The Merkur blade that came with it was not quite sharp enough for my beard but I&#x27;ve tried about 5 other kinds of blades and they all fit nice and snug. I&#x27;d highly recommend this to someone just getting into wet-shaving with a DE razor, although I think eventually I&#x27;ll upgrade or maybe just add to my collection with some different razors and brushes.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it.  The hardest thing is finding the right shave soap which costs about as much as this kit, but well worth it for a happy hubby</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really expect the top to be removable ., thought it would of been more like two side opening and in place and only would have to remove the blade.</li>
            <li> Great present. Please be extreemly careful with razor blade as is very sharp. Only grab by handle.!!!  Takes time to prepare the cream.</li>
            <li> This is everything you need to shave, perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds up well, durable, allows a super clean shave convenient and store-able you will not be disappointed by the quality and durability, AND it looks nice!!</li>
            <li> just received as a gift as i wanted to start wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;my first impressions.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;full set.&lt;br /&gt;brush is VERY soft and nice on your face&lt;br /&gt;soap feels light but works excelent&lt;br /&gt;razor gave me a very close cut&lt;br /&gt;stand air dries the razor and brush very well&lt;br /&gt;everything is shiny chrome no dull spots like you get on cheap stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;bowl is a little too big for soap, doesnt seat well but im just nit picking&lt;br /&gt;razor could be a little heavier, but again personal opinion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall i would recomend if you wanted a nice set.</li>
            <li> The set was way nicer than i thought it would be. the brush and razor stand is very nice and durable. The brush is built quite well ive used it more then 10 times and it still is holding together very well. The razor was as good as i expected it to be. The soap cup is also pretty nice and durable. If your looking into purchasing a sefety razor set this is the one to buy. Good quality...</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at shaving with a safety razor. The products arrived two days after placing the order, and arrived in perfect condition. I received exactly what is shown on the picture. This morning was my second time using the product and the brissles came off the base as I was pulling the excess lather off. The brissles are attached to a plastic cup which was glued to the handle, so when I get home tonight (after everything dries up) I will attempt to super glue it. Other than that, everything esle is good. I&#x27;m still getting used to the razor.</li>
            <li> Everything is good in the set except the brush. Part way through its first use the brush head detached itself from the metal body. I had to jam the brush back into the body to use it again. Once it was jammed back together tons of hairs came out of the brush while lathering. Hairs all over my face. Gross. The bright spot is the metal stand and Merkur razor. The are both of a high quality. If the brush worked better I would give the set a 5.</li>
            <li> Product received within a few days of ordering. Looks very nice. Only one blade included, which was not clear when ordering, but not a deal breaker. I recommend this product, especially for those just starting with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I was wanting to cut shaving costs I have a tough beard a 1 pm shadow. this is great for everyday shaving but for me 2 days it will not shave at all. will keep it like the soap and brush is great</li>
            <li> I purchased this set a year ago. I wanted to give it some real use before I wrote my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;This set is overpriced by about $50, for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The stand began to RUST where it attaches to the base!? This happened within a couple months of use!&lt;br /&gt;2. The bowl is small, barely holds the brush! Also the bottom plate of the bowl is GLUED on!&lt;br /&gt;  After numerous uses of soaking the brush in hot water in the bowl, the glue softened and the plate came OFF!?!&lt;br /&gt;  Now the bowl won&#x27;t stay upright if I attempt to soak the brush, or rest the brush in it while I shave!&lt;br /&gt;  (I refuse to glue it back on, as a reminder of my dissatisfaction)&lt;br /&gt;3. The brush seems OK, but some hairs began to dislodge after just a few uses (maybe this is normal for a brush?)&lt;br /&gt;4. The soap was mediocre - used it a few times, then moved on.&lt;br /&gt;5. The razor seems to be the only part of the \\&quot;set\\&quot; that I didn&#x27;t find to be junk - still using it a year later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I regret this purchase based on the price vs quality.&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality can sour the DE shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next set, I will be sure to go for quality!</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor, and I couldn&#x27;t be any more satisfied with a well crafted set as this is.</li>
            <li> Overall, this shaving set is good. But the handle of the razor is really short.</li>
            <li> This is my first wet shave kit and I am very happy with it.The merkur safety razor is very good and solid. I tried the col conk shaving soap and I had a body shop shaving cream for men , the shaving cream gave me a distinctly better shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this gift set for my father when I told him about my switch from using cartridge blades to double-edged shaving. His set came in a neat box along with the Lime-scented Colonel Conk glycerin soap, badger brush, Merker long handle razor with one blade, stand, and cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are great, however, my father did not like the razor. I used the Merker long handle and I liked it. It doesn&#x27;t have the best blade exposure and is very mild, but you can get a very close shave with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is great, suitable for hot days when you&#x27;re looking to complement it with a citrus/Summer cologne. Not a thick lather, however, it provides a great protective layer on your skin for  shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is great. It shed a bit, but it has been holding up much better than my Van Der Hagen brush. I also love the shiny chrome handle on it, very luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great gift for those looking into getting their feet wet with double-edged/wet shaving. Trust me, I don&#x27;t regret making the switch and save a ton of money now that me and my father don&#x27;t have to pay for overpriced shave cartridges.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues when it came to shaving.  I suffered from razor bumps on my neck and some ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;ve used fancy disposable razors like Mach 5, then switch to an expensive electric razor, and still had the same problem.  I finally decide to go old school and try a safety razor.  I receive the package promptly as expected, it was fulfilled by amazon after all.  It was well packaged.  The razor, bowl, brush, and stand all look great and have a good weight to them.  The soap was an almond scent and smelt great.  I never used shaving soap before but I&#x27;ve gotta say it&#x27;s not too bad at all.  The razor shaved great, very smooth, and so far no bumps.  It will take a little getting used to if you currently use a disposable razor.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was that the brush was not the quality I was expected.  Some of the hairs started to come out after the first use.  I had to purchase another higher quality one.  However, overall it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a very close shave without gumming up.  The brush performs well and the entire set is attractive to observe.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Merkur razor.  Total conversion to this as my shaving method.  The process of shaving is very zen now.</li>
            <li> Great kit. The quality of the kit is superb and the price was right on point. Best shave I have ever had. Thank you for a great product !!!!</li>
            <li> Everything re: this transaction was perfect!  The saving set looks quite fancy sitting on my husband&#x27;s sink.  He feels he gets a closer shave using the safety razor and is glad he&#x27;s made the switch.</li>
            <li> Having used this for a month now I feel that the razor, brush, stand, and bowl are all top quality.  The soap is a great starter soap and this is a perfect introduction into safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li> Great quality and I use it daily</li>
            <li> the razor is great. the soap, blade, and badger brush are fantastic. I love this thing so much. Best purchase ever.</li>
            <li> Everything is great except the soap. I recamened getting a different soap. The one it comes with dosnt lather well and dosnt smell great. Also I had to get use the the brush it sheds and has the wet fur smell but it&#x27;s works great.</li>
            <li> I received this set as a gift not too long ago, and have to say that I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to address some complaints that I saw other people listed with this set. 1) The biggest complaint that I&#x27;ve noticed is people commenting that the razor handle was too short, and at first I was of the same persuasion. After a bit of use though, and researching how to use it properly, I learned that holding it by the tip made it so that you don&#x27;t use any extra pressure than the weight of the razor (which is something that you definitely don&#x27;t want to happen). And so, with proper holding, the shorter handle allows for better control over the razor without having to choke up on it. 2) Someone mentioned that the soap was too tough and they had to cut it up to use. With proper brush technique (wetting the soap, the brush, letting it soak for a minute), this is absolutely not the case. All Col. Conk soaps that I have tried have lathered up quite nicely and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning to use the set well is what will make it great. For this, I highly  recommend checking out [...]  if you are unfamiliar with safety shaving.</li>
            <li> The set is quite classy. Nice set.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving soap (I got Almond) is good.</li>
            <li> The shaving set is attractive for display as well as useful for the man who prefers an old fashioned wet shave.  Being a gift for someone, I cannot comments on its qualities in use, but the set feels solid and well made.  For instance, the reptacles for the razor and brush are heavy weight and would not likely ever bend or distort even if dropped.  There is no seam on the brush handle as I&#x27;ve seen on some not-inexpensive brushes.  In fact, the brush handle is heavier than I expected, and I imagine this feels good in a man&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> Good quality, great shave, and so handsome on the bathroom shelf. And his face is sooo soft. Watch the Youtube videos about using a safety razor, and the reviews about razor refills are helpful.</li>
            <li> Not a great instrument but I may need some practise. I always shave after a hot shower, etc. I was realy expecting more. Mach lll and Barbasol better so far.</li>
            <li> I could not recommend the Merkur razor highly enough - it&#x27;s a joy to shave with, and normally I&#x27;m content to let my facial hair go. I&#x27;ve gone clean shaven in the two months I&#x27;ve had this razor than I have in years. The soap smells nice, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, makes a good lather - even with the switch to a safety, I&#x27;ve still had less irritation and a better experience than with any electric or disposable. My only complaint is that the stand began to rust almost immediately, even when kept in a clean, well-ventilated bathroom. The luster of the metal and the rust leads me to believe either the stand wasn&#x27;t plated well, or some non-stainless part of the base is rusting. This is just my experience, and perhaps I just got an unlucky fluke, but caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the US Army and so I shave my face and head everyday, and this razor and the double edge razor theory is amazing, and in expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather bin is cheap, but that doesn&#x27;t lessen the over zeal for this product</li>
            <li> Gave the shaving set as a gift to my son and he really likes it.  Very nice presentation and he said he is getting a very good shave with the razor.  I would recommend the gift set to anyone who is interested in using a straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> Nice starter set. I was a little disappointed about it just coming in the shipping box, but the pieces are still great quality. I&#x27;m planning on buying another set for Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> Great package and quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value for the money and the razor especially is excellent with great weight to the handle</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift. He truly enjoys it and loves that he has more control. He especially likes how heavy the handle of the razor is... It evidently takes a little getting use to, but is great for the closer shave.</li>
            <li> Gift for friend who has everything, except an old time razor.</li>
            <li> I researched this type of product for a few hours trying to find just what I wanted to get for my boyfriend. I wanted the whole set and this was the best deal I could find. It is well made and the brush gets really soft when used with warm water. The only thing that would make me like it better is if the bowl fit under the brush on the stand. My boyfriend loves it and uses it every time he shaves now!</li>
            <li> I really liked this set because it contained all high end instrument. They clean easily and are very durable. Nothing can brake.</li>
            <li> Great shaving set, all the parts of this set are of very good quality, good shave and great looks.  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This gives me a close, comfortable shave, without the issue of whiskers getting caught between the multiple blades you have in disposable razors. I would say that this is the next best thing to a barber shave. I also like the smell of the soap provided.</li>
            <li> For all you get with this gift set it&#x27;s a good deal especially for someone just starting out with a double edge razor. Razor is very good 5 star, no question. Brush seems good quality but have nothing to compare it to, will give it a 5 star. The soap I haven&#x27;t tried yet because I bought something else, can&#x27;t rate it. As for the bowl and the stand, look good, do their job. But, they bring down the overall rating because they are made in Taiwan. Overall, yes, good products and do recommend these products.</li>
            <li> I received this kit on request as a Christmas gift. I have thick facial hair but sensitive skin, which has always resulted in terrible razor burn. I couldn&#x27;t even shave daily with a cartridge razor because the razor burn would cover my neck and around my mouth by day two or three of shaving daily. My face and neck would burn the entire first half of the day. I tried everything. Three razors, four razors and five razors. I tried an electric shaver. I tried every technique anybody ever recommended until I read about safety razors and how they were basically the magic trick for people in my situation. Sure enough, they are right. Even from my first shave I could tell the difference. It wasn&#x27;t a perfect shave but I didn&#x27;t kill my face and I had almost no razor burn. I keep a wraparound and used the Fusion 5 to shave around it to avoid accidentally chopping out part of it with the safety razor and realized how much pressure I had to put on the cartridge razor to get even close to the shave I got with the safety razor with very little pressure. I assume that was the cause of all that razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m able to shave daily without being in pain. I plan on using the last few cartridges for the Fusion for when I travel and for trimming certain body parts. Once I run out I&#x27;m going to buy a package of cheap disposables for those purposes. Definitely happy with the Merkur razor. Everything else in the kit is good quality as well.</li>
            <li> Very happy was present for boyfriend he love the razor and was very surprised the lather bar or soap whichever you wanna call it I got another one of those he didn&#x27;t like that but was great the rest of it worth the price</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my boyfriend and he loves it. It has stayed rust free. It&#x27;s heavy and sturdy, great construction. The blade that comes with this is awesome. My boyfriend bought other blades and they work fine, but they didn&#x27;t provide as smooth of a shave as the Gilette razor that this came with. I would recommend sticking with the razor that the set comes with for the best shave. He normally has to shave every morning, as his facial hair grows like weeds, but this set and razor gets his shave close enough to have him last a day and a half, and also stopped the problems he was having with ingrown hairs. He was really scared to wet shave the first time, after hearing horror stories of cuts, but he experienced no cuts on his first try or the ones following. Maybe this is a praise to his dexterity, but definitely don&#x27;t be deterred by the new wet shaving experience.. Just be careful and take your time :)</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband&#x27;s 50th birthday. He had been considering a (much cheaper) product that was being advertised on TV. He loves anything old-timey, and he hates the way modern razors shave. I managed to get him to wait before he ordered anything so I could give him this set, and he LOVED it! He&#x27;s German and he over-engineers everything, so he really appreciates the Merkur quality. He hasn&#x27;t used it yet, because we&#x27;re remodeling the bathrooms and he doesn&#x27;t want his gorgeous new razor getting ruined. That means it&#x27;s a hit, and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll love it even more when he finally gets to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: He&#x27;s used the razor many times now, and he loves it more every time. It gives him a beautiful close shave and never clogs, like modern multi-blade razors do. If you&#x27;re on the fence, get it!! Just do it!</li>
            <li> I used disposables blades and canned foam for 20+ years and switched to electric about 9 years ago.  I tried expensive electric razors and &amp;#34;highly rated&amp;#34; less expensive razors.  Never got a decent shave with electric and frequently used a disposable blade to touch up spots where the electric just wouldn&#x27;t do the job.  I switched back to disposable a few months ago but this time with soap and brush.  While looking for &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; disposable blade, I came across a blog about safety razors.  After several days of research, I ordered this set.  I love it!  I&#x27;ve been using it a couple of weeks.  I&#x27;ve had very little trouble with nicks or cuts.  Actually, I&#x27;ve had fewer nicks and cuts than with the disposable blades.  I use a styptic pencil for the occasional nick.  I like the longer handle on this model because I think it gives me better control than I would have with a shorter handle. This set looks very nice and is well made.  The razor feels like a precision tool instead of the plastic toy feel with disposable razors.  I don&#x27;t have experience with other safety razors, but I am very pleased with this set and it is a much better shave than with disposable blades.</li>
            <li> Very well made, Heavy, and durable, a lifetime set that just keeps turning out quality shaves! Nice brush, and  the whole set is a class act!</li>
            <li> This is &#x27;da bomb!  I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product.  In some ways it&#x27;s a show piece as well.  The Merkur Safety Razor allows for a great  and close shave.</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with this product .  And that is all that matters to me .Thanks so much</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this -- he&#x27;ll never do an electric razor again</li>
            <li> The bowl is a little small and the brush is a little too big for the stand (at least in the one I received). However the soap is feels fantastic and smells great. The brush is excellent.  The razor has a great feel in the hand, with a good weight to it.</li>
            <li> My Dad taught me to shave with one of these types of razors decades ago.  I kept slicing myself up back then though so I went to disposable razors &amp; have used them ever since.  I shave my head &amp; face everyday for work &amp; the razor burn, ingrown hairs, &amp; blemishes were a nuisance.  I just received this today &amp; it&#x27;s absolutely amazing.  I just gave away almost $100 worth of disposable razor junk...excellent razor, &amp; closest shave ever!</li>
            <li> bought this for  christmas for my husband . He loves it  and says it really  makes a difference  fromthe other shavers he used .</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my husband, who had become really enamored with the idea of shaving with a safety razor. I was excited at how quickly it arrived, and how pretty the set was. Even better, the soap they send smells WONDERFUL! My husband has never had such a great shave, and his face feels  smoother than mine does afterwards! I really can&#x27;t support this product enough, my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> gave to my son-in-law as a Christmas gift, he currently uses an old safety razor, this was a pleasant surprise to get the Merkur razor, the gift set was complete with all the necessary items to get a great shave, would recommend this gift set.</li>
            <li> Solid, elegant product that made a perfect gift for my boss.  Shipping was fast and smooth and product arrived in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> I love the badger brush.  Its like shaving with a wild animal tail to spread your lather on your face. The price is high enough where you think you have something really nice. This is the second one I have bought.  This was a gift.  Watch out it is sharp. My 15 year old son recently started shaving to my surprise ( not his face but his manhood) I heard him yelling down the stairs for me to come up because he was bleeding.  So now he has his own set to shave with and I am keeping the new one.</li>
            <li> great product.the brush feels awesome on my face. very well finished chrome great ensemble.</li>
            <li> After years of cartridge shaving, decided to take the plunge and give DE shaving a try. I actually look forward to shaving now. Great kit that has everything you need to get started. Just watch out - you&#x27;re going to start buying more soaps and razors than you actually need, just to try it all!</li>
            <li> I ordered this gift for my husband. He&#x27;s always wanted a professional, stylish shaving stand and soap dish for years. When I received and opened it, I was impressed because I&#x27;m picky and like quality items. I really loved it!  I really believe he&#x27;s going to love it, also, and get many years of use. I know he&#x27;ll keep it out on display.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to disposable razors ever again. I have owned this set for almost a year now and have only gone through 2 col cronk&#x27;s shave soaps and 15 feather brand razors. Merkurs are nice but they pulled more then cut. DON&#x27;T BE AFRAID TO USE FEATHER BRAND BLADES. they are great and i still haven&#x27;t cut myself with a feather razor and i was new to wet shaving. I started off with a merkur blade and got my technique down (2 passes. 1 pass down, and the other pass across the grain. I don&#x27;t shave up.) Buy this set which i still have no complaints about, and buy a variety pack of col cronk&#x27;s shave soap, along with a 200ct pack of feather brand razors and you&#x27;ll have every bit of 2 years of shaving supplies, and still have another year or so of razors left.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend on his birthday he loves it! It&#x27;s a bit spendy but you get what you pay for.  The only complaint I have is the packaged arrived later that it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> The shaving gift set was perfect! Had been looking for something special for my dad and this was it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas 2012. He was very happy with it and the quality of the razor, brush and bowl. They still look great 2 years later and I think they have years of use left in them. He found the soap to be fine but now uses another brand. However the stand is of really bad quality and looked dinghy after a relatively short time with rust spots and the base kept coming loose so the whole thing was wobbly. I bought him a new stand. So over all this is a pretty good buy but just know that the stand will not look good or work well for as long as the other parts of the set.</li>
            <li> I love the razor. Two minor problems. Part of the stand that holds the razor was bent but I was able to bend it back into place and the glue holding the base to the cup wore out fairly quickly and won&#x27;t stick anymore. However, I&#x27;m still able to use it without the base.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far. The razor and brush work very well. I am a beginner to this type of shaving and it is a great starter set.</li>
            <li> This was a christmas gift and my Husband loves it, it was a real surprise to him, he collects old shaving sets. Its very beautiful.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail yesterday and it was purchased as a Christmas present. I opened the box and found the Brush. It felt pretty heavy. I pulled on the bristles to check it out and the it was pretty solid. The Rack looks well made and the Chrome is perfect. I unscrewed the Razor Handle and looked at the parts. Being in an industry that deal with mechanical design, this one looks very well built and the chrome on interior parts were as smooth as the outside. Looked good. I know that the simpler the design the longer it last as the easier the operation. This style razor meets that quality. The last time I had a Razor like this was 1978, or there about. The soap that came with this kit smelled refreshing and uniformly smooth matching the high quality of the whole set. The person getting this as a gift will enjoy a good shave I&#x27;m sure after spending a year in Africa.&lt;br /&gt;SSG, USA</li>
            <li> Only purchased this set because I was under the impression that the Merkur #178 sold by Col. Conk was the Merkur 34C HD.  It can be confusing and was hoping for the 34C hd, but all in all this is not a bad set.  The shave was great, the bowl could be a little larger, of course I do not use the provided soap.  I am still very pleased with the product, just know that you will not be getting the 34C HD, some pics can be confusing.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! He said each blade lasts for maybe 3-4 shaves and that there is a learning curve before u stop knicking yourself, but always gets a close shave!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day last year. Great gift. Looks super expensive. My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> love it... chrome is of good quality, so cleans up nice.</li>
            <li> my wife bought this for me  and this razor give me the closest shave i have ever had, and at a fraction of the cost of a cartridge razor. i will never go back to the Gillette fusion razor.</li>
            <li> The stand, razor and bowl all seem very nice. However my boyfriend has not gotten a chance to use them because he did not receive the shaving brush that was suppose to come with the set. I realized this on Christmas when he opened the set. I was very upset. I sent out emails to Amazon and the people who sell the item but got no response from either. :( I guess I will have to suck it up and buy him a brush.</li>
            <li> This item arrived as promised and I still hear how it made a wonderful gift for the holidays. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good quality products that seem built to last. This is my first safety razor and i will never be going back to disposable razors. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This has revolutionized my morning (and sometimes evening) routine by enabling me to get a much closer shave quite a bit faster plus saves money both in blades and in shaving cream (that one soap block that came with this set will probably last me at least 6 months).  Plus the razor and set themselves look great and exude quality!  No plastic junk here... this is a precision instrument!&lt;br /&gt;Sure I cut myself when starting out but learned the correct way to use it very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Twist the brush around when you swirl it through the soap to work up a better lather nice and fast.&lt;br /&gt;The blade angle is \\&quot;a feel for it\\&quot; you&#x27;ll learn.&lt;br /&gt;NEVER going back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This proves it... again.  Research EVERYTHING because majority \\&quot;opinion\\&quot; counts for nothing.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift! The person loves it. The only issue we both have is there are no instructions on how to use it shaving. That would&#x27;ve been great to have to shave better &amp; have a better shaving experience from using it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Hubby loved it!</li>
            <li> His face is sooo smooth &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;I got this as part of a set for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the first package was lost in the mail but the vendor resent it.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it!</li>
            <li> I love it! No more razor burn! Amazing to have you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend. It&#x27;s a beautiful set and he loves the close shave he gets with it. It came with everything he needed to get started which was a huge selling point for me!</li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase.  However, replacing the blade requires taking the unit apart vice simply turning the handle used in other models.</li>
            <li> Everything is great in the set except the brush. The head fell of within a few uses.</li>
            <li> I am choosing this rating not because it&#x27;s a bad product, but I wish there was more blades for this. The company only gave us one sample blade. But I enjoy this product because when I got it for my fiance it was for his face and a christmas gift but he couldnt wait til christmas to open the product and when he shaved his face, His face was as smooth as a baby butts.</li>
            <li> Excelent product and service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally new to DE shaving because I haven&#x27;t really shaved in let&#x27;s say 4 or 5 years. My skin just couldn&#x27;t handle it, so I&#x27;d get bumps and ingrown hairs and razor burn, so I decided to just keep a short beard. My hair is so thick and coarse that I still get ingrown hairs and irritation with no shaving. I even got some laser hair removal on my neck. So believe me, I&#x27;m no stranger to getting irritation from shaving. And that&#x27;s why I decided to get into the DE shaving crowd, and this seemed like a great place to start. Well, now that I&#x27;ve bought it, I can confidently say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur razor it comes with is good, but be aware that it&#x27;s a short handle. If you want a long handle, buy separate. Or even buy separate anyway and get the same thing, but you&#x27;ll have choices and save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush it comes with seems totally fine. I don&#x27;t have much experience with shaving brushes, so this works for me. Bristles? Check. A handle? Check. Feels good when I lather my face? Check. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is pretty crucial to me because I just wouldn&#x27;t want the brush or the razor touching the counter. Keep your equipment clean! The bowl is nice too but like I said, I&#x27;m new to all this, so I&#x27;m still getting the hang of even using a bowl to make the lather. Is there an advantage to using the bowl instead of putting it directly on my face? I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap isn&#x27;t anything special, and that&#x27;s why you&#x27;d may as well abandon this gift set and buy it all separate. It doesn&#x27;t come with aftershave or an astringent or a pre-shave cream or anything like that, which I need because my skin is so prone to razor burn, bumps, ingrown hairs, etc. So I had to buy all that separate anyway. But again, the soap isn&#x27;t anything special, and I&#x27;m already going to just buy some Proraso soap and pre-shave cream to replace the soap that comes with this set, so again, the set just seems pointless to me beyond giving a newbie like myself an idea of some of the stuff I need to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of this stuff is bad; I actually really like everything on display (with the exception of the soap which is just OK and I&#x27;m excited to try the Proraso soap), but it leaves out so much stuff that you can&#x27;t just buy this kit and assume everything is taken care of, and that defeats the point of it to me. I could&#x27;ve bought the same razor, the same stand, the same brush all separate. The soap you should just upgrade immediately to something exceptional instead of ordinary, and you&#x27;ll be buying all the extra creams and aftershaves and such separately anyway, so why bother on the kit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, wait, now that I think about it, there *is* something I don&#x27;t like that came with it: the actual blade. It comes with one sample blade, and it&#x27;s a Merkur, and it&#x27;s not sharp enough for my beard hair, so my first shave, I ended up putting too much pressure on and cut myself a couple times. I&#x27;d heard so much about how with DE razors you aren&#x27;t supposed to press on it at all, that the blade will do all the work and cut through like butter, that I couldn&#x27;t help but be worried that it wasn&#x27;t doing that with this blade. That&#x27;s why I put pressure on. Not much, but still. I just bought some Feather blades because I hear they&#x27;re way sharper, which I need for my hair. I&#x27;ll just be extra careful when using them. But basically, the blade that comes with it is not that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, it&#x27;s not a *bad* product by any stretch of the imagination, but I just think you&#x27;re better off using it as a basic template of stuff you should get, then assembling it all yourself: a Merkur blade, a nice stand, a brush, some Proraso soap and cream, Baxter of California aftershave balm, Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel, and some quality, sharp blades like Feathers.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for this product. I bought this for my husband and he will never use a disposable. He loves the close shave and will never use any other razor but Merkur from Amazon. Thank you so much! Seller had this at our home way  before the date estimated.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving set so I don&#x27;t know better but I think it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve seen complaints about the bowl being too small; it might be a tad but too small but you can still get a decent lather going in it. The brush is eh when creating a lather and is why I knocked it down a star but that&#x27;s probably due to my lack of experience. Razor is great and the stand is very convenient. Overall, a very solid product.</li>
            <li> My 30-year old son loved it! He watched You-Tube videos on perfecting the process and he loves his shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Now my other son wants one too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in using an old-school double edged safety razor for a few months, now. I originally began piecing together all the items separately, but thought otherwise when I saw this set. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money, only to discover I hated this type of shaving. I figured if I didn&#x27;t like it; I would only be out a little over $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this set. I&#x27;m sure more experienced wet-shavers would turn their nose down at this, preferring higher quality (and price) items. But, for a newbie; this set is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the items appear to be made of good quality materials. I thought the stand was going to be flimsy, and possibly topple over when holding the razor and brush, but to my amazement; it is very, very sturdy. The brush handle is also very heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: (1) The bowl is way too small. It serves it&#x27;s purpose, but I am constantly overflowing the lather over the sides. (2) I am losing about 2-3 bristles on the badger brush with every shave, but maybe this is normal. (3) It comes with only one blade. I think this set should include at least 5-10 blades, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the Col Conk shaving soap that is included. Instead, I use a pre shave, and shaving cream by Proraso.  I finish with Pinaud Clubman aftershave. For blades, I use Personna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall; I believe this would be perfect for any beginner, and would be a wonderful gift to give to your husband, boyfriend, father, bearded lady sideshow freak, etc.</li>
            <li> First time buying this type of shaver and I love it! I would recommend to any one interested in buying</li>
            <li> Set looks wonderful!  Great idea for that special man in your life.  Very pleased with this set.  Also company was very helpful ... And shioped promptly..</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband, he loves it.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. It looks great, shaves very well, and the soap lasts FOREVER (and smells great!). I ordered an additional soap four pack and 100 blades with this set and I&#x27;m fairly confident that he&#x27;ll be set for the next five years. This set makes a really good gift for someone you love!</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected and is a very good product.  No problems with the brush or the razor.</li>
            <li> This set will let you enjoy shaving.  It&#x27;s a ritual to be completed as you pamper your face into a silky-smooth work of art.  Remember to shave to reduce hair, not remove completely with a single stroke.  Takes longer than the eight-bladed monstrosities pushed by the television, but the difference is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying a couple of styptic pencils to stop the inevitable bleeding.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and beautiful aesthetic design. This is a perfect shaving set.</li>
            <li> The product information indicates the set has a Merkur 178, it doesn&#x27;t. It contains a Merkur 180. The Merkur 178 is a shorter handle and only the very top of the razor housing comes off, making it much easier to replace blades. The Merkur 180 is a long handle and both the top and bottom pieces which hold the blade in place come off, making it a bit more difficult to replace blades. Additionally, the Merkur 180 is around $33, the 178 is around $44. You can probably get all the components for less than the total kit if you shop around a bit.</li>
            <li> My son gave this, along with a case to carry the razor, to my husband for Christmas.  Just enough old world barber shop charm, without bringing on the flat edged blade!  The soap lathers well, and he gets a nice, close shave.  Great as a gift, as the set is complete.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my husband.  He loves it.  Very close shave, Nice set!  Everything he needs in an easy-to-use arrangement!</li>
            <li> Good high quality items across the board.  I have had this item for a couple of months now under heavy use and it has held up without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent wet shave starter kit.</li>
            <li> after almost a year shaving every day with this set , i recommended too every one, it even make my skin softer</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my Dad. It was advertised as sold by Simply Beautiful, but once in my cart, it said &amp;#34;sold by DB Roth.  It arrived missing the shaving brush.  After 3.5 weeks of back and forth emails to DB Roth, and an &amp;#34;out of the blue&amp;#34; email from Simply Beautiful stating they have nothing to do with this, I was finally told the item was out of stock (wasn&#x27;t this a kit?) and I have to contact Amazon for a refund.  So my Dad has an incomplete gift, I had to initiate every communication with customer service to get a resolution, and the resolution is unacceptable.  Amazon needs to dump this 3rd party vendor!!</li>
            <li> the set is great, but i didn&#x27;t receive a blade with the razor. kind of disappointing since it was a gift set to someone.</li>
            <li> Great set-up. Over time I have saved a lot of money not buying $15 replacement heads from other companies. This offers a great shave at a fraction of the cost. Only difference is, it isn&#x27;t as close on the first swipe which is too be expected. Other heads have three blades or more, so if you go over the same spot 3 times I&#x27;m sure it would be comparable. Very happy with the experience and will continue to use this product daily. Blades last about 3-4 weeks dependent on thickness of hair. Tip: Don&#x27;t try and save money on the cheap replacement blades, spend the extra 50 cents per blade and get the nicer ones, they make all the difference on your face and also last longer.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my son.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> In short:&lt;br /&gt;As the headline says, the razor is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave the whole thing 4 stars because the rest of the set is not very useful to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More detail:&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE using this type of razor now after coming from the old disposable type.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick facial hair, and this thing still works great.&lt;br /&gt;You buy replacement blades anywhere (Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, etc), they are so much cheaper, and they last much longer. Seriously, I can keep the same blade in my razor for maybe a month (shaving at least 5 days a week). Craziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the other things this set comes with, they look really good, old fashioned and manly, but I find I just keep my razor in the shower and don&#x27;t use the rest. I tried the soap that came with this, plus other versions of this style of soap, and could never get the lather like it felt right (not thick enough for me). So, I just went back to using some Gillette gel along with the razor shown here, and I&#x27;m completely satisfied. Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck finding the right soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The badger hair brush feels great, but again, I just don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try out this style of shaving, go for it; you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;Just maybe buy the razor by itself and any pack of blades will do.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> We bought this set for my husband&#x27;s dad. It&#x27;s nicer than the set we have for ourselves. The badger bristle brush is gorgeous. Everything in the set matches great and are all a heavy metal chrome-plated-like material. The merkur razors are the best, of course. The soap we got was the lime, which smells nicer than you&#x27;d think. It was a great deal for the money; better than anything else I saw. I can&#x27;t wait to see him open it on Christmas!</li>
            <li> Badger brush is not quite the quality I was expecting but everything else in the set is perfect for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son for Christmas. He changed to this from an electric razor. He really likes it…sid it gives a nice clean shave</li>
            <li> My son got this and he loves it ! The razor is heavy feels substantial.  This set makes you feel like a genteel man from another time.</li>
            <li> All pieces were exactly as advertised, and better quality than expected. My mate and I are both extremely happy with this set. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My husband loved this set.  It was an expensive looking set.  Well made. Would recommend this. He uses it everyday. It arrived on time before Christmas so I was glad for the on time delivery.</li>
            <li> He loved it. He said he was waiting to get himself one. So far, he says the shave is great. He looks forward to shaving in the morning and it all sits neatly on the counter. I&#x27;d say you should get aftershave and extra razors if you get this kit. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The stand is nice and heavy, the flat plate to hold the brush and razor is a little flimsy, the razor is a little on the cheap side, the brush is beginning to loose some hairs already. The soap is not too bad while the soap bowl is very nice. The razor blades are of good quality and keeps its edge and sharpness.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set for my dad for his birthday.  He loved it!  It has everything one would need to start shaving with a DE safety razor except the blades (I had a bunch from a variety pack I previously ordered).  I highly recommend this for anyone interested in getting into DE wet shaving.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this set. However, he said the shaving cream doesn&#x27;t lather really good.</li>
            <li> Gift for my husband.  He enjoys the close shave.</li>
            <li> After about a year of near daily use, the base of the bowl broke off. Other than that, the item performs well.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this and i am happy that he is happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought the 25 FEATHER BLUEBIRD ASTRA SHARK LORD DERBY BIC NACET Blade Sampler because this kit only comes with one blade. both products are amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves his set! Very sturdy, good quality!</li>
            <li> Great gift set! I&#x27;ve bought several of these and every guy I give them to loves it!</li>
            <li> Just as described and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He can&#x27;t get over how close of a shave he gets with this shaving  kit ! German engineering at its finest!</li>
            <li> I am in the military and have thick facial hair. That being said, it is important for me to have a nice, clean shaved face 5-6 days out of the week. After reading the reviews on safety razors I decided to put the multi-razor heads aside and purchased this kit for myself. At first I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with it until I finally learned how to use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have gotten the hang of it, and not finishing with cuts here and there, I think its awesome. Its the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and doesn&#x27;t leave razor burn like the fuzion that I was using previously. The kit may seem a little pricey, but considering that you can purchase a hundred double edge blades for around 10 dollars really helps eliminate the chance of buyers remorse. Especially when it costs 10-14 dollars for a set of 3 replacement fuzion heads that only last about a week and a half per.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do suggest Googling \\&quot;how to shave w/ a safety razor\\&quot; to spare yourself and your skin the torture I went through in the beginning, lol.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about a month now and feel after some practice, I get a better shave with this razor vs. Mach3.</li>
            <li> This set needs to be returned as soon as possible. This was a gift for my husband and he doesn&#x27;t use these kind of razors anymore because they cause razor bumps and don&#x27;t cut close enough. Please let me know what to do to return these items.</li>
            <li> The set is very handsome; my husband was impressed with the appearance as well.  The brush and safety razor are very well made; their weight confirms the quality of craftsmanship.  My husband liked the soap.  Other have complained about it being much like a &amp;#34;cheap glycerin soap&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not.  The soap is very appropriate for this type of shaving and lathers well in the bowl with the brush.  I would recommend this item to anyone. It&#x27;s worth the price; after all, holding a razor to one&#x27;s face on a daily basis is not something to take lightly. Plus, it looks very classy in our bathroom unlike the other shaving apparatuses he had in the past.</li>
            <li> Very nice. My guy loves it. I would have liked the lather bowl to be a bit heavier so I gave it a 4 rather than a 5. Good quality brush and razor. My guy hasn&#x27;t used it yet but sure he&#x27;ll be shaving happy!</li>
            <li> I received this safety razor shaving kit for Christmas along with a styptic pencil to help with the shaving nicks that my wife was sure I would inevitably receive due to never having used an &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; safety razor before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best Christmas gifts I&#x27;ve ever received. The only time I&#x27;ve ever had a shave this close was by a professional barber with a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit came complete with Merkur safety razor, badger tail shaving brush, soap, bowl and razor/brush holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, still haven&#x27;t had to open the styptic pencil.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy shaving with this set. It is a fine set and a must to have for men tired of shaving with cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I love the play pen. I actually bought it for my Chihuahuas.  During these cold spell we are having in Florida, my little guys are not use to it.  I keep them outside in a really nice area and they are spoiled.  So now when it gets cold or I don&#x27;t want them running around I put them in the Play Pen and they just love it.  Its sturdy and easy to set up or take down. Really glad I bought it.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect gift for my husband, as I was told I hit a homerun.  It was beautiful and well received.  The only mistake I made was I didn&#x27;t give enough time for it to arrive on time.  I asked him for the rating on this item and he gives it five stars.  I look forward to seeing what other items I might be able to purchase from this company.  Just give yourself time to receive (about 2-3 weeks).</li>
            <li> Received this as a Winter Holiday gift from my father.  I had a Merkur Double Edge razor on my wish list, but this went over and above!  Here is my opinion of the component items of the gift pack:  Razor:  I got a Merkur 180 (long) which is just what I wanted.  Excellent quality, very grippable, even with wet soapy hands.  Great size for me.  I am a 6&#x27;1\\&quot; big bear of a man with big ol&#x27; ham hands, and the razor performs well; doesn&#x27;t get lost in my grip as some things have a tendency to do.  Could not do better as far as the razor goes, at any cost.  Exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush works pretty darn well. It picks up soap well, but needs a bit of high-speed whipping to work it into a lather in the included shaving mug/bowl. Col. Conk glycerin soap is an inexpensive staple: even my straight-razor wielding buddy keeps coming back to it, and I must agree.  Decent lather production, great price.  I got the 3-pack of Col. Conk Almond, which is a nice subtle smell.  In the future, I&#x27;ll add bay rum or some sandalwood from Taylor of Old Bond St.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving mug works well, but the chrome keeps throwing me for a loop.  My hindbrain is expecting a ceramic bowl in which to build lather, but this is perfectly satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things I plan to upgrade are:  adding a silvertip badger brush, some alternate shave soaps (as mentioned) and perhaps a nice container in which to keep the current shaving soap.  It&#x27;s perfectly fine in the plastic in which it ships, but a nice wooden bowl would look classier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was delighted to receive this as a gift. My first double-edge shave was more comfortable than any 2- 3- 4- or 5-blade disposable shave I&#x27;ve tried (and yes, I have tried them all.)  I expected some discomfort and cuts the first time, but there was nothing!  Just pure smooth shave!  Now, after several shaves, I&#x27;d recommend the 2- or 3-pass system (go with the grain on the first pass, across the grain on the 2nd and against the grain on the 3rd for difficult areas, under the chin, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add some Ogallala bay rum aftershave, and you&#x27;ve got a wonderful gift for an \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; man, or a younger gent looking to upgrade his personal habits in a classy and time-tested way.  Definitely a gift which I was happy to receive, and would recommend for anyone willing to take the time for a good wet shave.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect gift! My boyfriend absolutely loves this set! All high quality and ready to use right out of the box. Well packaged and fast shipping. I also paired it with an Art of Shaving starter set in Sandlewood, I really love this sent on him :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a little over a year later and this set is still as great as ever! No rusting or tarnish to any of the pieces. Brush still has good use out of it will probably look to replace it within another year or so. The blade it came with worked great but it took my boyfriend a couple trys to find the perfect refills that worked for his skin/hair type. In the end, more than satisfied with this purchase. I think I&#x27;ll buy one for my dad next.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this set and it has nice quality; however, I am disappointed because they as per as their advertisement I should get Merkur Classic Safety Razor #178, but I got Merkuer 180 Long.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware when ordering.</li>
            <li> Great product, great doing bussiness with you, I&#x27;ll highly recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaving set I bought him for our anniversary! We use to buy the 3-blade expensive razors and decide to go back old school. My dad always used a single blade razor with brush and soap, when I was growing up as a kid and never had issues while shaving or the expense of razors today!. One of the best things that has happened since my husband started using the single blade razor is that he doesn&#x27;t wake me up in the morning banging the 3-blade razor against the sink to get the soap &amp; whiskers out of it!! He just runs it under the water to gently clean the blade! No more expensive 3-blade razors for us!!</li>
            <li> excellent razor,brush, and bowl.</li>
            <li> Love the blade and the stand. The brush and the bowl are alright. Wish the bowl was bigger. Otherwise is decent starter set.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my son&#x27;s sixteenth birthday.  It is heavy, well made and attractive.  He enjoys using the set.</li>
            <li> Gave this razor set as a gift.  Gentlemen receiving it really enjoys using it.  Priced similar item in shaving store and was a lot more expensive.  Good quality, nice product.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is well, it was comfortable to use and stable. However, it is necessary to be stored carefully to rust after use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas- he absolutely loves it! It&#x27;s a beautiful set I&#x27;d highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This is a great starter kit, or shaving kit for the seasoned shaver. The Merkur razor is a fabulous razor that shaves nice and close. The badger brush is soft and makes a nice foam. The shaving soap is quality. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Received set last Tuesday.  First use of the Badger Brush the hairs started falling out.  Had it now less than a week and the brush is in full shedding mode.  Hairs come out in your shave cream and causes cuts and injury.  Contacted vendor for replacement and waiting for a positive response.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful shaving set and my son loves it. His shaving is close and nick free. Overall, a great gift that looks fabulous in his bathroom and he is enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my son and step son for Christmas and they love them.  Perfect gift for the young adult men in your life.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend after doing a lot of research on the different safety razors that are available. I chose this one because I liked the classic look and it came with the stand to hold the razor and brush, and the bowl for the shaving soap. I was very pleased when it arrived and he was excited to open it. It now sits on the bathroom counter looking great, and he uses it all the time. The blades are so much cheaper than modern ones too!</li>
            <li> I have a beard tough enough for a bush hog, with skin that is very sensitive.  After years of paying for expensive, disposable, 5 blade razors, I am now hooked on this safety razor.  I can shave daily without razor burn.  I can even splash on the aftershave after 5 days without jumping through the ceiling.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this set. Unfortunately after a month and a half the head of the razor broke off. It happened after the return window so now he has no razor if we don&#x27;t buy a new one. Not impressed by the quality.</li>
            <li> Hubby asked for this for his birthday. Actually printed the page! I joined Amazon Prime to get a discount. He reports every day about his shaving experience. &amp;#34;Blood letting&amp;#34; is decreasing every day. He&#x27;s fascinated!</li>
            <li> First of all I love the razor. The soap disappeared within two weeks. The brush is  a real disappointment. I&#x27;ve had the brush about two months and hairs keep falling off and sticking to my face. The brush is about half the size of when I bought it. Starting to look for a replacement brush.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a single blade safety razor.  This model feels great in the hand-- It&#x27;s nice and heavy.  The shaving cream bowl is nice with a firm feeling as is the brush.  All top notch in construction.  This feels as though this may last for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a couple issues.  I personally don&#x27;t care for the included soap, but that&#x27;s just my preference.  How you replace the blade is the one thing I don&#x27;t like about this.  To replace blades, you have to unscrew the top and separate it from the handle.  This means you have to grip it from the smaller sides of the blade head and not the longer (there&#x27;s a blade there dummy).  Just something to be aware of the first time you grab the top to remove the blade.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.  The best shave I have ever had!</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving kit. Old School Cool</li>
            <li> Wonderful product as described, but I would get a better shave soap next time.</li>
            <li> brush, lovely, razor... great. Soap.. fine..... missing the extra razors and stand from the order... sad as it was a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> This set is very attractive and cleans very well.  Initially I was worried about water spotting but the finish returns to mirror quality with just a towel wipe-down.  The brush is perfect texture for even application and coverage.  I tried using the shave soap it came with initially but switched back to a creme as the soap was not working well with my skin type.  Lastly, the razor is fantastic in both form and function.  I have been using feather blades and once I was used to the feel of this tool I&#x27;ve had the best shaves of my life.</li>
            <li> Razor is still my favorite.  The stand is ok.  Parker makes a better brush.  I like Col. Conk soaps too.  The bowl looks good but seems too deep for mixing a good lather IMO.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby and he can&#x27;t stop raving about this. He said it the best gift!  Shaves great with one swipe. He recommends me to try it out. The only downside it only comes with one blade so order your additional blades.  4👍up.</li>
            <li> Awesome set for the guy who loves old school ways. The razor and the bowl are just so classic and they really look nice. Plus the stainless makes them perfect for keeping in the shower if needed. Love the kit</li>
            <li> A great alternative to modern day razors.  Great design and look.</li>
            <li> This was by far my boyfriends favorite Christmas gift and he tells me all of the time. Great starting kit for beginners!</li>
            <li> This extra length razor is a bit heavy and not as nimble as I&#x27;d like, I should have gotten the regular length.  The stand is nice and classy.  The soap doesn&#x27;t foam up much and does not lubricate as well as gel.  The razor clogs up with hair like my cheap disposable razor.  It takes a few more minutes to use a safety razor system.</li>
            <li> bought it for my husband he loves it</li>
            <li> Bought it for my hubs and he loves it. We got the lime glycerin soap with it &amp; it reminds us of jello. Haven&#x27;t tried the soap yet but everything else is pretty awesome!</li>
            <li> The man of my life was reminiscing about watching his father shave while he was a boy.  Aha!!  Note to self--a wonderful Christmas present to my beloved!  A very rich, sophisticated set, I was very pleased with this purchase.  And the man?  Tears in his eyes as he immediately went to the master bath to set up his shaving set, and shave the way &amp;#34;my dad did&amp;#34;  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves this thing!!</li>
            <li> Over all I like the items that came with this set. I have had it for around a year now and here is the breakdown.&lt;br /&gt;  Brush: Got rid of it after 3 months. It started shedding hairs in the shaving soap month 2&lt;br /&gt;  Stand: Looks good hard to keep it clean though, I stopped using it after 4 months. I find that blades last longer if you take the razor apart and dry the blade.&lt;br /&gt;  Bowl: Love the bowl, durable, perfect size, use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;  Handle: Super easy to assemble and disassemble. Diamond pattern in handle makes it easy to keep a good grip on.&lt;br /&gt;  Soap: Ehhhh pretty much sums up my opinion of this, not a great soap not a bad soap.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Perfect as a starter set. But once you get used to shaving with the razor you will probably replace the brush and soap.</li>
            <li> I love the Merkur safety razor. For me, it seems to do smoother shave than today&#x27;s &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; shaving tools.&lt;br /&gt;Before, shaving has been one task needed to complete. Now, it&#x27;s kind of exciting activities in preparation for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Love the sound Merkur makes when going through facial hair.</li>
            <li> Great kit for a starter or gift.  I got this for my brother and he loves it.  You save so much money using a safety razor over those ridiculous 6-bladed, battery-operated, pieces of crap and you get a closer shave to boot.  This set is nice with real badger brush and a nice substantial feel to the razor.  I definitely recommend for anyone who shaves above the shoulders.</li>
            <li> This came on a sunday which I didn&#x27;t know USPS delivered on sunday! I use this for trimming my beard. Great size and weight for this task. I am still a little scared because this is my first safety razor, but my sink didn&#x27;t look like a murder scene when I got done so I chalked it up as a win. The one thing that would be awesome is if they gave directions for soup mixture and basic use of the razor for nubes like me. It looks elagent on my bathroom sink, I feel so classy! haha Going to get a couple as gifts I think any man would love this. I do recommend putting coconut oil or grape seed oil on first. I have parasso for thick beards and without the oil it was twice as rough. Coconut oil is the fix to everything. If you are thinking about this purchase do it! I was hesitant after doing a lot of research, but I was not let down at all. Even as a newbie to this whole think</li>
            <li> Bought it for my fianc&amp;eacute; for our anniversary, he loves it! It&#x27;s his first time shaving with this type of razor, and he says it&#x27;s easy and he hasn&#x27;t cut himself yet!</li>
            <li> Great shaving kit for new shaver! The soap lathers up nicely and changing the blade is very easy. After about 30 uses the brush is still in excellant condition.</li>
            <li> Stand, brush, and soap dish all have a nice polished stainless finish.  The razor looks like blue zinc, and doesn&#x27;t match at all.  Still trying different blades, hoping to find a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby and it works amazing!  Never before has he had such a nice smooth and clean shave! And the refills are so inexpensive, it pays for itself really quick.  Never again will he ever use a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Okay,  I just finished my first shave with this set,  needless to say I&#x27;m breathless.  First let me shine some light on this.  I&#x27;ve heard people claim theses razors are too dangerous; all blades are dangerous but this razor is worth every penny.  The razor nicked me once but I&#x27;ve had traditional razors nick me more and far worse. A little YouTube goes a long way learning how to use these so I&#x27;m not gunna go into details about how to use this. The first shave took some time,  however it was pretty fun believe it or not.  For now I&#x27;ll be using it at night before I add it to my early morning routine.  But I digress,  I noticed that if you listen to your razor it will give you hints such as the blade will stop gliding once you need to apply more shaving cream and will move the cream around if you don&#x27;t have the proper angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to give you some other information to you guys.  I&#x27;m in the military and I take pride in my appearance because people look at us as the best,  and I take it to heart to live up to that.  Obviously the first step is to look the part.  I can honestly say this razor is a huge step forward for me.  I&#x27;ve never had a shave this close before in my life.  Furthermore,  I have extremely sensitive skin,  also from my job I get bad acne,  ingrown hairs and small scrapes on my face from doing various things.  The razor simply slid across everything,  even against the grain!  It was like magic!  No irritation,  no serious scrapes nothing!  Shaving actually felt good and was fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the brush did have a bit of a weird smell,  due to the fact it&#x27;s made from animal hair.  But the brush felt great on my skin and the shave soap left a pleasant smell on my face.  The smell wasn&#x27;t one I personally enjoy but it is a decent product. It had a good lather and didn&#x27;t take long to set up and put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,  I was a bit worried the set wouldn&#x27;t match very well because chrome and all materials have various finishes,  however this set looks perfect together and as you touch each piece of the set in feels natural in your hands and clean up is very easy,  just a simple rinse and you&#x27;re done no water stains or anything.  The handle on the razor has an excellent grip as well as the brush. You honestly can&#x27;t put a price on this experience,  every man should own one of these.s set looks perfect together and as you touch each piece of the set in feels natural in your hands and clean up is very easy,  just a simple rinse and you&#x27;re done no water stains or anything.

            <li> Just received my shaving set and love it. I priced all of these items separately and could not beat the price. I just had my first shave and with it and it is an experience, and a great one. I watched several videos on how to properly shave with a safety razor and believe me it is not as hard as you think. No nicks or cuts! I made the initial shave, rinsed lathered up again and made a second pass and am baby smooth. A much closer shave than my old Tripel blade. I would deffinately reccomend.</li>
            <li> Good value. Great quality.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loves it. I would defiinately recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s thinking of trying a safety razor. Not to mention that its going to be nice that I won&#x27;t be spending $20-30 on replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Good product. Good price. It isn&#x27;t quite as nice as some of the more expensive items, but for a classy guy on a tight budget this is perfect</li>
            <li> I wished this set held up, when you goto shave the single blade gets stopped up very easy making shaving take longer...</li>
