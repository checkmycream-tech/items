            <li>this is a nice lotion that&#x27;s not too greasy.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice, light smell that isn&#x27;t feminine or overpowering.</li>
            <li>There is no oily feeling whatsoever, as both soak right in and the smell is incredible - clean, fresh without being too girly, and a wonderful basis for any perfume I have.  </li>
            <li>These potentially hazardous ingredients completely ruin an otherwise great product!  </li>
            <li>A nice, light lotion, good scent, and not greasy.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this has a very strong odor.</li>
            <li>I had tried a sample of this lotion and really liked that it is very lightly scented.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best body lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best lotion I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>It is good for light moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This lotion is a pure dream, it feels wonderful on after a bath or a shower and goes on in a light layer that hydrates the skin, making it feel silky and elastic.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light and disappears so it doesn&#x27;t clash with your fragrance.  </li>

            <li>The scent is very light also.</li>

            <li>and it pares nicely with the light sesame oil</li>

            <li>I buy this regularly - a better deal when bought in this quantity.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.</li>
            <li>I love the silky feel it gives to your skin.</li>
            <li>I do like the oil better than the lotion, however.</li>
            <li>I love this body lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the way it works</li>
            <li>and I love its size.</li>
            <li>you ...... will ........... love ..........</li>
            <li>It has a clean light fragrance and the large size is an excellent value.  </li>
            <li>scent is nice too - just a nice, clean, light, gender-neutral scent.  </li>
            <li>like wow this is so good!</li>
            <li>the more wonderful it is, the cure for dry hair and scalp and skin conditions as it&#x27;s even said to penetrate to the bone marrow as it helps toxins pass, it&#x27;s literally a miracle product.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, it&#x27;s so light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, it&#x27;s so light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent lotion for dry skin and this gigantic bottle is a great way to never run out unexpectedly.</li>
            <li>Love the light smell and feel with this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love the light sesame fragrance, just like the oil version.  </li>
            <li>he would bring me all the samples from the NEUTROGENA  sales person  and wow great stuff .</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>This goes on, feels great, but it feels natural rather than like you have a lotion on.</li>
            <li>Love the light scent and texture.</li>
            <li>This Neutrogena Body Lotion is the best, and I was lucky enough to discover it on  Amazon.</li>
            <li>also it really has almost no scent, so if your sensitive to scents this lotion is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite \\&quot;go to\\&quot; lotion that is never greasy and smells delicious without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would have considerd using these products this way because I thought it might be too much; but I liked it even better than either alone.</li>
            <li>The pump makes it easy to dispense too.</li>
            <li>It has an easy to use spout nozzle.</li>
            <li>But, most important of all, it works to soften and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Love the light consistency...glides on smoothly and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>My wife liked this product very much.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is very light, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>its good to normal skin or oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product for dry skin; and the value is unbeatable.  </li>
            <li>For a body lotion it is fine, but I am still looking for the neutrogena  hand cream</li>
            <li>the smell though its the soft pleasant smell everyone described.</li>
            <li>But there is a huge BUT.</li>
            <li>I even bought a huge bottle for my dad, the person from whom I inherited my skin issues.</li>
            <li>This light sesame formula is the newer of the body lotion formulas.  </li>
            <li>The cream version did not disappoint, it was light to apply, and without the stickiness, you can feel your hands are smoother.  </li>
            <li>light smell and not greasy at all</li>
            <li>In the winter when I am drier, I use the coordinating Light Seame Oil in the shower and then touch up with this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try a combo of the Neutrogena body oil followed by the Neutrogena Body Lotion, Light Sesame Formula because of C. Greer&#x27;s review  about layering these products after bathing.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000EBAHHG Neutrogena Body Lotion, Light Sesame Formula,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light , never feels greasy.</li>
            <li>After shower leave your skin silky smooth and it locks in the moisture in your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to find the bigger bottle on amazon.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best body lotion especially when paired up with the Neutrogena Body Lotion, Light Sesame Formula.  </li>
            <li>If you do the same, you can have this great product at a savings over buying it retail.</li>
            <li>lotion is so &#x27;light&#x27; that it is like not putting any lotion at all.  </li>
            <li>It is light and moisturizing, and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>When I forget to throw the Neutrogena Body Oil Light Sesame Formula on after bathing, this lotion fits the bill for that error.</li>
            <li>It smells cheap and almost like a granny scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this lotion, but haven&#x27;t been able to find this 32 oz size in local stores.  </li>
            <li>It is a very light lotion and not greasy, which was exactly what I wanted for my face.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend catching your Neutrogena products through Amazon and save the search of stores around your area.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic lotion at any price/size, but this special 32 oz.</li>
            <li>maybe next year when this one runs out :P</li>
            <li>IT goes on lightweight and smells fresh!</li>
            <li>Feels clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>The old formula had a nice light scent which I miss.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft with a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion for seasons when the air is dry.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and really helps with the itching that we have during the winter months.</li>
            <li>This large bottle is in my bathroom... love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice too with  a soft scent.</li>
            <li>Wow is this lotion nice.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too with&lt;br /&gt;a soft scent.</li>
            <li>Nice soft skin, without that greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, smells heavenly and makes your skin ever so soft.  </li>
            <li>have a drawer full of scented lotions and gift basket rejects from specialty bath stores -  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the way my skin feels but the smell is just too much.</li>
            <li>love the feeling of pampering myself and the scent is nice for its not overwhelming but will make you feel clean and fresh plus the size is ideal to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>In bath or shower or in my salad, sesame seed oil will be on my radar this year and this lotion makes it so easy to use daily, the size for this price is truly amazing.    </li>
            <li>just as cheap right to my doorstep.</li>
            <li>It is so light and soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>Also it is a huge volume, very large container</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs rather quickly so you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to try.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>The lotion dries fairly quickly and the scent does not linger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, not oily, has a very slight and pleasant fragrance and leaves the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>First, this is a HUGE size, so it is a bargain.</li>
            <li>goes on the skin so smooyhly and gets absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I am very sensitive to many ingredients and  scents.</li>
            <li>I highly  recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>This alone makes it worth the price.    </li>
            <li>I discovered it at a friend&#x27;s house and loved it so much that I actually remembered to search for it and then bought it for myself - which for me, is a testimony in itself.  </li>
            <li>What I also like about it is that it does not give me the same kind of problems with wearing contacts that a lot of lotions that are labeled for use in the face do.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Body Lotion (Light Sesame Formula) is the best all-around body lotion that I have ever used, which is why I have used it for approximately 10 years now.  </li>
            <li>In the winter time I will be using the Light Sesame body oil from Neutrogena and then layering on this lotion for full protection from hash New England winters.</li>
            <li>It smells ok, but I&#x27;d love it if they came up with other scents as well...</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Body Lotion, Sesame is the best, I ordered a large bottle that will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>The lotion has just the right degree of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I can put it on and right away it soaks in.</li>
            <li>I go through the small bottle quickly, and it&#x27;s more cost effective to buy it in the large size.  </li>
            <li>Usually have to take a trip into the Rack too get this great of a deal</li>
            <li>This lotion is by far my absolute favorite for Summer.    </li>
            <li>The cost is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the light nutty scent, the sesame seed is a golden little nugget of rich nourishment to the skin, it smells woody and so light, making me feel pampered and relaxed.    </li>
            <li>The large economical size a bonus too.</li>
            <li>Best of all, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Used when skin is damp from the shower, it has no equal for going on smoothly, being absorbed, softening the skin, and providing a clean scent that I personally really like.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is, but this is the only lotion I can use on my face without some sort of vapors or scents affecting my eyes/contacts that make them super sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs super fast and practically disappears leaving all parts smooth.</li>
            <li>Used it as a favorite before she passed away last year.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the first time using it</li>
            <li>I first used this at a luxury hotel</li>
            <li>In fact this year I&#x27;m planning on slathering this oil on as much as possible, the more I read about it on the internet</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft after using.</li>
            <li>This lotion has been my favorite for several years.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, soft and makes the skin feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent and the size!</li>
            <li>The only think I wish it had was more intensive moisturizer...</li>
            <li>So i&#x27;ve been putting on the oil first then once i&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the same product at Target and Walmart for about 25% more -</li>
            <li>No greasy residue and it moisturizes very well!</li>
            <li>I first tried this Neutrogena lotion as a sample from a hotel I was staying at</li>
            <li>use this daily skin feels so much better</li>
            <li>This is my favorite body lotion, especially in the summer when something lighter is preferred.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin very smooth and what I like the most is the delicate smell.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love Neutrogena Body Lotion, and Amazon is the ONLY place where I can find this large 32 oz.</li>
            <li>I leave it in the kitchen, but what I love the most is it last a very long time.</li>
            <li>This lotion REALLY moisturizes my dry skin and leave me feeling and smelling fresh, as opposed to just smelling flowery, which is why most lotions do.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll like it so much that you&#x27;ll be glad you purchased the larger  size.</li>
            <li>In the winter I combine this with a rich and silky body wash, nice salt scrubs and when I use any self tanner it makes the skin glow, sesame oil has long been known to be beneficial to the skin, being called the healing beauty oil that is not only beautifying but also has antibacterial properties.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much C. Greer!</li>
            <li>It costs a pretty penny but really like it.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a long time, and just reorded 6 more bottles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even light and fast enough to use at night when I&#x27;m tired and it still does a great job of quickly quenching any thirst in the epidermis.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be keeping this and enjoying it all the other seasons as my favorite lotion</li>
            <li>This lotion leaves my skin so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling especially during hot and humid weather.</li>
            <li>I need something more in the dry winter time.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturizer - it absorbs quickly, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it makes my skin softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly into my skin, completely effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Has helped me turn my dry skin and eczema into healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>You certainly can&#x27;t beat the deal on the 40 oz lotion that I found here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I also like the large size.</li>
            <li>but this is a LARGE bottle.  </li>
            <li>After that, I bought a large container for her.  </li>
            <li>Really like the large size, very convenient.</li>
            <li>The price from this vendor was really good for the hard to find 32 ounce size.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find in stores and this was a good buy for the money.  </li>
            <li>Fast Service;</li>
            <li>This one is much smoother than Skin Milk though because of the sesame oil mixture.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>very  pricy  with delivery.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way it feels and smells.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, and it really works.</li>
            <li>It works very well for the summer time, as it does not leave a residue, it does not feel sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>but almost none of them really helped.</li>
            <li>The second impression is the smell, which is light, unisex, and not at all flowery -- does not overwhelm my perfume.</li>
            <li>32 ounce size equates to a real bargain.</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance of these products and would buy them over and over again.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Nice light thin lotion.</li>
            <li>In the past, Neutrogenia made this lotion with a light scent which I liked far better, but can only hope that Neutrogenia brings it back.</li>
            <li>During the winter months, this lotion helps to keep my skin from becoming too dry.</li>
            <li>Smells great love the way it feels not too thick or greasy!!!!</li>
            <li>Plus, in this larger size, there is a significant cost savings.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this lotion!</li>
            <li>This is one lotion I can&#x27;t live without!  </li>
            <li>It soaks into your wet skin so easily and keeps it moist.  </li>
            <li>Should have read the ingredient label; loaded with parabens and too light for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t particularly like scented lotions.)  </li>
            <li>It slides on smoothly and absorbs quickly without any oily, slick feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this and the Skin Milk lotions.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>Very light scent, long lasting moisture effect, non sticky, and</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft and absorbs fast without leaving residues</li>
            <li>This is worth the extra money!!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion for the summer months when I don&#x27;t want or need anything too heavy on my skin.  </li>
            <li>If you are not concerned with ingredients and have normal skin, you will like the silky feel.</li>
            <li>Now we have a new TARGET store in REGINA&amp;#60;</li>
            <li>It has a pump system on the bottle  which makes it easy to use, and the 32 oz  container will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>This is exactly like the hotels have in their tiny samples.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it on Amazon as we usually purchased it at Costco.</li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly that I can get right back to using a computer or doing other tasks without leaving greasy prints on everything.</li>
            <li>This product is light, non-greasy, easily absorbed by the   skin, and subtly scented.    </li>
            <li>This lotion is an everyday lotion that glides on easily without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I love neutrogena, but this does not last long I do get ashy later on during the day</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried other lotions, most of the major brands, but I have come back to this one again and again.</li>
            <li>This one was gentle and actually felt healing.  </li>
            <li>and I am 75 years old.</li>
            <li>Aging skin or young skin can both benefit.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for years and it keeps my skin looking soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised on all aspects.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling soft but not ultra lotiony like shea butter type lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it once, and it did leave my skin amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>Our whole family uses this daily.</li>
            <li>I usually only buy scent-free skin products, but due to other reviewers saying the smell is very mild and fresh, I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I feel so smooth and soft after I use it and the effect LASTS longer than ten minutes like with other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I had chapped, dry, rough fingers from doing so many crafts (can&#x27;t use gloves), and this is the only thing that worked.</li>
            <li>It appears to be \\&quot;seasonal\\&quot;, and is only available in the winter months, for some odd reason.  </li>
            <li>My fingers are back to normal, and I use it on hands and elbows too.</li>
            <li>I keep a bottle in the bath and by my bed ~ not greasy and my skin is soft and not dry like it use to be</li>
            <li>I use this lotion everyday and the scent is so mild.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not greasy or heavy like many other lotions.</li>
            <li>only problem is i wish they sold the huge 32 oz year round not only the holidays.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of daily use, my elbows and heels are really soft.</li>
            <li>Third, the lotion goes on easily, is not greasy, and disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly, leaving my skin soft and subtly scented.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> this is a nice lotion that&#x27;s not too greasy.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice, light smell that isn&#x27;t feminine or overpowering.</li>
            <li> There is no oily feeling whatsoever, as both soak right in and the smell is incredible - clean, fresh without being too girly, and a wonderful basis for any perfume I have.  </li>
            <li> These potentially hazardous ingredients completely ruin an otherwise great product!  </li>
            <li> A nice, light lotion, good scent, and not greasy.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this has a very strong odor.</li>

            <li> The scent is very light also.</li>

            <li> and it pares nicely with the light sesame oil</li>

            <li> the more wonderful it is, the cure for dry hair and scalp and skin conditions as it&#x27;s even said to penetrate to the bone marrow as it helps toxins pass, it&#x27;s literally a miracle product.</li>

            <li> My skin feels smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> This goes on, feels great, but it feels natural rather than like you have a lotion on.</li>
            <li> Love the light scent and texture.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena Body Lotion is the best, and I was lucky enough to discover it on  Amazon.</li>

            <li> The pump makes it easy to dispense too.</li>
            <li> It has an easy to use spout nozzle.</li>

            <li> Love the light consistency...glides on smoothly and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> My wife liked this product very much.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is very light, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li> its good to normal skin or oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for dry skin; and the value is unbeatable.  </li>
            <li> For a body lotion it is fine, but I am still looking for the neutrogena  hand cream</li>
            <li> the smell though its the soft pleasant smell everyone described.</li>
            <li> But there is a huge BUT.</li>
            <li> I even bought a huge bottle for my dad, the person from whom I inherited my skin issues.</li>
            <li> This light sesame formula is the newer of the body lotion formulas.  </li>
            <li> The cream version did not disappoint, it was light to apply, and without the stickiness, you can feel your hands are smoother.  </li>
            <li> light smell and not greasy at all</li>
            <li> In the winter when I am drier, I use the coordinating Light Seame Oil in the shower and then touch up with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try a combo of the Neutrogena body oil followed by the Neutrogena Body Lotion, Light Sesame Formula because of C. Greer&#x27;s review  about layering these products after bathing.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000EBAHHG Neutrogena Body Lotion, Light Sesame Formula,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light , never feels greasy.</li>
            <li> After shower leave your skin silky smooth and it locks in the moisture in your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to find the bigger bottle on amazon.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best body lotion especially when paired up with the Neutrogena Body Lotion, Light Sesame Formula.  </li>
            <li> If you do the same, you can have this great product at a savings over buying it retail.</li>
            <li> lotion is so &#x27;light&#x27; that it is like not putting any lotion at all.  </li>
            <li> It is light and moisturizing, and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> When I forget to throw the Neutrogena Body Oil Light Sesame Formula on after bathing, this lotion fits the bill for that error.</li>
            <li> It smells cheap and almost like a granny scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this lotion, but haven&#x27;t been able to find this 32 oz size in local stores.  </li>
            <li> It is a very light lotion and not greasy, which was exactly what I wanted for my face.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend catching your Neutrogena products through Amazon and save the search of stores around your area.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic lotion at any price/size, but this special 32 oz.</li>
            <li> maybe next year when this one runs out :P</li>
            <li> IT goes on lightweight and smells fresh!</li>
            <li> Feels clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> The old formula had a nice light scent which I miss.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft with a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for seasons when the air is dry.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and really helps with the itching that we have during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This large bottle is in my bathroom... love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice too with  a soft scent.</li>
            <li> Wow is this lotion nice.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too with&lt;br /&gt;a soft scent.</li>
            <li> Nice soft skin, without that greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, smells heavenly and makes your skin ever so soft.  </li>
            <li> have a drawer full of scented lotions and gift basket rejects from specialty bath stores -  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the way my skin feels but the smell is just too much.</li>
            <li> love the feeling of pampering myself and the scent is nice for its not overwhelming but will make you feel clean and fresh plus the size is ideal to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> In bath or shower or in my salad, sesame seed oil will be on my radar this year and this lotion makes it so easy to use daily, the size for this price is truly amazing.    </li>
            <li> just as cheap right to my doorstep.</li>
            <li> It is so light and soaks right in.  </li>
            <li> Also it is a huge volume, very large container</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs rather quickly so you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to try.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> The lotion dries fairly quickly and the scent does not linger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, not oily, has a very slight and pleasant fragrance and leaves the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> First, this is a HUGE size, so it is a bargain.</li>
            <li> goes on the skin so smooyhly and gets absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I am very sensitive to many ingredients and  scents.</li>
            <li> I highly  recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This alone makes it worth the price.    </li>
            <li> I discovered it at a friend&#x27;s house and loved it so much that I actually remembered to search for it and then bought it for myself - which for me, is a testimony in itself.  </li>
            <li> What I also like about it is that it does not give me the same kind of problems with wearing contacts that a lot of lotions that are labeled for use in the face do.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Body Lotion (Light Sesame Formula) is the best all-around body lotion that I have ever used, which is why I have used it for approximately 10 years now.  </li>
            <li> In the winter time I will be using the Light Sesame body oil from Neutrogena and then layering on this lotion for full protection from hash New England winters.</li>
            <li> It smells ok, but I&#x27;d love it if they came up with other scents as well...</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Body Lotion, Sesame is the best, I ordered a large bottle that will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The lotion has just the right degree of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I can put it on and right away it soaks in.</li>
            <li> I go through the small bottle quickly, and it&#x27;s more cost effective to buy it in the large size.  </li>
            <li> Usually have to take a trip into the Rack too get this great of a deal</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far my absolute favorite for Summer.    </li>
            <li> The cost is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the light nutty scent, the sesame seed is a golden little nugget of rich nourishment to the skin, it smells woody and so light, making me feel pampered and relaxed.    </li>
            <li> The large economical size a bonus too.</li>
            <li> Best of all, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Used when skin is damp from the shower, it has no equal for going on smoothly, being absorbed, softening the skin, and providing a clean scent that I personally really like.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but this is the only lotion I can use on my face without some sort of vapors or scents affecting my eyes/contacts that make them super sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs super fast and practically disappears leaving all parts smooth.</li>
            <li> Used it as a favorite before she passed away last year.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the first time using it</li>
            <li> I first used this at a luxury hotel</li>
            <li> In fact this year I&#x27;m planning on slathering this oil on as much as possible, the more I read about it on the internet</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and soft after using.</li>
            <li> This lotion has been my favorite for several years.</li>
            <li> It is smooth, soft and makes the skin feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent and the size!</li>
            <li> The only think I wish it had was more intensive moisturizer...</li>
            <li> So i&#x27;ve been putting on the oil first then once i&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the same product at Target and Walmart for about 25% more -</li>
            <li> No greasy residue and it moisturizes very well!</li>
            <li> I first tried this Neutrogena lotion as a sample from a hotel I was staying at</li>
            <li> use this daily skin feels so much better</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion, especially in the summer when something lighter is preferred.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin very smooth and what I like the most is the delicate smell.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love Neutrogena Body Lotion, and Amazon is the ONLY place where I can find this large 32 oz.</li>
            <li> I leave it in the kitchen, but what I love the most is it last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This lotion REALLY moisturizes my dry skin and leave me feeling and smelling fresh, as opposed to just smelling flowery, which is why most lotions do.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll like it so much that you&#x27;ll be glad you purchased the larger  size.</li>
            <li> In the winter I combine this with a rich and silky body wash, nice salt scrubs and when I use any self tanner it makes the skin glow, sesame oil has long been known to be beneficial to the skin, being called the healing beauty oil that is not only beautifying but also has antibacterial properties.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much C. Greer!</li>
            <li> It costs a pretty penny but really like it.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a long time, and just reorded 6 more bottles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even light and fast enough to use at night when I&#x27;m tired and it still does a great job of quickly quenching any thirst in the epidermis.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be keeping this and enjoying it all the other seasons as my favorite lotion</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves my skin so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling especially during hot and humid weather.</li>
            <li> I need something more in the dry winter time.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer - it absorbs quickly, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it makes my skin softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> It absorbs so quickly into my skin, completely effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Has helped me turn my dry skin and eczema into healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> You certainly can&#x27;t beat the deal on the 40 oz lotion that I found here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I also like the large size.</li>
            <li> but this is a LARGE bottle.  </li>
            <li> After that, I bought a large container for her.  </li>
            <li> Really like the large size, very convenient.</li>
            <li> The price from this vendor was really good for the hard to find 32 ounce size.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores and this was a good buy for the money.  </li>
            <li> Fast Service;</li>
            <li> This one is much smoother than Skin Milk though because of the sesame oil mixture.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> very  pricy  with delivery.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels and smells.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, and it really works.</li>
            <li> It works very well for the summer time, as it does not leave a residue, it does not feel sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> but almost none of them really helped.</li>
            <li> The second impression is the smell, which is light, unisex, and not at all flowery -- does not overwhelm my perfume.</li>
            <li> 32 ounce size equates to a real bargain.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance of these products and would buy them over and over again.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Nice light thin lotion.</li>
            <li> In the past, Neutrogenia made this lotion with a light scent which I liked far better, but can only hope that Neutrogenia brings it back.</li>
            <li> During the winter months, this lotion helps to keep my skin from becoming too dry.</li>
            <li> Smells great love the way it feels not too thick or greasy!!!!</li>
            <li> Plus, in this larger size, there is a significant cost savings.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this lotion!</li>
            <li> This is one lotion I can&#x27;t live without!  </li>
            <li> It soaks into your wet skin so easily and keeps it moist.  </li>
            <li> Should have read the ingredient label; loaded with parabens and too light for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t particularly like scented lotions.)  </li>
            <li> It slides on smoothly and absorbs quickly without any oily, slick feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this and the Skin Milk lotions.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> Very light scent, long lasting moisture effect, non sticky, and</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft and absorbs fast without leaving residues</li>
            <li> This is worth the extra money!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion for the summer months when I don&#x27;t want or need anything too heavy on my skin.  </li>
            <li> If you are not concerned with ingredients and have normal skin, you will like the silky feel.</li>
            <li> Now we have a new TARGET store in REGINA&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> It has a pump system on the bottle  which makes it easy to use, and the 32 oz  container will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the hotels have in their tiny samples.</li>
            <li> Glad to find it on Amazon as we usually purchased it at Costco.</li>
            <li> It absorbs so quickly that I can get right back to using a computer or doing other tasks without leaving greasy prints on everything.</li>
            <li> This product is light, non-greasy, easily absorbed by the   skin, and subtly scented.    </li>
            <li> This lotion is an everyday lotion that glides on easily without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I love neutrogena, but this does not last long I do get ashy later on during the day</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried other lotions, most of the major brands, but I have come back to this one again and again.</li>
            <li> This one was gentle and actually felt healing.  </li>
            <li> and I am 75 years old.</li>
            <li> Aging skin or young skin can both benefit.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years and it keeps my skin looking soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised on all aspects.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft but not ultra lotiony like shea butter type lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it once, and it did leave my skin amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> Our whole family uses this daily.</li>
            <li> I usually only buy scent-free skin products, but due to other reviewers saying the smell is very mild and fresh, I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I feel so smooth and soft after I use it and the effect LASTS longer than ten minutes like with other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I had chapped, dry, rough fingers from doing so many crafts (can&#x27;t use gloves), and this is the only thing that worked.</li>
            <li> It appears to be \\&quot;seasonal\\&quot;, and is only available in the winter months, for some odd reason.  </li>
            <li> My fingers are back to normal, and I use it on hands and elbows too.</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle in the bath and by my bed ~ not greasy and my skin is soft and not dry like it use to be</li>
            <li> I use this lotion everyday and the scent is so mild.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not greasy or heavy like many other lotions.</li>
            <li> only problem is i wish they sold the huge 32 oz year round not only the holidays.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of daily use, my elbows and heels are really soft.</li>
            <li> Third, the lotion goes on easily, is not greasy, and disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly, leaving my skin soft and subtly scented.  </li>
            <li> Layering these two products is a total double whammy against dry, itchy skin!</li>
            <li> It has not a light fresh scent, but rather a deep, stale smell that is very overpowering - I literally couldn&#x27;t smell anything else but this product.</li>
            <li> Until they clean up the formula, I&#x27;ve purchased my last bottle unfortunately.</li>
            <li> size lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> So with that I am going to be well stocked for a long time  </li>
            <li> so you are stuck with it for a long time</li>
            <li> size lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> lotion that I use every day all year long.</li>
            <li> But as long as I can order</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy very expensive body lotions, so it&#x27;s possible there are others out there that are better.  </li>
            <li> i went through a whole 8.5oz in a little less than a month.</li>
            <li> This product has been around a long time -  we found it last year on Amazon,  and we haven&#x27;t bought any other lotion</li>
            <li> I gave away all my other store lotions and will only use this.</li>
            <li> long before I moved to Montana thirty years ago!  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> After bathing I PAT dry and then use the oil, followed by the lotion.  </li>
            <li> Yep, use both if you have really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Dry skin peoples used this lotion in summer...</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, problem skin.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is just too strong and is not pleasant at all (at least for me).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only gone down a couple of fingers.</li>
            <li> Only down side is</li>
            <li> For that reason, I try to buy up a few bottles over the winter, enough to last me throughout the other 3 seasons.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried just about every lotion on the market that was marketed to dry, itchy or rough skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and using this product twice a day seems to keep it under control.  </li>
            <li> I bought this along with the sesame oil, since my skin has been VERY dry this winter.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find this lotion in local retail locations.  </li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years and it gets harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> I have wasted a lot of money on lotions only to find I am  allergic to them.</li>
            <li> it hope every one tries it  </li>
            <li> Use daily and never have that heavy lotion feel.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and a lot of other products burn or cause some sort of negative reaction.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This 32 ounce bottle is the only way to buy it - feels a little silly having such large bottles,  but I have to reorder every few months !</li>
            <li> We use this every morning &amp; frankly, I get tired of trying to get that last ounce or so out of the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> This was so hard to find when I was looking for it initially.</li>
            <li> I did a little test-after bathing, I used the oil followed by the lotion and then tried both products separately.</li>
            <li> To name a few, Toothpaste, batteries,  a cover for a Nook, etc.</li>
            <li> I have used neutrogena body lotion for years and was having trouble finding it in stores around my area.  </li>
            <li> You put it on and it softens and soakes into your skin with no greasy or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> I like this product because I do not like anything heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> You can use it all over and even in the face without it being heavy and giving you grease-face.</li>
            <li> it goes on smoothly...but its not good for dry skin...</li>
            <li> I will say that I have had a difficult time finding it on the   shelves of my local stores.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the lotion to be be very heavy and thick....</li>
            <li> Moisturizes, yet you hardly feel it on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used it for years, but it is hard to get in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy or thick like some lotions.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very hard to find now, for some reason.</li>
            <li> It works YEAR ROUND, in the heat of summer and in the cold of winter.</li>
            <li> No more flakey skin!!!</li>
            <li> This product is really difficult to find, so I&#x27;ve been using my stash sparingly.  </li>
            <li> The cold Montana winters (below zero temperatures) are brutal to the skin, and this lotion is just what you need...especially during the long winter months!  </li>
            <li> However, it smells so bad to me that I can never use it again.</li>
            <li> As I have said before, I hate making up words for inanimate inexpensive items like this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This is the only lotion my wife will use and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena Body Lotion is the best, and I was lucky enough to discover it on  Amazon. It has a pump system on the bottle  which makes it easy to use, and the 32 oz  container will last me a long time. I highly  recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogenia body lotion for over 20 years and have had wonderful results with it.  It is a very light lotion and not greasy, which was exactly what I wanted for my face.  This light sesame formula is the newer of the body lotion formulas.  In the past, Neutrogenia made this lotion with a light scent which I liked far better, but can only hope that Neutrogenia brings it back.</li>
            <li> my husband and i both have exzema and i battle with lichen simplex of  the skin. im so glad i stumbled upon this lotion we use it religiously.its one of the only lotions i can use and not breakout or itch. also it really has almost no scent, so if your sensitive to scents this lotion is wonderful. only problem is i wish they sold the huge 32 oz year round not only the holidays. give this lotion a try.</li>
            <li> My wife liked this product very much.  Used it as a favorite before she passed away last year.  Don&#x27;t know what else I can say at the present.</li>
            <li> Finally.  I could not find this 32 oz Bottle anywhere else.  Fast Service; Great price.  Love this stuff.  I wish it in came in a 55-Gallon Drum !^)    &lt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EBAHHG/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title&gt;</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. It&#x27;s not the first time using it and I would recommend it for everyone. Very light scent, long lasting moisture effect, non sticky, and even though I wash my hands often, you can feel the moisture afterwards.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion on vacation in June. It was the lotion that the hotel provided - I was hooked. I gave away all my other store lotions and will only use this. It is  light - very hydrating and the fragrance is perfect with my perfumes or wonderful all by its self! Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion. Thumbs up for neutrogena... This lotion leaves my skin so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling especially during hot and humid weather. Great when used after taking a bath while the skin is still damp.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it&#x27;s so light and refreshing. Smells nice too with  a soft scent. The 32 oz. size lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This lotion REALLY moisturizes my dry skin and leave me feeling and smelling fresh, as opposed to just smelling flowery, which is why most lotions do.  I have extremely sensitive skin and a lot of other products burn or cause some sort of negative reaction.  This one was gentle and actually felt healing.  I am never using anything else.  This is worth the extra money!!</li>
            <li> This was so hard to find when I was looking for it initially. I first used this at a luxury hotel and I felt like a king like wow this is so good! I ordered a box of these I think I have 8 bottles. I highly reccomend this and the Skin Milk lotions. This one is much smoother than Skin Milk though because of the sesame oil mixture.</li>
            <li> I love it and would keep buying more. Moisturizes, yet you hardly feel it on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I can see the skin shine after application.</li>
            <li> goes on sheer and not greasy and perfect for summer.  I have used this for years and always been happy. It has a clean light fragrance and the large size is an excellent value.  I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Like to get these as gifts for the ladies,no better way to score points with everyone from grandama to girlfriends. They like the lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a pure dream, it feels wonderful on after a bath or a shower and goes on in a light layer that hydrates the skin, making it feel silky and elastic. I cannot describe how nice it is to use it in the morning and not have it stick to clothes. It&#x27;s even light and fast enough to use at night when I&#x27;m tired and it still does a great job of quickly quenching any thirst in the epidermis. Not to mention the light nutty scent, the sesame seed is a golden little nugget of rich nourishment to the skin, it smells woody and so light, making me feel pampered and relaxed.    In the winter I combine this with a rich and silky body wash, nice salt scrubs and when I use any self tanner it makes the skin glow, sesame oil has long been known to be beneficial to the skin, being called the healing beauty oil that is not only beautifying but also has antibacterial properties. In fact this year I&#x27;m planning on slathering this oil on as much as possible, the more I read about it on the internet the more wonderful it is, the cure for dry hair and scalp and skin conditions as it&#x27;s even said to penetrate to the bone marrow as it helps toxins pass, it&#x27;s literally a miracle product. In bath or shower or in my salad, sesame seed oil will be on my radar this year and this lotion makes it so easy to use daily, the size for this price is truly amazing.    - Kasia S.</li>
            <li> This body lotion is wonderful.  My skin feels smooth and soft after using.I have very dry skin and using this product twice a day seems to keep it under control.  The fragrance is very light and disappears so it doesn&#x27;t clash with your fragrance.  Try this - warmer weather is coming.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years and it gets harder and harder to find. It is great to be able to get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is basically the only body lotion that I can use on my skin.  Have used it for years!  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for dry skin; and the value is unbeatable.  I have used this produce for over five years.  The Neutrogena sesame shower gel is equally as good. The shipping was fast.  The transaction was good.</li>
            <li> I love neutrogena body lotion.  I have used it for years, but it is hard to get in the stores.  I think they have changed their formula a bit though.  The old formula had a nice light scent which I miss.</li>
            <li> Love the light smell and feel with this lotion. I was expecting the lotion to be be very heavy and thick....its not. Its perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the oil version: the best.  But I wanted something that I can use at work or transfer to traveller&#x27;s pack.  The cream version did not disappoint, it was light to apply, and without the stickiness, you can feel your hands are smoother.  Love the light sesame fragrance, just like the oil version.  Great value.  Love it.</li>
            <li> THIS NEUTROGENA SESAME LOTION IS JUST WONDERFUL, I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS, IS PERFECT FOR MY SKIN TYPE.. I HAVE SHARED THIS GREAT LOTION WITH FRIENDS THAT IVE HOOKED ON NEUTROGENA RAIN BATH, NOW THEY USE BOTH.. THANKS FOR A GREAT PRICE FOR A GREAT PRODUCT.. CHRIS</li>
            <li> This is an excellent lotion for dry skin and this gigantic bottle is a great way to never run out unexpectedly. I&#x27;ve used it every day for almost a month and it&#x27;s only gone down a couple of fingers. It smells ok, but I&#x27;d love it if they came up with other scents as well... vanilla maybe? I would buy this product again, but maybe next year when this one runs out :P</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far my absolute favorite for Summer.    I happened upon it and gave it a try as I use Neutrogena&#x27;s   facial moisturizer faithfully. Boy am i glad I did!    This product is light, non-greasy, easily absorbed by the   skin, and subtly scented.    While I use a heavier body cream for the winter months, I  can&#x27;t stand feeling sticky in the heat of the summer. This  formula seems to disappear into my skin without leaving   any residue.    Additionally, I am very sensitive to many ingredients and  scents. I have wasted a lot of money on lotions only to find I am  allergic to them. No rashes, bumps or sneezes here. What a pleasant  surprise!  This alone makes it worth the price.    I will say that I have had a difficult time finding it on the   shelves of my local stores. Thus, would recommend buying it here.  You&#x27;ll like it so much that you&#x27;ll be glad you purchased the larger  size.</li>
            <li> love the feeling of pampering myself and the scent is nice for its not overwhelming but will make you feel clean and fresh plus the size is ideal to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> We use this every morning &amp; frankly, I get tired of trying to get that last ounce or so out of the smaller bottles. Really like the large size, very convenient.</li>
            <li> This lotion has been my favorite for several years. It leaves my skin feeling soft with a nice light scent. I was so happy to find the 32 oz bottle available on Amazon and at such a great price. It&#x27;s a nice savings over the 8.5 oz size and, of course, lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love it!  It is smooth, soft and makes the skin feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> light smell and not greasy at all</li>
            <li> I love neutrogena, but this does not last long I do get ashy later on during the day but it smells good. I will not buy this one again.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice, light smell that isn&#x27;t feminine or overpowering. It&#x27;s also not greasy or heavy like many other lotions. The price is great for this large size bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite \\&quot;go to\\&quot; lotion that is never greasy and smells delicious without being too heavy. I can keep the pump bottle on the counter and get a squirt after every hand wash which is essential to keep my skin from drying out. It absorbs so quickly that I can get right back to using a computer or doing other tasks without leaving greasy prints on everything. In the winter when I am drier, I use the coordinating Light Seame Oil in the shower and then touch up with this lotion.  The price from this vendor was really good for the hard to find 32 ounce size.</li>
            <li> I have used this for face and body for 30 years.  Had to buy in the usa  when i traveled  then Walmart REGINA  was carrying the product and stopped several years ago. My beginning was with a local dentist  DR. PAUL BOOKHALTER  he would bring me all the samples from the NEUTROGENA  sales person  and wow great stuff . So recently  the usa stores did not have it in stock so I bought off AMAZON  very  pricy  with delivery.  Now we have a new TARGET store in REGINA&amp;#60; SASK. CANADA  and they are not carrying it here either.  I had a sheet from a magazine that it was $14.99  for the 32 oz  vut they would not deliver to canada So with that I am going to be well stocked for a long time  I bought 4 - 32 oz  and will use it daily.

            <li> My husband and I have extremely dry skin. This lotion has a very mild scent , which is nice for someone who has problems with allergies. The lotion has just the right degree of moisturizing. It goes on very smooth and really helps with the itching that we have during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Body Lotion (Light Sesame Formula) is the best all-around body lotion that I have ever used, which is why I have used it for approximately 10 years now.  It works YEAR ROUND, in the heat of summer and in the cold of winter. Plus, in this larger size, there is a significant cost savings. However, the one and only \\&quot;gripe\\&quot; I have for Neutrogena is that they do not offer this larger size of the product year-round.  It appears to be \\&quot;seasonal\\&quot;, and is only available in the winter months, for some odd reason.  For that reason, I try to buy up a few bottles over the winter, enough to last me throughout the other 3 seasons.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a combo of the Neutrogena body oil followed by the Neutrogena Body Lotion, Light Sesame Formula because of C. Greer&#x27;s review  about layering these products after bathing.  I did a little test-after bathing, I used the oil followed by the lotion and then tried both products separately. Layering these two products is a total double whammy against dry, itchy skin! What a difference!  My skin looks and feels wonderful.  I don&#x27;t think I would have considerd using these products this way because I thought it might be too much; but I liked it even better than either alone. Thanks so much C. Greer!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000EBAHHG Neutrogena Body Lotion, Light Sesame Formula, 32-Ounce Pump]]I was using this body lotion long before I moved to Montana thirty years ago!  The cold Montana winters (below zero temperatures) are brutal to the skin, and this lotion is just what you need...especially during the long winter months!  The retail stores here no longer carry the 32-ounce bottle, so I was pleased to discover that I could purchase it on amazon.com!  You now have a customer for life!!</li>
            <li> Great light lotion.Does not leave you feeling greasy! Great light smell that stays with you all day.&lt;br /&gt;Great size bottle.</li>
            <li> love this and it pares nicely with the light sesame oil</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace shepards lotion, I like it a lot, but the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is...it is scented and I&#x27;d rather have unscented.</li>
            <li> Wow is this lotion nice. It costs a pretty penny but really like it. I was having some skin issues and my dermatologist said they only recommend this lotion. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It is what it says, it is light and creamy and one of the best moisturizing lotions I have used.</li>
            <li> I tried it and its okay, maybe because I am not the lotion type after I shower so its okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this lotion, but haven&#x27;t been able to find this 32 oz size in local stores.  I go through the small bottle quickly, and it&#x27;s more cost effective to buy it in the large size.  The price on this item was awesome!</li>
            <li> I really like the scent and the size! The only think I wish it had was more intensive moisturizer...I need something more in the dry winter time. I will definitely be keeping this and enjoying it all the other seasons as my favorite lotion</li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels and smells. It&#x27;s light , never feels greasy. It absorbs quickly and makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I will ever buy!!!  It isn&#x27;t oily or stinky.....it&#x27;s perfect!!!  I stock up when I purchase it and have even given it as gifts!!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer - it absorbs quickly, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it makes my skin softer and smoother. But there is a huge BUT. The smell of this lotion is just too strong and is not pleasant at all (at least for me). It has not a light fresh scent, but rather a deep, stale smell that is very overpowering - I literally couldn&#x27;t smell anything else but this product.</li>
            <li> As I have said before, I hate making up words for inanimate inexpensive items like this. .You need to allow customers to skip reviews on these types of items.  To name a few, Toothpaste, batteries,  a cover for a Nook, etc.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion for the summer months when I don&#x27;t want or need anything too heavy on my skin.  Nothing feels better after shaving your legs than pumping on this lotion--heaven!  It soaks in quickly, leaving my skin soft and subtly scented.  This product is really difficult to find, so I&#x27;ve been using my stash sparingly.  I&#x27;m happy to see I can stock up here.</li>
            <li> I have used neutrogena body lotion for years and was having trouble finding it in stores around my area.  I ordered from Amazon and am thrilled to find the lotion is still as great as it ever was.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion . I allways use it thoroughly on my body after shower . This is the best lotion I have experienced in the market sofar&lt;br /&gt;in my life and I am 75 years old.Thank you for offering it .I usualy buy 6 in Oct. or Nov. of every year .It goes on the skin so smooyhly and gets absorbed quickly.It has delightful arroma.A lady I know commented to me that I always smell so good .She asked me what do I use .</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the hotels have in their tiny samples. I love it. It&#x27;s not greasy, and it really works. I had chapped, dry, rough fingers from doing so many crafts (can&#x27;t use gloves), and this is the only thing that worked. My fingers are back to normal, and I use it on hands and elbows too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product luv it hope every one tries it  It will last for a year see you later</li>
            <li> My family  &amp; I have been using this lotion for years. I leave it in the kitchen, but what I love the most is it last a very long time.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love Neutrogena Body Lotion, and Amazon is the ONLY place where I can find this large 32 oz. pump bottle.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I had tried a sample of this lotion and really liked that it is very lightly scented.  It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> After shower leave your skin silky smooth and it locks in the moisture in your skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this product 5 stars because it is a really wonderful lotion, but then I found out that Neutrogena as a company tests on animals so I won&#x27;t be using it. Why Neutrogena why?!?</li>
            <li> I use both this and the sesame oil . I love them.  My skin feels smooth and healthy. The pump makes it easy to dispense too. It is very light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the sesame oil, since my skin has been VERY dry this winter. So i&#x27;ve been putting on the oil first then once i&#x27;m done i will go back through and put lotion on. Even after doing both i&#x27;m not greasy. This lotion works well alone and has a nice light scent. It absorbs rather quickly so you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to try. Only down side is i went through a whole 8.5oz in a little less than a month. I&#x27;m happy to find the bigger bottle on amazon.</li>
            <li> For a body lotion it is fine, but I am still looking for the neutrogena  hand cream</li>
            <li> This is by far the best body lotion I have ever used.  Used when skin is damp from the shower, it has no equal for going on smoothly, being absorbed, softening the skin, and providing a clean scent that I personally really like.  Aging skin or young skin can both benefit. Have bought and will buy every time I need to buy lotion.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about this product because it is not \\&quot;scent-free\\&quot;. I usually only buy scent-free skin products, but due to other reviewers saying the smell is very mild and fresh, I purchased it. I&#x27;m glad I did. The scent is almost non-existent, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about not liking it, or worry about it overpowering anything else I wear. It absorbs so quickly into my skin, completely effortlessly. It works very well for the summer time, as it does not leave a residue, it does not feel sticky or greasy. In the winter time I will be using the Light Sesame body oil from Neutrogena and then layering on this lotion for full protection from hash New England winters.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best body lotion especially when paired up with the Neutrogena Body Lotion, Light Sesame Formula.  You certainly can&#x27;t beat the deal on the 40 oz lotion that I found here on Amazon.  After bathing I PAT dry and then use the oil, followed by the lotion.  Yep, use both if you have really dry skin.  There is no oily feeling whatsoever, as both soak right in and the smell is incredible - clean, fresh without being too girly, and a wonderful basis for any perfume I have.  In fact, I have had people ask me what I have on with just the oil and lotion.  I have been using this combo for years and years and my hubby now uses both products as well</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lotion I have ever purchased.  I know longer buy the scented lotions from the specialty stores or the drugstore aisle.  I am sticking with this.</li>
            <li> Usually have to take a trip into the Rack too get this great of a deal but instead got it just as cheap right to my doorstep. Use daily and never have that heavy lotion feel.</li>
            <li> It is a great product:  Non-greasy, not smelly, and moisturizes beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;What more can one say?  It&#x27;s great!.  Love it</li>
            <li> this is GREAT stuff....have used it for sometime and like it a lot! The large economical size a bonus too.</li>
            <li> Had looked all over for this stuff and could not find it anywhere. Found it here. Shipped quickly. Packaged well.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft and absorbs fast without leaving residues but I did not like the smell of it. Also it is a huge volume, very large container so you are stuck with it for a long time</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion.  I use it on my grand babies and even my face.  Feels clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  The cost is very reasonable.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it&#x27;s so light and refreshing. Smells nice too with&lt;br /&gt;a soft scent. The 32 oz. size lasts a long time. its good to normal skin or oily skin. Dry skin peoples used this lotion in summer...so good result for you</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin very smooth and what I like the most is the delicate smell. I also like the large size.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT HAS PARABEN IN IT. PARABENS ARE LINKED TO OPENING THE BODY TO CANCER, PER ONCOLOGISTS. DO NOT USE ANY PRODUCTS WITH PARABENS. SHAME ON NEUTROGENA FOR USING PARABENS!</li>
            <li> Love will not use anything else. I use after my shower with the Neutrogena Body Oil</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It is so light and soaks right in.  Has helped me turn my dry skin and eczema into healthy skin.  I use it daily and it took me about 4 months to go through this big bottle.  It is a generous amount for the price.  I&#x27;ve seen the same product at Target and Walmart for about 25% more - I ordered mine with my Prime membership and avoided shipping.  If you do the same, you can have this great product at a savings over buying it retail.</li>
            <li> lotion is so &#x27;light&#x27; that it is like not putting any lotion at all.  I would like to just return the product, however I have already opened the product up and just need to use it in addition to the sesame oil and another lotion</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and so happy to have 32 oz bottle!!! Smells great love the way it feels not too thick or greasy!!!! Great product!</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle in the bath and by my bed ~ not greasy and my skin is soft and not dry like it use to be</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Body Lotion, Sesame is the best, I ordered a large bottle that will last me a long time. I use this lotion everyday and the scent is so mild.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, problem skin. Over the years, I have tried just about every lotion on the market that was marketed to dry, itchy or rough skin but almost none of them really helped. I accidentally found this lotion in Target one day while looking for something else.  I liked that it said it had oil in it as i use oil after my showers as a moisturizer. This lotion is wonderful and smells nice. I feel so smooth and soft after I use it and the effect LASTS longer than ten minutes like with other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. I even bought a huge bottle for my dad, the person from whom I inherited my skin issues. This lotion is very hard to find now, for some reason. Glad I could get it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> This lotion penetrates quickly, moisturizes and softens skin, and smells absolutely WONDERFUL.  I discovered it at a friend&#x27;s house and loved it so much that I actually remembered to search for it and then bought it for myself - which for me, is a testimony in itself.  It&#x27;s my favorite &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; body lotion now.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, soaks in nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice price good product</li>
            <li> I buy this regularly - a better deal when bought in this quantity.  Some lotions have caused me skin problems, but never this one. Seems to be perfect for me - a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; lotion that I use every day all year long. No more flakey skin!!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice lightweight lotion. The scent is very light also. It is good for light moisturizing. It has an easy to use spout nozzle. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> It has a smell that I cannot tolerate - will not order again</li>
            <li> During the winter months, this lotion helps to keep my skin from becoming too dry. I recommend this for year around skin care.</li>
            <li> Nice light thin lotion. Leaves no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy very expensive body lotions, so it&#x27;s possible there are others out there that are better.  However, for the price, this is the one for me.  I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena products before and used to use the regular Neutrogena body lotion.  This lotion, with sesame oil is the best.  Nice soft skin, without that greasy feeling.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best body lotion ever.  If you use this, you will NEVER  go back to anything  else.  It goes on nicely, smells heavenly and makes your skin ever so soft.  The light sesame aroma is perfect and not overpowering.  I will continue to buy forever!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is an everyday lotion that glides on easily without a greasy feel.  It is light and moisturizing, and lasts all day.  The bottle lasts me almost 6 months of daily use.</li>
            <li> When I forget to throw the Neutrogena Body Oil Light Sesame Formula on after bathing, this lotion fits the bill for that error. It slides on smoothly and absorbs quickly without any oily, slick feeling afterwards. I highly recommend catching your Neutrogena products through Amazon and save the search of stores around your area.</li>
            <li> great item very happy</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years and it keeps my skin looking soft and supple.  It is hard to find in stores and this was a good buy for the money.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it, too!</li>
            <li> Love it! The bottle is huge and is so convenient to keep on the dresser! IT goes on lightweight and smells fresh! No greasy residue and it moisturizes very well!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena: Take the parabens out of this product please!!!  These potentially hazardous ingredients completely ruin an otherwise great product!  Until they clean up the formula, I&#x27;ve purchased my last bottle unfortunately.</li>
            <li> For the size they give you the price is good.. the smell though its the soft pleasant smell everyone described. It smells cheap and almost like a granny scent. I only use it to lotion my feet after showering. Anywhere else and the scent lingers.</li>
            <li> I search for this every year!  This is a fantastic lotion at any price/size, but this special 32 oz. that comes out every fall before the holidays is an amazing deal.  The texture and VERY light fragrance are perfect for daily use after getting out of the shower, it soaks in immediately and gives my skin a silky, not sticky, feel.  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried other lotions, most of the major brands, but I have come back to this one again and again.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena Body Lotion is just the moisturizer I&#x27;ve been looking for. It&#x27;s light, not oily, has a very slight and pleasant fragrance and leaves the skin smooth. Best of all, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very light, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy.  Has a nice pleasant fragrance.  And wasn&#x27;t paying attention when I ordered, but this is a LARGE bottle.  Pleasantly surprised on all aspects.</li>
            <li> I first tried this Neutrogena lotion as a sample from a hotel I was staying at and I was hooked from day 1.  It goes on with a very light silky feel and though it has sesame seed oil in it, it does not seems greasy at all.  Leaves your skin feeling soft but not ultra lotiony like shea butter type lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice too - just a nice, clean, light, gender-neutral scent.  I can&#x27;t stand over-powering smells on beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find this lotion in local retail locations.  But as long as I can order that&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> First, this is a HUGE size, so it is a bargain. The second impression is the smell, which is light, unisex, and not at all flowery -- does not overwhelm my perfume. Third, the lotion goes on easily, is not greasy, and disappears quickly. But, most important of all, it works to soften and smooth skin. After two weeks of daily use, my elbows and heels are really soft. Neutrogena is a quality brand, and this is no exception!</li>
            <li> THis is the 2nd time I have had to write this review.  It is the ONLY lotion I use...and I like this size.  It is not greasy, it blends into the skin well and the smell is not overpowering... it is very pleasant.  I recommend this lotion... I keep a smaller bottle in my kitchen next to my sink.  This large bottle is in my bathroom... love this lotion.  Now please, do not ask me to write a 3 review!</li>
            <li> My wife tried it at a hotel and loved it.  After that, I bought a large container for her.  She still thinks it is the greatest thing going.</li>
            <li> We use this after out showers a lot, especially in the summer.  It soaks into your wet skin so easily and keeps it moist.  Glad to find it on Amazon as we usually purchased it at Costco.</li>
            <li> Love the light consistency...glides on smoothly and absorbs well.  Love the pleasant scent too.  32 ounce size equates to a real bargain.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Can&#x27;t find it in stores any more. You put it on and it softens and soakes into your skin with no greasy or heavy feeling. Very light!!!</li>
            <li> Not greasy or thick like some lotions. I love the silky feel it gives to your skin. Can&#x27;t live without this lotion!</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying this product without knowing what it smelled like. I used it once, and it did leave my skin amazingly soft. The moisturized feeling lasted all day. However, it smells so bad to me that I can never use it again. It smells like the soap in a public restroom; that is the only way I can describe the scent. Waste of money for me, and it is a shame because it does work so very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance of these products and would buy them over and over again. I do like the oil better than the lotion, however.</li>
            <li> I like this product because I do not like anything heavy on my skin. This goes on, feels great, but it feels natural rather than like you have a lotion on.</li>
            <li> Great brand. This lotion works great for me. I suffer from excema so I use a ton of lotion. this is a nice lotion that&#x27;s not too greasy. I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> A nice, light lotion, good scent, and not greasy. I discovered it at a hotel and it works well.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for seasons when the air is dry. You can use it all over and even in the face without it being heavy and giving you grease-face. What I also like about it is that it does not give me the same kind of problems with wearing contacts that a lot of lotions that are labeled for use in the face do. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but this is the only lotion I can use on my face without some sort of vapors or scents affecting my eyes/contacts that make them super sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs super fast and practically disappears leaving all parts smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion. I can put it on and right away it soaks in. No waiting too put your clothes on. I love the way it feels!!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a long time, and just reorded 6 more bottles. Our whole family uses this daily. Never a greasy feel or over perfumed smell, just a great lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!  Can&#x27;t find this any where.  Works well.  Very satisfied.  Try this product and I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and was very happy was able to order in such a large size.  I am definitely going to order again and again.  Use this several times a day.  Delivery was very quick. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This size bottle is a great way to save!  The lotion dries fairly quickly and the scent does not linger. (I don&#x27;t particularly like scented lotions.)  Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is one lotion I can&#x27;t live without!  The best ever!</li>
            <li> use this daily skin feels so much better</li>
            <li> This product has been around a long time -  we found it last year on Amazon,  and we haven&#x27;t bought any other lotion since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a drawer full of scented lotions and gift basket rejects from specialty bath stores -  they sit unused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light scent - non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 32 ounce bottle is the only way to buy it - feels a little silly having such large bottles,  but I have to reorder every few months !</li>
            <li> Darn I should have gotten an unscented product.  In my opinion, this has a very strong odor. I LOVE the way my skin feels but the smell is just too much.</li>
            <li> Should have read the ingredient label; loaded with parabens and too light for my dry skin.  If you are not concerned with ingredients and have normal skin, you will like the silky feel.</li>
            <li> Great product no longer available in Canada. I love the way it works and I love its size.Bring it back to Canada.</li>
            <li> you ...... will ........... love .......... this ..................item ............ without ......... a ........ doubt ......... I ......... promise ........ you</li>
            <li> Love the light scent and texture. This is my favorite body lotion, especially in the summer when something lighter is preferred.</li>
            <li> When I put this lotion on.....it goes on smoothly...but its not good for dry skin...you put it on an hour later you can t even tell you put it on. There used to be some Norweigan Neutrogena Lotion and it was great...Can t find it anymore!!!!!</li>
