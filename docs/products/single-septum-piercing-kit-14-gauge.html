            <li>Worked great for my septum</li>
            <li>This was amazing!</li>
            <li>but I guess I&#x27;ll just wait to get it pierced good waist of money...</li>
            <li>Good sanitary stuff.</li>
            <li>but over all it gave me a good peircing.</li>
            <li>I just got the kit in the mail and was so eager to have a piercing kit for my nose at a good price.</li>
            <li>Great kit, did my own septum &amp; worked out fine.</li>
            <li>But i will say the kit itself was nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best to go to a professional.</li>
            <li>It is an okay kit.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to people who would rather get their septum pierced at home than out in the shops everything is included as shown in the picture overall great product ! :)</li>
            <li>This kit comes with all materials that you need to do a piercing at home and the safe way.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m glad I found this kit, all packaged separately and looks very clean and sterile.</li>
            <li>The kit came with everything pictured and looked very clean and sterile.</li>
            <li>I really do I love my septum and this kit made it so easy to do myself.</li>
            <li>Remember good aftercare, get H2Ocean &amp; Provon Antimicrobial Soap and don&#x27;t touch a fresh piercing without washing your hands first!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 2-3 weeks now and the ring itself is fine c: .</li>
            <li>My piercing came out great because of this kit but the ring was way to big on me and some of the wipes I didn&#x27;t know how to use.</li>
            <li>Everything I needed for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Everything was great except the fact that the jewelry was way too big .</li>
            <li>Everything was perfect except that the clap just got in the way and was way to pig and the needle was smaller than the actual piercing so it hurt more putting it</li>
            <li>Thought it was good, except the ring itself is to big for the needle.</li>
            <li>Other than that the kit was great and had everything it said it would.</li>
            <li>The clamps hurt like a Biotch and broke relatively quick.</li>
            <li>Also, the needle was super sharp which made for easy piercing and something nice was that mine came with a iodine swab, which wasn&#x27;t in the product description but greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was good</li>
            <li>The clamp wasn&#x27;t even the right type of clamp to do a septum piercing.</li>
            <li>I got this today, and everything was pretty decent, the only problem was that the needle wasn&#x27;t very sharp, which is kind of the most important part.</li>
            <li>and it all seemed pretty sterile.</li>
            <li>However this company offers pretty cheap and decent septum forceps.</li>
            <li>but the ring was too big and wouldn&#x27;t fit in my nose</li>
            <li>I bought the item and was really please with all the things it came with.</li>
            <li>The clamps weren&#x27;t necessarily for the septum, but they really aren&#x27;t necessary anyway &amp; sometimes cause more pain than the piercing.</li>
            <li>Decent kit, would order again.</li>
            <li>Of course,no could get new jewelry, buf I was looking forward to a lazy fix as honest as the description was.</li>
            <li>The only things that were useful in this kit were the gloves, the needle, and the alcohol pads that it comes with.</li>
            <li>Ring was pretty big .</li>
            <li>All in all, I now have a big hole in my nose with no jewelry that was expected to fit with this.</li>
            <li>is dull, Hurt quite a bit, Other than that its a good kit</li>
            <li>Yet, as I was done with the needle, I found that the horseshoe jewelry for it was too large, and that the clamp was an odd triangle one that was too large for my nose.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty high pain tolerance and I was crying like a baby.</li>
            <li>The needle was pretty sharp being</li>
            <li>This kit is not good fit a septum piercing and doesn&#x27;t even come with everything it says.</li>
            <li>Came with everything I needed and it looks good in my septum, but it hurt sooooo bad.</li>

            <li> Came with everything I needed and it looks good in my septum, but it hurt sooooo bad.</li>
            <li> so I found my whole but pointless.</li>
            <li> the needle is supposed to be super sharp and have almost painless peircing but the needle had a hard time going through</li>
            <li> Has everything expected from a basic piercing kit.</li>
            <li> Also when you are about to pull the needle through your septum put the jewelry in the other end.</li>
            <li> The jewelry was to small to go threw my nose and the needle and the jewelry are the same size.</li>
            <li> usually when piercing your nose you need a need one size bigger to make it easier.  </li>
            <li> Other than that 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The needle is decently sharp, but the forceps are not for septum piercings.</li>
            <li> The clamp shown in the picture is not the clamp they give you, they include a short, fat clamp that is hard to use.</li>
            <li> (I have an average sized nose)</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little tricky to get in.</li>
            <li> The horseshoe it comes with is way to big to be a septum and looks really dumb in your nose.</li>
            <li> The only things I didn&#x27;t like is the clamps were not for a septum at all (which is what I bought it for), and the barbell was HUGE and looked terrible as a septum piercing.</li>
            <li> The only bad things is that the clamp isnt a septum clamp and is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> If you have a small nose and you&#x27;re going to try and hide this.. it wont work.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> it even came with a ring, however, the ring was a gauge size too big from the needle, and I unfortunately didn&#x27;t notice until it came time for piercing.</li>
            <li> The needle is to small for the jewellery</li>
            <li> I could hardly flip it up.</li>
            <li> the clamp was not a good choice for septum peircings</li>
            <li> But at least it works!</li>
            <li> Too bad clamp isn&#x27;t for septum peicing..</li>
            <li> Really stupid and unprofessional to sell it like that</li>

            <li> I got this today, and everything was pretty decent, the only problem was that the needle wasn&#x27;t very sharp, which is kind of the most important part. It didn&#x27;t hurt but it got stuck in my scar tissue. Another thing is the ring is a bit too big so it&#x27;s a little tricky to get in. But at least it works!</li>
            <li> everything in the package was there but the ring was too big and wouldn&#x27;t fit in my nose (I have an average sized nose)</li>
            <li> If you have a small nose and you&#x27;re going to try and hide this.. it wont work. The ring is too big. I pierced mine and only kept it in for like 10 minutes because i knew it was going to be to big to hide. I could hardly flip it up. But i will say the kit itself was nice. Everything was there and it all seemed pretty sterile.</li>
            <li> Well I ordered this hoping to get my septum pierced finally! But it didn&#x27;t even come So I&#x27;m pretty disappointed but I guess I&#x27;ll just wait to get it pierced good waist of money...</li>
            <li> My piercing came out great because of this kit but the ring was way to big on me and some of the wipes I didn&#x27;t know how to use.</li>
            <li> Everything I needed for such a great price. I&#x27;ve always done my piercings at home, but had to buy everything separately. So I&#x27;m glad I found this kit, all packaged separately and looks very clean and sterile.</li>
            <li> This was amazing! It came with everything you need to pierce your septum! I would definitely recommend this to all of my friends!&lt;br /&gt;Great job!</li>
            <li> Made the job all easier for my gf to do it herself.</li>
            <li> I only wish the kit came in a smaller gauge and a wider barbell. Other than that the kit was great and had everything it said it would. Also when you are about to pull the needle through your septum put the jewelry in the other end.</li>
            <li> The jewelry was to small to go threw my nose and the needle and the jewelry are the same size. usually when piercing your nose you need a need one size bigger to make it easier.  The clamps hurt like a Biotch and broke relatively quick. I like all the sanitizers and lube tho</li>
            <li> Came with everything I needed and it looks good in my septum, but it hurt sooooo bad. I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Everything was great, it came faster then it said it would. I recommend this this kit for anybody who is doing it themselves. I&#x27;ve had it for 2-3 weeks now and the ring itself is fine c: .</li>
            <li> Second time buying from this seller. Totally recommended! Has everything you need for the piercing.</li>
            <li> Great kit, did my own septum &amp; worked out fine. Dont be scared guys. Just do hw on how to do it and its a breeze. Not rocket science</li>
            <li> Everything was great except the fact that the jewelry was way too big .</li>
            <li> Has everything expected from a basic piercing kit. No issues</li>
            <li> This kit came with everything needed to do either a septum, belly button or lip piercing. The clamps weren&#x27;t necessarily for the septum, but they really aren&#x27;t necessary anyway &amp; sometimes cause more pain than the piercing. You can always get a receiving tube for the needle. Remember good aftercare, get H2Ocean &amp; Provon Antimicrobial Soap and don&#x27;t touch a fresh piercing without washing your hands first!! Decent kit, would order again.</li>
            <li> Ring was pretty big . Other than that it was good (:</li>
            <li> Needle it came with is dull, Hurt quite a bit, Other than that its a good kit</li>
            <li> Too bad clamp isn&#x27;t for septum peicing.. Other than that 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought the item and was really please with all the things it came with. it even came with a ring, however, the ring was a gauge size too big from the needle, and I unfortunately didn&#x27;t notice until it came time for piercing. so I ended up trying to use something else I had, but none of my rings were a size 14g so I pierced my septum thinking i could just shove a ring through, but it didn&#x27;t work so I found my whole but pointless.</li>
            <li> The needle is decently sharp, but the forceps are not for septum piercings. However this company offers pretty cheap and decent septum forceps. The needle is NOT a 14g needle, so you have to force the ring through, it is not the ring, as I tried all my 14g rings. Good sanitary stuff.</li>
            <li> It is an okay kit. The clamps would get stuck and are not for a septum piercing. The horseshoe it comes with is way to big to be a septum and looks really dumb in your nose. The needle was pretty sharp being I used it three times.</li>
            <li> the clamp was not a good choice for septum peircings so i went without it. the needle is supposed to be super sharp and have almost painless peircing but the needle had a hard time going through but over all it gave me a good peircing.</li>
            <li> perfect piercing kit if you would prefer getting your septum pierced at home than in a shop i love it! would recommend this product to people who would rather get their septum pierced at home than out in the shops everything is included as shown in the picture overall great product ! :)</li>
            <li> The clamp shown in the picture is not the clamp they give you, they include a short, fat clamp that is hard to use. Also, they should include some sort of guideline or instruction.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the reviews that I read about it and the reason why I rated it 3 stars is because 1. The Jewelry was too big and I had to get a 16g ring to go into the 14g needle, as I knew this would be the case I assumed that the company did too. 2. The clamp wasn&#x27;t even the right type of clamp to do a septum piercing. 3. The only things that were useful in this kit were the gloves, the needle, and the alcohol pads that it comes with. If you order this kit you will need to buy a 16g ring and be prepared to use your hands instead of a clamp.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my septum</li>
            <li> When I got the product in, I immediately realized that the clamp was different than the one in the photo. The one I recieved was way smaller and shaped differently, but that was no big deal because I wanted a clamp with a tube instead. Everything else was perfectly accounted for. Also, the needle was super sharp which made for easy piercing and something nice was that mine came with a iodine swab, which wasn&#x27;t in the product description but greatly appreciated. Over all, good buy!</li>
            <li> I really do I love my septum and this kit made it so easy to do myself. Everything was sterile and in individual packaging!</li>
            <li> Trust me if your trying to pierce yourself it&#x27;s best to go to a professional. This kit is not good fit a septum piercing and doesn&#x27;t even come with everything it says. The needle is to small for the jewellery and if you try to force it, you&#x27;re in for a lot of pain. I have a pretty high pain tolerance and I was crying like a baby.</li>
            <li> The kit came with everything pictured and looked very clean and sterile. The only things I didn&#x27;t like is the clamps were not for a septum at all (which is what I bought it for), and the barbell was HUGE and looked terrible as a septum piercing.</li>
            <li> This kit comes with all materials that you need to do a piercing at home and the safe way. The only bad things is that the clamp isnt a septum clamp and is pretty much useless. I recommend just buying a separate septum clamp.</li>
            <li> I just got the kit in the mail and was so eager to have a piercing kit for my nose at a good price. Yet, as I was done with the needle, I found that the horseshoe jewelry for it was too large, and that the clamp was an odd triangle one that was too large for my nose. All in all, I now have a big hole in my nose with no jewelry that was expected to fit with this. Of course,no could get new jewelry, buf I was looking forward to a lazy fix as honest as the description was. Hooray for the tunnel that lays in my septum .</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect except that the clap just got in the way and was way to pig and the needle was smaller than the actual piercing so it hurt more putting it in I had to get a diffrent ring and it was too big.. But it worked to the extent that I have my septum done!</li>
            <li> Thought it was good, except the ring itself is to big for the needle. Really stupid and unprofessional to sell it like that if you ask me. Never buying from this shop again.</li>
            <li> Great! I had no problems</li>
