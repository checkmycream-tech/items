            <li>We are very happy with how this Proactive BB cream works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect BB cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the cream I reach for when I want to look my best, because it doesn&#x27;t even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>in all... a great face cream.</li>
            <li>so it is a great product for me.  </li>
            <li>I am really happy with this BB cream.</li>
            <li>and it is a great regimen.  </li>
            <li>The SPF of 15 is an ok strength but 30-45 is best for protection.</li>
            <li>I.was pleasantly</li>
            <li>Because of this, the light shade is the perfect one for me at the moment, by the end of summer I will need to order the medium color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Proactiv BB Cream contains both vitamins E and C, which is good.</li>
            <li>It does a good job hydrating my skin, as well as offering a protective moist layer against winter winds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s marketed as fragrance-free, which is good.</li>
            <li>The cream has good consistency and isn&#x27;t cakey, and blends well into skin.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Not oily like some others so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>I feel good knowing it has SPF 15.  </li>
            <li>She is fair of skin and has been advised to use SPF 30 when out in the sun.</li>
            <li>This may be a good product for those who can get by with a SPF of 15.</li>
            <li>great, not horrible, but rather</li>
            <li>, it is easy to use, it is an excellent moisturizer and it gives me a healthy look.</li>
            <li>This cream is very light and provided good coverage.</li>
            <li>BB Cream smells like the kind of sunscreen you put on your kids for a day at the beach.</li>
            <li>It does not wear off or smudge and seems to be effective as a sun screen.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is still nice to have if you don&#x27;t want to apply color to your face and have to deal with moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li>Seemed light, non-greasy, not smelly, not too tinted, and generally pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer, but the color is very light</li>
            <li>’s also quickly absorbed and it blends over the skin living a perfect clean look and feel.</li>
            <li>not so strong.- more like a pleasant sunscreen smell.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the controversial ingredients found in this cream, I found this product to be….not</li>
            <li>The color was good as well, I often wear light foundation and the color matched my skin</li>
            <li>That kind of product is okay for beach days, but I don&#x27;t want to wear it every day on my face.</li>
            <li>So Proactiv might be a good cream for the vitamins E and C, nourishing your skin and keeping it healthy -- but add a high SPF sunscreen on top of it if you&#x27;re going out into bright sunlight.reen on top of it if you&#x27;re going out into bright sunlight.</li>
            <li>cream is very light in weight and goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t work as a foundation unless you have very light skin, in which case you probably could use more than SPF 15.</li>
            <li>I honesty don’t know how, but my skin looks better after applying this.</li>
            <li>And what I like the most, is that there is not difference between my face skin color and my neck.</li>
            <li>– just okay.  </li>
            <li>So in that way, Proactiv is better.</li>
            <li>The coverage was smooth and I wore it while in the sun and did not have a burn at the end of the day!</li>
            <li>While many BB creams do have sunscreen in them, this product is not a BB cream.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>It seems to focus on the SPF more than anything else.</li>
            <li>I also like that it gives me a more healthy look</li>
            <li>It wraps both steps into one, and if you tend to otherwise skip using something with SPF, this will do a lot to help keep your skin healthy.</li>
            <li>up&amp;#34; anything, it did help make my skin tone look more even.</li>
            <li>It moisturized my face pretty good and didn&#x27;t cause me to break out</li>
            <li>This was a super nice BB cream.</li>
            <li>SPF 15, so not too strong but better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>Good in concept, but perhaps is trying to do too much.</li>
            <li>I can easily see where a woman who uses cosmetics on her face might not like this product or be fooled by what it is and duplicate what she has.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It went on easily.</li>
            <li>It sort of smells like sunscreen but not quite as strong.  </li>
            <li>As a moisturizer, I’d say it was average at best.</li>
            <li>Instead, it is a wonderfully light, nongreasy cream that spreads easily all over your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light skin colored and is not too strong to cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li>I have several other BB creams that I like much better (they are my go-to creams when I want to look my best) to even out skin tone and make me look good without looking made-up.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a light glow while keeping it moisturized and protected from the sun.</li>
            <li>The light tint is light and doesn&#x27;t turn your skin yellow, which is great, but...</li>
            <li>as they say depending on your complexion and sensitivity to light.</li>
            <li>Proactive BB Cream, Light 1.7 ounce, fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Proactiv&#x27;s BB cream is a light and smooth moisturizer that gives your skin just the slightest hint of a color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free and has no odor.  </li>
            <li>This works as a light moisturizer while giving my face even color.</li>
            <li>It was smooth and spread well.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and doesn&#x27;t smell medicated or weird but very good smell.</li>
            <li>So if you have rosacea, this might be a friendly cream for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I heard that Proactiv had a BB Cream.</li>
            <li>I was excited about receiving this product, a BB cream from renown Rodan &amp; Fields.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, but sometimes light is too light for me, especially if I have a little.color on my face.</li>
            <li>K Estee Lauder Day Wear]], which smells like cucumbers, and feels cool and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A light SPF you wear every day will benefit you more than a strong SPF you only wear on weekends.</li>
            <li>It is the best on the market and only a few dollars more than this Proactiv &amp;#34;BB Cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My daughter has been using this cream for several weeks and is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>She has had issues with very sensitive skin and eczema, and now that she&#x27;s a teenager, it&#x27;s even more troublesome.  </li>
            <li>This is by FAR the best moisturizing BB cream I&#x27;ve used, hands down.</li>
            <li>This BB Cream is a great base for a natural look with the protection of a sunscreen SPF 15, and is perfect for those times when one feels like not wearing much makeup, but still wants to look good.</li>
            <li>It is an all-in-one face cream, and that sun protection is especially important to us, since we live at 4200&#x27; in southern Arizona.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, this product certainly rubs on easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The negative would be the amount needed to make sure you have good sunscreen coverage.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, while it doesn&#x27;t provide any noticeable coverage, it does have a tint that can rub off on shirt collars, handkerchiefs and so on, so in that respect, it&#x27;d kind of not that great--</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m not talking warm glow red</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hide laugh lines around the eyes though.</li>
            <li>I rated 4 stars for this BB cream because:  -It seems to be not so effective enough for a dress-up occasion because this BB cream seems not to hide</li>
            <li>I liked that this didn&#x27;t make me ghostly white.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much color at all, probably best for a young fresh-faced beauty who doesn&#x27;t have much to cover.</li>
            <li>This creamy solution is just the right thickness and texture.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>To be useful as a cream and for coverage and for sun protection, personally I&#x27;d need something darker and with more sun blockage.</li>
            <li>So, I tend to have an issue with some Proactiv products being way too strong for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>a moisturizer, it is not greasy or creamy, very mild, but it does help the skin stay soft.</li>
            <li>For me, I used some mineral powder over it, and it was good for a less made-up summer look.</li>
            <li>I then use a concealer for age spots, a little blush, lipstick, eye liner, and I am good to go until the afternoon.</li>
            <li>It becomes just that healthy glow I described above.</li>
            <li>The creams that provide the best sunscreen and/or skin tone perfecting are almost always lousy moisturizers and vice versa.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only 15 SPF, which is basically what any product, including most face powders and makeups will give you.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a tinted SPF 15 product.  </li>
            <li>I know that most cosmetics only have SPF 15 for protection</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to my regular Neutrogena Healthy Defense and Jouer Luminizing Moisturizer, this BB Cream looks fine in the morning, but doesn&#x27;t offer nearly the coverage that the Healthy Defense does, and has pretty much disappeared by lunchtime.</li>
            <li>This cream has a light tint and a barely noticeable scent.</li>
            <li>Due to that, I don&#x27;t recommend this BB cream if you have sensitive or fair skin.</li>
            <li>SPF 15 is just right for my normal every day activities, if I were to spend any extended time in the sun, I’d want something stronger.  </li>
            <li>That there&#x27;s not that much difference between an SPF of 15 and 100.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to like this as much as I do.</li>
            <li>thing about SPF is, it is not so much the strength but the consistency.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I do not wear make up or use moisturizer on my face much.</li>
            <li>It is my first time to use a Proactiv product and I was pretty surprised how well this BB cream blended into my skin.</li>
            <li>-I am not sure if SPF 15 is good enough for really hot days, so I may use a sunscreen lotion with a higher SPF before applying this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>It does go on dry, which I think it is a good thing if you don&#x27;t want to get your pores plugged up, but it does make your skin feel dry.</li>
            <li>First of all, the BB Cream vanished completely on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have combo skin and my cheeks tend to get really dry, and the Proactive BB Cream keeps them feeling comfortable without any itchy tightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a lot of respect for the Proactive line, so I had high hopes for this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I really consider 20 SPF the bare minimum with 30 SPF being my general target for a product that is expected to provide any kind of sun protection at all.</li>
            <li>The cream made my face more moist than any other BB cream which I owned so far</li>
            <li>moisturizer during the summer when I have a little tan on my face as it seems to do a better job at evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review with that comparison after I get a little more</li>
            <li>I normally use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It is rather pricey, and I&#x27;m not sure it was good enough to warrant the price being asked for it.</li>
            <li>Compared to Jouer tinted moisturizer at the same price point, Jouer wins hands down with better coverage that lasts all day and still looks natural.</li>
            <li>summary is that it&#x27;s kind of an average BB cream, except that it does provide a higher level of moisture than the other BB creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>So find a face cream you can live with, and then use it all the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to see how this Proactiv product compares to the Jouer as they&#x27;re basically the same price point.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s very sheer.</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife and the first thing she noticed is that the DSPF 15 is too low for her use.</li>
            <li>I applied it to clean skin that had just been washed and I did not put any other products on my face.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product to even out skin tone or provide light coverage for slight unevenness, this product probably isn&#x27;t the one for you.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know which of those chemicals I am sensitive to, but something in the solution made my skin turn red and hot and itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using this in place of my regular tinted moisturizer, Neutrogena Healthy Defense, and it seems to be working about the same, giving me light coverage without a heavy makeup look or feel.</li>
            <li>I only wish the SPF were higher, as 15 doesn&#x27;t buy me much time outside.  </li>
            <li>The producer of this product should clearly state its use which it does not on Amazon.</li>
            <li>For these reasons, I am back and forth whether I really like the product or if it eh....</li>
            <li>I have been using this BB cream for about 5 months now as a base, the shade &#x27;Light&#x27; works well with my florescent Irish skin (lol).</li>
            <li>my daughter has really sensitive skin and this one works well with her.  </li>
            <li>It goes on soft and absorbs quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s combination oily/dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The down side is that it is full of parabens which are ingredients that we try to avoid.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that I could get decent makeup coverage and clear my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s main purpose is as a sunscreen which it says on the back</li>
            <li>so this is right in line with other make</li>
            <li>Not horrible or over-powering, but not good either.</li>
            <li>I end up using more than I would normally when I use tinted moisturizer, so not sure if Pro Active tinted cream is cost efficient.</li>
            <li>Most of my creams and lotions are SPF 15, so this has no advantage there, but at least it does provide a tiny bit of protection from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has broad spectrum SPF 15.  </li>
            <li>The opening to dispense the cream is very small and makes it easy to control the amount of cream that is dispensed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has sort of a natural look, as if I were wearing no makeup, but at the same time, it has a radiance it didn’t have before.</li>
            <li>I like carrying something like this in my purse for unexpected outside expeditions.</li>
            <li>The tint may look a bit dark when you first apply it, but it blends in and becomes unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li>The derm didn&#x27;t recomment Proactive specifically, but my daughter has had no skin issues with using this cream on a near daily basis.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the night I came home and washed my face only to discover two new big pimples on my chin.</li>
            <li>So far it really didn&#x27;t help with acne, but she really doesn&#x27;t have serious acne problem.</li>
            <li>I should mention that I normally do not break out with my normal BB Cream (Smashbox).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to cover blemishes as well as the Healthy Defense, but I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m having bad breakouts</li>
            <li>I use Bare Minerals powder foundation over it daily</li>
            <li>That was probably from the amount I used and it may be less sticky if you used less of the product, but it would also be less effective against a sun burn.</li>
            <li>I didn’t feel like my skin was tight or dry, nor did it feel very hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>was not previously familiar with Proactive products, but now that they are on my radar, I will almost certainly get their products in the future.</li>

            <li> It wraps both steps into one, and if you tend to otherwise skip using something with SPF, this will do a lot to help keep your skin healthy.</li>
            <li> up&amp;#34; anything, it did help make my skin tone look more even.</li>
            <li> It moisturized my face pretty good and didn&#x27;t cause me to break out</li>
            <li> This was a super nice BB cream.</li>
            <li> SPF 15, so not too strong but better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> Good in concept, but perhaps is trying to do too much.</li>
            <li> I can easily see where a woman who uses cosmetics on her face might not like this product or be fooled by what it is and duplicate what she has.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It went on easily.</li>
            <li> It sort of smells like sunscreen but not quite as strong.  </li>
            <li> As a moisturizer, I’d say it was average at best.</li>
            <li> Instead, it is a wonderfully light, nongreasy cream that spreads easily all over your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light skin colored and is not too strong to cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li> I have several other BB creams that I like much better (they are my go-to creams when I want to look my best) to even out skin tone and make me look good without looking made-up.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a light glow while keeping it moisturized and protected from the sun.</li>
            <li> The light tint is light and doesn&#x27;t turn your skin yellow, which is great, but...</li>
            <li> as they say depending on your complexion and sensitivity to light.</li>
            <li> Proactive BB Cream, Light 1.7 ounce, fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Proactiv&#x27;s BB cream is a light and smooth moisturizer that gives your skin just the slightest hint of a color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free and has no odor.  </li>
            <li> This works as a light moisturizer while giving my face even color.</li>
            <li> It was smooth and spread well.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice and doesn&#x27;t smell medicated or weird but very good smell.</li>
            <li> So if you have rosacea, this might be a friendly cream for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I heard that Proactiv had a BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I was excited about receiving this product, a BB cream from renown Rodan &amp; Fields.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, but sometimes light is too light for me, especially if I have a little.color on my face.</li>
            <li> K Estee Lauder Day Wear]], which smells like cucumbers, and feels cool and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A light SPF you wear every day will benefit you more than a strong SPF you only wear on weekends.</li>
            <li> It is the best on the market and only a few dollars more than this Proactiv &amp;#34;BB Cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this cream for several weeks and is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> She has had issues with very sensitive skin and eczema, and now that she&#x27;s a teenager, it&#x27;s even more troublesome.  </li>
            <li> This is by FAR the best moisturizing BB cream I&#x27;ve used, hands down.</li>
            <li> This BB Cream is a great base for a natural look with the protection of a sunscreen SPF 15, and is perfect for those times when one feels like not wearing much makeup, but still wants to look good.</li>
            <li> It is an all-in-one face cream, and that sun protection is especially important to us, since we live at 4200&#x27; in southern Arizona.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, this product certainly rubs on easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The negative would be the amount needed to make sure you have good sunscreen coverage.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, while it doesn&#x27;t provide any noticeable coverage, it does have a tint that can rub off on shirt collars, handkerchiefs and so on, so in that respect, it&#x27;d kind of not that great--</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not talking warm glow red</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hide laugh lines around the eyes though.</li>
            <li> I rated 4 stars for this BB cream because:  -It seems to be not so effective enough for a dress-up occasion because this BB cream seems not to hide</li>
            <li> I liked that this didn&#x27;t make me ghostly white.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much color at all, probably best for a young fresh-faced beauty who doesn&#x27;t have much to cover.</li>
            <li> This creamy solution is just the right thickness and texture.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> To be useful as a cream and for coverage and for sun protection, personally I&#x27;d need something darker and with more sun blockage.</li>
            <li> So, I tend to have an issue with some Proactiv products being way too strong for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> a moisturizer, it is not greasy or creamy, very mild, but it does help the skin stay soft.</li>
            <li> For me, I used some mineral powder over it, and it was good for a less made-up summer look.</li>
            <li> I then use a concealer for age spots, a little blush, lipstick, eye liner, and I am good to go until the afternoon.</li>
            <li> It becomes just that healthy glow I described above.</li>
            <li> The creams that provide the best sunscreen and/or skin tone perfecting are almost always lousy moisturizers and vice versa.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only 15 SPF, which is basically what any product, including most face powders and makeups will give you.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a tinted SPF 15 product.  </li>
            <li> I know that most cosmetics only have SPF 15 for protection</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to my regular Neutrogena Healthy Defense and Jouer Luminizing Moisturizer, this BB Cream looks fine in the morning, but doesn&#x27;t offer nearly the coverage that the Healthy Defense does, and has pretty much disappeared by lunchtime.</li>
            <li> This cream has a light tint and a barely noticeable scent.</li>
            <li> Due to that, I don&#x27;t recommend this BB cream if you have sensitive or fair skin.</li>
            <li> SPF 15 is just right for my normal every day activities, if I were to spend any extended time in the sun, I’d want something stronger.  </li>
            <li> That there&#x27;s not that much difference between an SPF of 15 and 100.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like this as much as I do.</li>
            <li> thing about SPF is, it is not so much the strength but the consistency.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I do not wear make up or use moisturizer on my face much.</li>
            <li> It is my first time to use a Proactiv product and I was pretty surprised how well this BB cream blended into my skin.</li>
            <li> -I am not sure if SPF 15 is good enough for really hot days, so I may use a sunscreen lotion with a higher SPF before applying this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> It does go on dry, which I think it is a good thing if you don&#x27;t want to get your pores plugged up, but it does make your skin feel dry.</li>
            <li> First of all, the BB Cream vanished completely on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin and my cheeks tend to get really dry, and the Proactive BB Cream keeps them feeling comfortable without any itchy tightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a lot of respect for the Proactive line, so I had high hopes for this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I really consider 20 SPF the bare minimum with 30 SPF being my general target for a product that is expected to provide any kind of sun protection at all.</li>
            <li> The cream made my face more moist than any other BB cream which I owned so far</li>
            <li> moisturizer during the summer when I have a little tan on my face as it seems to do a better job at evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review with that comparison after I get a little more</li>
            <li> I normally use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It is rather pricey, and I&#x27;m not sure it was good enough to warrant the price being asked for it.</li>
            <li> Compared to Jouer tinted moisturizer at the same price point, Jouer wins hands down with better coverage that lasts all day and still looks natural.</li>
            <li> summary is that it&#x27;s kind of an average BB cream, except that it does provide a higher level of moisture than the other BB creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So find a face cream you can live with, and then use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be interested to see how this Proactiv product compares to the Jouer as they&#x27;re basically the same price point.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s very sheer.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and the first thing she noticed is that the DSPF 15 is too low for her use.</li>
            <li> I applied it to clean skin that had just been washed and I did not put any other products on my face.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product to even out skin tone or provide light coverage for slight unevenness, this product probably isn&#x27;t the one for you.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know which of those chemicals I am sensitive to, but something in the solution made my skin turn red and hot and itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using this in place of my regular tinted moisturizer, Neutrogena Healthy Defense, and it seems to be working about the same, giving me light coverage without a heavy makeup look or feel.</li>
            <li> I only wish the SPF were higher, as 15 doesn&#x27;t buy me much time outside.  </li>
            <li> The producer of this product should clearly state its use which it does not on Amazon.</li>
            <li> For these reasons, I am back and forth whether I really like the product or if it eh....</li>
            <li> I have been using this BB cream for about 5 months now as a base, the shade &#x27;Light&#x27; works well with my florescent Irish skin (lol).</li>
            <li> my daughter has really sensitive skin and this one works well with her.  </li>
            <li> It goes on soft and absorbs quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s combination oily/dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The down side is that it is full of parabens which are ingredients that we try to avoid.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that I could get decent makeup coverage and clear my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s main purpose is as a sunscreen which it says on the back</li>
            <li> so this is right in line with other make</li>
            <li> Not horrible or over-powering, but not good either.</li>
            <li> I end up using more than I would normally when I use tinted moisturizer, so not sure if Pro Active tinted cream is cost efficient.</li>
            <li> Most of my creams and lotions are SPF 15, so this has no advantage there, but at least it does provide a tiny bit of protection from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has broad spectrum SPF 15.  </li>
            <li> The opening to dispense the cream is very small and makes it easy to control the amount of cream that is dispensed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has sort of a natural look, as if I were wearing no makeup, but at the same time, it has a radiance it didn’t have before.</li>
            <li> I like carrying something like this in my purse for unexpected outside expeditions.</li>
            <li> The tint may look a bit dark when you first apply it, but it blends in and becomes unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li> The derm didn&#x27;t recomment Proactive specifically, but my daughter has had no skin issues with using this cream on a near daily basis.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the night I came home and washed my face only to discover two new big pimples on my chin.</li>
            <li> So far it really didn&#x27;t help with acne, but she really doesn&#x27;t have serious acne problem.</li>
            <li> I should mention that I normally do not break out with my normal BB Cream (Smashbox).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to cover blemishes as well as the Healthy Defense, but I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m having bad breakouts</li>
            <li> I use Bare Minerals powder foundation over it daily</li>
            <li> That was probably from the amount I used and it may be less sticky if you used less of the product, but it would also be less effective against a sun burn.</li>
            <li> I didn’t feel like my skin was tight or dry, nor did it feel very hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> was not previously familiar with Proactive products, but now that they are on my radar, I will almost certainly get their products in the future.</li>
            <li> and I have less need of a high SPF product.doesn&#x27;t even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> and I have less need of a high SPF product.</li>
            <li> It is, however, a decent cream for everyday use, especially in the winter when its drier</li>
            <li> It is, however, a decent cream for everyday use, especially in the winter when its drier</li>
            <li> I felt like the included tint made a small improvement in my naturally pale complexion, which is fine</li>
            <li> It may have been coincidence, but they&#x27;ve been there a long time, and suddenly after a week of this, they were going away.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I thought was a bit strange is that it says you should reapply every two hours which seems like overkill.</li>
            <li> only use Beta-Ginseng in the winter, when the air is dry.</li>
            <li> It is a sunscreen, and a light (SPF 15) and expensive (currently ($35.95) one at that.</li>
            <li> Sunscreens are particularly tough and while this wouldn&#x27;t subsitute for full on sun screen, 15 SPF is still pretty effective and it at least provides base protection on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I just have minor imperfections.  </li>
            <li> My face tends to be dry</li>
            <li> So the SPF is average (and actually what you might expect from face products that aren&#x27;t specifically sunscreens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel tight, it makes it flaky, and it makes it red.  </li>
            <li> I’m writing this in the middle of the spring, after a long winter, so I’m still very pale.</li>
            <li> I assumed (wrongly) that it was going to be either an especially oily lotion or an unpleasantly greasy cream, as far too many creams in this price range are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m trying to cover extreme imperfections, either.  </li>
            <li> Initially, due to the proactive brand name, I thought it was also a skin treatment, but it turns out that the FDA doesn&#x27;t allow companies to combine sunscreen and blemish treatment.</li>
            <li> Here are the active ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have some left on your hands, however, and rub them on a white towel, you will leave brown stains behind.</li>
            <li> my opinion….this is just another average product, with an inflated price tag.</li>

            <li> What I noticed after a week of using it though, was that my skin was actually softer and the small bumps I usually have on my forehead diminished.</li>
            <li> There was a little bit of sticky feeling while I was wearing it.</li>
            <li> decided to examine the product a little closer.</li>
            <li> It has a slight scent, like suntan lotion, but not necessarily strong or offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face was still uneven and shiny.</li>
            <li> It absorbs instantly and does not leave behind a greasy feel or sheen.  </li>
            <li> With the tint, my uneven coloring disappears.</li>

            <li> take away a star because the description is very confusing.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is tinted but the coverage is so thin that you wouldn&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> but I was not happy about it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I honesty don’t know how, but my skin looks better after applying this. It has sort of a natural look, as if I were wearing no makeup, but at the same time, it has a radiance it didn’t have before. And what I like the most, is that there is not difference between my face skin color and my neck. I’m writing this in the middle of the spring, after a long winter, so I’m still very pale. Because of this, the light shade is the perfect one for me at the moment, by the end of summer I will need to order the medium color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s also quickly absorbed and it blends over the skin living a perfect clean look and feel. It becomes just that healthy glow I described above. I like how it feels in my skin, and the lasting moisturizer effect it leaves on it. This BB Cream is a great base for a natural look with the protection of a sunscreen SPF 15, and is perfect for those times when one feels like not wearing much makeup, but still wants to look good.</li>
            <li> Aside from the controversial ingredients found in this cream, I found this product to be….not great, not horrible, but rather – just okay.  SPF 15 is just right for my normal every day activities, if I were to spend any extended time in the sun, I’d want something stronger.  I felt like the included tint made a small improvement in my naturally pale complexion, which is fine, I wouldn’t want a drastic change or an orange-ish color. As a moisturizer, I’d say it was average at best. I didn’t feel like my skin was tight or dry, nor did it feel very hydrated and soft. It has a slight scent, like suntan lotion, but not necessarily strong or offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion….this is just another average product, with an inflated price tag.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this. Yes, it is tinted but the coverage is so thin that you wouldn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s tinted. It does go on dry, which I think it is a good thing if you don&#x27;t want to get your pores plugged up, but it does make your skin feel dry.I end up using more than I would normally when I use tinted moisturizer, so not sure if Pro Active tinted cream is cost efficient. For these reasons, I am back and forth whether I really like the product or if it eh.... But I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a bad product. Just needs some improvement.</li>
            <li> Rosacea varies from person to person. Different things set off the redness in each person, though they usually include extreme cold, extreme heat, sunlight, alcohol, and strenuous exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For skin hydration I normally use [[ASIN:B001FV5XA0 Beta-Ginseng]], which sets off my rosacea, reddening my skin. This Proactiv BB Cream resulted in no rosacea flare ups. So if you have rosacea, this might be a friendly cream for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Proactiv BB Cream contains both vitamins E and C, which is good. Beta-Ginseng (Earth Science keeps changing its name) used to contain vitamin E, but not C. It might not contain either vitamin at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use Beta-Ginseng in the winter, when the air is dry. It does a good job hydrating my skin, as well as offering a protective moist layer against winter winds. Yet still, my skin reddens from using Beta-Ginseng, even if there are no winds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv BB Cream is drier than Beta-Ginseng, so it might not hydrate as well. At least, it doesn&#x27;t feel as moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a brownish cream, but if you rub it in, its hue won&#x27;t be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s marketed as fragrance-free, which is good. Yet it still has an unpleasant scent. Not horrible or over-powering, but not good either. Beta-Ginseng (also fragrance-free) smells a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Proactiv BB Cream has an SPF of 15. Beta-Ginseng has no SPF. So in that way, Proactiv is better. However, being a fair-skinned person with rosacea, I prefer the highest SPF I can find. I usually use sunscreens with an SPF of 100 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, \\&quot;experts\\&quot; say there&#x27;s a rate of diminishing returns on the SPF scale. That there&#x27;s not that much difference between an SPF of 15 and 100. The former might block 90% of sun rays, while the latter gets 98%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, I prefer the highest SPF possible. So Proactiv might be a good cream for the vitamins E and C, nourishing your skin and keeping it healthy -- but add a high SPF sunscreen on top of it if you&#x27;re going out into bright sunlight.reen on top of it if you&#x27;re going out into bright sunlight.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like this as much as I do. I assumed (wrongly) that it was going to be either an especially oily lotion or an unpleasantly greasy cream, as far too many creams in this price range are. Instead, it is a wonderfully light, nongreasy cream that spreads easily all over your skin. The tint gives it a cosmetic touch, evening out skin tone. Most of my creams and lotions are SPF 15, so this has no advantage there, but at least it does provide a tiny bit of protection from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not previously familiar with Proactive products, but now that they are on my radar, I will almost certainly get their products in the future.</li>
            <li> The SPF of 15 is an ok strength but 30-45 is best for protection. I have been using this BB cream for about 5 months now as a base, the shade &#x27;Light&#x27; works well with my florescent Irish skin (lol). I then use a concealer for age spots, a little blush, lipstick, eye liner, and I am good to go until the afternoon.</li>
            <li> my daughter has really sensitive skin and this one works well with her.  It&#x27;s light skin colored and is not too strong to cause any irritation.  The scent is very nice and doesn&#x27;t smell medicated or weird but very good smell. So far it really didn&#x27;t help with acne, but she really doesn&#x27;t have serious acne problem. The cream has good consistency and isn&#x27;t cakey, and blends well into skin.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This was a super nice BB cream. The coverage was smooth and I wore it while in the sun and did not have a burn at the end of the day! The color was good as well, I often wear light foundation and the color matched my skin well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative would be the amount needed to make sure you have good sunscreen coverage. There was a little bit of sticky feeling while I was wearing it. That was probably from the amount I used and it may be less sticky if you used less of the product, but it would also be less effective against a sun burn.</li>
            <li> We are very happy with how this Proactive BB cream works. It gives my skin a light glow while keeping it moisturized and protected from the sun. It goes on soft and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The down side is that it is full of parabens which are ingredients that we try to avoid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect BB cream. The creams that provide the best sunscreen and/or skin tone perfecting are almost always lousy moisturizers and vice versa. Anyway, I keep looking. I have a lot of respect for the Proactive line, so I had high hopes for this BB cream. Here is my breakdown of its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for moisturizing. This is by FAR the best moisturizing BB cream I&#x27;ve used, hands down. In fact, it&#x27;s the only BB cream I&#x27;ve found in all the brands I&#x27;ve tried that actually seems to do well in the moisturizing department. I have combo skin and my cheeks tend to get really dry, and the Proactive BB Cream keeps them feeling comfortable without any itchy tightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for coverage/tint. The light tint is light and doesn&#x27;t turn your skin yellow, which is great, but... If you are looking for a product to even out skin tone or provide light coverage for slight unevenness, this product probably isn&#x27;t the one for you. I have several other BB creams that I like much better (they are my go-to creams when I want to look my best) to even out skin tone and make me look good without looking made-up. Unfortunately, while it doesn&#x27;t provide any noticeable coverage, it does have a tint that can rub off on shirt collars, handkerchiefs and so on, so in that respect, it&#x27;d kind of not that great--just average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for sunscreen. It&#x27;s only 15 SPF, which is basically what any product, including most face powders and makeups will give you. I really consider 20 SPF the bare minimum with 30 SPF being my general target for a product that is expected to provide any kind of sun protection at all. So the SPF is average (and actually what you might expect from face products that aren&#x27;t specifically sunscreens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My summary is that it&#x27;s kind of an average BB cream, except that it does provide a higher level of moisture than the other BB creams I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not the cream I reach for when I want to look my best, because it doesn&#x27;t even out my skin tone. It is, however, a decent cream for everyday use, especially in the winter when its drier and I have less need of a high SPF product.doesn&#x27;t even out my skin tone. It is, however, a decent cream for everyday use, especially in the winter when its drier and I have less need of a high SPF product.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I heard that Proactiv had a BB Cream. I was hoping that I could get decent makeup coverage and clear my skin at the same time. Unfortunately, that is not the case with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the BB Cream the moment it arrived. I applied it to clean skin that had just been washed and I did not put any other products on my face. First of all, the BB Cream vanished completely on my skin. It did not look like I was wearing makeup at all. My face was still uneven and shiny. I decided to wear it all day without anything else anyhow to test it out. At the end of the night I came home and washed my face only to discover two new big pimples on my chin. I don&#x27;t know if this is a coincidence or if the Proactiv made me break out, but I was not happy about it. I should mention that I normally do not break out with my normal BB Cream (Smashbox).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to examine the product a little closer. It actually says on the back that the purpose is &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34;. While many BB creams do have sunscreen in them, this product is not a BB cream. It is a sunscreen, and a light (SPF 15) and expensive (currently ($35.95) one at that. The fact that this is a sunscreen explains why I broke out. I break out when I wear plain sunscreen. I do not breakout with BB Cream that has sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product. If you are looking for a BB Cream or even a sunscreen for your face, try Smashbox BB Cream. It is the best on the market and only a few dollars more than this Proactiv &amp;#34;BB Cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Good in concept, but perhaps is trying to do too much. Nice moisturizer, but the color is very light so it doesn&#x27;t work as a foundation unless you have very light skin, in which case you probably could use more than SPF 15. To be useful as a cream and for coverage and for sun protection, personally I&#x27;d need something darker and with more sun blockage. &amp;#34;Your mileage may vary&amp;#34; as they say depending on your complexion and sensitivity to light.</li>
            <li> My wife likes how the subtle color in this face cream makes her skin look, without the bother of applying something heavier.  She says it also moisturizes well, and, of course, has some sun protection.  It is an all-in-one face cream, and that sun protection is especially important to us, since we live at 4200&#x27; in southern Arizona.</li>
            <li> I think this product is stronger than it needs to be. Here are the active ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Octinoxate 7.5%&lt;br /&gt;Octisalate 5.0%&lt;br /&gt;Oxybenzone 3.0%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know which of those chemicals I am sensitive to, but something in the solution made my skin turn red and hot and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BB Cream smells like the kind of sunscreen you put on your kids for a day at the beach. That kind of product is okay for beach days, but I don&#x27;t want to wear it every day on my face. I prefer a gentler product, like [[ASIN:B004OFI54K Estee Lauder Day Wear]], which smells like cucumbers, and feels cool and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing about SPF is, it is not so much the strength but the consistency. A light SPF you wear every day will benefit you more than a strong SPF you only wear on weekends. So find a face cream you can live with, and then use it all the time. Your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> This cream is very light and provided good coverage. Not oily like some others so that&#x27;s good.  It moisturized my face pretty good and didn&#x27;t cause me to break out so that was a plus. It sort of smells like sunscreen but not quite as strong.  It is rather pricey, and I&#x27;m not sure it was good enough to warrant the price being asked for it. SPF 15, so not too strong but better than nothing.  Good product but seems to be too pricey.</li>
            <li> Proactive BB Cream, Light 1.7 ounce, fragrance free.  I love this cream.  It has broad spectrum SPF 15.  It has a hint of tint, so I use it as foundation.  I feel good knowing it has SPF 15.  This creamy solution is just the right thickness and texture.  This tube has sun protection measures on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So, I tend to have an issue with some Proactiv products being way too strong for my sensitive skin.  However, I decided to try the BB cream out since I tried the Proactiv+ Revitalizing Pads and they, while somewhat underwhelming, did not cause my skin any damage.  The same can not be said for this BB cream.  Unfortunately, the same problems that I have with Proactiv&#x27;s anti-acne formula is present here.  It makes my skin feel tight, it makes it flaky, and it makes it red.  Now, I&#x27;m not talking warm glow red, I&#x27;m talking third degree sunburn red.  It was bad...and it didn&#x27;t fade until Day 3.  Due to that, I don&#x27;t recommend this BB cream if you have sensitive or fair skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using this in place of my regular tinted moisturizer, Neutrogena Healthy Defense, and it seems to be working about the same, giving me light coverage without a heavy makeup look or feel. It doesn&#x27;t seem to cover blemishes as well as the Healthy Defense, but I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m having bad breakouts right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Jouer tinted &amp;#34;luminizing&amp;#34; moisturizer during the summer when I have a little tan on my face as it seems to do a better job at evening out my skin tone. I&#x27;ll be interested to see how this Proactiv product compares to the Jouer as they&#x27;re basically the same price point. I&#x27;ll update this review with that comparison after I get a little more sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 1 month of use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to my regular Neutrogena Healthy Defense and Jouer Luminizing Moisturizer, this BB Cream looks fine in the morning, but doesn&#x27;t offer nearly the coverage that the Healthy Defense does, and has pretty much disappeared by lunchtime. Compared to Jouer tinted moisturizer at the same price point, Jouer wins hands down with better coverage that lasts all day and still looks natural.</li>
            <li> I was excited about receiving this product, a BB cream from renown Rodan &amp; Fields. Imagine my horror to see that among the list of ingredients were methylparaben, polyparaben, and butylparaben! I am not going to put this on my skin, nor will I give it to someone to try. Color me gobsmacked and buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Seemed light, non-greasy, not smelly, not too tinted, and generally pleasant.  I only wish the SPF were higher, as 15 doesn&#x27;t buy me much time outside.  I like carrying something like this in my purse for unexpected outside expeditions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why anyone would want to purchase this product.  First, it&#x27;s very sheer. As in NO coverage at all.  For a tinted moisture cream you would expect some sort of coverage.  I put it on and rubbed it in.  Nothing!  So, I decided to put my makeup over it.  No!  It flaked off all over my face.  I had to remove it all to put on makeup.  So my conclusion is, you can only use this as a sunscreen.  And even then it&#x27;s only SPF15.  I&#x27;ll use it when I&#x27;m at home by the pool.  Otherwise, I can&#x27;t use it at all.  I won&#x27;t go out in public without covering all my skin imperfections.  And this product does nothing to cover those at all.  I just have minor imperfections.  It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m trying to cover extreme imperfections, either.  This is just a bunch of nothingness!!  There&#x27;s cheaper sunscreen out there.</li>
            <li> Proactiv&#x27;s BB cream is a light and smooth moisturizer that gives your skin just the slightest hint of a color tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BB cream comes in a small plastic squeeze tube with a twist off cap.  The opening to dispense the cream is very small and makes it easy to control the amount of cream that is dispensed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very light in weight and goes on very smoothly.  It absorbs instantly and does not leave behind a greasy feel or sheen.  It&#x27;s fragrance free and has no odor.  The tint may look a bit dark when you first apply it, but it blends in and becomes unnoticeable.  Nobody asked me why I was wearing foundation, or anything like that.  I have olive-colored skin that&#x27;s combination oily/dry and sensitive.  Sometimes my skin can be a bit red and blotchy and the Proactive BB cream smooths out my completion a bit.  I&#x27;ve not had any reaction to it, or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... a great face cream.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a tinted SPF 15 product.  Proactiv BB Cream is an expensive moisturizing creme.  I tested the 1.7 fluid ounce &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version (it also comes in medium and dark).  After application, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel unpleasant, and, although &amp;#34;fragrance-free,&amp;#34; the product has the odor of, well, sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like underarm deodorant products that sell for $20 and up, I guess there&#x27;s a market for very expensive, non-prescription, tinted sunscreen moisturizers.  Oh, and did I mention... not water or sweat resistant? On the positive side, this product certainly rubs on easily and quickly.  If you have some left on your hands, however, and rub them on a white towel, you will leave brown stains behind.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I do not wear make up or use moisturizer on my face much. This works as a light moisturizer while giving my face even color. It does not wear off or smudge and seems to be effective as a sun screen. I know that most cosmetics only have SPF 15 for protection so this is right in line with other make up.&lt;br /&gt;As a moisturizer, it is not greasy or creamy, very mild, but it does help the skin stay soft. With the tint, my uneven coloring disappears. It doesn&#x27;t hide laugh lines around the eyes though. And I don&#x27;t think it is meant to. But for someone who does not use a lot of skincare products, this is so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take away a star because the description is very confusing. I can easily see where a woman who uses cosmetics on her face might not like this product or be fooled by what it is and duplicate what she has. The producer of this product should clearly state its use which it does not on Amazon. It seems to focus on the SPF more than anything else. If Proactive targeted a user like myself, they would probably do well.</li>
            <li> It is my first time to use a Proactiv product and I was pretty surprised how well this BB cream blended into my skin. It was smooth and spread well. The cream made my face more moist than any other BB cream which I owned so far and it does not leave any greasy feeling on my face. My face tends to be dry so it is a great product for me.  I like the smell - not so strong.- more like a pleasant sunscreen smell.  I also like that it gives me a more healthy look so I will use this cream for day to day activities like going out to walk the dog, going grocery shopping, etc.  I rated 4 stars for this BB cream because:  -It seems to be not so effective enough for a dress-up occasion because this BB cream seems not to hide well my freckles on my face.  -I am not sure if SPF 15 is good enough for really hot days, so I may use a sunscreen lotion with a higher SPF before applying this BB cream.  Overall, I like this BB cream, it is easy to use, it is an excellent moisturizer and it gives me a healthy look.</li>
            <li> This is basically a very faintly tinted sunscreen. Initially, due to the proactive brand name, I thought it was also a skin treatment, but it turns out that the FDA doesn&#x27;t allow companies to combine sunscreen and blemish treatment. Anyway, this is still nice to have if you don&#x27;t want to apply color to your face and have to deal with moisturizer as well. It wraps both steps into one, and if you tend to otherwise skip using something with SPF, this will do a lot to help keep your skin healthy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and the first thing she noticed is that the DSPF 15 is too low for her use. She is fair of skin and has been advised to use SPF 30 when out in the sun. This cream has a light tint and a barely noticeable scent. She could use this if she stayed out of the sun but that is not the way she spends her days. This may be a good product for those who can get by with a SPF of 15.</li>
            <li> I know I should wear sunscreen on my face and especially in the summer or if I&#x27;m not wearing makeup, which does block some of the sun&#x27;s rays, I do try to apply sunscreen. I have moisturizers which contain sunscreen, but to some degree, they all have that strong.chemical sunscreen smell. This one did not! I.was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went on easily. I have fair skin, but sometimes light is too light for me, especially if I have a little.color on my face. I liked that this didn&#x27;t make me ghostly white. There&#x27;s not much color at all, probably best for a young fresh-faced beauty who doesn&#x27;t have much to cover. For me, I used some mineral powder over it, and it was good for a less made-up summer look.</li>
            <li> I have very pale, reactive skin so not all skin care products do well on me. I am really happy with this BB cream. It is tinted and although it doesn&#x27;t really go on heavy and &amp;#34;cover up&amp;#34; anything, it did help make my skin tone look more even. It&#x27;s main purpose is as a sunscreen which it says on the back and it also did its job there. What I noticed after a week of using it though, was that my skin was actually softer and the small bumps I usually have on my forehead diminished. It may have been coincidence, but they&#x27;ve been there a long time, and suddenly after a week of this, they were going away. So I am going to give some credit to this BB cream. It has no scent to it which I also like and isn&#x27;t oily.  I use Bare Minerals powder foundation over it daily and it is a great regimen.  The only thing that I thought was a bit strange is that it says you should reapply every two hours which seems like overkill. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with sun exposure while applying it just once a day, but I also didn&#x27;t sit in the sun either.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this cream for several weeks and is very pleased with it.  She has had issues with very sensitive skin and eczema, and now that she&#x27;s a teenager, it&#x27;s even more troublesome.  We&#x27;ve even taken her to a dermatologist to help control flare ups and get advice.  The derm didn&#x27;t recomment Proactive specifically, but my daughter has had no skin issues with using this cream on a near daily basis.  Sunscreens are particularly tough and while this wouldn&#x27;t subsitute for full on sun screen, 15 SPF is still pretty effective and it at least provides base protection on a regular basis.</li>
