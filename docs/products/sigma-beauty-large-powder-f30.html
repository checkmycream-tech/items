            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love them both.</li>
            <li>I love their kabuki brushes for foundation....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in love for the products of Sigma.</li>
            <li>I have heard a lot of good reviews about sigma brushes and this is my first time ever purchasing a powder brush in my life.</li>
            <li>It does the job, feels amazing, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but I used some superglue and fixed it and have a great brush.</li>
            <li>Great brush so far.</li>
            <li>and they are good as new and</li>
            <li>She loved it as it was very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have spent so much more on brushes that I have not been as happy with.</li>
            <li>This brush is huge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and does not seem to shed too much.</li>
            <li>Great for overall powder application for setting your foundation.</li>
            <li>I got another brush and also got a free e25 mini with that purchase as well.</li>
            <li>This brush is great you can tell its a good brush by how thick the head of the brush is.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a nice powder brush, I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I needed a new powder brush and decided to finally get some of the sigma brushes and I am soooo HAPPY that I did!  </li>
            <li>This is my first sigma brush and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This brush is very big and soft, it´s perfect for th makeup powder.</li>
            <li>The brush was dense with very soft bristles, came nicely package with no \\&quot;plasticky\\&quot;odour.</li>
            <li>The quality of this powder brush is amazing and its so soft!</li>
            <li>Its so soft i love using it!</li>
            <li>but overall it is still of good quality</li>
            <li>not for powder foundation for full coverage.  </li>
            <li>que abarca toda tu cara y los mas importante , son super suaves</li>
            <li>definitely buying more!</li>
            <li>Love the Sigma brushes I&#x27;ve bought so far!</li>
            <li>Most of the powder brushed out there that are larger are more rounded, I was looking for something that was slightly flatter and this was perfect!</li>
            <li>The bristles on this are amazing and similar to MACs brushes.</li>
            <li>This one is WAY better than her old one.</li>
            <li>This is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>I keep buying Sigma, brushes are so soft, don&#x27;t shed and the quality is better than MAC.</li>
            <li>The handle is a nice weight, solidly attached to the barrel.</li>
            <li>I was looking to purchase MAC brushes, but thought I&#x27;d check on Amazon to see if there were any other brands (that are just as good) for a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>recomendos all the girls that buy the products of Sigma, are very good and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Pick up the right amount of powder and no fallout</li>
            <li>Oh and not to mention fast delivery, even 4 days faster than the expected date!I also find it very helpful the cleaning tips included with the product:) I love it!</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to hold, and the hairs are super soft. ^_^</li>
            <li>Loved both the f 45 and f 30 brushes, the large fluff e 30 is shedding already.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles put powder on lightly.</li>
            <li>It holds makeup very well and rather than hard bristles that put more product into the air than on your face, this is a nice applicator with an airy-blended look once applied to the face.</li>
            <li>this is the first sigma brush I&#x27;ve gotten</li>
            <li>Nice product - exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Soft synthetic bristles make for even powder application, and it lightly dusts it on so you can build the coverage.</li>
            <li>This was my first Sigma brush.</li>
            <li>This product is just as good as any mac brush and is half the price!</li>
            <li>This is a great investment and well definitely last a long time because it is made very well</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft, picks up powdered product really well and leaves a smooth finish on your skin.</li>
            <li>Very well made, I&#x27;m so glad I bought this brush especially from Amazon!</li>
            <li>All the positive reviews here floored me.</li>
            <li>I know that this one will be a favorite for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and full.</li>
            <li>Plus, it applies my powder super quickly since it&#x27;s so big.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft, I really recommend!!</li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty tightly packed which is good, but sometimes, less dense brushes have a better &amp;#34;smush&amp;#34; factor for certain types of applications (if that makes sense).  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush to replace a MAC large powder that also shed uncontrollably.</li>
            <li>In one week the sigma beaty large powder is here.</li>
            <li>A bit too large for me for blush applications.</li>
            <li>I already had a large face powder brush but it didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>The brush is larger than expected and is best used to apply loose setting powder.</li>
            <li>Large and soft!!!</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I recomend the Real Techniques powder brush, softer and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>highly recommend to friends and family!</li>
            <li>I really, really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>I really like Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>High quality brush,love it!</li>
            <li>I really like it for the price as well.  </li>
            <li>The brush is very large and soft.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of other sigma brushes and love them all.</li>
            <li>I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have no idea how long they are doing the free gift brush thing (ordered 4/17/13)</li>
            <li>Definitely get the full coverage you need.</li>
            <li>It puts the product on very sheer, and I use MAC studio full coverage powder......</li>
            <li>Softer, more durable, and fluffier than my much more expensive MAC brushes.</li>
            <li>Love the extra big size.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to raise your prices, put your brushes together in a decent manner, for Pete&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li>This particular sigma brush SUCKED......</li>
            <li>it is however soft and nice and fluffy</li>
            <li>Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would order these brushes again - they are high quality.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a high quality brush because sigma has a reputation for that.</li>
            <li>So high end</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and it picks up makeup really well.</li>
            <li>The brush is amazingly soft, and it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much powder.</li>
            <li>Definitely buy, 100% worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this brush for my mom&#x27;s birthday because she mentioned she needed a new powder brush.</li>
            <li>My daughter use them every day and they still like brand new.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft, and they don&#x27;t shed all over my face like so many other brushes I&#x27;ve recently tried.</li>
            <li>Received and went to try for the first time, and the brush looked slightly crooked.</li>
            <li>This is the first sigma brush that I have owned, but by no means the only makeup brush I have owned.</li>
            <li>and i am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I chose to rate this brush with 5 stars because it is so soft!</li>
            <li>the silver part came loose right away.</li>
            <li>it don&#x27;t look like it will come out completely</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I purchased directly from their website, not this seller.</li>
            <li>Brush is soft on my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far I can say Sigma are my # 1</li>
            <li>This sigma brush so far exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li>and it make my face looking naturally.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but dense so it can cover a lot of area.  </li>
            <li>I have MAC brushes that are 14 years old because I care for brushes with know how.  </li>
            <li>They are really soft and get the job done.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this brush a try since I love all my other Sigma brushes, but this one is just not soft enough to me a powder brush.</li>
            <li>I use Bare Minerals foundation and it blends it well.</li>
            <li>With barely any fallout from the hairs I don&#x27;t have to worry about picking them off my face after I set my makeup.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how many little black hairs I have to pick off my face each morning after I use this brush.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering other sigma brushes very soon.</li>

            <li> This brush is great you can tell its a good brush by how thick the head of the brush is.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a nice powder brush, I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I needed a new powder brush and decided to finally get some of the sigma brushes and I am soooo HAPPY that I did!  </li>
            <li> This is my first sigma brush and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This brush is very big and soft, it´s perfect for th makeup powder.</li>
            <li> The brush was dense with very soft bristles, came nicely package with no \\&quot;plasticky\\&quot;odour.</li>
            <li> The quality of this powder brush is amazing and its so soft!</li>
            <li> Its so soft i love using it!</li>
            <li> but overall it is still of good quality</li>
            <li> not for powder foundation for full coverage.  </li>
            <li> que abarca toda tu cara y los mas importante , son super suaves</li>
            <li> definitely buying more!</li>
            <li> Love the Sigma brushes I&#x27;ve bought so far!</li>
            <li> Most of the powder brushed out there that are larger are more rounded, I was looking for something that was slightly flatter and this was perfect!</li>
            <li> The bristles on this are amazing and similar to MACs brushes.</li>
            <li> This one is WAY better than her old one.</li>
            <li> This is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I keep buying Sigma, brushes are so soft, don&#x27;t shed and the quality is better than MAC.</li>
            <li> The handle is a nice weight, solidly attached to the barrel.</li>
            <li> I was looking to purchase MAC brushes, but thought I&#x27;d check on Amazon to see if there were any other brands (that are just as good) for a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> recomendos all the girls that buy the products of Sigma, are very good and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Pick up the right amount of powder and no fallout</li>
            <li> Oh and not to mention fast delivery, even 4 days faster than the expected date!I also find it very helpful the cleaning tips included with the product:) I love it!</li>
            <li> They are comfortable to hold, and the hairs are super soft. ^_^</li>
            <li> Loved both the f 45 and f 30 brushes, the large fluff e 30 is shedding already.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles put powder on lightly.</li>
            <li> It holds makeup very well and rather than hard bristles that put more product into the air than on your face, this is a nice applicator with an airy-blended look once applied to the face.</li>
            <li> this is the first sigma brush I&#x27;ve gotten</li>
            <li> Nice product - exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Soft synthetic bristles make for even powder application, and it lightly dusts it on so you can build the coverage.</li>
            <li> This was my first Sigma brush.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as any mac brush and is half the price!</li>
            <li> This is a great investment and well definitely last a long time because it is made very well</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft, picks up powdered product really well and leaves a smooth finish on your skin.</li>
            <li> Very well made, I&#x27;m so glad I bought this brush especially from Amazon!</li>
            <li> All the positive reviews here floored me.</li>
            <li> I know that this one will be a favorite for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft and full.</li>
            <li> Plus, it applies my powder super quickly since it&#x27;s so big.  </li>
            <li> It is very soft, I really recommend!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty tightly packed which is good, but sometimes, less dense brushes have a better &amp;#34;smush&amp;#34; factor for certain types of applications (if that makes sense).  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush to replace a MAC large powder that also shed uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> In one week the sigma beaty large powder is here.</li>
            <li> A bit too large for me for blush applications.</li>
            <li> I already had a large face powder brush but it didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> The brush is larger than expected and is best used to apply loose setting powder.</li>
            <li> Large and soft!!!</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I recomend the Real Techniques powder brush, softer and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> highly recommend to friends and family!</li>
            <li> I really, really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> I really like Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> High quality brush,love it!</li>
            <li> I really like it for the price as well.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very large and soft.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of other sigma brushes and love them all.</li>
            <li> I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no idea how long they are doing the free gift brush thing (ordered 4/17/13)</li>
            <li> Definitely get the full coverage you need.</li>
            <li> It puts the product on very sheer, and I use MAC studio full coverage powder......</li>
            <li> Softer, more durable, and fluffier than my much more expensive MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> Love the extra big size.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to raise your prices, put your brushes together in a decent manner, for Pete&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li> This particular sigma brush SUCKED......</li>
            <li> it is however soft and nice and fluffy</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would order these brushes again - they are high quality.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a high quality brush because sigma has a reputation for that.</li>
            <li> So high end</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and it picks up makeup really well.</li>
            <li> The brush is amazingly soft, and it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much powder.</li>
            <li> Definitely buy, 100% worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my mom&#x27;s birthday because she mentioned she needed a new powder brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter use them every day and they still like brand new.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft, and they don&#x27;t shed all over my face like so many other brushes I&#x27;ve recently tried.</li>
            <li> Received and went to try for the first time, and the brush looked slightly crooked.</li>
            <li> This is the first sigma brush that I have owned, but by no means the only makeup brush I have owned.</li>
            <li> and i am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I chose to rate this brush with 5 stars because it is so soft!</li>
            <li> the silver part came loose right away.</li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t look like it will come out completely</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I purchased directly from their website, not this seller.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft on my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far I can say Sigma are my # 1</li>
            <li> This sigma brush so far exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li> and it make my face looking naturally.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but dense so it can cover a lot of area.  </li>
            <li> I have MAC brushes that are 14 years old because I care for brushes with know how.  </li>
            <li> They are really soft and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this brush a try since I love all my other Sigma brushes, but this one is just not soft enough to me a powder brush.</li>
            <li> I use Bare Minerals foundation and it blends it well.</li>
            <li> With barely any fallout from the hairs I don&#x27;t have to worry about picking them off my face after I set my makeup.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many little black hairs I have to pick off my face each morning after I use this brush.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering other sigma brushes very soon.</li>
            <li> The brush has very Soft bristles, did come a little apart in shipping box</li>
            <li> All makeup brushes should be left to dry with the bristles facing downwards.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely on par with other brands that would cost $50+ for this same type of brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are SO soft, and there is little to no shedding if you follow the directions on washing the brush.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use them (those suckers are NEVER coming off again, hahahaha).  </li>
            <li> The hairs seem coarse and rough on your face.</li>
            <li> , the handle is way too long also.</li>
            <li> I am an avid Mac cosmetic buyer &amp; I still stand behind this brush.</li>
            <li> When I took it out of the box, it had one or two loose hairs</li>
            <li> I put my loose powder  using it.it is  easiy to use.</li>
            <li> 4 brushes total for less than the cost of 1 MAC brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush in fear of it being a let down...</li>
            <li> While this brush does the trick, a lot of little black hairs come off of it with every use.  </li>
            <li> I think I should have chosen a smaller one for blush, but I got confused by the photo when I was trying to order what a girl used in a YouTube video.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy MAC but then discovered Sigma and have no plans to ever waste my $$ on MAC brushes again.  </li>
            <li> It has at least slowed down.  </li>
            <li> I do not plan to purchase any Sigma brushes due to the quality of this brush, which is very poor.</li>
            <li> The glue was old :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the handle broke in half.</li>
            <li> Seriously.)</li>
            <li> and I thought I would this one for my powder foundation, but its not good.</li>
            <li> Where the handle secures into the metal on my brush was loose :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am absolutely obsessed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still shedding like crazy.</li>
            <li> Bad glue.</li>
            <li> The quality was bad and it shed alot.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get real dirty and doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The brush is larger than expected and is best used to apply loose setting powder. The bristles of the brush are not as soft as is expected with Sigma but overall it is still of good quality</li>
            <li> My favorite Sigma brush I own and I have about 15. I use it for powder and bronzer. Its the best for blending overt my entire face! Wish I had another one.</li>
            <li> Where the handle secures into the metal on my brush was loose :( it don&#x27;t look like it will come out completely so I&#x27;m keeping it.. if I didn&#x27;t need it asap I&#x27;d send it back for another one. I&#x27;ll love her the way she is :)</li>
            <li> Received and went to try for the first time, and the brush looked slightly crooked. When I went to shift it back in place the handle broke off. Dissapointed with the low quality craftsmanship considering the reputation and price. Will be returning</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best brushes I have ever purchased. The bristles are so soft and full. Definitely get the full coverage you need. A must for all makeup lovers.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first brushes I&#x27;ve purchased from this brand, and I really am impressed! They are comfortable to hold, and the hairs are super soft. ^_^</li>
            <li> Love...love...love... this powder brush from sigma. The bristles are so soft, picks up powdered product really well and leaves a smooth finish on your skin. Would definitely recommend this product to friends. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Wow. All the positive reviews here floored me. I&#x27;ve had my brush for about a month and it&#x27;s still shedding like crazy. I can&#x27;t believe how many little black hairs I have to pick off my face each morning after I use this brush. I bought this brush to replace a MAC large powder that also shed uncontrollably. Maybe it&#x27;s me? I decided to replace this brush with one of Sigma&#x27;s Sigmax brushes. I love those.</li>
            <li> When I started using Sigma brushes, my application quality vastly improved. I began getting compliments about how well I&#x27;d done my makeup that day even though I was literally doing it the same as always haha. Definitely buy, 100% worth it.&lt;br /&gt;However, I purchased directly from their website, not this seller.</li>
            <li> my daughter ordered this and she likes it</li>
            <li> I just received my sigma powder brush and I LOVE it! This is the first sigma brush that I have owned, but by no means the only makeup brush I have owned. I love the size of it as well as the shape. Most of the powder brushed out there that are larger are more rounded, I was looking for something that was slightly flatter and this was perfect! It shipped within the promised amount of time and I thought it was a great deal for the product. I have spent so much more on brushes that I have not been as happy with. I know that this one will be a favorite for a long time to come. Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> always perfect. In one week the sigma beaty large powder is here. This brush is very big and soft, it´s perfect for th makeup powder. I´m very very happy.</li>
            <li> I use this brush almost every day for my MAC powder. It&#x27;s amazing and does not seem to shed too much.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft on my skin.  Sigma brushes are always a great buy</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my mom&#x27;s birthday because she mentioned she needed a new powder brush. This one is WAY better than her old one. It&#x27;s so soft and it picks up makeup really well. When I took it out of the box, it had one or two loose hairs but otherwise it doesn&#x27;t shed. It&#x27;s absolutely great!</li>
            <li> i have been a MAC-ONLY user when it comes to brushes. i thought i&#x27;d give this brand a try and i&#x27;m so glad i did! the brush works great at a fraction of the Mac brushes.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Bad glue. The bristles on this are amazing and similar to MACs brushes. Unfortunately, the handle broke in half. The glue was old :( but I used some superglue and fixed it and have a great brush.</li>
            <li> this is the first sigma brush I&#x27;ve gotten and I LOVE IT! definitely buying more!</li>
            <li> Breat make up brushes, very affordable and the quality was excellent. My daughter use them every day and they still like brand new.</li>
            <li> The brush is amazingly soft, and it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much powder. Definitely the best powder brush I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> Nice product - exactly what I expected. It holds makeup very well and rather than hard bristles that put more product into the air than on your face, this is a nice applicator with an airy-blended look once applied to the face. I would order these brushes again - they are high quality.</li>
            <li> It is very soft, I really recommend!! Amazing quality and great prices.&lt;br /&gt;For me Sigma is the best in quality and price.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply my setting powder. I would imagine any powder application will be flawless. It gives an even and beautiful application. Very well made, I&#x27;m so glad I bought this brush especially from Amazon! Great product and great service!</li>
            <li> Gave this to my 19-year-old daughter for a gift.  She loved it as it was very soft.  It blended her makeup perfectly and she felt glamorous.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this brush a try since I love all my other Sigma brushes, but this one is just not soft enough to me a powder brush. The hairs seem coarse and rough on your face. I recomend the Real Techniques powder brush, softer and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love this brush because i like the way it spreads the powder. I also like the softness as well. i have about four of these brushes.</li>
            <li> If you are going to apply makeup on your face you want to make sure you use the best brushes and The BEST brushes in the market right now &#x3D; Sigma Beauty Brushes. I will continue to purchase their product and will give you my review on how I feel abou it.&lt;br /&gt;So far I can say Sigma are my # 1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am absolutely obsessed. This is totally worth the money. Soft synthetic bristles make for even powder application, and it lightly dusts it on so you can build the coverage.</li>
            <li> This brush is great you can tell its a good brush by how thick the head of the brush is. It is very soft and grazes the face perfectly for powdered foundation. I am an avid Mac cosmetic buyer &amp; I still stand behind this brush.</li>
            <li> LOVE this makeup brush! Softer, more durable, and fluffier than my much more expensive MAC brushes. I&#x27;m a sigma convert!</li>
            <li> The brush feels amazing against my skin!  I was looking to purchase MAC brushes, but thought I&#x27;d check on Amazon to see if there were any other brands (that are just as good) for a cheaper price.  I found this one, and thought this was a very good buy.  It does the job, feels amazing, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This brush feels very nice on my face. This is my first sigma brush and I absolutely love it. I will be ordering other sigma brushes very soon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush in fear of it being a let down...(being a religious mac user) and i am pleasantly surprised! This product is just as good as any mac brush and is half the price! do your self (and your face) a favor and purchase this brush.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a high quality brush because sigma has a reputation for that. The brush was dense with very soft bristles, came nicely package with no \\&quot;plasticky\\&quot;odour.</li>
            <li> Another wonderful brush!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, just like all Sigma brushes</li>
            <li> Loved both the f 45 and f 30 brushes, the large fluff e 30 is shedding already. I bought all three recently.</li>
            <li> How not to love this brush!?!</li>
            <li> no puedo decir lo mucho que me gustan esta brocha , es perfecta para el Bronzer  ya que abarca toda tu cara y los mas importante , son super suaves</li>
            <li> Love this powder brush!!! Large and soft!!! Pick up the right amount of powder and no fallout so far!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Oh my!...I have heard a lot of good reviews about sigma brushes and this is my first time ever purchasing a powder brush in my life. I&#x27;m a beginner in make-up and I wanted a brush that I would not regret, if possible the best out there. This sigma brush so far exceeded my expectation. I told myself if I have to buy a powder brush it would have to be a sigma brush...Oh and not to mention fast delivery, even 4 days faster than the expected date!I also find it very helpful the cleaning tips included with the product:) I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the extra big size. Very soft bristles put powder on lightly. Good quality.</li>
            <li> This brush is huge.  I think I should have chosen a smaller one for blush, but I got confused by the photo when I was trying to order what a girl used in a YouTube video.  While this brush does the trick, a lot of little black hairs come off of it with every use.  I&#x27;ve tried brushing it out, but it still sheds.  I THINK eventually it will stop.  It has at least slowed down.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I keep buying Sigma, brushes are so soft, don&#x27;t shed and the quality is better than MAC. Need a Sigma store in Phoenix...I never tooght that I would like a brush more than my MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a quality brush at a very low price for what you are getting. Great for overall powder application for setting your foundation. A bit too large for me for blush applications. The handle is a nice weight, solidly attached to the barrel. The bristles are SO soft, and there is little to no shedding if you follow the directions on washing the brush.  All makeup brushes should be left to dry with the bristles facing downwards. This prevents water from penetrating the brush barrel and loosening the bristles. I use brush guards I purchased on amazon to keep the brush&#x27;s shape in between use and for drying the brushes. This brush is definitely on par with other brands that would cost $50+ for this same type of brush. If you don&#x27;t have a nice powder brush, I would highly recommend this one. Mine even came with a mini brush gift with purchase (an e25 with short handle. I got another brush and also got a free e25 mini with that purchase as well. 4 brushes total for less than the cost of 1 MAC brush. Seriously.) I have no idea how long they are doing the free gift brush thing (ordered 4/17/13) so if you are on the fence do it NOW!!!</li>
            <li> I put my loose powder  using it.it is  easiy to use. and it make my face looking naturally. I recommended it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Great price, awesome brushes!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I already had a large face powder brush but it didn&#x27;t cut it. The quality was bad and it shed alot. Once I used this brush you could definitely see the difference in my makeup application. It was like night and day. Thank you Sigma!</li>
            <li> The brush has very Soft bristles, did come a little apart in shipping box but otherwise great product! Provides great for over coverage of my powder and bronzer,</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for the perfect powder brush and I have finally found it.  The bristles are soft but dense so it can cover a lot of area.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The is the best powder brush I own.  The application of powder is amazing!  It was an awesome purchase.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this brush.  However, that said, I deducted a couple of stars, because the brush handle came apart from the ferrule.  Before anyone thinks that I do not take care of my brushes, this is not a one-off thing.  This also happened with my Sigma F10 blush brush as well. I am an ex makeup artist (I have worked for Chanel and MAC) and I know how to care for brushes. I have MAC brushes that are 14 years old because I care for brushes with know how.  ANYHOO.  With that said, I have glued my Sigma brushes back to their handles with some E6000 and they are good as new and I will continue to use them (those suckers are NEVER coming off again, hahahaha).  But for the prices Sigma now charges, this should not happen.  Come on, guys.  If you&#x27;re going to raise your prices, put your brushes together in a decent manner, for Pete&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li> I needed a new powder brush and decided to finally get some of the sigma brushes and I am soooo HAPPY that I did!  The quality of this powder brush is amazing and its so soft!</li>
            <li> Best brush I ever found or had, for the face. I have a couple of other sigma brushes and love them all. I will only buy Sigma brushes because they are dependable and well made.</li>
            <li> I really like Sigma brushes. They are really soft and get the job done. I use Bare Minerals foundation and it blends it well.</li>
            <li> I bought this powder brush and the smaller powder brush to use for blush. I love them both. They&#x27;re very soft, and they don&#x27;t shed all over my face like so many other brushes I&#x27;ve recently tried.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing at delivering the perfect amount of powder to my face. I can&#x27;t wait to try it with blush! I would highly recommend this brush! It&#x27;s a must have! You won&#x27;t be diaaapointrd! Heard great reviews so I bought this brush and I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I used to buy MAC but then discovered Sigma and have no plans to ever waste my $$ on MAC brushes again.  Amazing quality and great prices.</li>
            <li> High quality brush,love it!</li>
            <li> Good brush but the silver part came loose right away.</li>
            <li> Nice brush.  The bristles are pretty tightly packed which is good, but sometimes, less dense brushes have a better &amp;#34;smush&amp;#34; factor for certain types of applications (if that makes sense).  I do like this brush and it has a nice application.  The bristles don&#x27;t fall out all over the place like my last brush.  Love the Sigma brushes I&#x27;ve bought so far!</li>
            <li> Great brush so far. Doesn&#x27;t get real dirty and doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I have heard so many good things about it and I had to buy it! Its so soft i love using it! Its very big too which makes my makeup process shorter. This is a great investment and well definitely last a long time because it is made very well</li>
            <li> This particular sigma brush SUCKED......I love their kabuki brushes for foundation....and I thought I would this one for my powder foundation, but its not good. It puts the product on very sheer, and I use MAC studio full coverage powder......It works well to blend out my blush or for setting powder....not for powder foundation for full coverage.  it is however soft and nice and fluffy, the handle is way too long also.</li>
            <li> The brush is very large and soft. With barely any fallout from the hairs I don&#x27;t have to worry about picking them off my face after I set my makeup. A must-have for any makeup lover!</li>
            <li> This was a gift with purchase of my Sigma brush washing glove. This was my first Sigma brush. I do not plan to purchase any Sigma brushes due to the quality of this brush, which is very poor. I have used it regularly for a week now. With each and every use bristles fall out of the brush and I have to pick them off my face. I am giving this brush to my daughter to play with.</li>
            <li> I chose to rate this brush with 5 stars because it is so soft! Plus, it applies my powder super quickly since it&#x27;s so big.  I really like it for the price as well.  For the price, I think Sigma prices are great quality.  I would recommend this product to someone who is looking for an affordable powder brush.</li>
            <li> I love sigma brushes! So high end but for a considerably low price! must have! Great blush brush for your every day kit!</li>
            <li> The sigma brushes are wonderful, the finishes of the shadows and application of blush and powder is fantastic. The brushes are very soft and fluffy. I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever brushes good, the best is even Sigma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomendos all the girls that buy the products of Sigma, are very good and last a long time. What is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love for the products of Sigma.</li>
