            <li> This is a fine quality oil. I&#x27;m glad to have a connection to Plant Therapy Essential oils as I feel confident that I continue  to find what I need.</li>
            <li> Quality product and service.</li>
            <li> The products was exactly what it was supposed to be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it (and other products) to make homemade bug spray. (I never heard of this oil before) It worked great!</li>
            <li> Ordered this and got it two days later. Exactly as described, smells great, amber bottle to keep out the light. Can&#x27;t wait to use with my henna mix!</li>
            <li> This is a stronger version of Tea Tree.  If you need something for pain, Cajeput is really helpful. I mix it with Peppermint and a carrier oil like Olive oil and use it on my husband&#x27;s muscles. After about two minutes, he is relieved of pain.  It is amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my horse.  He got a case of sinusitis and I took him to two vets with no positive outcome and lots of money spent.  So...I did some researching and found that essential oils can be used with horses.  They breathe them in IF they are attracted to them.  Well, Rusty was interested and this oil really worked.  I have since moved on to another oil which he prefers even better and it really is helping drain and clear out this sinus issue.  I give this a FIVE STAR rating.</li>
            <li> This oil smells pure and works for all my recipes. Plant Therapy is a trusted place to buy pure essential oils.</li>
            <li> My mother swears by this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy is a fantastic company. Not only is there customer service the best I have ever dealt with, the oils are of the best quality. The quality of the oils is as good OR BETTER than popular MLM brands but don&#x27;t have the inflated prices. No up-line to pocket your hard earned money! Just a great family business doing what they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy has certified aromatherapists on staff to help with your questions. They promote safe usage and really care about their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The free shipping also helps to make these oils affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Cajeput oil is certified pure. It is 100% essential oil and will need to be diluted with the carrier oil if used topically.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size for what I needed and not too expensive. It also seals nicely so that nothing smells like cajeput unless you want it to.</li>
            <li> great bottle and product</li>
            <li> I bought an essential oil called cajeput, something I only recently heard about for the first time. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a popular oil, but was very happy to see that Plant Therapy Essential Oils on Amazon had it. I ordered it with another item and they both came in the same box very quickly. I have used Plant Therapy Oils before and have always been happy with their products, and this was no exception. Their prices are reasonable and the oils are exactly as described.</li>
            <li> bought this to try it out as a recomendation from a friend.  recieved product in a timly matter and the stuff is good and has a great smell too</li>

            <li> my wife swears by this stuff , she has large bottles at home , this is a travel size or just a trial size</li>
            <li> The bottle should let one drop out at a time and it ran all over. Not able to control the usage and used more than i needed.</li>
            <li> I used this oil for a recipe that I made for my body aches.  So far it seems to be working.  I enjoy the scent.  I may even make some candles using this scent.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. I use this oil along with other essential oils to make a nasal oil to lubricate my sinuses at night. After three sinus surgeries, I now suffer with a condition called empty nose syndrome that leaves me with very dry sinuses and nosebleeds. Used an oil that I purchased on Amazon but it was a bit pricey so I decided to make my own. Worked very well ;)</li>
            <li> Great for soothing my foot pain.</li>
            <li> I have turned a lot of folks on to this oil I rate it a number 10 it works very well</li>
