            <li>I will be sure to purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li>I am glad to use it again.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product...</li>
            <li>All of my friends that I&#x27;ve tried it on love it too...</li>
            <li>A+ I&#x27;ve always liked how light this product is on my skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a matte finish, either :)</li>
            <li>Just the way I wanted, came in as ordered, on time and sealed, enjoying it now, no problems during the order</li>
            <li>This was for my grand daughter</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>many compliments on my face</li>
            <li>This is my favorite I can wear it by itself and it makes my skin look smoother.</li>
            <li>It makes me look better, without making me look made up.</li>
            <li>I will NEVER use any other makeup line-this is absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li>Bare escentuals is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly as described and such a great deal!  </li>
            <li>It also feels light on my skin.</li>
            <li>Felt like the Original veil was too light for my light skin.</li>
            <li>&amp; it actually looks better &amp; better throughout the day!</li>
            <li>I originally bought a starter kit.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>I love the way the feels on my skin, not heavy just light.</li>
            <li>I think that knowing the color is lighter than expected is good, you can adjust for application.  </li>
            <li>Right product for the right price.  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing it if it&#x27;s applied right</li>
            <li>I love Bare Escentuals.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d buy from BM website or store but WAY cheaper and arrives at your door.</li>
            <li>I switched to it recently and just love.</li>
            <li>I tried the trial first...</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the natural mineral veil that comes in the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size -- not a small sample size -- so it lasts a good long time for me.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and every liquid makeup I ever used settled in them.</li>
            <li>The wording to describe this product should be changed in order to accurately describe the actual size of the product (.1 oz).</li>
            <li>It was very orange.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>And it takes like 3 minutes to do the whole routine.</li>
            <li>too much of the product comes out at a time.  </li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t really know I am wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>Love their other products though.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals is dependable and consistent.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a huge mess.</li>
            <li>They say it&#x27;s supposed to clear up when you&#x27;re an adult!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>I expected to be ordering the largest size available but received a much smaller size.  </li>
            <li>Must be old.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the price and quality of this product.</li>
            <li>It works miracles on my normally sensitive, combination &amp; acne prone skin...</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>I like the natural look.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use anything but Bare Escentials.</li>
            <li>it even improves the natural tone, texture &amp; overall appearance of my skin &amp; limits breakouts-Even if I fall asleep while I have it on!!!</li>
            <li>I am a Bare Minerals girl.</li>
            <li>but when I do it is always bare minerals.  </li>
            <li>and I keep going back to bare minerals</li>
            <li>I only use Bare Minerals now that I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
            <li>I recommend Larenim mineral makeup above bare escentuals.</li>
            <li>This is not the same product as what you buy in the store from Bare Escentuals.</li>

            <li> It smells kinda strange and chemically.</li>
            <li> My order arrived in less than a week via standard shipping.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is in this that made it so differnt, but i would spend the extra money and go to the store!</li>
            <li> I use this as a primer, before my foundation, and after I&#x27;m done applying my other make up.</li>
            <li> Much too expensive.  </li>
            <li> For me...this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I have been using mineral veil for a few years now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else to calI it.</li>
            <li> This is the small container, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I was afraid for the price, that the container would not be the standard size, but it was.</li>
            <li> But this brand makes the Makeup hassle that I hate so much a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I always have, but I have a terrible complexion and have spent the last 12 years with uncontrollable acne.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not happy with the dispenser.</li>
            <li> Anyone who uses these products knows how expensive it can get.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always this, but in stores its been too expensive.</li>
            <li> So its very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Just to put this out there - I hate makeup.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t really look any different than when I just wear foundation. I won&#x27;t buy it again. It smells kinda strange and chemically. For me...this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!! Everyone should have the mineral veil in their makeup kits. I recommend this to everyone :) not to mention at this price it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> Must be old. It was very orange. Would NOT buy again!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the price and quality of this product. I&#x27;m always looking for a good deal and this was definately a good deal. My order arrived in less than a week via standard shipping. I used it the next day and the quality was just like the mineral veil I had which came in the starter kit. I would buy again from this dealer. I&#x27;m very happy with the service and the product which was sold to me.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! I&#x27;ve tried every type of makeup and I keep going back to bare minerals</li>
            <li> I only use Bare Minerals now that I&#x27;m hooked.  I used to get it at Sephora but now I save a lot through Amazon.  It&#x27;s a great product &amp; now a more afordable price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use anything but Bare Escentials.</li>
            <li> Good price on a great product.</li>
            <li> This was exactly as described and such a great deal!  Anyone who uses these products knows how expensive it can get.  I will be sure to purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I have used it before but let it go.  I am glad to use it again.  Great product and save for the face.</li>
            <li> Just to put this out there - I hate makeup. I always have, but I have a terrible complexion and have spent the last 12 years with uncontrollable acne. They say it&#x27;s supposed to clear up when you&#x27;re an adult! Haha. But this brand makes the Makeup hassle that I hate so much a lot easier. It takes no time just to use the powder foundation they have, their concealer, then touch it up with this veil stuff. I had my doubts about it. How does powder stay on? But it does. And it takes like 3 minutes to do the whole routine. Not bad.</li>
            <li> Right product for the right price.  I was afraid for the price, that the container would not be the standard size, but it was.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product...it&#x27;s absolutely my favorite Mineral Makeup Line!!! It works miracles on my normally sensitive, combination &amp; acne prone skin...it even improves the natural tone, texture &amp; overall appearance of my skin &amp; limits breakouts-Even if I fall asleep while I have it on!!! I will NEVER use any other makeup line-this is absolutely perfect! All of my friends that I&#x27;ve tried it on love it too...you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing it if it&#x27;s applied right &amp; it actually looks better &amp; better throughout the day! Plus...it is sweat/waterproof &amp; doesn&#x27;t rub off all over your clothing-even white tops once this is applied &amp; it sets!!! A+ makeup! Love love love!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years.  I dropped off their regular delivery a while ago.  So I knew what I wanted and the shade.  It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It was good makeup ! What I was shopping for but a lot smaller than I wanted.. I will buy this again</li>
            <li> I think that knowing the color is lighter than expected is good, you can adjust for application.  The product provides a face-saver all around and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using mineral veil for a few years now and I think it is one of the best products on the market. I love the way the feels on my skin, not heavy just light.</li>
            <li> A powder should somewhat sink into the skin.  But this does not.  It also was drying.  Much too expensive.  I recommend Larenim mineral makeup above bare escentuals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d buy from BM website or store but WAY cheaper and arrives at your door. It&#x27;s the natural mineral veil that comes in the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size -- not a small sample size -- so it lasts a good long time for me. A+ I&#x27;ve always liked how light this product is on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave a matte finish, either :)</li>
            <li> Bare escentuals is a great product.  I switched to it recently and just love. it.  I tried the trial first...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought minearl veil from the actual store and it is not the same as i received. I am not sure what is in this that made it so differnt, but i would spend the extra money and go to the store!</li>
            <li> too much of the product comes out at a time.  There used to be an adjusting mechanism to allow a smaller amount of product to come out at a time.  Now there are just several holes that allow the powder to get all over the place!</li>
            <li> It does what it needs to do. But I&#x27;m not happy with the dispenser. I&#x27;m not sure what else to calI it. It doesn&#x27;t have thlittle turnsile inside to close and open so the product can/will not come out. So its very inconvenient.I carry it in my purse, and I always have to shake it so the product can fall back in the dispenser. And not all of does sowhen I open it there&#x27;s a huge mess. I would not buy this again from here. I&#x27;d rather pay the extRA money at dillards.</li>
            <li> This is the small container, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain. I love Bare Escentuals.  I can take this when I travel, will be perfect.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals is dependable and consistent. I am a Bare Minerals girl.</li>
            <li> Just the way I wanted, came in as ordered, on time and sealed, enjoying it now, no problems during the order</li>
            <li> This was for my grand daughter and she liked it</li>
            <li> This is not the same product as what you buy in the store from Bare Escentuals. Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the size advertised was misleading.  I expected to be ordering the largest size available but received a much smaller size.  The wording to describe this product should be changed in order to accurately describe the actual size of the product (.1 oz).</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Felt like the Original veil was too light for my light skin. I should have gone with the next one up. I will know for next time. Love their other products though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup a lot but when I do it is always bare minerals.  I finally had to replace my mineral veil.  I highly recommend this product.  It covers age spots yet feels like you are not wearing anything.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product was exactly what I expected! Thanks!</li>
            <li> love this product and all of them this brightens your face good product many compliments on my face and I am 62</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.&lt;br /&gt; I have large pores and every liquid makeup I ever used settled in them. I would have polka dots. My skin is also oily and tends to be red. I originally bought a starter kit. It came with several products including the Mineral Veil. This is my favorite I can wear it by itself and it makes my skin look smoother. It never settles in my pores and lasts all day. I have people mention I look nice when I wear this line of makeup and they don&#x27;t really know I am wearing makeup. It makes me look better, without making me look made up. It also feels light on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always this, but in stores its been too expensive. I use this as a primer, before my foundation, and after I&#x27;m done applying my other make up. It&#x27;s not too powdery or grainy. I like the natural look.</li>
