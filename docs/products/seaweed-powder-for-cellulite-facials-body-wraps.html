            <li>Since I feel that products that claim to help with a specific body issue (Ex. cellulite and wrinkles) need to be used over time, I cannot say how effective this was at reducing the appearance of cellulite on my thighs.</li>
            <li>mixed it with my own recipe of epsom salt, water and almond oil.</li>
            <li>I love La Lune Naturals&#x27; Seaweed Powder a lot better than other brands.  </li>
            <li>I love to have an occasional at home spa day, so I was excited to try La Lune Naturals Seaweed (kelp) Powder.</li>
            <li>He was right</li>
            <li>The package came right on time.</li>
            <li>so this product is right up my alley.</li>
            <li>I have all kinds of options for use of the product right at my fingertips.</li>
            <li>- I started with a 1/4 cup and added about a 1/4 cup more because I like my scrubs a little more liquidy&lt;</li>
            <li>This is definitely the real deal, very strong scented I use as a face mask and stomach wrap.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend purchasing some oil to add a better scent to it since it smells like seaweed.</li>
            <li>it works well an many different ways to try it</li>
            <li>I have yet to do the wrap on my legs for cellulite- the reason for purchasing in first place.  </li>
            <li>It smells like fresh seaweed, and it made my face feel really breatheable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Refreshed is the FIRST word that comes to mind.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This is how I know this is not just because I all of a sudden started paying more attention to my thighs and exfoliating them with a scrub (seaweed or not) that my skin feels like this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The recipe on the side of the jar says: 3 tbsp Seaweed Powder, 1/4 cup sea salt, 1/4 cup olive oil, drop of essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying a seaweed (face) mask.</li>
            <li>The item was exactly the way it was described...</li>
            <li>I added some charcoal to my first mask this morning.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be trying more products from this company.  </li>
            <li>You can use it for so many different spa treatments at home.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>She sis break out a bit at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to remember to post an update after a few weeks of use on how things are going with the eczema.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fun to mix up your own mask and fun to put it on.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use it more and try different seaweed powder recipes!!</li>
            <li>I have tried the sponges and other items from this seller and I love them all!</li>
            <li>I like that there are many different recipes to choose from, which indicates to me that this is a multi-use product.</li>
            <li>Another con for me was that this recipe required more powder than the 1/2 that was recommended because I felt that it was not enough.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a product like this</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more using different oils.  </li>
            <li>One thing I noticed, after just the first couple of uses, is how my skin is responding.  </li>
            <li>Plus I got pretty itchy and might have had an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>However, my skin felt softer later once the itching stopped :)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am using La Lune Naturals product.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as it says it will do.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary for testing/review purposes, but I only recommend products I would use personally and believe will be good.</li>
            <li>I tried the seaweed (kelp) powder for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this for the first time and I like it</li>
            <li>I made the rosemary seaweed anti aging mask and was amazed and how smooth and soft my skin felt afterwards.</li>
            <li>Leaves are skin soft detoxified and clean.</li>
            <li>Thanks La Lune for getting my product out so fast!  </li>
            <li>I am waiting to try the other recipes in the e-book; I am sure each one of them will provide a good Spa like experience for me, for as little as $5 each time.</li>
            <li>After useing this, and seeing first hand the beautiful effects it&#x27;s worth twice the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one and only negative I have...</li>
            <li>also tried sort of like a face mask on my butt &amp; thighs, equal parts seaweed powder and sodium bentonite clay (&amp;#34;Indian Healing Clay&amp;#34;) and water until smooth and put this on my face and then added peppermint oil and put the rest on my thighs for about 15-20 min.  </li>
            <li>The recipes were simple &amp; easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Most products I&#x27;ve tried leave you feeling dry, but not this one.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you can get past the fishy smell and get the powder mixed into the right texture.</li>
            <li>but you can melt solid coconut oil and it will work fine too)</li>
            <li>I received my Seaweed Powder on time and very eager to try out new recipes for masks and wraps with this product!!</li>
            <li>I add my own body wash and a little water and the feeling on my skin</li>
            <li>I love that the company sent a complimentary recipe ebook because, like I said before, I am not familiar with using seaweed powder.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice much smell at all, and</li>
            <li>and i absolutely can see a difference</li>
            <li>Probably because is straight from the ocean.</li>
            <li>It was very relaxing.</li>
            <li>so possibley that&#x27;s why.. Used as a tummy wrap , went real well</li>
            <li>The powder has a very earthy smell.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really see a difference from using it</li>
            <li>but she does say it feels really soothing while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about the power of seaweed.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is very smelly</li>
            <li>Also, the smell didn&#x27;t linger too much on my legs.</li>
            <li>none where Really helping my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t enjoy is the smell.</li>
            <li>May not use it that much for that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but my skin felt so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The recipe book is very helpful.</li>
            <li>I love this powder and used it so far as a mask after a facial.</li>
            <li>My face feels incredibly smooth, soft and clear.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Not so much that I had to clean it off instantly</li>
            <li>There are 20 other recipes in the free book that I&#x27;m looking forward to trying!</li>
            <li>One scoop was enough to get full coverage on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I think this is a cool product to try especially if you like organic products and DIYs.</li>
            <li>I just received my first order of the natural seaweed powder</li>
            <li>, Peppermint essential oil - A LOT, like I think I used a tablespoon or more trying to cover up the smell of the apple cider vinegar (which I may leave out next time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really made my skin feel soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>would highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>High in vitamins and minerals&lt;</li>
            <li>High quality.  </li>
            <li>I felt like this product actually reduced the redness from my rosacea and made my skin feel so clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive the book so trying to find out how to use the product is kind of hard</li>
            <li>So far, I like this product, but to soon to tell if it will really help with cellulite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask was so gentle; my 7yr old tried it.</li>
            <li>I am going on vacation in a few weeks and can&#x27;t wait to show off my results :)</li>
            <li>However, I do like trying new things and having &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; days for myself</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I decided to order it to try something new to relieve the eczema I have on my hands.</li>
            <li>I mixed a scoop of the kelp powder with Aloe Vera gel and honey, added some warm water and a few drops of lemon oil in it.</li>
            <li>Leaved my skin very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin was very soft and silky after.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>is OFFICIALLY the first Amazon Review I&#x27;ve ever written after placing over 600 orders during the last 6 years.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Feet were very smooth, less dry, and felt very refreshed.  </li>
            <li>The reason for that is I did not know how to use it at first and felt that I needed at least a free day to test it out (make the seaweed paste, apply on body, wait, rinse it off etc).</li>
            <li>So far, the scrub makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong scent (a seaweed scent, obviously), but I suppose that should be expected with an all-natural product.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried the face mask and it left my face very smooth and tight.  </li>
            <li>I could also see a crafty DIY enthusiast buying a tub of the powder around the holidays and handing out little mason jars of homemade scrubs or masks.  </li>
            <li>Once off, my skin looked refreshed and clear.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft and radiant after using.  </li>
            <li>My skin never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>but mixing in some essential oils really helps.  </li>
            <li>I say feel, in reference to how smooth my skin feels on the back of my thighs compared to the front of my thighs after using this powder mixed into a scrub I&#x27;ve been using on the back &amp; sides of my thighs &amp;</li>
            <li>When mixed very messy...difficulty wiping it off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking out for natural skin care.</li>
            <li>I made the Fast Acting Cellulite Seaweed Wrap and the Detoxifying and Tonight Seaweed Mask.  </li>
            <li>La Lune Natural had sent me a recipe e-book for all the way I can use the kelp powder.</li>
            <li>and I really recommend that you do the same.</li>
            <li>Use a toner on a cotton ball for complete removal.</li>
            <li>I only used 1/2 teaspoon (it didn&#x27;t say how much to use)</li>
            <li>So far nothing has seemed to help with the itching I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>but this product gentle enough.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that the tea tree oil or the powder would irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>One con is that the recipes require multiple ingredients which means you may need to shell out a few more dollars to try them.</li>
            <li>I will need to use is a few more times to see if it actually reduces my cellulite but for now, I like it.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and have been having more frequent bouts with it here lately.  </li>
            <li>When I received this, I was very surprised at how much was provided and how little is needed for each &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; This will definitely last a while and well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say after using the seaweed kelp in my facial mask my skin felt smooth, firm and very soft.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;&amp; last but not least</li>
            <li>Naturally, the coconut or olive oil I choose along with exfoliating with sea salt is going to leave skin feeling extra soft.  </li>
            <li>Recently was on a cruise and the spa tried to sell me a similar product that was just four packets and nearly $200!!!  </li>
            <li>but she tends to have very sensitive skin and her skin did adjust after the first few uses....</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying this seaweed powder in your next facial mask.</li>
            <li>I do not have really bad cellulite, but starting early has always been extremely important to be, and a important roll in my beauty regimen, I have used cellulite lotions in the past as a preventive product, every lotion, cream, gel, and spray; yes spray didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference, what I am looking for is tighter, smooth skin, something that smooths out any imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far,  I have only used this as a mask.</li>
            <li>Just received my Seaweed Powder a week ago, have only used it as a foot soak so far.  </li>
            <li>I mixed it with my normal face wash for extra exfoliation.</li>
            <li>As a vegan, it is sometimes difficult to find cruelty-free beauty products that are effective and affordable.</li>
            <li>My mask powder is almost finished and now I found the scoop at the bottom, LOL, my bad and as advised by the seller I didnot use any essential oil the second time and it did not burn anymore but it was intolerable to breath in.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It looked clean, you can see that.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected, was delivered on time and the customer service was great.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried all the recipes but so far this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but I would much rather use the Indian clay mask.</li>
            <li> A nice professional touch.</li>
            <li> I really think its the combination of the seaweed powder with the peppermint oil that has made my skin/thighs look and feel so much better.  </li>
            <li> I am very grateful I was given this product to review because I don&#x27;t think I would have thought an ocean weed could do anything for my skin, my thighs, or cellulite because I&#x27;ve tried so many products claiming to help cellulite.  </li>

            <li> and cleaned it off with warm water and a soft cloth.</li>
            <li> They immediately followed up after I bought the product to make sure I was satisfied and sent a digital recipe book for ways to use the product.</li>
            <li> This product came quickly to my door.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly as did the ebook of receipts.</li>
            <li> highly doubt I will be able to use it again because of this.  </li>
            <li> Indian Healing Clay&amp;#34;) and water until smooth and put this on my face and then added peppermint oil and put the rest on my thighs for about 15-20 min.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product.</li>
            <li> I love incorporating new products into my skin regimen to see what works and what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Their powder is super fine and smooth, that makes it very easy to mix well with other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> When i used it for the first time I had a mask, my husband, when he came back from work, noticed that my skin was particularly bright.</li>
            <li> Does have a strong sea oder, but that tells you its the real deal.  </li>
            <li> it arrived it comes as described in a large 8oz tube, with a free scoop.</li>
            <li> Packaging of product was good, so far, I would recommend this, will edit this review once I have had a chance to use it a few more times!  </li>
            <li> This is a great item, I have used a few times since it arrived.</li>
            <li> My favorite ways to use it are in face masks so far.</li>
            <li> I received the following product in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;Reduces the Appearance of Cellulite on the body when used as a scrub or body wrap.</li>
            <li> I ckeanse my face thoroughly and use them both after my shower so my Pires are open then take a nice bath and soak in some seaweed.</li>
            <li> As someone with somewhat sensitive skin I was glad that this seaweed powder does not cause any irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li> I also love that it includes a free e-book for various masks.</li>
            <li> Since I feel that products that claim to help with a specific body issue (Ex. cellulite and wrinkles) need to be used over time, I cannot say how effective this was at reducing the appearance of cellulite on my thighs.</li>
            <li> mixed it with my own recipe of epsom salt, water and almond oil.</li>
            <li> I love La Lune Naturals&#x27; Seaweed Powder a lot better than other brands.  </li>
            <li> I love to have an occasional at home spa day, so I was excited to try La Lune Naturals Seaweed (kelp) Powder.</li>
            <li> He was right</li>
            <li> The package came right on time.</li>
            <li> so this product is right up my alley.</li>
            <li> I have all kinds of options for use of the product right at my fingertips.</li>
            <li> - I started with a 1/4 cup and added about a 1/4 cup more because I like my scrubs a little more liquidy&lt;</li>
            <li> This is definitely the real deal, very strong scented I use as a face mask and stomach wrap.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend purchasing some oil to add a better scent to it since it smells like seaweed.</li>
            <li> it works well an many different ways to try it</li>
            <li> I have yet to do the wrap on my legs for cellulite- the reason for purchasing in first place.  </li>
            <li> It smells like fresh seaweed, and it made my face feel really breatheable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Refreshed is the FIRST word that comes to mind.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is how I know this is not just because I all of a sudden started paying more attention to my thighs and exfoliating them with a scrub (seaweed or not) that my skin feels like this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The recipe on the side of the jar says: 3 tbsp Seaweed Powder, 1/4 cup sea salt, 1/4 cup olive oil, drop of essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a seaweed (face) mask.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly the way it was described...</li>
            <li> I added some charcoal to my first mask this morning.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be trying more products from this company.  </li>
            <li> You can use it for so many different spa treatments at home.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> She sis break out a bit at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to remember to post an update after a few weeks of use on how things are going with the eczema.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fun to mix up your own mask and fun to put it on.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it more and try different seaweed powder recipes!!</li>
            <li> I have tried the sponges and other items from this seller and I love them all!</li>
            <li> I like that there are many different recipes to choose from, which indicates to me that this is a multi-use product.</li>
            <li> Another con for me was that this recipe required more powder than the 1/2 that was recommended because I felt that it was not enough.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a product like this</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more using different oils.  </li>
            <li> One thing I noticed, after just the first couple of uses, is how my skin is responding.  </li>
            <li> Plus I got pretty itchy and might have had an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> However, my skin felt softer later once the itching stopped :)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using La Lune Naturals product.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary for testing/review purposes, but I only recommend products I would use personally and believe will be good.</li>
            <li> I tried the seaweed (kelp) powder for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for the first time and I like it</li>
            <li> I made the rosemary seaweed anti aging mask and was amazed and how smooth and soft my skin felt afterwards.</li>
            <li> Leaves are skin soft detoxified and clean.</li>
            <li> Thanks La Lune for getting my product out so fast!  </li>
            <li> I am waiting to try the other recipes in the e-book; I am sure each one of them will provide a good Spa like experience for me, for as little as $5 each time.</li>
            <li> After useing this, and seeing first hand the beautiful effects it&#x27;s worth twice the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one and only negative I have...</li>
            <li> also tried sort of like a face mask on my butt &amp; thighs, equal parts seaweed powder and sodium bentonite clay (&amp;#34;Indian Healing Clay&amp;#34;) and water until smooth and put this on my face and then added peppermint oil and put the rest on my thighs for about 15-20 min.  </li>
            <li> The recipes were simple &amp; easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Most products I&#x27;ve tried leave you feeling dry, but not this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you can get past the fishy smell and get the powder mixed into the right texture.</li>
            <li> but you can melt solid coconut oil and it will work fine too)</li>
            <li> I received my Seaweed Powder on time and very eager to try out new recipes for masks and wraps with this product!!</li>
            <li> I add my own body wash and a little water and the feeling on my skin</li>
            <li> I love that the company sent a complimentary recipe ebook because, like I said before, I am not familiar with using seaweed powder.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice much smell at all, and</li>
            <li> and i absolutely can see a difference</li>
            <li> Probably because is straight from the ocean.</li>
            <li> It was very relaxing.</li>
            <li> so possibley that&#x27;s why.. Used as a tummy wrap , went real well</li>
            <li> The powder has a very earthy smell.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see a difference from using it</li>
            <li> but she does say it feels really soothing while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about the power of seaweed.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is very smelly</li>
            <li> Also, the smell didn&#x27;t linger too much on my legs.</li>
            <li> none where Really helping my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t enjoy is the smell.</li>
            <li> May not use it that much for that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but my skin felt so much smoother.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The recipe book is very helpful.</li>
            <li> I love this powder and used it so far as a mask after a facial.</li>
            <li> My face feels incredibly smooth, soft and clear.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Not so much that I had to clean it off instantly</li>
            <li> There are 20 other recipes in the free book that I&#x27;m looking forward to trying!</li>
            <li> One scoop was enough to get full coverage on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I think this is a cool product to try especially if you like organic products and DIYs.</li>
            <li> I just received my first order of the natural seaweed powder</li>
            <li> , Peppermint essential oil - A LOT, like I think I used a tablespoon or more trying to cover up the smell of the apple cider vinegar (which I may leave out next time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really made my skin feel soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> would highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> High in vitamins and minerals&lt;</li>
            <li> High quality.  </li>
            <li> I felt like this product actually reduced the redness from my rosacea and made my skin feel so clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the book so trying to find out how to use the product is kind of hard</li>
            <li> So far, I like this product, but to soon to tell if it will really help with cellulite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The mask was so gentle; my 7yr old tried it.</li>
            <li> I am going on vacation in a few weeks and can&#x27;t wait to show off my results :)</li>
            <li> However, I do like trying new things and having &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; days for myself</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to order it to try something new to relieve the eczema I have on my hands.</li>
            <li> I mixed a scoop of the kelp powder with Aloe Vera gel and honey, added some warm water and a few drops of lemon oil in it.</li>
            <li> Leaved my skin very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin was very soft and silky after.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> is OFFICIALLY the first Amazon Review I&#x27;ve ever written after placing over 600 orders during the last 6 years.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Feet were very smooth, less dry, and felt very refreshed.  </li>
            <li> The reason for that is I did not know how to use it at first and felt that I needed at least a free day to test it out (make the seaweed paste, apply on body, wait, rinse it off etc).</li>
            <li> So far, the scrub makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong scent (a seaweed scent, obviously), but I suppose that should be expected with an all-natural product.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried the face mask and it left my face very smooth and tight.  </li>
            <li> I could also see a crafty DIY enthusiast buying a tub of the powder around the holidays and handing out little mason jars of homemade scrubs or masks.  </li>
            <li> Once off, my skin looked refreshed and clear.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft and radiant after using.  </li>
            <li> My skin never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> but mixing in some essential oils really helps.  </li>
            <li> I say feel, in reference to how smooth my skin feels on the back of my thighs compared to the front of my thighs after using this powder mixed into a scrub I&#x27;ve been using on the back &amp; sides of my thighs &amp;</li>
            <li> When mixed very messy...difficulty wiping it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking out for natural skin care.</li>
            <li> I made the Fast Acting Cellulite Seaweed Wrap and the Detoxifying and Tonight Seaweed Mask.  </li>
            <li> La Lune Natural had sent me a recipe e-book for all the way I can use the kelp powder.</li>
            <li> and I really recommend that you do the same.</li>
            <li> Use a toner on a cotton ball for complete removal.</li>
            <li> I only used 1/2 teaspoon (it didn&#x27;t say how much to use)</li>
            <li> So far nothing has seemed to help with the itching I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> but this product gentle enough.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that the tea tree oil or the powder would irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> One con is that the recipes require multiple ingredients which means you may need to shell out a few more dollars to try them.</li>
            <li> I will need to use is a few more times to see if it actually reduces my cellulite but for now, I like it.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and have been having more frequent bouts with it here lately.  </li>
            <li> When I received this, I was very surprised at how much was provided and how little is needed for each &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; This will definitely last a while and well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say after using the seaweed kelp in my facial mask my skin felt smooth, firm and very soft.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&amp; last but not least</li>
            <li> Naturally, the coconut or olive oil I choose along with exfoliating with sea salt is going to leave skin feeling extra soft.  </li>
            <li> Recently was on a cruise and the spa tried to sell me a similar product that was just four packets and nearly $200!!!  </li>
            <li> but she tends to have very sensitive skin and her skin did adjust after the first few uses....</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying this seaweed powder in your next facial mask.</li>
            <li> I do not have really bad cellulite, but starting early has always been extremely important to be, and a important roll in my beauty regimen, I have used cellulite lotions in the past as a preventive product, every lotion, cream, gel, and spray; yes spray didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference, what I am looking for is tighter, smooth skin, something that smooths out any imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far,  I have only used this as a mask.</li>
            <li> Just received my Seaweed Powder a week ago, have only used it as a foot soak so far.  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with my normal face wash for extra exfoliation.</li>
            <li> As a vegan, it is sometimes difficult to find cruelty-free beauty products that are effective and affordable.</li>
            <li> My mask powder is almost finished and now I found the scoop at the bottom, LOL, my bad and as advised by the seller I didnot use any essential oil the second time and it did not burn anymore but it was intolerable to breath in.</li>
            <li> So this 8oz tub will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, long story short</li>
            <li> wrapped my thighs with clear wrap, and waited around half an hour.</li>
            <li> However it left my face feeling silly smooth.</li>
            <li> It made my skin tight and soft.</li>
            <li> certainly nothing negative.</li>
            <li> , it looked like I washed my face after long time</li>
            <li> After looking at the concoction I made I realized the amount of seaweed powder is less of an overall percentage of the final product than what the bottle recipe is.  </li>
            <li> After looking at the concoction I made I realized the amount of seaweed powder is less of an overall percentage of the final product than what the bottle recipe is.  </li>
            <li> I have other body scrubs I use regularly</li>
            <li> WAAAAYY bigger than I expected also!</li>
            <li> When applied as a mask on the face, it helps to reduce symptoms of Rosacea, Acne Eczema, Dermatitis, Sun Damage, Aging, Dry Skin etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s harder to get off the face when dry.</li>
            <li> It doesnt dry out your skin and mixes well with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> sort of tweaked the recipe on the side of the jar and added a few extra things..</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and it did NOT include a scoop.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected with kelp powder.</li>
            <li> Hey, everyone knows it’s not cheap to go to the spa and have a facial every month.</li>
            <li> My feelings are that whichever way I am going to try the kelp powder, I have to add a few drops of essential oil in it.</li>
            <li> It makes enough for a few applications 2-3 times per week,  </li>
            <li> but it did burn a little, may be that is due to the fact that I did not have a facial for over a year.</li>
            <li> Requires other ingredients like honey, salt or aloe vera gel to mix with it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other recipes...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other recipes....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot about Seaweed Powder and since I&#x27;ve used other La Lune Naturals products I knew this was the way to go.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the slight fishy smell (I didn&#x27;t have the essential oil to add to any of the recipes).  </li>
            <li> I started doing my facial masks at least twice a week</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful not to use harsh products.  </li>
            <li> P lace 3 tablespoons of plain greek yogurt into a small dish.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try all the other recipes the manufacturer provides on its website!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure all the credit is due to the seaweed.</li>
            <li> Its a little stinky</li>
            <li> The packaging for this wasn&#x27;t a little substandard.</li>
            <li> I sprinkled a little of the kelp powder in with my body wash as an \\&quot;add-in\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I want to try mixing it with dead sea salts to use as a cellulite scrub..</li>
            <li> No joke, I used the green side of a Scotch-Brite kitchen sponge to exfoliate the skin on my legs.  </li>
            <li> Some of these ingredients include: 70 vitamins, enzymes, minerals, trace elements, fatty acids, and proteins etc.</li>
            <li> and i waited to use it a few times before leaving a review of the product.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to come with a scoop though which was missing from the jar.</li>
            <li> I also use it just plain with a little water to make a paste for a face mask.</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to wash off</li>
            <li> As a woman in my late thirties, I value anything that can alter the look of cellulite even a little.</li>
            <li> I also use it for my legs, I&#x27;m not sure if it works on cellulite, but it leaves the skin like a baby.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t break out (which usually happens) and my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, not a huge fan of the smell, but hey, it IS seaweed!  </li>
            <li> It was hard to get it off</li>
            <li> not that bad my face look so soft</li>
            <li> I will hold off on my FIVE rating after I try it at least for a weeek.</li>
            <li> Upon purchasing my seaweed powder, an email arrived with at least 20 recipes for spa treatments using the powder.  </li>
            <li> I suggest not making the mask too thick</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to any product that says it reduces cellulite or gets rid of cellulite, because there is no instant fix for dimple thighs (except for maybe liposuction or laser treatments</li>
            <li> She suffers from dry skin and just by using this 2 times she has already felt a difference where her face feels nourished and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> I saw in other reviews that there was a bad smell</li>
            <li> it has a weird smell to it</li>
            <li> i will very unlikely use any thing else!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even smell bad!</li>
            <li> About the smell, is not that terrible, but if you want you can add some drops of mint or lemon and it would work.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this company! My seaweed powder is awesome!</li>
            <li> I love it i feel like i was in spa i like the smell not that bad my face look so soft</li>
            <li> The face mask worked well and the scrubs are nice. Requires other ingredients like honey, salt or aloe vera gel to mix with it. I definitely recommend purchasing some oil to add a better scent to it since it smells like seaweed.</li>
            <li> it works well an many different ways to try it</li>
            <li> Works good, my skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this seaweed powder. I have been using several of the recipes in the free ebook that came with the product and am really happy. My favorite ways to use it are in face masks so far. I saw in other reviews that there was a bad smell but I didn&#x27;t notice much smell at all, and certainly nothing negative.</li>
            <li> Love this product and all the great recipes that are in the free e-book!  So far,  I have only used this as a mask. My skin was so soft and radiant after using.  Can&#x27;t wait to try other recipes... But am thrilled with the mask!  Great product,  would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good product, it shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest at first I was a little skeptical about this product. I have been using it for about a week with one of the ebook recipes and i absolutely can see a difference I would definitely rebuy this proudly</li>
            <li> So far, the scrub makes my skin very soft.  However, I&#x27;m not sure all the credit is due to the seaweed. Naturally, the coconut or olive oil I choose along with exfoliating with sea salt is going to leave skin feeling extra soft.  I have yet to do the wrap on my legs for cellulite- the reason for purchasing in first place.  I will hold off on my FIVE rating after I try it at least for a weeek.</li>
            <li> Great. ..just quite smelly. Probably because is straight from the ocean. Container size is great for the price.  And you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get a good consistency.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again once I run out. I got it in two days.</li>
            <li> great product! I love it and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary jar of this to try and give my honest opinion on. I&#x27;ve never used any seaweed powder, prior to this one, so I have nothing to compare it to. But I DO love this one. They sent a receipe book so you could follow along to some wraps or masks. I personally made a mask with mine. I loved it. It smells like fresh seaweed, and it made my face feel really breatheable. It was very relaxing.</li>
            <li> This powder is amazing.. I add my own body wash and a little water and the feeling on my skin feels so good. I also use it just plain with a little water to make a paste for a face mask. My skin never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find any smell but than again I&#x27;m a ocean brat so possibley that&#x27;s why.. Used as a tummy wrap , went real well just put a towel under you ..clean up was great have only done one wrap see after 4-5 weeks what the result is.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Wanted to try this as a mask. Works okay, but I would much rather use the Indian clay mask.</li>
            <li> Awesome product great company</li>
            <li> This product by LaLune Naturals is truly wonderful. As soon as is arrived I instintly wanted to try it out. I do not have really bad cellulite, but starting early has always been extremely important to be, and a important roll in my beauty regimen, I have used cellulite lotions in the past as a preventive product, every lotion, cream, gel, and spray; yes spray didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference, what I am looking for is tighter, smooth skin, something that smooths out any imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is much more then a cellulite treatment. You can use this as a facial mask as well. So what did I have to lose?..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived it comes as described in a large 8oz tube, with a free scoop. The powder has a very earthy smell. But when used as a face mask I didn&#x27;t notice this at all. It was very easy to apply. Afterwards my skin felt amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Refreshed is the FIRST word that comes to mind. My skin looks and feels amazing. One scoop was enough to get full coverage on my face and neck. So this 8oz tub will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to my next point, the price. The price is fantastic! After useing this, and seeing first hand the beautiful effects it&#x27;s worth twice the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one and only negative I have...&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s just me, I wish they had basic directions on the back. (I.e. water/powder mix) instead of referencing the website for recipes.&lt;br /&gt;If I wanted to give this as a gift to say my grandmother, who doesn&#x27;t use a computer I would need to explain or print out afew recipes myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly, highly recommend this product. A+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Love Love, and I know you will too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this item free in exchange for my honest opinion. Everything stated is 100% truthful and my own personal views.</li>
            <li> This is a great item, I have used a few times since it arrived. My only downside is the scent, but that has nothing to do with the company, it&#x27;s just the seaweed smell. Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great seaweed powder to make masks! Would of gave it 5 stars but the smell of the powder once it&#x27;s mixed isn&#x27;t the greatest. However it left my face feeling silly smooth.</li>
            <li> I received the following product in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;Reduces the Appearance of Cellulite on the body when used as a scrub or body wrap. When applied as a mask on the face, it helps to reduce symptoms of Rosacea, Acne Eczema, Dermatitis, Sun Damage, Aging, Dry Skin etc.&lt;br /&gt;I love this Seaweed powder- I have used it as a face mask (see recipe below) and my skin feels refreshed, super clean and amazingly soft!&lt;br /&gt;Next I want to try mixing it with dead sea salts to use as a cellulite scrub..&lt;br /&gt;The Seaweed powder when mixed with water does have a bit of the seaweed scent- but mixing in some essential oils really helps.  I love the recipe ebook that they send through email after purchase- full of really great masks, scrubs and body wrap recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seaweed &amp; Rosehip oil Face mask&lt;br /&gt;2 tbsp. La Lune Naturals Seaweed Powder&lt;br /&gt;10-15 drops Rosehip oil&lt;br /&gt;2-4 tbsp. Distilled water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix all those together- adding just enough oil and/water to desired consistency and apply to your face and wash it off after 20-25 minutes or until you feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the wonderful&lt;br /&gt;benefits of this simple mask:&lt;br /&gt;• High in vitamins and minerals&lt;br /&gt;• Tone and moisturizes the skin&lt;br /&gt;• Soothes inflamed skin&lt;br /&gt;• Opens up clogged pores&lt;br /&gt;• Removes toxins from the skin</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! I have only had time to prepare a face mask but I am looking forward to trying the body wraps. I hear great things from my friends. As a woman in my late thirties, I value anything that can alter the look of cellulite even a little. I liked the follow up emails from the company. A nice professional touch.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and I love the way my skin feels after. My skin has a nice sheen and feels firmer!</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to any product that says it reduces cellulite or gets rid of cellulite, because there is no instant fix for dimple thighs (except for maybe liposuction or laser treatments but my budget doesn&#x27;t allow for that).  I have tried many lotions, creams, massagers and nothing has ever seems to make a difference that I can see and feel.  I say feel, in reference to how smooth my skin feels on the back of my thighs compared to the front of my thighs after using this powder mixed into a scrub I&#x27;ve been using on the back &amp; sides of my thighs &amp; butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started using this seaweed powder in a scrub I did exfoliate my legs/thighs &amp; butt regularly.  No joke, I used the green side of a Scotch-Brite kitchen sponge to exfoliate the skin on my legs.  This is how I know this is not just because I all of a sudden started paying more attention to my thighs and exfoliating them with a scrub (seaweed or not) that my skin feels like this.  I have other body scrubs I use regularly but since I have quit using those on my thighs and just started using the seaweed scrub on my thighs, my skin feel much more even and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recipe on the side of the jar says: 3 tbsp Seaweed Powder, 1/4 cup sea salt, 1/4 cup olive oil, drop of essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;I sort of tweaked the recipe on the side of the jar and added a few extra things.. I used&lt;br /&gt;4 tbsp Seaweed Powder&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup sea salt&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup sugar&lt;br /&gt;1 tbsp olive oil&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup apple cider vinegar (optional)&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup coconut oil (fractionated (liquid) works best but you can melt solid coconut oil and it will work fine too) - I started with a 1/4 cup and added about a 1/4 cup more because I like my scrubs a little more liquidy&lt;br /&gt;&amp; last but not least, Peppermint essential oil - A LOT, like I think I used a tablespoon or more trying to cover up the smell of the apple cider vinegar (which I may leave out next time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried sort of like a face mask on my butt &amp; thighs, equal parts seaweed powder and sodium bentonite clay (&amp;#34;Indian Healing Clay&amp;#34;) and water until smooth and put this on my face and then added peppermint oil and put the rest on my thighs for about 15-20 min.  I really think its the combination of the seaweed powder with the peppermint oil that has made my skin/thighs look and feel so much better.  After looking at the concoction I made I realized the amount of seaweed powder is less of an overall percentage of the final product than what the bottle recipe is.  So I&#x27;ll definitely try what the bottle says next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so very pleased with this product.  I am very grateful I was given this product to review because I don&#x27;t think I would have thought an ocean weed could do anything for my skin, my thighs, or cellulite because I&#x27;ve tried so many products claiming to help cellulite.  That being said, this seaweed powder is amazing, and I will definitely be purchasing more when it runs out because I like the results I see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______________________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold &amp; Shipped by: La Lune Naturals&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Plastic jar/tub was encased in plastic wrap (see pic) and there was also a safety seal below the lid.

            <li> When mixed very messy...difficulty wiping it off.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have a container I made with cellulite recope and a Cobtained I made with the face mask. I ckeanse my face thoroughly and use them both after my shower so my Pires are open then take a nice bath and soak in some seaweed. I also use it in my kuds tub...it has done wonders for his eczema. Leaves are skin soft detoxified and clean. I will be buying this again and it will be a household staple. 😊</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and it did NOT include a scoop.</li>
            <li> I made my first homemade mask with this seaweed Kelp powder and it was the best I have ever used.  I cannot wait to have a girls night in to share with my friends.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the real deal, very strong scented I use as a face mask and stomach wrap. Don&#x27;t really see a difference from using it maybe I need to use it more often feels good as a mask but the smell is not my favorite, smells like what it is seaweed! I suggest not making the mask too thick it&#x27;s harder to get off the face when dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking out for natural skin care. This is my first time trying a seaweed (face) mask. And I think it&#x27;s one of the best masks you can use. It increases blood circulation, seems to bring impurities to the surface of the skin. Leaved my skin very soft and hydrated. The mask goes on so smoothly that I even used it around my eyes and lips.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does after regular use. Great product!</li>
            <li> Works good for a face mask...haven&#x27;t  tried it on the body yet. The item was exactly the way it was described...</li>
            <li> Great product all around. Definite repeat buyer</li>
            <li> As someone that’s always looking for beauty products to help improve the appearance of my skin I was excited to receive this La Lune Naturals Seaweed Powder in the mail! After testing this seaweed powder out for myself I have to say I really love this seaweed powder. This seaweed powder is a great all around product to bring that spa experience home with you as this product can do wonders for your skin!!

It also comes with a free measuring scoop for easy use of the product as well as a free ebook that includes many great recipes and photos so you can find many great uses for this product. I definitely recommend this La Lune Naturals Seaweed powder to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you can get past the fishy smell and get the powder mixed into the right texture.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the wonderful things I&#x27;ve heard about kelp masks and this product did not disappoint. I had my Mom try it and she loves it. She suffers from dry skin and just by using this 2 times she has already felt a difference where her face feels nourished and hydrated. Would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want spa prices and at home comfort when using this mask. I also love that it includes a free e-book for various masks.</li>
            <li> i will very unlikely use any thing else! super easy to use, fresh smell, great recipes that i love to use and share. very pleased with the product line</li>
            <li> I love eating seaweed, but have never used it as a beauty product. I added some charcoal to my first mask this morning. It was hard to get it off and it didn&#x27;t have that pulsing effect like the indian clay, but I did like the results afterwards: bright and supple. Will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about a month ago and i waited to use it a few times before leaving a review of the product. When i used it for the first time I had a mask, my husband, when he came back from work, noticed that my skin was particularly bright. He was right, it looked like I washed my face after long time (just saying) It looked clean, you can see that. As a result he wanted to have a mask for himself the same night lol. I also use it for my legs, I&#x27;m not sure if it works on cellulite, but it leaves the skin like a baby. About the smell, is not that terrible, but if you want you can add some drops of mint or lemon and it would work. Definitely I&#x27;l buy again this product.</li>
            <li> This seaweed powder works great in my cellulite scrub! It is also the most affordable that I could find on Amazon; I would recommend it to anyone interested in making their own scrubs and facials.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!  I have rosacea and very sensitive skin so I have to be careful not to use harsh products.  I felt like this product actually reduced the redness from my rosacea and made my skin feel so clean and soft.  Can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other recipes.... I plan to make it part of my routine skincare for my face/ cellulite reduction.... I will definitely be reordering this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this seaweed powder from La Lune Naturals! My skin felt and looked amazing after just one use. As a vegan, it is sometimes difficult to find cruelty-free beauty products that are effective and affordable. This product is all of that and more! I would highly recommend trying this seaweed powder in your next facial mask.</li>
            <li> My wife has been looking for a product like this.  Great product, great service!</li>
            <li> Best mask I have ever used!  I have tried many masks but this is absolutely my favorite!  They send you lots of recipes to use the seaweed powder in different ways.  So many recipes that I would of never thought of this is a great product and company!</li>
            <li> I love this powder and used it so far as a mask after a facial. It made my skin tight and soft. My next plan is to use the recipe book for a body wrap. The book is amazing, it has many different recipes which helps you get creative with the seaweed powder. I have also got the Konjac Sponge from the same brand. Also, La Lune Customer Service is top-notch, it makes you want to come back for more very often!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this company!  I ordered the Seaweed Powder, and received the product SO quickly!  I used the free ebook, and made a couple of the recipes in it tonight.  I made the Fast Acting Cellulite Seaweed Wrap and the Detoxifying and Tonight Seaweed Mask.  I was extremely impressed with both recipes!  My skin feels smoother, and looks bright and refreshed.  I will definitely be trying more products from this company.  :)</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. So versatile. You can use it for so many different spa treatments at home. I mixed it with my normal face wash for extra exfoliation. There is a lot of product for your money.</li>
            <li> So far, I like this product, but to soon to tell if it will really help with cellulite.  Also, not a huge fan of the smell, but hey, it IS seaweed!  I liked the fact that the company supplies a website, with recipes available, to help facilitate a true spa experience.  Packaging of product was good, so far, I would recommend this, will edit this review once I have had a chance to use it a few more times!  Barb Westberg</li>
            <li> Tried the recipe for cellulite reduction and after three uses I&#x27;m seeing results! Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter who had recently had a baby and she loved what this stuff did for her skin. She sis break out a bit at first but she tends to have very sensitive skin and her skin did adjust after the first few uses.... This helped her skin recover from the trauma of having a baby. She was very pleased with the gift.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and the company and customer service is over the top good. They immediately followed up after I bought the product to make sure I was satisfied and sent a digital recipe book for ways to use the product. I got it for my daughter who has eczema under her eyes and she&#x27;s used it twice. We haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet in dryness but she does say it feels really soothing while it&#x27;s on. I&#x27;ll try to remember to post an update after a few weeks of use on how things are going with the eczema.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fun to mix up your own mask and fun to put it on. Its a little stinky but that&#x27;s to be expected with kelp powder. It helps to mix in essential oil...I like orange or lavender best!</li>
            <li> I have been fought with my cellulite for about 30 years. I used a lot of products and treatments. Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;The seaweed Powder is the best I had ever had.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing !!!!!! and it is works !!!! I used only 3 times but you can see the difference. I mix the seaweed Powder with the Indian Healing Clay and put on my tights and arms every 3-th day.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Seaweed Powder !!</li>
            <li> La Lune does it again! Awesome product - the possibilities are endless! I love the eBook and all the recipes that I can use for this product. And an added bonus - the packaging is great!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and even better customer service. I have these coming every month now!!</li>
            <li> The packaging for this wasn&#x27;t a little substandard. It didn&#x27;t come with an outer seal and when I opened the package there was seaweed powder everywhere. I did eventually get the email with the free recipes. It does seem to work, but I have found that bentonite clay works better. So, I am combining the two and getting good results. :)</li>
            <li> I used this product when I got home from vacationing in Florida. I was still burnt and beginning to peel on my face. After one use of the seaweed powder aloe face mask my skin felt and looked so much better!! (I could honesty see/feel a difference). I defiantly recommended this product!! I can&#x27;t wait to use it more and try different seaweed powder recipes!! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Totally loving this product! I am not a wait around or use something for 6 months then see results type of person so I was amazed when this actually did what it says it does, instantly! I love taking detox baths with it and also using it as a face mask. It leaves your face glowing! Using it as a body wrap works great too! Feeling bloated, just break this out! Love this!</li>
            <li> nice product.  comes with recipes and leaves skin healthy.</li>
            <li> Hey, everyone knows it’s not cheap to go to the spa and have a facial every month. We have to maintain a budget and those facials and wraps aren’t cheap at all. This is where the Seaweed (kelp) powder comes to the picture. You can make your own professional grade mask, scrub or wraps at home using the kelp powder. La Lune Natural had sent me a recipe e-book for all the way I can use the kelp powder. The 1st thing I tried was the Aloe Vera Antiaging mask. I mixed a scoop of the kelp powder with Aloe Vera gel and honey, added some warm water and a few drops of lemon oil in it. I applied the paste on my face and oh boy, it started to burn. Not so much that I had to clean it off instantly but it did burn a little, may be that is due to the fact that I did not have a facial for over a year. I left it for 20 mins. and cleaned it off with warm water and a soft cloth. The mask must have done its work, because when I was done my skin did feel smoother and tighter. I am waiting to try the other recipes in the e-book; I am sure each one of them will provide a good Spa like experience for me, for as little as $5 each time. My feelings are that whichever way I am going to try the kelp powder, I have to add a few drops of essential oil in it. The powder does not smell good at all, well that figures because it is 100% natural seaweed from the Atlantic Ocean. It was supposed to come with a scoop though which was missing from the jar. But over all my experience was good with the powder and I will keep using it. UPDATE: My mask powder is almost finished and now I found the scoop at the bottom, LOL, my bad and as advised by the seller I didnot use any essential oil the second time and it did not burn anymore but it was intolerable to breath in. The smell of the powder with out any essential oil is truly not an option for me, so I after that I used only 1 drops of oil. I received the product for free but the opinion is unbiased and is my own.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use.  My skin appears firmer.</li>
            <li> I received my Seaweed Powder on time and very eager to try out new recipes for masks and wraps with this product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great universal product. You can mix it to make masks or scrubs to scents that you enjoy. I like the most citrus scrub the best</li>
            <li> Amazing products and amazing company!!!</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it to make a seaweed body mask and its quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected, was delivered on time and the customer service was great. I loved being able to use this after having a baby! Great for Moms!</li>
            <li> Very much impressed, very fast shipping , nicely packed. Very impressive product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Not only is this powder available for an excellent price, but the eBook that comes with has 20 recipes! A huge variety of masks and wraps and scrubs. I can&#x27;t wait to try them all! The instructions are very easy to follow. I have tried the sponges and other items from this seller and I love them all! Truly a great company with excellent service!</li>
            <li> is a good produt for the price I will order the seaweed powder again .</li>
            <li> This Seaweed Powder is one of the best things I have ever put on my face. I mix about a table spoon of seaweed powder with organic greek yogurt (1TB), Organic honey (1TB), a squeeze of organic lemon and 1/4 teaspoon of organic Tumeric...BEST mask EVER!! It makes enough for a few applications 2-3 times per week,  so I leave it in the fridge for next time. My face feels incredibly smooth, soft and clear. I decided a while ago to go all organic for my skin care and I really recommend that you do the same. This product is a great addition to my skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;This is OFFICIALLY the first Amazon Review I&#x27;ve ever written after placing over 600 orders during the last 6 years. Sweet!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product. No problems at all !! Cheers!!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about the power of seaweed.  This company is awesome to work with.  Upon purchasing my seaweed powder, an email arrived with at least 20 recipes for spa treatments using the powder.  I can&#x27;t wait to try them all.  This would be a great gift for any spa and beauty lover.  I could also see a crafty DIY enthusiast buying a tub of the powder around the holidays and handing out little mason jars of homemade scrubs or masks.  They would also be perfect little gifts for girlfriends or party favors at a spa party.</li>
            <li> Just received my Seaweed Powder a week ago, have only used it as a foot soak so far.  Must say I was very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I put it in warm water and soaked for about 15 minutes, rubbed lightly with a pumice stone.  Feet were very smooth, less dry, and felt very refreshed.  Just like at a spa.</li>
            <li> The recipes were simple &amp; easy to follow. If you can get over the smell, the face mask felt great. It really made my skin feel soft and hydrated! However, the VERY strong odor of this product was just too much for me &amp; I highly doubt I will be able to use it again because of this.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This is great! It doesnt dry out your skin and mixes well with other ingredients. The package came right on time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Skin is noticeably smoother after use and thought the free recipe book was a great bonus</li>
            <li> I love La Lune Naturals&#x27; Seaweed Powder a lot better than other brands.  Their powder is super fine and smooth, that makes it very easy to mix well with other ingredients.  And their customer service is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I received this powder around 2 weeks ago and have just gotten a chance to use it. The reason for that is I did not know how to use it at first and felt that I needed at least a free day to test it out (make the seaweed paste, apply on body, wait, rinse it off etc). Also, it is very smelly so I definitely did not use (or would not use) this before heading out of the house. I love that the company sent a complimentary recipe ebook because, like I said before, I am not familiar with using seaweed powder. I like that there are many different recipes to choose from, which indicates to me that this is a multi-use product. I did choose only one recipe which was the cellulite wrap. One con is that the recipes require multiple ingredients which means you may need to shell out a few more dollars to try them. Fortunately, I had all ingredients for the cellulite wrap at home. I used coconut oil to try to combat the smell and since it is fairly moisturizing. So, long story short, I made the paste, applied it all over my thighs,  wrapped my thighs with clear wrap, and waited around half an hour. Another con for me was that this recipe required more powder than the 1/2 that was recommended because I felt that it was not enough. I used around 1 cup of powder for this recipe alone and that is about 1/4 of the product in the container. Since I feel that products that claim to help with a specific body issue (Ex. cellulite and wrinkles) need to be used over time, I cannot say how effective this was at reducing the appearance of cellulite on my thighs. However, I do like trying new things and having &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; days for myself so this product is right up my alley. I will need to use is a few more times to see if it actually reduces my cellulite but for now, I like it. It did not irritate my skin, clog any pores, and was easy to wash off. Also, the smell didn&#x27;t linger too much on my legs. I think this is a cool product to try especially if you like organic products and DIYs. Also, if you like saving money for spa treatments, this is something that can be used more than once and is affordable. Word of Caution: Making the seaweed paste etc.can be messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free for my honest review.you like saving money for spa treatments, this is something that can be used more than once and is affordable. Word of Caution: Making the seaweed paste etc.can be messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried all the recipes but so far this product is amazing. Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product. Most products I&#x27;ve tried leave you feeling dry, but not this one. Works great with the konjac sponges!! Can&#x27;t wait to try all the receives that come with the ebook!</li>
            <li> I love my seaweed powder from LA Lune Naturals. It makes great masks and wraps my skin was breaking out quite a bit and I gad tried lots of products but none where Really helping my skin.  I started doing my facial masks at least twice a week and I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin. Love it definitely worth trying! !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a product like this and I really like it.  The recipes are easy and varied, my favorite is the salt scrub.  I&#x27;ve tried the wrap recipe and the mask and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more using different oils.  One thing I noticed, after just the first couple of uses, is how my skin is responding.  I have psoriasis and I noticed an improvement after using the salt scrub recipe for a week so I made a mask batch and have been applying it to individual areas like you would a face mask.  Like the face mask, I leave it on for a bit and then shower.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I will definitely re-order.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I love incorporating new products into my skin regimen to see what works and what doesn&#x27;t. I have to say after using the seaweed kelp in my facial mask my skin felt smooth, firm and very soft. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Arrived early , great product... Will order again</li>
            <li> I used this as a facial mask and my skin felt smoother immediately after using it. It does have a strong scent (a seaweed scent, obviously), but I suppose that should be expected with an all-natural product.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!!!  Recently was on a cruise and the spa tried to sell me a similar product that was just four packets and nearly $200!!!  Have used as a face scrub/exfoliant, fave mask with Greek yogurt and taken seaweed baths as recommended by the cruise ship spa, only not with their product.  Does have a strong sea oder, but that tells you its the real deal.  Just be sure to thoroughly rinse the tub after a seaweed bath.  Just a tablespoon or so will do you!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  High quality.  Love to use it as a mask and Also use it in body wrap.  The only thing I don&#x27;t enjoy is the smell. It&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> This product came quickly to my door. I was very impressed with the product and will order this again.</li>
            <li> I personally couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. Plus I got pretty itchy and might have had an allergic reaction.  However, my skin felt softer later once the itching stopped :)</li>
            <li> Thanks La Lune for getting my product out so fast!  I can&#x27;t wait to make up some soothing goodies from this jewel!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using La Lune Naturals product. I am using the powder for face mask and am happy so far. Will surely order some more once i run out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found one awesome face mask recipe online and wanted to share it over here.&lt;br /&gt;Half spoon seaweed powder&lt;br /&gt;one spoon Aztec healing clay or any clay of your choice&lt;br /&gt;quarter spoon vitamin c crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix all those together and add water to make it of required consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add a drop of tea tree oil and 3-4 drops of jojoba oil or any oil of your preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix all those together and apply to your face and wash it off after 20-25 minutes or until you feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is really great, and am loving it.</li>
            <li> I adore this Seaweed Powder! I received the product immediately - it actually arrived the next day.  Once I got it, I went to their website and got a couple recipes to try out on myself.  The consistency is so fine that it was really easy to mix.  I have sensitive skin, and was thrilled that I had no adverse reactions using this seaweed powder!  I can&#x27;t wait to try all the other recipes the manufacturer provides on its website!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this! After reading the reviews I decided to order it to try something new to relieve the eczema I have on my hands. It arrived quickly as did the ebook of receipts. Great service!</li>
            <li> WOW!!! SUPER FAST SHIPPING and excellent customer service. This product is amazing! Have only used it once but I am in love! WAAAAYY bigger than I expected also! Very impressed with the product and the seller! I will definitely be ordering more!!!!!! Thanks LaLuneNaturals!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! The fact that it&#x27;s good for so many different things makes it even more worth it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used it once so don&#x27;t know about the anti-cellulite properties yet. May not use it that much for that.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it with my own recipe of epsom salt, water and almond oil. I made a paste and apllied it. It was nice and smooth and wrnt on easily. I left it on for aout 5 minutes and rinsed. My skin was very soft and silky after.</li>
            <li> Great product. WDBWA. Does exactly as it says it will do. Love love love.</li>
            <li> I love to have an occasional at home spa day, so I was excited to try La Lune Naturals Seaweed (kelp) Powder. I love this stuff! It is great for masks and body wraps. They have so many great recipes for you on their website. Here is one of the ones I tried, Seaweed and Greek Yogurt Anti Aging Mask: Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;3 tablespoon greek yogurt 1 teaspoon La Lune Naturals Seaweed Powder 1 teaspoon honey&lt;br /&gt;Directions&lt;br /&gt;1. P lace 3 tablespoons of plain greek yogurt into a small dish. Add powdered Kelp, stir well.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Add honey and stir until all ingredients are blended into a smooth consistency.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Cleanse face, apply mask all over face, neck and shoulder area. Massage lightly.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Leave on for about 5 to 10 minutes. Remove with a warm washcloth. Use a toner on a cotton ball for complete removal. Apply moisturizer as usual.&lt;br /&gt; I received this product complimentary for testing/review purposes, but I only recommend products I would use personally and believe will be good.</li>
            <li> Loved all the free ebooks that came with the purchase of the seawood powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wow!  La Lune Naturals are amazing!  I just received my first order of the natural seaweed powder and I absolutely love it!  I am already noticing results to my body and my cellulite is beginning to diminish!  I would definitely recommend purchasing this product.  I am going on vacation in a few weeks and can&#x27;t wait to show off my results :)</li>
            <li> I tried the seaweed (kelp) powder for the first time today.  I sprinkled a little of the kelp powder in with my body wash as an \\&quot;add-in\\&quot;.  I only used 1/2 teaspoon (it didn&#x27;t say how much to use) but my skin felt so much smoother.  I have psoriasis and have been having more frequent bouts with it here lately.  So far nothing has seemed to help with the itching I&#x27;ve had but this seems to have helped.  Tomorrow when I shower I&#x27;ll try more of the powder.  There is also a scalp treatment that I&#x27;m going to try since I have the affliction on my scalp, too.</li>
            <li> Wow, I would never believe it but this organic seaweed powder has reduced my cellulite!!!!!! It is so easy to use and I have gotten great results in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the book so trying to find out how to use the product is kind of hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for the first time and I like it it has a weird smell to it but it doesn&#x27;t last after you wash it off  I love how my skin feels afterwards and I love all the recipes they sent with it</li>
            <li> I enjoyed giving myself a spa treatment! I ordered this product and also received a free recipe book, so I figured I&#x27;d try the Detoxifying &amp; Toning Seaweed Mask. It felt really good while on and after my skin looked dewy and fresh. There are 20 other recipes in the free book that I&#x27;m looking forward to trying!</li>
            <li> If you can get past the slight fishy smell (I didn&#x27;t have the essential oil to add to any of the recipes).  This product was really good for tightening skin.  The product comes with a bunch of recipes to use as a face mask or body wrap to reduce cellulite.  So far I&#x27;ve tried the face mask and it left my face very smooth and tight.  I have very sensitive skin but this product gentle enough.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the body wrap after my order for the essential oil comes.</li>
            <li> When I received this, I was very surprised at how much was provided and how little is needed for each &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; This will definitely last a while and well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just happen to have tea tree oil when I received this so I tried the face mask that was listed in the emailed e-book. I was worried that the tea tree oil or the powder would irritate my sensitive skin but it didn&#x27;t. It didn&#x27;t even smell bad! The book suggested adding rosemary oil to cover the sea/fishy smell but I didn&#x27;t have a problem with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask was so gentle; my 7yr old tried it. It was very cooling feeling and nice. It was a little hard to wash off but my mask also included honey so that my have been it. Once off, my skin looked refreshed and clear. I didn&#x27;t break out (which usually happens) and my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately buy this again and even include it in a gift basket to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to try all the items listed in the e-book.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot about Seaweed Powder and since I&#x27;ve used other La Lune Naturals products I knew this was the way to go. LOVE that they send you ebooks with recipes. I have all kinds of options for use of the product right at my fingertips. I made the rosemary seaweed anti aging mask and was amazed and how smooth and soft my skin felt afterwards. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this product as a cellulite reducer.  The recipe book is very helpful.</li>
            <li> I just received my package today. I can&#x27;t wait to pamper my self!</li>
