            <li>I am a very satisfied happy customer and am very glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>Good case.</li>
            <li>Good presentation.</li>
            <li>and I thought that was a very appropriate</li>
            <li>If you can handle more than 1000 mcg of biotin per day, then do it!  </li>
            <li>AND I HAVE SEEN AMAZING RESULTS.</li>
            <li>Too time consuming to make it effective.</li>
            <li>used it after every shower and to be honest..</li>
            <li>(I kind of rotate which ones</li>
            <li>Some reviews love</li>
            <li>Ok this product does not do magic .  </li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it will give me more dense hair on the front .  </li>
            <li>I see some improvement but nothing magical .</li>
            <li>It makes the hair more boufant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 months now, and I&#x27;m definitely satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe the manufacturer when they say it won&#x27;t work \\&quot;better\\&quot; if you use it more than three times a week for 15 minutes, because it *will* work better.</li>
            <li>In my opinion if you use it more oftten it will work faster.</li>
            <li>The hairmax laser is working OK.</li>
            <li>WITH THE HAIRMAX LASER COMB THE RESULTS HAVE BE EVEN GREATER.</li>
            <li>Maybe you will have better luck using this product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s keeping me from losing even MORE</li>
            <li>(trying to be more preventative in my approach).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m the type of person that would love to never have to take a pill for anything EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve considered getting what are called \\&quot;top pieces\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a lot of amplifying hair products that just make me look like I have more hair.  </li>
            <li>: This is the one thing I do EVERY DAY that makes me feel INSTANTLY BETTER:  </li>
            <li>Maybelline Stylish Smokes 225S \\&quot;Made for Mocha\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>Grow Beautiful, Healthy, Natural HairTwinlab Nature&#x27;s Herbs Saw Palmetto Berries</li>
            <li>but I think the only good treatment for thinning hair is a good hat.</li>
            <li>and they were more than friendly when I called to cancel.  </li>
            <li>feels more full.</li>
            <li>And after she and I analyzed my hair under bright lights, we came to the conclusion that they were new hairs because there was not sign of breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t come with a plug battery operated which is fine</li>
            <li>Initially, the results were great.</li>
            <li>that helped keep what hair i had and gave me allot of peach fuss..very light hairs that seem not to grow..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Hairmax Advanced 7 since December 11 2011, so coming up on 15 months.</li>
            <li>Advanced</li>
            <li>Advanced</li>
            <li>Advanced</li>
            <li>(Thank you, heredity!)&lt;br /&gt;Because I am a woman, having my hair is really important.  </li>
            <li>I grab my eyeshadow (which is a brown, since I have light brown hair:  </li>
            <li>so far so good..</li>
            <li>I do notice more hair on the top because rogaine didn&#x27;t cause that much hair to grow.</li>
            <li>Frieda Luxurious Volume Fine to Full Blow-Out Spray</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my HairMax.  </li>
            <li>Now, we just have to see if hair regrowth will be significant.</li>
            <li>, this is what I&#x27;m pretty sure what those baby hairs are - they are the hair that is regrowing from my \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; phase.  </li>
            <li>I do NOT have thicker hair than I originally had when I started the laser comb.  </li>
            <li>- I originally planned to do a hair transplant with Dr. Michael Zufelt in Utah this month, but got nervous about the price</li>
            <li>The shipment was right ontime!</li>
            <li>It sure beats going to a salon for laser treaments but again I don&#x27;t know if it is really as helpful as the shampoo products.</li>
            <li>ALMOST HAVE A FULL HEAD OF HAIR.</li>
            <li>Nearly every battery-driven gadget I own has a sliding or latched door to the battery compartment.</li>
            <li>It is not a sham, it does seem to be effective.</li>
            <li>I am starting to see more of a hair line with more hair so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that biotin is basically a super B vitamin that helps your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super valuable</li>
            <li>Its packaged very efficiently and the product is simply great, its very uniquley desinged for a right cause and with complete information</li>
            <li>It could not be more easy to use, so she uses it regularly.</li>
            <li>&quot; it&#x27;s right by Head-and-Shoulders at the store, that is supposed to remove DHT from hair follicles too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For 7 months straight, I have been religiously using the Hairmax Advanced 7 Hair Comb 3 times a week for 15 minutes each time (the instructions explicitly say that if you use it more often than that, it won&#x27;t matter).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently all that time.</li>
            <li>first of all i been using minoxidil for over a year.</li>
            <li>YOU CAN SEE WHAT EXACTLY IT DO FOR YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, my options suck, and the laser comb, by itself, seems to sadly not be enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just have to justify that the $6k is better than sinkingmy money into wigs that will inevitably come if I don&#x27;t do something about this....</li>
            <li>I have diahrea - it basically gets flushed out of your system because it is so much that it cannot be absorbed.  </li>
            <li>When I started on a higher dosage, I did notice my hair stronger and healthier.  </li>
            <li>I instantly look like I have more</li>
            <li>So overall, even if I did get a transplant, it would only be to fill in the top, it will not give more body to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Directions say to use this 2-3 times per week, which meant every other day to me, for those days in between I used a popular shampoo and conditioner that advertise on the radio.</li>
            <li>Healthy Long Hair Loss Prevention and Fast Regrowth!</li>
            <li>I researched many options and decided that the laser comb would be the most cost-effective (in the long-run) and have the least chance for side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am absolutely positive it does NOT regrow hair.  </li>
            <li>As for growth, not yet certain, but then my hair had been falling out, weakening for months.  </li>
            <li>To be fair i think i did not loose more hair , so seems my status did not become worse</li>
            <li>It makes my hair fluffier and also I am starting to see them fine hairs grow and get darker.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how well this performs since I don&#x27;t like sitting and holding on my head for 15min.</li>
            <li>By way of disclaimer, I wasn&#x27;t really losing my hair so much as the hairs themselves were just getting progressively thinner.</li>
            <li>So really, it was just a sales strategy.</li>
            <li>I was very diligent, but no improvement at all.</li>
            <li>The battery compartment must be opened with a philips screwdriver, which runs a real risk of stripping the head of the screw.  </li>
            <li>: I have watched very closely to figure out if this thing works.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see evidence of this.  </li>
            <li>When I first started, I went through a \\&quot;shedding phase\\&quot; - where I shed a lot of hair - which the hairmax website says is normal.  </li>
            <li>But I really haven&#x27;t seen change since that shedding phase.  </li>
            <li>He is so very understanding and approachable.  </li>
            <li>I have to take the biotin with a multivitamin because if there is too much B vitamin in your system, it flushes out (resulting in diahrea).  </li>
            <li>I am using HairMax lasercomb from more than 3 months ago as instructed (for 15 min every other day).</li>
            <li>I would advise anyone to try other more safer methods to make your hair grow and stop it from falling.</li>
            <li>I think part of the reason is because you have to do it on clean hair, so I have to do it after I take a shower in the mornings - which is also when I&#x27;m trying to coordinate kids at the same time.  </li>
            <li>The HairMax LaserComb WORKS, we love it, only used 3 times per week for 15 minutes, my hair start growing back in three weeks!!</li>
            <li>To solve this, there are more expensive laser combs by the same company that only require 7 minutes at a time (it has more lasers, so covers more of your scalp)...</li>
            <li>Also, the biotin gives me diahrea if I take a high dose, so I&#x27;m on the lowest dosage I can find.  </li>
            <li>: If I looked in the mirror (or at a computer monitor), while using it, I got headaches - even if I wasn&#x27;t directly looking at the laser in the reflection.&lt;br /&gt;#2: I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be too much of a hassle, but 15 minutes a day, 3 times a week became a hassle as a working mother.  </li>
            <li>I did not have any new hair grow after 3 months of use.</li>
            <li>Saw Palmetto actually calmed me down (I&#x27;m kind of a high-stress, intense person) - and after reading about it, it actually relaxes your nerves.  </li>
            <li>I am still counting and usually lose around 80 hair a day now and more on the day I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>The Hairmax has completely reversed this, and my hair now looks and feels exactly the same as it did before noticed the thinning.</li>
            <li>If you are a young adult who is suffering hair loss, it may a genetic issue and this product may not help, you may need something surgical.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>and so far I have not notice any hair regrow.  </li>
            <li>Sounds to signalize use but only continuous time of using will say if it function really.</li>
            <li>I know that I will need to wait several months to see if there is any hair regrowth, but from all I have talked to about this product they say it really does work.</li>
            <li>He explained that when you buy directly from the company they test the product before sending to customers to assure it works.  </li>
            <li>The device comes with no available power supply (although the materials shipped with it say one is available -- but it is not).  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t just use any old philips.</li>
            <li>So far I do see hair.</li>
            <li>So far things are working OK.&lt;br /&gt;Expect to see results in about a month.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>B004WFFKVI Hairmax Lasercomb Professional 12, White]][[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I used it  for 7 months as instructed, not a single improvement or hair growth, steer clear of this product!!</li>
            <li>This, along with the dryness, may not be a factor at all if your hair is cut short, or is very straight or flat in structure to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>Plus, this is much cheaper in the long run than buying pills and there are no side-effects (something that concerned my wife).</li>
            <li>The manufacturers only said that because people who were using it longer got fed up with the time involved and were dumping them on Ebay, and the sale of new ones by the manufacturer were dropping.</li>
            <li>So, using it on newly washed damp hair is not strictly necessary.</li>
            <li>&quot; - these are websites that I visit regularly for new information.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product a year of constant use and all I really believe I did was save what I have left, I didn&#x27;t lose anymore, but didn&#x27;t see any growth in my bald patch.</li>
            <li>I use the DS Revita hair products everyday and have noticed a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li>I would go to a hair loss doctor, usually the initial appointment is free to just consult...</li>
            <li>Well, let me say I&#x27;m only 33 yrs old and been losing hair since.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 33 year old woman with female pattern hairloss.  </li>
            <li>so using the back of the head hair to replace the top of the head hair is not ideal because the back of the head thins on women, whereas the back of the head does not thin for men.  </li>
            <li>I am an Asian male, 50 years old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s not the say that the results of have been dramatic -- they haven&#x27;t been -- but I feel confident at this point saying that the gains are definitely noticeable (as verified by my daughter) and that I have no regrets about my purchase.  </li>
            <li>the transplanted hair from the back of the head is not a total safe bet because it can thin too.  </li>
            <li>Just to activate the batteries to get the device working, we had to fiddle with several screwdrivers, and ended up using a flat head screwdriver -- it was hard to find one that fit, though, and would not strip the screw head.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> first of all i been using minoxidil for over a year.</li>
            <li> YOU CAN SEE WHAT EXACTLY IT DO FOR YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, my options suck, and the laser comb, by itself, seems to sadly not be enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just have to justify that the $6k is better than sinkingmy money into wigs that will inevitably come if I don&#x27;t do something about this....</li>
            <li> I have diahrea - it basically gets flushed out of your system because it is so much that it cannot be absorbed.  </li>
            <li> When I started on a higher dosage, I did notice my hair stronger and healthier.  </li>
            <li> I instantly look like I have more</li>
            <li> So overall, even if I did get a transplant, it would only be to fill in the top, it will not give more body to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Directions say to use this 2-3 times per week, which meant every other day to me, for those days in between I used a popular shampoo and conditioner that advertise on the radio.</li>
            <li> Healthy Long Hair Loss Prevention and Fast Regrowth!</li>
            <li> I researched many options and decided that the laser comb would be the most cost-effective (in the long-run) and have the least chance for side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am absolutely positive it does NOT regrow hair.  </li>
            <li> As for growth, not yet certain, but then my hair had been falling out, weakening for months.  </li>
            <li> To be fair i think i did not loose more hair , so seems my status did not become worse</li>
            <li> It makes my hair fluffier and also I am starting to see them fine hairs grow and get darker.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how well this performs since I don&#x27;t like sitting and holding on my head for 15min.</li>
            <li> By way of disclaimer, I wasn&#x27;t really losing my hair so much as the hairs themselves were just getting progressively thinner.</li>
            <li> So really, it was just a sales strategy.</li>
            <li> I was very diligent, but no improvement at all.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment must be opened with a philips screwdriver, which runs a real risk of stripping the head of the screw.  </li>
            <li> : I have watched very closely to figure out if this thing works.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see evidence of this.  </li>
            <li> When I first started, I went through a \\&quot;shedding phase\\&quot; - where I shed a lot of hair - which the hairmax website says is normal.  </li>
            <li> But I really haven&#x27;t seen change since that shedding phase.  </li>
            <li> He is so very understanding and approachable.  </li>
            <li> I have to take the biotin with a multivitamin because if there is too much B vitamin in your system, it flushes out (resulting in diahrea).  </li>
            <li> I am using HairMax lasercomb from more than 3 months ago as instructed (for 15 min every other day).</li>
            <li> I would advise anyone to try other more safer methods to make your hair grow and stop it from falling.</li>
            <li> I think part of the reason is because you have to do it on clean hair, so I have to do it after I take a shower in the mornings - which is also when I&#x27;m trying to coordinate kids at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The HairMax LaserComb WORKS, we love it, only used 3 times per week for 15 minutes, my hair start growing back in three weeks!!</li>
            <li> To solve this, there are more expensive laser combs by the same company that only require 7 minutes at a time (it has more lasers, so covers more of your scalp)...</li>
            <li> Also, the biotin gives me diahrea if I take a high dose, so I&#x27;m on the lowest dosage I can find.  </li>
            <li> : If I looked in the mirror (or at a computer monitor), while using it, I got headaches - even if I wasn&#x27;t directly looking at the laser in the reflection.&lt;br /&gt;#2: I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be too much of a hassle, but 15 minutes a day, 3 times a week became a hassle as a working mother.  </li>
            <li> I did not have any new hair grow after 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> Saw Palmetto actually calmed me down (I&#x27;m kind of a high-stress, intense person) - and after reading about it, it actually relaxes your nerves.  </li>
            <li> I am still counting and usually lose around 80 hair a day now and more on the day I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> The Hairmax has completely reversed this, and my hair now looks and feels exactly the same as it did before noticed the thinning.</li>
            <li> If you are a young adult who is suffering hair loss, it may a genetic issue and this product may not help, you may need something surgical.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> and so far I have not notice any hair regrow.  </li>
            <li> Sounds to signalize use but only continuous time of using will say if it function really.</li>
            <li> I know that I will need to wait several months to see if there is any hair regrowth, but from all I have talked to about this product they say it really does work.</li>
            <li> He explained that when you buy directly from the company they test the product before sending to customers to assure it works.  </li>
            <li> The device comes with no available power supply (although the materials shipped with it say one is available -- but it is not).  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just use any old philips.</li>
            <li> So far I do see hair.</li>
            <li> So far things are working OK.&lt;br /&gt;Expect to see results in about a month.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> B004WFFKVI Hairmax Lasercomb Professional 12, White]][[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I used it  for 7 months as instructed, not a single improvement or hair growth, steer clear of this product!!</li>
            <li> This, along with the dryness, may not be a factor at all if your hair is cut short, or is very straight or flat in structure to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> Plus, this is much cheaper in the long run than buying pills and there are no side-effects (something that concerned my wife).</li>
            <li> The manufacturers only said that because people who were using it longer got fed up with the time involved and were dumping them on Ebay, and the sale of new ones by the manufacturer were dropping.</li>
            <li> So, using it on newly washed damp hair is not strictly necessary.</li>
            <li> &quot; - these are websites that I visit regularly for new information.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product a year of constant use and all I really believe I did was save what I have left, I didn&#x27;t lose anymore, but didn&#x27;t see any growth in my bald patch.</li>
            <li> I use the DS Revita hair products everyday and have noticed a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> I would go to a hair loss doctor, usually the initial appointment is free to just consult...</li>
            <li> Well, let me say I&#x27;m only 33 yrs old and been losing hair since.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 33 year old woman with female pattern hairloss.  </li>
            <li> so using the back of the head hair to replace the top of the head hair is not ideal because the back of the head thins on women, whereas the back of the head does not thin for men.  </li>
            <li> I am an Asian male, 50 years old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s not the say that the results of have been dramatic -- they haven&#x27;t been -- but I feel confident at this point saying that the gains are definitely noticeable (as verified by my daughter) and that I have no regrets about my purchase.  </li>
            <li> the transplanted hair from the back of the head is not a total safe bet because it can thin too.  </li>
            <li> Just to activate the batteries to get the device working, we had to fiddle with several screwdrivers, and ended up using a flat head screwdriver -- it was hard to find one that fit, though, and would not strip the screw head.  </li>
            <li> If I touch my hair at the root, I notice that the hair shafts are fuzzier, like the hair is like a vine, where there are little vines growing off the main vine.  </li>
            <li> It was kind of weird, although I&#x27;m not opposed to trying it again down the road.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;#4: I have naturally thin/fine hair anyway, so as it is thinning, it&#x27;s super difficult.  </li>
            <li> Also, I use the Hairmax a half hour day, on one side of my head, and then a half hour the next day on the other side of my head, and I do that every day of the week only rarely skipping days.</li>
            <li> little too early for any specific</li>
            <li> It gives me headache and apparently is not working !</li>
            <li> Some hair re-growth may be occuring, it&#x27;s a little early to state this definitively though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I suspect is these little hairs were from the time that my head shed the old</li>
            <li> In the past year or so, it became clear that I was losing the fight and starting to develop a hair island in the front of my head.  </li>
            <li> A complete waste of batteries.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very long, drawn out process to start seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In December 2012, My hair stylist and I both noticed little babyhairs (about 1/4 of an inch long) showing up on my scalp, especially around my part.  </li>
            <li> So I actually took saw palmetto every other day for a few weeks and then stopped and am currently just using biotin and nizoral shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Dr. Zufelt has spent time with me and explained the process and my options.  </li>
            <li> just plain ol&#x27; female pattern hair loss.)  </li>
            <li> I will sadly have to start using rogaine - the hair transplant doctor recommended rogaine foam (that is technically for men) - which is less-greasy than the normal rogaine... and I am considering a hair transplant...and perhaps some type of wig that blends in with my hair - just to cover the thinning top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using my HairMax due to an ongoing progressively worstening hair loss problem.  </li>
            <li> Probably... however, I will begrudgingly start adding other hair loss options.  </li>
            <li> So click on my profile name to view other reviews of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I stopped using the Laser Comb April 1, 2013 due to no results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Men&#x27;s Rogaine Foam from April 1, 2013 to June 21, 2013 and stopped due to severe headaches and nausea.....</li>
            <li> Now the hair strength is not as noticeable due to the lower dose.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re like me, in your late 30s early 40s and seeing some hair slowly disappear, this could be an option for you.</li>
            <li> and I seem to be loosing a little less hair than I was before using the comb.</li>
            <li> , it will make your hair seem a little &amp;#34;poofier&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Now I have to wait a few months to see if my hair grow up</li>
            <li> EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for a few months now, and have noticed a substantial reduction in hair loss.</li>
            <li> Dr. Zufelt is very down to earth</li>
            <li> It is a waste of time!</li>
            <li> i am not sure it working.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> (it was weird, the biotin gave me diahrea and saw palmetto constipated me - definite weirdness for my intestines).  </li>
            <li> I usually check it once a week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> Head Small Talk</li>
            <li> How hard would it have been to design this thing for user ease?</li>
            <li> It could of at least gave the option for a cord.  </li>
            <li> In late 2008, I then went to Bosley&#x27;s for a hair transplant.</li>
            <li> Too late to return.  </li>
            <li> and I had a mammogram done, and it kept me awake late into the night, and constipated me</li>
            <li> A real waste of money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, where my hair was receding slightly at the temples, the Hairmax doesn&#x27;t seem to have done anything to regrow hair there.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think 15 minutes 3 times a week sounded bad until I actually do it.  </li>
            <li> this item and others say no good, here is my review.</li>
            <li> I try to use the comb as recommended but always seem to forget or get frustrated just sitting and holding on my head because I get interrupted and can&#x27;t seem to do it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> After several google searches, I have found this:  [...]  </li>
            <li> I thought my hair was falling out bad before using the laser comb and after using it it really started coming out bad.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s the name of the game.  </li>
            <li> The base is only a stand to house it.  </li>
            <li> Although it is not charging when in the base, it came with the necessary batteries</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the HairMax Laser comb for approximately 4 years.  </li>
            <li> Out of curiosity, I wanted to read some reviews about the Laser comb because I&#x27;m not happy with my results.  </li>
            <li> I used the laser comb approximately 6 times</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, my hair is still as thin as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I hate female hair</li>
            <li> My hair is as thin as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and he said that the laser comb does help, but does not show dramatic results...</li>
            <li> Needless to say, neither the air transplant nor the Laser comb worked.  </li>
            <li> Totally useless.</li>
            <li> Should show it on a TV shopping site for useless gadgets.</li>
            <li> and i notice hairmax laser don&#x27;t cause any unpleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> I thought that the comb would be charging when it is in the base, but it does not.</li>
            <li> but I hate to see a doctor to get prescription</li>
            <li> and I noticed my hair was coming out very bad.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The HairMax LaserComb WORKS, we love it, only used 3 times per week for 15 minutes, my hair start growing back in three weeks!! The shipment was right ontime! Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> If you are a young adult who is suffering hair loss, it may a genetic issue and this product may not help, you may need something surgical. But if you&#x27;re like me, in your late 30s early 40s and seeing some hair slowly disappear, this could be an option for you. Some reviews love this item and others say no good, here is my review. Directions say to use this 2-3 times per week, which meant every other day to me, for those days in between I used a popular shampoo and conditioner that advertise on the radio. I gave this product a year of constant use and all I really believe I did was save what I have left, I didn&#x27;t lose anymore, but didn&#x27;t see any growth in my bald patch. After a year I&#x27;m gonna try rogaine and if that doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll take a razor to my head. But I had to give this a try. I wish you the best.</li>
            <li> Ok this product does not do magic .  I am not bald but my hair started thinning  on the front . I bought this hoping it will give me more dense hair on the front .  I see some improvement but nothing magical . To be fair i think i did not loose more hair , so seems my status did not become worse and i see the front got a bit darker . I use it day after day  , 15 minutes per session, on the vibration mode .</li>
            <li> The instructions are to use abt every two days.  since I was ill, wasn&#x27;t able to keep up, but when I use it as meant, my hair appears to fill out.  As for growth, not yet certain, but then my hair had been falling out, weakening for months.  It makes the hair more boufant.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with a cord, only batteries and it didn&#x27;t say anything about that.  It could of at least gave the option for a cord.  Now I have to re-order a cord separately.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product for a few weeks now so I do not know about the results at this time.  I didn&#x27;t think 15 minutes 3 times a week sounded bad until I actually do it.  Seems like it takes forever.  But that&#x27;s the name of the game.  Hopefully I see results at some point in time.</li>
            <li> I am using HairMax lasercomb from more than 3 months ago as instructed (for 15 min every other day). However, I do not see any results.  I gave the product two stars because I cannot tell if it keeps the rest of my hair and if I stop it I will lose all my hair or not.</li>
            <li> These things are a scam and made the person I bought it for hair fallout even faster. It came back to where it was after stopping it and using minoxidil. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using it about 3 times a week and so far I have not notice any hair regrow.  I like the massage It give me, and I can only hope that I continue to use it, I will benefit from it.</li>
            <li> It gives me headache and apparently is not working !</li>
            <li> I thought that the comb would be charging when it is in the base, but it does not. The base is only a stand to house it.  Although it is not charging when in the base, it came with the necessary batteries and I seem to be loosing a little less hair than I was before using the comb.</li>
            <li> Too time consuming to make it effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 months now, and I&#x27;m definitely satisfied with the results.  I started noticing thinning in the front of my head about 5 years or so ago -- I&#x27;m now in my early-mid 40s -- and I started to fight the hair loss with Propecia.  In the past year or so, it became clear that I was losing the fight and starting to develop a hair island in the front of my head.  I&#x27;m convinced that the LaserComb has turned the tide back in my favor, and I stopped using Propecia about 1 1/2 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not the say that the results of have been dramatic -- they haven&#x27;t been -- but I feel confident at this point saying that the gains are definitely noticeable (as verified by my daughter) and that I have no regrets about my purchase.  Plus, this is much cheaper in the long run than buying pills and there are no side-effects (something that concerned my wife).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the HairMax Laser comb for approximately 4 years.  I&#x27;ve been using it consistently all that time. Out of curiosity, I wanted to read some reviews about the Laser comb because I&#x27;m not happy with my results.  I&#x27;ve concluded that anyone who has written a 5 star review is an employee, or paid reviewer...period!  I am an Asian male, 50 years old. My balding pattern is the frontal region of the scalp. I&#x27;ve noticed the thinning progress since 2006. I purchased the Laser comb in 2008 and used it 3-4 times a week. I observed no improvement. In late 2008, I then went to Bosley&#x27;s for a hair transplant. Initially, the results were great. They recommended that I continue to use the Laser comb, which I did. But now (Oct 2012) I&#x27;m seeing the frontal hair region thinning. Needless to say, neither the air transplant nor the Laser comb worked.  I&#x27;m not a scientist but I think the only good treatment for thinning hair is a good hat. I&#x27;m putting my laser comb away for good!</li>
            <li> I used it for year as directed. I see no improvement and still shedding hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how well this performs since I don&#x27;t like sitting and holding on my head for 15min.I use the DS Revita hair products everyday and have noticed a tremendous difference. I try to use the comb as recommended but always seem to forget or get frustrated just sitting and holding on my head because I get interrupted and can&#x27;t seem to do it on a regular basis. It sure beats going to a salon for laser treaments but again I don&#x27;t know if it is really as helpful as the shampoo products.</li>
            <li> ok. first of all i been using minoxidil for over a year. that helped keep what hair i had and gave me allot of peach fuss..very light hairs that seem not to grow.. well I got the hair max a month ago. used it after every shower and to be honest..It makes my hair fluffier and also I am starting to see them fine hairs grow and get darker. I am starting to see more of a hair line with more hair so. so far so good.. no complaints yet..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Hairmax Advanced 7 since December 11 2011, so coming up on 15 months. By way of disclaimer, I wasn&#x27;t really losing my hair so much as the hairs themselves were just getting progressively thinner. The Hairmax has completely reversed this, and my hair now looks and feels exactly the same as it did before noticed the thinning. Unfortunately, where my hair was receding slightly at the temples, the Hairmax doesn&#x27;t seem to have done anything to regrow hair there. And I do use the laser there in the hopes that it might one day miraculously start to work! Also, I use the Hairmax a half hour day, on one side of my head, and then a half hour the next day on the other side of my head, and I do that every day of the week only rarely skipping days. Don&#x27;t believe the manufacturer when they say it won&#x27;t work \\&quot;better\\&quot; if you use it more than three times a week for 15 minutes, because it *will* work better. The manufacturers only said that because people who were using it longer got fed up with the time involved and were dumping them on Ebay, and the sale of new ones by the manufacturer were dropping. So really, it was just a sales strategy. In my opinion if you use it more oftten it will work faster. Also, I wash my hair in the morning and then use the Hairmax at night as the last thing I do before going to bed. So, using it on newly washed damp hair is not strictly necessary. In my opinion. Though it may work faster if you do do it like that. My schedule in the morning just doesn&#x27;t let me do that. So, in summary I would definitely recommend this product, especially for people with my type of hair issues, i.e. not balding but the follicles just putting out ever thinner and thinner hair. I am a very satisfied happy customer and am very glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Used it for 6months with no effect. I should have returned it.  Stay away and just be happy about yourself.</li>
            <li> Good case. Good presentation. Sounds to signalize use but only continuous time of using will say if it function really.</li>
            <li> The hairmax is still going. I can say with certainty that it has stopped further hair loss. I used in combination with Rogaine and it has stopped the deterioration of my hair loss.</li>
            <li> The hairmax laser is working OK. Now I have to wait a few months to see if my hair grow up</li>
            <li> They should inform that there is power outlet avaiable for HairMax Laser and that is not included in this package.</li>
            <li> I SAW THIS COMB ON THE DOCTORS TV SHOW. WAS SO HAPPY WOMEN CAN USE THIS LASER COMB. I PURCHASED IT LATER THAN SOONER. I HAD TO SAVE UP FOR THIS. WELL I HAVE BEEN USING ALMOST A YEAR NOW. AND I HAVE SEEN AMAZING RESULTS. I DO SEE A DR. FOR HAIR LOSS. AND I HAVE SEEN SOME IMPROVEMENTS. WITH THE HAIRMAX LASER COMB THE RESULTS HAVE BE EVEN GREATER. HAIR HAS GROWN IN SPOTS THAT I WAS NOT SEEING THE BEST RESULTS.I HAVE NOT BEEN DISSATIFIED WITH THIS COMB AT ALL. I USE NON LATHERING SHAMPOO AND A DEEP CONDITIONER AND KEEP MY SCALP OILED A LITTLE.I THANK GOD FOR THIS COMB EVERYDAY. GIVE IT TIME. ALMOST HAVE A FULL HEAD OF HAIR. ALSO SEE THE VIDEOS THEY SHOW ON THE COMBS. YOU CAN SEE WHAT EXACTLY IT DO FOR YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a thing.Totally useless. Too late to return.  A complete waste of batteries.  Should show it on a TV shopping site for useless gadgets.</li>
            <li> I know that I will need to wait several months to see if there is any hair regrowth, but from all I have talked to about this product they say it really does work.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I did not have any new hair grow after 3 months of use. Maybe you will have better luck using this product</li>
            <li> No results at all - I even tried it with rogaine. A real waste of money. I was very diligent, but no improvement at all.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using my HairMax due to an ongoing progressively worstening hair loss problem.  I was so excited to get my HairMax.  I turned it on and NOTHING! No lights came on, no sign of it working.  I had read all the info in the booklet that came with the HairMax so I changed the batteries just as it instructed and still no sign of working.  I called the customer service number and was told when you buy the product at a reduced price sometimes it is because it may have been purchased by a distributor then sat in a factory for 2 or 3 years, so by now not working.  He explained that when you buy directly from the company they test the product before sending to customers to assure it works.  I was told no matter it still had a 2 year warranty after purchase and to send it to the company.  GREAT!</li>
            <li> The device comes with no available power supply (although the materials shipped with it say one is available -- but it is not).  The battery compartment must be opened with a philips screwdriver, which runs a real risk of stripping the head of the screw.  You can&#x27;t just use any old philips. Just to activate the batteries to get the device working, we had to fiddle with several screwdrivers, and ended up using a flat head screwdriver -- it was hard to find one that fit, though, and would not strip the screw head.  How hard would it have been to design this thing for user ease? Nearly every battery-driven gadget I own has a sliding or latched door to the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, It doesn&#x27;t work at all! It makes no effect on hair growing. It is a waste of time!</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my mom. It could not be more easy to use, so she uses it regularly. Now, we just have to see if hair regrowth will be significant. It arrived on time, perfectly packaged, as well.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004W9TGVY HairMax LaserComb Advanced 7 - FDA Cleared to Promote Hair Growth]] I bought the hair max a month ago.  I can say that my hair shedding ceased and there is some growth in front of my hair.  I will continue using the hair max and I will definitely post any progress.  [[ASIN:B004W9TGVY HairMax LaserComb Advanced 7 - FDA Cleared to Promote Hair Growth]]</li>
            <li> I started using it sept 29 2012. So far I do see hair. I am using rogaine too plus taking biotin for hair and nails. I do notice more hair on the top because rogaine didn&#x27;t cause that much hair to grow. I follow the instruction. Well, let me say I&#x27;m only 33 yrs old and been losing hair since. I even took propecia but I hate to see a doctor to get prescription and i notice hairmax laser don&#x27;t cause any unpleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> I used the laser comb approximately 6 times and I noticed my hair was coming out very bad.  I thought my hair was falling out bad before using the laser comb and after using it it really started coming out bad.  I began counting the hair I was losing each day and one day when I washed my hair, I lost 366 hair.  I stopped using the laser comb immediately and returned it.  My hair continues to fall out now after 4 months.  I am still counting and usually lose around 80 hair a day now and more on the day I wash my hair.  I don&#x27;t see how it can be FDA approved or how they can advertise and make the claims they do if it affects everyone the way it did me.  Now I am praying that my hair will just thicken back up to where it was before trying the laser comb.  I would advise anyone to try other more safer methods to make your hair grow and stop it from falling.</li>
            <li> Its packaged very efficiently and the product is simply great, its very uniquley desinged for a right cause and with complete information</li>
            <li> As of july 19, 2014 this does not work.</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for a few months now, and have noticed a substantial reduction in hair loss. Some hair re-growth may be occuring, it&#x27;s a little early to state this definitively though.&lt;br /&gt;Although this does not put out any heat, I have noticed increased dryness in my hair. The manufacturer recommends using it on damp hair, and this will likely reduce this.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, as others have pointed out as well, it will make your hair seem a little &amp;#34;poofier&amp;#34;. This, along with the dryness, may not be a factor at all if your hair is cut short, or is very straight or flat in structure to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend this device. It is not a sham, it does seem to be effective.</li>
            <li> just did not like bcause it had nop batteriers</li>
            <li> i am not sure it working.&lt;br /&gt;1) didn&#x27;t come with a plug battery operated which is fine will last about 3 monts&lt;br /&gt;2)i uses it every day for 15 min and i cant tell if it working</li>
            <li> So far things are working OK.&lt;br /&gt;Expect to see results in about a month.&lt;br /&gt;A little too early for any specific results.&lt;br /&gt;But I have noticed hair feels more full.</li>

(Thank you, heredity!)&lt;br /&gt;Because I am a woman, having my hair is really important.  I researched many options and decided that the laser comb would be the most cost-effective (in the long-run) and have the least chance for side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 7 months straight, I have been religiously using the Hairmax Advanced 7 Hair Comb 3 times a week for 15 minutes each time (the instructions explicitly say that if you use it more often than that, it won&#x27;t matter).  Here are my thoughts on the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1: If I looked in the mirror (or at a computer monitor), while using it, I got headaches - even if I wasn&#x27;t directly looking at the laser in the reflection.&lt;br /&gt;#2: I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be too much of a hassle, but 15 minutes a day, 3 times a week became a hassle as a working mother.  I think part of the reason is because you have to do it on clean hair, so I have to do it after I take a shower in the mornings - which is also when I&#x27;m trying to coordinate kids at the same time.  It&#x27;s become a definite burden to be dedicated.  To solve this, there are more expensive laser combs by the same company that only require 7 minutes at a time (it has more lasers, so covers more of your scalp)...or there is a laser hat that you simply place on your head and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it slowing you down.&lt;br /&gt;#3: I have watched very closely to figure out if this thing works.  I am absolutely positive it does NOT regrow hair.  If I touch my hair at the root, I notice that the hair shafts are fuzzier, like the hair is like a vine, where there are little vines growing off the main vine.  It doesn&#x27;t make multiple hairs from one follicle, but it just makes the hair fuzzier... I hope that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;#4: Are my hair follicles bigger, thus making the hair shaft thicker?  I can&#x27;t really see evidence of this.  When I first started, I went through a \\&quot;shedding phase\\&quot; - where I shed a lot of hair - which the hairmax website says is normal.  But I really haven&#x27;t seen change since that shedding phase.  I still have thinning hair.  I consulted a hair transplant doctor about it and he said that the laser comb does help, but does not show dramatic results... and I thought that was a very appropriate assessment.&lt;br /&gt;#5: Will I continue to use the lasercomb?  Probably... however, I will begrudgingly start adding other hair loss options.  I will sadly have to start using rogaine - the hair transplant doctor recommended rogaine foam (that is technically for men) - which is less-greasy than the normal rogaine... and I am considering a hair transplant...and perhaps some type of wig that blends in with my hair - just to cover the thinning top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my options suck, and the laser comb, by itself, seems to sadly not be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: April 6, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;So I started using the haircomb May 1, 2012.  In December 2012, My hair stylist and I both noticed little babyhairs (about 1/4 of an inch long) showing up on my scalp, especially around my part.  I asked if the baby hairs were from her texturizing my hair. She said that she would not ever texturize on my part.  And after she and I analyzed my hair under bright lights, we came to the conclusion that they were new hairs because there was not sign of breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve analyzed my hair since then, this is what I&#x27;m pretty sure what those baby hairs are - they are the hair that is regrowing from my \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; phase.  I do NOT have thicker hair than I originally had when I started the laser comb.  I do not have any noticeable change in scalp coverage.  What I suspect is these little hairs were from the time that my head shed the old hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are they coming in thicker at the follicle than before?  I cannot tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my hair is still as thin as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue religiously using this product 3 times a week. Only because I *HOPE* it&#x27;s keeping me from losing even MORE hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all about hope with this product....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of 4/1/2013, I have begun using Men&#x27;s Rogaine Foam.  I am using a 3/4 capful once in the mornings.  No side effects *yet*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will write my review of that in about 6 months.  So click on my profile name to view other reviews of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - I originally planned to do a hair transplant with Dr. Michael Zufelt in Utah this month, but got nervous about the price (approx. $6k).  Dr. Zufelt has spent time with me and explained the process and my options.  He is so very understanding and approachable.  However, what I have read is that women&#x27;s hair thins all over, so the transplanted hair from the back of the head is not a total safe bet because it can thin too.  Overall, I think I will eventually do 1-2 hair transplants with Dr. Zufelt.  Dr. Zufelt is very down to earth and they were more than friendly when I called to cancel.  I just have to justify that the $6k is better than sinkingmy money into wigs that will inevitably come if I don&#x27;t do something about this.... (trying to be more preventative in my approach).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I hate female hair loss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update 6/21/2013 - Click on my name (C&#x27;est Moi) to see my Men&#x27;s Rogaine Foam review....****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/29/2013: I stopped using the Laser Comb April 1, 2013 due to no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Men&#x27;s Rogaine Foam from April 1, 2013 to June 21, 2013 and stopped due to severe headaches and nausea.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO as of June 21, 2013 I am taking biotin and am using Nizoral shampoo.  I&#x27;ve read that biotin is basically a super B vitamin that helps your hair.  Also Nizoral is supposed to remove DHT from your follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to take biotin with a multi-vitamin or else I have diahrea - it basically gets flushed out of your system because it is so much that it cannot be absorbed.  Also, the biotin gives me diahrea if I take a high dose, so I&#x27;m on the lowest dosage I can find.  (And you can find biotin in the vitamin section of your local grocery store). When I started on a higher dosage, I did notice my hair stronger and healthier.  Now the hair strength is not as noticeable due to the lower dose.  Anything Nizoral shampoo is doing is not noticeable. (You can also find Nizoral by the dandruff shampoos in your local grocery store).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used saw palmetto from June 21, 2013 to end of August 2013.  I read that saw palmetto is supposed to remove DHT from your folicles (although this is for male prostate health, I took it anyway).  It&#x27;s a hormone.  (Also in the vitamin section of your local grocery store).  Saw Palmetto actually calmed me down (I&#x27;m kind of a high-stress, intense person) - and after reading about it, it actually relaxes your nerves.  But it also enlarged my breasts, and made lumps in my breasts, which freaked me out and I had a mammogram done, and it kept me awake late into the night, and constipated me (it was weird, the biotin gave me diahrea and saw palmetto constipated me - definite weirdness for my intestines).  It was kind of weird, although I&#x27;m not opposed to trying it again down the road.  So I actually took saw palmetto every other day for a few weeks and then stopped and am currently just using biotin and nizoral shampoo.  My hair is as thin as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I need to start a blog?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - I created an email account if you would like to contact me: womenhairloss@outlook.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update 1/19/2013*************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received several emails from Amazon customers, and I thought I would share my recommendations that I&#x27;ve emailed recently.  (you can email me at womenhairloss@outlook.com - I usually check it once a week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair is very crucial to a woman&#x27;s self esteem.  Especially if she&#x27;s young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I have to remind myself with any and all hair products is that results take time.  It&#x27;s a very long, drawn out process to start seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the type of person that would love to never have to take a pill for anything EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is what I have found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1: Determine if there might be some type of chemical inbalance.  (In my case it wasn&#x27;t... just plain ol&#x27; female pattern hair loss.)  I would go to a hair loss doctor, usually the initial appointment is free to just consult... but the doctor I went to ordered a blood test to rule out thyroid and everything else.  So I would do this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2: Get some biotin and saw palmetto.  You can google these.  I have to take the biotin with a multivitamin because if there is too much B vitamin in your system, it flushes out (resulting in diahrea).  So I take 1000 mcg of biotin with a multivitamin every day and 160 mg of saw palmetto once every 2 days.  Saw palmetto constipates you and enlarges your breasts, so I don&#x27;t take it every day.  If you can handle more than 1000 mcg of biotin per day, then do it!  You will notice STRENGTH in your hair and fingernails.  Saw palmetto removes DHT from follicles, but also there is a dandruff shampoo called \\&quot;Nizoral\\&quot; it&#x27;s right by Head-and-Shoulders at the store, that is supposed to remove DHT from hair follicles too.  So try that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3: I&#x27;ve considered getting what are called \\&quot;top pieces\\&quot;.  After several google searches, I have found this:  [...]  This is the only place I&#x27;d buy anything from.  They do skype consultations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4: I have naturally thin/fine hair anyway, so as it is thinning, it&#x27;s super difficult.  I have been using a lot of amplifying hair products that just make me look like I have more hair.  That is a great way to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the products I use (I kind of rotate which ones I use each day):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Samy Fat Hair \\&quot;0\\&quot; Calories Amplifying Mousse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-John Frieda Luxurious Volume Fine to Full Blow-Out Spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Bed Head Small Talk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Bed Head Superstar Queen for a Day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-L&#x27;Oreal Everstyle volume root lifting spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#5: This is the one thing I do EVERY DAY that makes me feel INSTANTLY BETTER:  I grab my eyeshadow (which is a brown, since I have light brown hair:  Maybelline Stylish Smokes 225S \\&quot;Made for Mocha\\&quot;) and I use my eyebrow brush and I dab my eyeshadow onto my head at my part and IT COVERS IT UP!!  I instantly look like I have more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#6: I have researched hair transplants... I still have not ruled this out, but I have read that women&#x27;s hair thins all over their head (called \\&quot;diffuse thinning\\&quot;) so using the back of the head hair to replace the top of the head hair is not ideal because the back of the head thins on women, whereas the back of the head does not thin for men.  So overall, even if I did get a transplant, it would only be to fill in the top, it will not give more body to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#7: Go online and google the following: \\&quot;Reprieve Hair\\&quot; and \\&quot;My Crowning Glory Hair\\&quot; and \\&quot;Women&#x27;s hairloss project\\&quot; - these are websites that I visit regularly for new information.  It&#x27;s super valuable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all you hair loss sufferers!  We&#x27;re in this together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******</li>
            <li> I used it  for 7 months as instructed, not a single improvement or hair growth, steer clear of this product!!</li>
