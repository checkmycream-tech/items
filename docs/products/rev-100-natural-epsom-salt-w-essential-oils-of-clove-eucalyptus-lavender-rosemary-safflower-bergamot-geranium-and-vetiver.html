    <ol>
            <li>Great product to use-</li>
            <li>Package was attractive.  </li>
            <li>The sale felt and smelled great in my tub, but damaged the enamel.</li>
            <li>Rev epsom salts are great, no overpowering smell -</li>
            <li>Very nice scent.  </li>
            <li>Epsom salt has been a staple in our house for quite a while and finding one with this wonderful aroma makes soaking in the tub an absolute joy!  </li>
            <li>Price was good.  </li>
            <li>but it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>These salts dissolve well and smell nice in the bath.  </li>
            <li>So I took a bath with the salts - they smell wonderful and it was really relaxing.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice addition to one&#x27;s bath.  </li>
            <li>as a special treat it is nice!</li>
            <li>Epsom salts are very cheap and can be purchased in bulk here:</li>
            <li>But you don&#x27;t need to buy this blend, as you can easily make your own.</li>
            <li>I love Epsom Salts (magnesium).</li>
            <li>For the price, you&#x27;re much better off buying in bulk.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t reorder more than once...</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>REV Epsom Salts with essential oils is awesome.</li>
            <li>I loathe overwhelming, synthetic smells.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful fragrant product, I regularly use Epsom Salt in bath.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soothing and smell great.</li>
            <li>I look forward to my baths more now and will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a regular cyclist and need the relief a great epsom salt bath can give.  </li>
            <li>I believe that Epsom Salt is important and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>It has a  light fragrance, which I don&#x27;t think would offend anyone.</li>
            <li>I tried it for sore muscles after a work out walk, I was surprised on how good it made me feel.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>and nothing special.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why I have to have so many words to express my feelings.  </li>
            <li>online way cheaper even with free shipping, then going to my local health food store and buying my own oils</li>
            <li>No weird oily residue in my bathtub or on my person.</li>
            <li>the scent was light and natural.  </li>
            <li>I tried it first for relief from itchy winter skin-</li>
            <li>My job is also pretty physical as well, so at the end of a long day, Rev epsom salts really relax my muscles and I end up getting a great night&#x27;s sleep as well.  </li>
            <li>i just ended up buying a large bag of epson salt</li>
            <li>If you need to soak something in epsom salts, use this and reward your whole self.  </li>
            <li>For the full effect snuggle down in something warm and let the essential oils continue to work.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t taken the time to take a hot bath in a long time, so this was a great excuse to go back to old habits.</li>
            <li>As for sore muscles, I&#x27;m not sure if it was a relaxing warm bath, the salt or a combination that helped.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much pricier than plain epsom, however, but has more advantages - the soft scent, the added oils which leave your skin feeling moisturized.  </li>
            <li>You mother was right, soaking in this product removes those aches and pains in legs, arms, neck and back.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m feeling a little too cheap to repurchase</li>
            <li>Be careful how you add and how much you use.</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling soft and scented.</li>
            <li>Although these salts are a bit more expensive than other salts, I have found the extra cost worth it.</li>
            <li>if you live in the NE USA, you know what I mean, and it really helped!</li>

            <li> Great product to use- the smell is not too overpowering and it adds a little extra to an epsom salt soak.</li>
            <li> I love Epsom Salts (magnesium). But you don&#x27;t need to buy this blend, as you can easily make your own. Epsom salts are very cheap and can be purchased in bulk here: [[ASIN:B004N7DQHA B004N7DQHA]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to add scents to your salts, you can buy an inexpensive bottle or bottles of essential oils. Personally, I like NOW brand, shown here: [[ASIN:B00CDG91TU B00CDG91TU]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it requires about 1-2 cups per bath, the Rev brand only lasts for maybe 3 baths. For the price, you&#x27;re much better off buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> These salts dissolve well and smell nice in the bath.  They feel a bit softer than the generic epsom salts that you buy at the grocery store.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Just that....okay and nothing special. Didn&#x27;t reorder more than once...</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had a giant blister on my foot and was told to soak it in epsom salt. When this came a day after I ordered it, the blister had taken care of itself. So I took a bath with the salts - they smell wonderful and it was really relaxing. No weird oily residue in my bathtub or on my person. A+.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this for use after sports activities. I tried it and it actually works as advertised. I wish it came in a larger container though as it can get expensive if you use the suggested amounts, you will go through it after a couple of uses. I will highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive for bath salt but let me tell you, the smell is heavely. I&#x27;m mad because my kids used the last of my REV salt and i&#x27;m feeling a little too cheap to repurchase but I may break down soon. As for sore muscles, I&#x27;m not sure if it was a relaxing warm bath, the salt or a combination that helped. I bought this for those days after longer runs when my body needed a break.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to be said about Epson salts?  Price was good.  Package was attractive.  Product was what it was supposed to be.</li>
            <li> You mother was right, soaking in this product removes those aches and pains in legs, arms, neck and back. Who would have know that this product would do such a thing?</li>
            <li> Epsom salt has been a staple in our house for quite a while and finding one with this wonderful aroma makes soaking in the tub an absolute joy!  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> have not used this yet but it smells really good.  I really don&#x27;t know why I have to have so many words to express my feelings.  :)</li>
            <li> The sale felt and smelled great in my tub, but damaged the enamel. Be careful how you add and how much you use.</li>
            <li> This is not your usual Epsom salts. It contains vitamin E with Magnesium Sulfate, clove, Lavender and Rosemary just to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried it for sore muscles after a work out walk, I was surprised on how good it made me feel. I will keep a supply at all times.</li>
            <li> REV Epsom Salts with essential oils is awesome. Just slide in the tub before bed or a nap and relax. For the full effect snuggle down in something warm and let the essential oils continue to work.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t taken the time to take a hot bath in a long time, so this was a great excuse to go back to old habits. Left my skin feeling soft and scented. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent.  I loathe overwhelming, synthetic smells.  Rev epsom salts are great, no overpowering smell - the scent was light and natural.

Although these salts are a bit more expensive than other salts, I have found the extra cost worth it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrant product, I regularly use Epsom Salt in bath. I can&#x27;t afford this too often but as a special treat it is nice! I believe that Epsom Salt is important and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> only gave you 3 baths. did not like the smell. i just ended up buying a large bag of epson salt online way cheaper even with free shipping, then going to my local health food store and buying my own oils so i can switch up my bath scents.  definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soothing and smell great. I look forward to my baths more now and will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice addition to one&#x27;s bath.  It has a  light fragrance, which I don&#x27;t think would offend anyone.

I continue to use it when I have overworked or overplayed and it soothes and relaxes.</li>
