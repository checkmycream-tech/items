            <li>BEST PAIR OF CLIPPERS</li>
            <li>This is the best idea ever.</li>
            <li>Keep this thing as incredible as it is.  </li>
            <li>Feels great, cuts great and with great dual cord adapter.</li>
            <li>These are great tools to accomplish this.</li>
            <li>Great bundle deal.</li>
            <li>Just used both clipper and liner/trimmer on myself before using on my son&#x27;s hair, because the pervious brand (Andis) burned him and what a GREAT feeling.  </li>
            <li>Also ther feel great in hand.</li>
            <li>The price is great</li>
            <li>The clippers are great but the trimmer are defective.</li>
            <li>Both the trimmer and clipper is amazing!</li>
            <li>Kids are getting shaggy :-P</li>
            <li>Feels good in the hand</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that good</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Great buy, smooth cut</li>
            <li>Cuts really  nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this to shave my own head and have my roommate touch up my hairline.</li>
            <li>these clippers and the ones I currently own.</li>
            <li>and I wanted him to have a nice set of clippers and when he received them he was so excited because they cut great :-)</li>
            <li>Great clippers, they are easy to use and the cord connects easily.</li>
            <li>Great clippers well worth the money</li>
            <li>They cut good, but not as precise as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I cut my husband and two young gentleman&#x27;s hair and these clippers are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The 5 star magic wahl clipper is amazing.</li>
            <li>The delivery time was fast and best of all free.</li>
            <li>It just seems that when things are too good to be true in the barber world that they tend to get discontinued or the price will get jacked up</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I may need to adjust it more.</li>
            <li>I love the looks and they perform well.  </li>
            <li>Works as described but just make sure not to drop it.</li>
            <li>and then no one will be able to afford it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really love this kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice powerful and very accurate.</li>
            <li>If you want professional quality for a great price, this combo is a steal.</li>
            <li>I bought an extra pair for my boss and she loved it!</li>
            <li>the closest, yet safest height easily attainable.  </li>
            <li>They work fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a barber and use these daily they work great .</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m cheap and wanted an alternative to taking my dog to the groomers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of trimmer, which is more important for me, it was between the Wahl Detailer and the Andis T Outliner, and after MANY HOURS of youtube videos, barber opinions, and my own testing of the two, I prefer the bland looking Andis, for it gets the job done well, and that&#x27;s what matters most.</li>
            <li>but the trimmers are loud and the machine isn&#x27;t as great as others say and I am a professional</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut the length of time to do my sons hair in half &amp; I can trim &amp; shape my beard with much greater accuracy!!</li>
            <li>I was a bit sceptical about the price and possibly the quality, but I am really happy with them so far.</li>
            <li>It comes with a v9000 motor which is durable and powerful.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>They cut like a hot knife to butter.</li>
            <li>So if you are familiar with clipper over comb techniques you can cut several types of haircuts, with proficiency, right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>So if you are familiar with clipper over comb techniques you can cut several types of haircuts, with proficiency, right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li>I will be trying to return these very soon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Have not had a problem with them and would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>Going to cross my finger and hope it still cuts smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute steal.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer was very precise, just wish the sides were a little more sharp.</li>
            <li>I also have a full beard that gets trimmed regularly &amp; cannot use razors</li>
            <li>This is a solidly built unit that should last many years.</li>
            <li>For those that swap back &amp; forth, get some di-electric grease &amp; grease up both plugs &amp; the cord &amp; it will make things much easier!!</li>
            <li>clipper is a very good cutting machine.  </li>
            <li>trimmer is also a very good cutting trimmer.  </li>
            <li>High quality,you can notice the difference right away compare to the 20-30 $ that I have purchased from local stores.</li>
            <li>It cuts quietly, smoothly, and sharply.</li>
            <li>Excellent home hair cutting set, however, I bought an additional electrical cord after several uses, moving the one cord from trimmer to cutter is time consuming.</li>
            <li>Professional feeling and look!  </li>
            <li>This is such an incredible idea from Wahl that I personally want to keep it a secret.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re one to just blast through cuts, this may be a bigger setback to you than say, the barber/ stylist that puts a little more time into their cuts.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are just average, nothing special.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s great for all around cutting, tapering, and fading.  </li>
            <li>So far so good,Great set of clippers.</li>
            <li>and there was an issue there, but the clippers were SOO loud.</li>
            <li>Just what you&#x27;d expect from a professional quality magnetic clipper.  </li>
            <li>So if you like machines like the Andis T-outliner it shouldn&#x27;t be too far off with the exception of again, the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as a package.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very well built, seems it will last forever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned quite a few pairs of shears (Retired Army) and I have never owned a pair that rusted as quick as these.  </li>
            <li>And I mean EASY.  </li>
            <li>and there was not very noticeable vibration like other cheap clippers.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with these bad boys.</li>
            <li>The only draw back of this particular trimmer is that it is on the larger side and once again, I do not have very big hands.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the size of the trimmer is kinda long, and when it comes to lining up my beard at the mandible (top of the neck, bottom of the cheek), I am unable to get a good position to do line up&#x27;s</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s still not much of a setback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it too is a magnetic driven liner so it cuts as expected.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped mine while cleaning and not sure it will be the same anymore.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not right.</li>
            <li> Other than those few issues, it gets the job done, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> beware the clippers are very sharp so pay close attention when using</li>
            <li> So as a little insurance I bought</li>
            <li> well this doesn&#x27;t work so well on my little cavalier king charles&#x27; fluffy hair.</li>
            <li> I picked up this set due to the 9000 motor &amp; the t-blade trimmer &amp; couldn&#x27;t be any happier!!</li>
            <li> The Only beef I have is the cord is a little difficult to remove from the clippers.  </li>
            <li> , as convenient as having 1 cord is, it is rather inconvenient if one must constantly unplug one unit to plug in the other, and so on.</li>
            <li> It does require at the very least, minimal attention.  </li>
            <li> No more trial and error by way of giving your customers tattoos.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed on how fast the blades rusted.  </li>
            <li> Its thick cord</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard,and this weed whacked it like butter.</li>
            <li> I sent these to my husband in Afghanistan because he was cutting a few of the guys hair</li>
            <li> I was fearful of the switch or the cord getting damaged but its very lasting.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair along with my son &amp; nobody cuts our hair besides me, so my clippers take a beating!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really sad !</li>
            <li> And I hope this isn&#x27;t the catalyst for triggering an impossibly attainable haircutting machine set.f course if you wish to use it in tandem as I believe</li>
            <li> And I hope this isn&#x27;t the catalyst for triggering an impossibly attainable haircutting machine set.</li>
            <li> Bad material quality</li>
            <li> YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>

            <li> I purchased this to line up and keep my beard trimmed. Both units are decent, and look SLICK in my bathroom, especially when the cord is disconnected. Unfortunately, the size of the trimmer is kinda long, and when it comes to lining up my beard at the mandible (top of the neck, bottom of the cheek), I am unable to get a good position to do line up&#x27;s here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as convenient as having 1 cord is, it is rather inconvenient if one must constantly unplug one unit to plug in the other, and so on.

            <li> Cuts all types of hair I&#x27;m a barber and use these daily they work great . great deal!!</li>
            <li> I bought an extra pair for my boss and she loved it! Thanks again!</li>
            <li> So far so good,Great set of clippers.The jury is still out on whether I like having One cord to share.Cuts really  nice.Feels good in the hand</li>
            <li> Great clippers well worth the money</li>
            <li> These Clippers are Nice!!!!  Definitely a steal!  The Only beef I have is the cord is a little difficult to remove from the clippers.  Highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> It could just be that I tried using the one I got in England with a transformer and there was an issue there, but the clippers were SOO loud. I bought them to cut my kids&#x27; hair but there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;re letting me close to them with these clippers. I tried adjusting the power with the side knob but that didn&#x27;t help. I will be trying to return these very soon. Hopefully I can find a pair of clippers that work out here. Kids are getting shaggy :-P</li>
            <li> I had to send my back! They was no way I could use them, the head was crooked.</li>
            <li> I love it. It cuts quietly, smoothly, and sharply.</li>
            <li> I am playing a role in a musical that requires that I maintain the &amp;#34;six day growth look&amp;#34; for the part I am playing. These are great tools to accomplish this. I use a number 1 comb on the beard.  This is a solidly built unit that should last many years.</li>
            <li> One of the best sets that I&#x27;ve brought ....beware the clippers are very sharp so pay close attention when using</li>
            <li> Great bundle deal.I have a tough beard,and this weed whacked it like butter.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair along with my son &amp; nobody cuts our hair besides me, so my clippers take a beating! I also have a full beard that gets trimmed regularly &amp; cannot use razors cause the hair is so course. I picked up this set due to the 9000 motor &amp; the t-blade trimmer &amp; couldn&#x27;t be any happier!! I&#x27;ve cut the length of time to do my sons hair in half &amp; I can trim &amp; shape my beard with much greater accuracy!! Only downfall is that I switch back &amp; forth from clipper to trimmer a lot so I&#x27;m going to call Wahl Corps customer service &amp; pick up a second cord. For those that swap back &amp; forth, get some di-electric grease &amp; grease up both plugs &amp; the cord &amp; it will make things much easier!!</li>
            <li> Just used both clipper and liner/trimmer on myself before using on my son&#x27;s hair, because the pervious brand (Andis) burned him and what a GREAT feeling.  Professional feeling and look!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great clippers, they are easy to use and the cord connects easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave my own head and have my roommate touch up my hairline. The first time I used the trimmer it cut my neck pretty bad. I had to adjust the blade so it wouldn&#x27;t cut me, but it still makes my skin really red and sore. I may need to adjust it more. The clippers are just average, nothing special. They cut good, but not as precise as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery but the trimmers are loud and the machine isn&#x27;t as great as others say and I am a professional</li>
            <li> I sent these to my husband in Afghanistan because he was cutting a few of the guys hair and I wanted him to have a nice set of clippers and when he received them he was so excited because they cut great :-)</li>
            <li> These clippers are great!!! They cut like a hot knife to butter. Also ther feel great in hand.</li>
            <li> Excellent home hair cutting set, however, I bought an additional electrical cord after several uses, moving the one cord from trimmer to cutter is time consuming.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with these bad boys. As soon as I turned them I could tell the difference betweens these clippers and the ones I currently own. I was a bit sceptical about the price and possibly the quality, but I am really happy with them so far.</li>
            <li> I cut my husband and two young gentleman&#x27;s hair and these clippers are wonderful.  Have not had a problem with them and would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m cheap and wanted an alternative to taking my dog to the groomers. yeah, well this doesn&#x27;t work so well on my little cavalier king charles&#x27; fluffy hair. so off to the groomers she goes still... sometimes i do shave off the hair on the bottom of her feet and this works well.</li>
            <li> Great buy, smooth cut and there was not very noticeable vibration like other cheap clippers. The trimmer was very precise, just wish the sides were a little more sharp.</li>
            <li> I love the looks and they perform well.  I plan on taking them to the next hair show I attend.</li>
            <li> The 5 star magic wahl clipper is amazing. It comes with a v9000 motor which is durable and powerful. If you want professional quality for a great price, this combo is a steal. It comes with all the things you need to cut. The delivery time was fast and best of all free.</li>
            <li> Works as described but just make sure not to drop it. I accidentally dropped mine while cleaning and not sure it will be the same anymore. Going to cross my finger and hope it still cuts smoothly.</li>
            <li> High quality,you can notice the difference right away compare to the 20-30 $ that I have purchased from local stores.</li>
            <li> This is such an incredible idea from Wahl that I personally want to keep it a secret.  It just seems that when things are too good to be true in the barber world that they tend to get discontinued or the price will get jacked up and then no one will be able to afford it.  Frankly, I&#x27;m scared a Wahl rep will see this and realize that they&#x27;ve discovered a diamond.  So as a little insurance I bought two- yeah...it&#x27;s that good AND I am probably going to buy another one.  Two clippers, one cord??  It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is a very good cutting machine.  Just what you&#x27;d expect from a professional quality magnetic clipper.  So it&#x27;s great for all around cutting, tapering, and fading.  The only drawback may be the size and weight of the clipper.  It is on the larger and heavier end of the clipper spectrum.  I don&#x27;t have very big hands and it&#x27;s still not much of a setback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is also a very good cutting trimmer.  It includes the Wahl zero-gapping tool which makes adjusting your trimmer blades the closest, yet safest height easily attainable.  And I mean EASY.  No more trial and error by way of giving your customers tattoos.  The only draw back of this particular trimmer is that it is on the larger side and once again, I do not have very big hands.  But it too is a magnetic driven liner so it cuts as expected.  So if you like machines like the Andis T-outliner it shouldn&#x27;t be too far off with the exception of again, the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as a package.  This is an absolute steal.  PLEASE Wahl do not discontinue and vendors please don&#x27;t jack up the prices!  Keep this thing as incredible as it is.  The only drawback as a collective, is that the cord can&#x27;t necessarily get swapped back and forth mindlessly.  It does require at the very least, minimal attention.  If you&#x27;re one to just blast through cuts, this may be a bigger setback to you than say, the barber/ stylist that puts a little more time into their cuts.  That is of course if you wish to use it in tandem as I believe is the intention of Wahl when they thought of this.  Additionally, it comes with all the guards for the clipper and trimmer, and a comb.  So if you are familiar with clipper over comb techniques you can cut several types of haircuts, with proficiency, right out of the box.  Standing ovation for Wahl.  And I hope this isn&#x27;t the catalyst for triggering an impossibly attainable haircutting machine set.f course if you wish to use it in tandem as I believe is the intention of Wahl when they thought of this.

            <li> BUY THESE NOW, YOU WILL NOT BE UPSET!!  BEST PAIR OF CLIPPERS IN HAVE EVER OWNED FOR THE PRICE. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> Hi, I buy this clippers&lt;br /&gt;They are fakes:&lt;br /&gt;1. Not working.&lt;br /&gt;2. Just big noise&lt;br /&gt;3. Bad material quality&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really sad !</li>
            <li> really love this kit.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very well built, seems it will last forever.</li>
            <li> Disappointed on how fast the blades rusted.  They work fine. I&#x27;ve owned quite a few pairs of shears (Retired Army) and I have never owned a pair that rusted as quick as these.  I missed oiling these things once and almost had to throw them away.</li>
            <li> Feels great, cuts great and with great dual cord adapter. This is the best idea ever. Two clippers and one cord. Its thick cord and well designed that I&#x27;ve switched back and forth several times with no problem or wear. I was fearful of the switch or the cord getting damaged but its very lasting.</li>
            <li> I got this order in two days and I have to say I&#x27;m amazed and glade I bought this! This is a v9000 motor I opened the clipper and boom it has a v9000 motor! It&#x27;s nice powerful and very accurate. Both the trimmer and clipper is amazing! The price is great and I would never trade this order for anything else! I recommend this !!!</li>
            <li> The clippers are great but the trimmer are defective. They cut my son in laws neck. I can&#x27;t return them because they only have 30 return. That&#x27;s not right. I do not want my money back I want to exchange them. If I would have bought them at the store there would be no problem</li>
