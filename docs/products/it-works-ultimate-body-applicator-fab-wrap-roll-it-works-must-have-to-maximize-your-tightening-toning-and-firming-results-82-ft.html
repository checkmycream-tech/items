            <li>Seran wrap works so much better</li>
            <li>It tears very easily and has a strong smell for something that&#x27;s not supposed to do anything.</li>
            <li>The seller sent the product faster than expected, I was very happy with the service.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-super easy to apply yourself</li>
            <li>Wrap material seems to tear easily as you are putting it on.</li>
            <li>the scent is so strong it stayed in my bathroom well after I applied it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1st Month eSuite and replicated website free</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- quick and easy in 45 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then I used wraps for the last month and had Amazing Results!</li>
            <li>You can get these for $7 as a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>You can also become a loyal customer and get these way</li>
            <li>( you can also become a loyal costumer here!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are super then and will cut quickly.</li>
            <li>My face was much smoother!!</li>
            <li>So worth the purchase</li>
            <li>But otherwise yea kinda worth the price.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>But about the wraps, These really do work!</li>
            <li>first off it smells like motor oil.</li>
            <li>It is very flimsy , i think I should have just used saran wrap like some people suggested.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see the point in wasting my money on the wraps or fab wrap because it does not stay in place.</li>
            <li>I recieved the product on time, The product is not holding when I try to rape it , but I will buy again Thanks</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>, I was checking many different and similar of this one</li>
            <li>This works really well to hold the body wrap on but it is not an actual body wrap.</li>
            <li>sometimes you have to complete 2 before you see the results.</li>
            <li>I believe you have to be completely still to use the body wraps because no matter what you use to hold it in place, any type of movement will make it move.</li>
            <li>all the other products are well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Big waste if money tore easily, rolls up when you move, and doesn&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li>It ripps really easy making it really hard to wrap yourself.</li>
            <li>I just received this, I was super anxious to try it out...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s broken so easy.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It does wrap awesome but i did not know its not a wrap you still need to order the wraps for your tummy and then you over wrap it with this around it.. so im saving it until i buy the other product that goes with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s broken so easy. I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> This product was to be used to wrap around the body wraps.  It is very flimsy , i think I should have just used saran wrap like some people suggested.</li>
            <li> This works really well to hold the body wrap on but it is not an actual body wrap. Don&#x27;t but it here though. This product is only  $5 at KKBNWraps.com!</li>
            <li> The fab wrap is the best thing to hold the body applicator in place. It doesn&#x27;t make you sweat or feel uncomfortable like Saran Wrap but you can get it for 5 dollars at www.yourwrapgirlamanda.myitworks.com</li>
            <li> I was disappointed at the fact that this does absolutely nothing. It is only for holding the wraps, you have to bye separately, in place. It tears very easily and has a strong smell for something that&#x27;s not supposed to do anything.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! So worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love! I used The Greens for a month to cleanse, then Thermofit for a month and then I used wraps for the last month and had Amazing Results! :) my distributor is so caring, involved and works with me for my progress. She will walk you threw your fitness journey. She loves what she does! Check her out www.annandamanda.myitworks.com</li>
            <li> The product is not what I expected. It tears very easily. And does not hold itself in place. Other than that no other issues.</li>
            <li> Awful product, not recommended</li>
            <li> You do not need the Fab wrap to do the wraps. Personally I like saran wrap better anyways. But about the wraps, These really do work! Hints the name it works! People selling on Amazon have them a little too high priced though. I found a friend that sells them for $59 a box of 4 at brittcanwrap.myitworks.com. She helped me with tips and recommendations to maximize my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- quick and easy in 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-you see immediate results and they keep working for 72 hours.&lt;br /&gt;-super easy to apply yourself&lt;br /&gt;-you can use them anywhere on your body&lt;br /&gt;-they are made with botanical ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-cheaper than going to the salon for a body wrap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- sometimes you have to complete 2 before you see the results.</li>
            <li> It ripps really easy making it really hard to wrap yourself.</li>
            <li> Hated them. Didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> You can get these for $7 as a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> first off it smells like motor oil. the scent is so strong it stayed in my bathroom well after I applied it. secondly ok it wraps well but as soon as I move around or sit down it rolls up and down.

            <li> Wrap material seems to tear easily as you are putting it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. When I use the wrap then putting the ultimate fab wrap over the regular wrap. It likes to roll up while I am wearing it. But otherwise yea kinda worth the price.</li>
            <li> These wraps are amazing!! Before you use them lookup It works wrap tips and tricks! I&#x27;ve seen awesome results! loosened the pants, better definition, and shrank the belly.

            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this it&#x27;s to delicate I could wrap my legs with this.</li>
            <li> They are super then and will cut quickly. Before you even start rapping it</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> The worse it didn&#x27;t arrived when expected and when it did worse product ever..</li>
            <li> The seller sent the product faster than expected, I was very happy with the service. The product on the other hand was not what I was expecting. Every time I tried to wrap myself, the Fab Wrap would tear and it did not stick well.</li>
            <li> good for what i needed</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it start rolling up!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My face was much smoother!!</li>
            <li> Can not pull on this roll to go around waist without tearing. Very cheap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought from amazon n never had any problem or be disappointed until I bought this item. I was so disappointed. It wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> It is probably my fault for not reading correctly but this did not work at all.  I can&#x27;t return because we &amp;#34;wasted it&amp;#34; trying to make it work.</li>
            <li> This is just cosmetic does not work....read my blog to learn how to get healthy from the inside out [...]</li>
            <li> Not what I expected!  Wrong item</li>
            <li> I just received this, I was super anxious to try it out... Only to be disappointed with it! I wasted money of this for nothing! Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> Not what i thought it was</li>
            <li> It tears and doesn&#x27;t stay on. I paid money for tissue paper basically.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. It tears and rolls up when you put it on. Seran wrap works so much better and it&#x27;s not $7 a roll. . .</li>
            <li> Horrible. Will never order this again.</li>
