            <li>so much cheaper than at the dermatologists office; great product!</li>
            <li>Liked the feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>It has diminished my hyper pigmentation nicely.</li>
            <li>It feels nice on the skin</li>
            <li>Since I have used this product before, I was already familiar with how great it was.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It needs a better pump or even a squeeze tube.</li>
            <li>Love this product and have seen a noticeable difference in my skin since I began using it 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I love Skin Medica.  </li>
            <li>I just love it...</li>
            <li>Love the feel of it on my skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and was confident that because it was coming from an &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; dealer that it would be quality.</li>
            <li>so I cannot squeeze the product but have to unscrew the top and try to dispense</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>More packaging than product.  </li>
            <li>I love how it makes my face feel and look.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I feel that I am providing healthy nutrients to my skin.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect was the immediate shipping and outstanding level of customer</li>
            <li>I love skin medica products and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>My skin is more radiant and supple in appearance.</li>
            <li>I love this product line.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for more than a year</li>
            <li>I really love what it has done to my skin.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best skin products I have ever used--not inexpensive, but very well worth it.</li>
            <li>but I use it more at night.</li>
            <li>have a pump &#x27;mechanism&#x27;, so you would have to unscrew the top and use it &#x27;manually&#x27; (for the lack of better word).</li>
            <li>Like very much......goes on smooth, feels great on the skin before moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This serum is light, smells great, and hydrates my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth texture of this product.</li>
            <li>Product, good, dispenser not so much.  </li>
            <li>It is creamy and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>Here is the recipe for beautiful skin:&lt;br /&gt;1)Lumixyl topical brightening cream&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it makes my fine lines disappear!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is fine but the dispenser pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I leaves my skin soft and my makeup is very easy to apply!</li>
            <li>SkinMedica has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but since I started using this product my skin tone is more even and breakouts are rare.  </li>
            <li>It will protect you from free radical damage...</li>
            <li>I use this light cream under my moisture cream.  </li>
            <li>A great product that gets rid of ruddiness, but there isn&#x27;t enough in the bottle for the price.  </li>
            <li>It help make my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth and has no smell.</li>
            <li>maybe that&#x27;s why you get such a great price on it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels right after I put this on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>When I ran out of my first bottle, I wanted more</li>
            <li>You can unscrew the top and use the product, but that is kind of a bummer especially considering that this is a costly product.</li>
            <li>This is by far my must-have favorite!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t given it a full trial run to see if that subsides.</li>
            <li>so I ordered the full size.</li>
            <li>The seller I purchased from was outstanding and I very much appreciated her contact and follow-up after my purchase.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day to keep my skin healthy, soft, youthful and blemish free...</li>
            <li>I love the way my face feels soft  and looks smooth  after using this product.</li>
            <li>but it is absorbed in quickly</li>
            <li>love the product it keeps my skin young and supple</li>
            <li>my skin is more calm, clear and even toned.  </li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>It is worth the price and Amazon had the lowest price.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Once, it wasn&#x27;t working right out of the package.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making it right, Gabby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame the company can&#x27;t seem to get this right</li>
            <li>Very much so, but definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>TNS is great products, usually.  </li>
            <li>, your face feels kinda like a pearl after you&#x27;ve applied it, but within a second or two I feel like I&#x27;ve just put on something with very, very fine glass in it.  </li>
            <li>It just feels great on my face, keeping it smooth, soft and unburdened by old dry cells.</li>
            <li>I have been using thius product for almost a year and my skin is in such good condition at 45 years old that I no longer wear any foundation.</li>
            <li>The product, skinMedica Vitamin C + E Complex, is a good product, but the bottle I received didn&#x27;t have a working pump; consequently, I have to take the top off each time I use it (gets kind of messy.</li>
            <li>From the first application I was sold.  </li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, balanced skin immediately.</li>
            <li>Over the next couple of months I noticed that my skin was looking better than it ever had</li>
            <li>/&gt;9/2012- Update, still love this stuff as stated above.</li>
            <li>You can really see a difference in my complexion since I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
            <li>I use this at night in rotation with Skin Medica&#x27;s TNS Recovery Complex and have had great results.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth and soft like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first thing I put on my face in the morning after I shower</li>
            <li>but I have read many reviews on different sites complaining about the pump.  </li>
            <li>At first this product stung a bit, but it just means it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my skin seems to love this product.</li>
            <li>get the idea that I might be able to tolerate a stronger vitamin topical.</li>
            <li>SkinMedica is one of the only companies that makes a C product that is bioavailable  Love this product&#x27;s quality and texture.</li>
            <li>The top fell off the bottle and when I put it back on, no cream would come out.  </li>
            <li>After reading mainly positive reviews I decided to take a leap and purchase the product here.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product for 10+ days, it diffidently feels more like a primer, goes on very smooth</li>
            <li>It just spreads and absorbs (that may be thanks to my clarisonic though) ..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I think it really works well on my skin</li>
            <li>This is a very concentrated cream that almost feels like a gel as it goes on.</li>
            <li>crazy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not moisturize so much, so you have to use two products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>She loves it thanks.</li>
            <li>It really evens out one&#x27;s skin tone.</li>
            <li>As much as it costs, Skin Medica should pay attention and redesign the container and pump.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews say the pump doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>really absorbs.</li>
            <li>I had been struggling with eczema on my face and this worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I feel so comfortable without makeup because this product is changing my complexion and giving years and life back to my face.</li>
            <li>So do not waste your money on Vit C products that simply sit on the top of your skin and do nothing.  </li>
            <li>The pump is missing is a fact, but Susan assured me that the product was authentic and fresh.  </li>
            <li>In the morning, I frequently use the TNS Recovery complex again and follow up with a good moisturizer containing sun block.</li>
            <li>I just take the top off and tap a little bit in my palm.</li>
            <li>I will keep the product this time but will check right away next time on the pump.  </li>
            <li>Arrived as described, new and unopened.</li>
            <li>A very small amount provides adequate coverage and leaves my skin feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li>I have read many other users of this product are saying the same problems as mine.</li>
            <li>SkinMedica gave me a new one because my old one had a problem with the pump.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for backing up your product.  </li>
            <li>If I have a little left over after applying it to my face and neck I apply it to the top of my hands.  </li>
            <li>and when I opened it (on vacation) it had clearly expired.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive, breakout prone skin</li>
            <li>It is soft, you dont have to rub iti in like a lotion...</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I had to remove the pump and just use product directly from bottle.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use a lot of products with vitamins because they tend to irritate my skin; this product does not.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old with no lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>So much anti-aging research is coming out stating the importance of Vitamin C in your daily skin care.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>, for that much money I would hope it would last longer</li>
            <li>it is so rich that just a dab will cover your whole face,so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and you have to use so little of it.</li>
            <li>Everytime ive applied it, the next morning I wake up with a new zit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already been using their Retinol Complex, TNS Essential Serum and moisturizer and love those products.</li>
            <li>I took a mental picture of my skin when I started, noticing I had crows feet and other fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>I have used Skin Medica Cand E Complex for a long time and it is one of my favorite moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and it makes me look 10 years younger!  </li>
            <li>It is exactly the same product with all the bells and whistles just half the price.  </li>
            <li>But not sure, maybe this is the right strength for me</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and dry.  </li>
            <li>After about a week, it does not work, and you have to dig the stuff out with a small spoon or some other device that will fit into the bottle.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It needs a better pump or even a squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have seen a noticeable difference in my skin since I began using it 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> I love Skin Medica.  </li>
            <li> I just love it...</li>
            <li> Love the feel of it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and was confident that because it was coming from an &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; dealer that it would be quality.</li>
            <li> so I cannot squeeze the product but have to unscrew the top and try to dispense</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> More packaging than product.  </li>
            <li> I love how it makes my face feel and look.  </li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I feel that I am providing healthy nutrients to my skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect was the immediate shipping and outstanding level of customer</li>
            <li> I love skin medica products and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> My skin is more radiant and supple in appearance.</li>
            <li> I love this product line.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for more than a year</li>
            <li> I really love what it has done to my skin.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best skin products I have ever used--not inexpensive, but very well worth it.</li>
            <li> but I use it more at night.</li>
            <li> have a pump &#x27;mechanism&#x27;, so you would have to unscrew the top and use it &#x27;manually&#x27; (for the lack of better word).</li>
            <li> Like very much......goes on smooth, feels great on the skin before moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This serum is light, smells great, and hydrates my skin very well.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth texture of this product.</li>
            <li> Product, good, dispenser not so much.  </li>
            <li> It is creamy and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> Here is the recipe for beautiful skin:&lt;br /&gt;1)Lumixyl topical brightening cream&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it makes my fine lines disappear!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is fine but the dispenser pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I leaves my skin soft and my makeup is very easy to apply!</li>
            <li> SkinMedica has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> but since I started using this product my skin tone is more even and breakouts are rare.  </li>
            <li> It will protect you from free radical damage...</li>
            <li> I use this light cream under my moisture cream.  </li>
            <li> A great product that gets rid of ruddiness, but there isn&#x27;t enough in the bottle for the price.  </li>
            <li> It help make my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Smooth and has no smell.</li>
            <li> maybe that&#x27;s why you get such a great price on it.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels right after I put this on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> When I ran out of my first bottle, I wanted more</li>
            <li> You can unscrew the top and use the product, but that is kind of a bummer especially considering that this is a costly product.</li>
            <li> This is by far my must-have favorite!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t given it a full trial run to see if that subsides.</li>
            <li> so I ordered the full size.</li>
            <li> The seller I purchased from was outstanding and I very much appreciated her contact and follow-up after my purchase.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day to keep my skin healthy, soft, youthful and blemish free...</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels soft  and looks smooth  after using this product.</li>
            <li> but it is absorbed in quickly</li>
            <li> love the product it keeps my skin young and supple</li>
            <li> my skin is more calm, clear and even toned.  </li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> It is worth the price and Amazon had the lowest price.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Once, it wasn&#x27;t working right out of the package.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making it right, Gabby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame the company can&#x27;t seem to get this right</li>
            <li> Very much so, but definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> TNS is great products, usually.  </li>
            <li> , your face feels kinda like a pearl after you&#x27;ve applied it, but within a second or two I feel like I&#x27;ve just put on something with very, very fine glass in it.  </li>
            <li> It just feels great on my face, keeping it smooth, soft and unburdened by old dry cells.</li>
            <li> I have been using thius product for almost a year and my skin is in such good condition at 45 years old that I no longer wear any foundation.</li>
            <li> The product, skinMedica Vitamin C + E Complex, is a good product, but the bottle I received didn&#x27;t have a working pump; consequently, I have to take the top off each time I use it (gets kind of messy.</li>
            <li> From the first application I was sold.  </li>
            <li> Soft, smooth, balanced skin immediately.</li>
            <li> Over the next couple of months I noticed that my skin was looking better than it ever had</li>
            <li> /&gt;9/2012- Update, still love this stuff as stated above.</li>
            <li> You can really see a difference in my complexion since I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
            <li> I use this at night in rotation with Skin Medica&#x27;s TNS Recovery Complex and have had great results.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smooth and soft like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first thing I put on my face in the morning after I shower</li>
            <li> but I have read many reviews on different sites complaining about the pump.  </li>
            <li> At first this product stung a bit, but it just means it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my skin seems to love this product.</li>
            <li> get the idea that I might be able to tolerate a stronger vitamin topical.</li>
            <li> SkinMedica is one of the only companies that makes a C product that is bioavailable  Love this product&#x27;s quality and texture.</li>
            <li> The top fell off the bottle and when I put it back on, no cream would come out.  </li>
            <li> After reading mainly positive reviews I decided to take a leap and purchase the product here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for 10+ days, it diffidently feels more like a primer, goes on very smooth</li>
            <li> It just spreads and absorbs (that may be thanks to my clarisonic though) ..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I think it really works well on my skin</li>
            <li> This is a very concentrated cream that almost feels like a gel as it goes on.</li>
            <li> crazy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not moisturize so much, so you have to use two products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> She loves it thanks.</li>
            <li> It really evens out one&#x27;s skin tone.</li>
            <li> As much as it costs, Skin Medica should pay attention and redesign the container and pump.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews say the pump doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> really absorbs.</li>
            <li> I had been struggling with eczema on my face and this worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I feel so comfortable without makeup because this product is changing my complexion and giving years and life back to my face.</li>
            <li> So do not waste your money on Vit C products that simply sit on the top of your skin and do nothing.  </li>
            <li> The pump is missing is a fact, but Susan assured me that the product was authentic and fresh.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, I frequently use the TNS Recovery complex again and follow up with a good moisturizer containing sun block.</li>
            <li> I just take the top off and tap a little bit in my palm.</li>
            <li> I will keep the product this time but will check right away next time on the pump.  </li>
            <li> Arrived as described, new and unopened.</li>
            <li> A very small amount provides adequate coverage and leaves my skin feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li> I have read many other users of this product are saying the same problems as mine.</li>
            <li> SkinMedica gave me a new one because my old one had a problem with the pump.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for backing up your product.  </li>
            <li> If I have a little left over after applying it to my face and neck I apply it to the top of my hands.  </li>
            <li> and when I opened it (on vacation) it had clearly expired.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive, breakout prone skin</li>
            <li> It is soft, you dont have to rub iti in like a lotion...</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I had to remove the pump and just use product directly from bottle.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use a lot of products with vitamins because they tend to irritate my skin; this product does not.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old with no lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> So much anti-aging research is coming out stating the importance of Vitamin C in your daily skin care.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> , for that much money I would hope it would last longer</li>
            <li> it is so rich that just a dab will cover your whole face,so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and you have to use so little of it.</li>
            <li> Everytime ive applied it, the next morning I wake up with a new zit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already been using their Retinol Complex, TNS Essential Serum and moisturizer and love those products.</li>
            <li> I took a mental picture of my skin when I started, noticing I had crows feet and other fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> I have used Skin Medica Cand E Complex for a long time and it is one of my favorite moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and it makes me look 10 years younger!  </li>
            <li> It is exactly the same product with all the bells and whistles just half the price.  </li>
            <li> But not sure, maybe this is the right strength for me</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and dry.  </li>
            <li> After about a week, it does not work, and you have to dig the stuff out with a small spoon or some other device that will fit into the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Considering that this is a $50 face cream, I&#x27;m pretty upset that it was not sealed and that half the product&#x27;s contents were missing upon delivery.</li>
            <li> It did subside within a few seconds, but it surprised me that it had a kick.</li>
            <li> Plus, it goes on, not really like a serum, but like a primer such as Smashbox.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Skin Medica Vitamin C and E Complex  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it last quite a long time</li>
            <li> I received it as a free sample and was skeptical and not interested in adding a step to my skin care.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it definitely helps some, noticeably so, with lightening dark (sun) spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No longer need freeze treatment for those dry spots!  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and use this as a moisturizing treat once a week.</li>
            <li> This sort of stung my skin a little upon initial application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied different creams, serum and gels and some of them sting a little</li>
            <li> (1) container is way bigger than it needs to be for the amount of product and (2) that it&#x27;s hard to get to the last amount of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties and have all the early signs of sun damage and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C + E Complex 1 fluid ounce, I received a sample a while back</li>
            <li> It is on the expensive side but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the downsides, which are minimal</li>
            <li> Would have expected to see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is somewhat expensive but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels like silk on your skin and only a few drops provide desired results.</li>
            <li> I had that problem also but figured out, if I turn the bottle upside down and rest the bottle loosely in the cap, almost all of it pumps out.</li>
            <li> Not good for sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning and every other night, alternating with a prescription retin A product that I&#x27;ve used for over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not notice any stinging as other users have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I use other skin medica products</li>
            <li> Maybe these containers are defective and that is why the price is half of what salons and other stores charge.</li>
            <li> It just is not worth the aggravation</li>
            <li> As with most TNS products, I hate the container.</li>
            <li> A small amount is all you need to cover your face and neck so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I do not remember having problem in previous Vit C &amp; E containers.</li>
            <li> It also costs about half the price on line as they get at the spa.</li>
            <li> I would try it again if I could find it for less.</li>
            <li> in less than 2 weeks my skin was smoother and tighter..</li>
            <li> so I found it on Amazon.com for much less.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> A little eyeshadow</li>
            <li> used other products in the past.</li>
            <li> It does tinkle a little when you apply it</li>
            <li> The bottle-pump is missing a part</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I started to return this but decided it was too much trouble.  </li>
            <li> and I tried it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> also it is not scented with heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li> So it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> You can feel a little tingle sometimes, which tells me the vitamins are active (at least that&#x27;s what I think).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what that&#x27;s about ...</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed in Amazon..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll order this product again....</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s from this product?</li>
            <li> It was a dark yellow color, in contrast to the white it usually is, and had a very bad stench.  </li>
            <li> so I hardly use this.</li>
            <li> SkinMedica Vit C +E complex</li>
            <li> I start with TNS recovery , then layer the Vitamin C&amp;E Complex.</li>
            <li> I like this complex</li>
            <li> the lid has broken</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I opened it, it was too late to return.  </li>
            <li> Easier access but no Brilliant Destinction points.</li>
            <li> Expensive?</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive to buy from my dermatologist</li>
            <li> however it is really expensive for the amount of product you get</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will NOT be ordering from amazon again!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;are very expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two years and my crows feet are very faint and almost gone.  </li>
            <li> but I wish it did not temporarily sting me :(</li>
            <li> Very unhappy</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in Amazon.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Instantly you will see an improvement  in skin smoothness and brightness ! Lov it</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have been using it for a year now and the results are great!  I use it before my day cream.  I leaves my skin soft and my makeup is very easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it every morning before I go out.  It is creamy and goes on easily.  The product was well packaged and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! I received it as a free sample and was skeptical and not interested in adding a step to my skin care. From the first application I was sold.  Soft, smooth, balanced skin immediately. Oily spots were under control, dryness was gone. Over the next couple of months I noticed that my skin was looking better than it ever had and my husband commented on how good my skin was looking.  I have extremely sensitive, breakout prone skin but since I started using this product my skin tone is more even and breakouts are rare.  I have used this product for about a year now.  I use it in the morning and every other night, alternating with a prescription retin A product that I&#x27;ve used for over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/2012- Update, still love this stuff as stated above. I wanted to comment on the pump packaging because I am hoping to get the manufacturer to change it. The pump often stops working when there is a lot of product left. Once, it wasn&#x27;t working right out of the package. You can unscrew the top and use the product, but that is kind of a bummer especially considering that this is a costly product. It needs a better pump or even a squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> This sort of stung my skin a little upon initial application. It did subside within a few seconds, but it surprised me that it had a kick. It is soft, you dont have to rub iti in like a lotion... It just spreads and absorbs (that may be thanks to my clarisonic though) .. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my complexion.

            <li> Been using this for years and think it improves the &amp;#34;youthfulness&amp;#34; of my skin.</li>
            <li> Great seller &amp; product!</li>
            <li> Wonderful and effective serum for my aging skin. It has minimized my wrinkles and also cleared  my skin of sun damage.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have seen a noticeable difference in my skin since I began using it 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for your skin.  The problem is the container.  I have had 4 containers of the stuff, and the pump does not work properly.  After about a week, it does not work, and you have to dig the stuff out with a small spoon or some other device that will fit into the bottle.  For the price, it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Loved this product!   I have oily skin and this product does not leave my T zone shiny and oily.   My skin looks and feels great!   It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a while. Arrived as described, new and unopened. Fast shipping, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> love the product it keeps my skin young and supple</li>
            <li> Product, good, dispenser not so much.  End up needing to open to get product out.  Not a fluke this is the 3rd I have.  One from salon the same.  At the salon she bangs it on counter to get out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product after having had a planing of my skin.  It is great for the skin, keeps it moist and renews the tone.  I would recommend it for anybody but especially ladies over 60.</li>
            <li> This is by far my must-have favorite! It is like miracle serum for blemishes. I use it twice a day to keep my skin healthy, soft, youthful and blemish free...</li>
            <li> I like the product but get discouraged when I try to dispense.  Customer Service replied immediately and told me to shake it because of an air pocket. It does help but  I do not remember having problem in previous Vit C &amp; E containers.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  You can really see a difference in my complexion since I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
            <li> been using this for a couple of years along with the essential serum. I think it really works well on my skin</li>
            <li> I have been using thius product for almost a year and my skin is in such good condition at 45 years old that I no longer wear any foundation. A little eyeshadow and I am good to go.  This is a very concentrated cream that almost feels like a gel as it goes on. It is in no way oily. A very small amount provides adequate coverage and leaves my skin feeling so smooth. It also costs about half the price on line as they get at the spa. This is what I use as my daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product !  Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product.</li>
            <li> I love Skin Medica.  I am 60 years old and it makes me look 10 years younger!  Lots of compliments since I began using the product.</li>
            <li> Remember you need Vit E to absorb the Vit C  in your skin.  So do not waste your money on Vit C products that simply sit on the top of your skin and do nothing.  This is an amazing product.  It will protect you from free radical damage...sun, enviromental stuff etc.  That is the reason why you need a Vit C product for you skin  every day.  Here is the recipe for beautiful skin:&lt;br /&gt;1)Lumixyl topical brightening cream&lt;br /&gt;2) SkinMedica Vit C +E complex&lt;br /&gt;3)SkinMedica TNS Essential Serum&lt;br /&gt;4)Neocutis Biorestorative Cream with Psp&lt;br /&gt;5)Neocutis lumiere Riche Biorestorative eye balm with Psp&lt;br /&gt;6) sun Block</li>
            <li> I wrote a review before describing that the product came without a pump, the color was off and I requested a refund.  I was very pleased with a speedy customer representative response.  Susan responded to multiple questions and emails, and talked me through the issues. The pump is missing is a fact, but Susan assured me that the product was authentic and fresh.  It did tingle on my skin just as it supposed to.  I will keep the product this time but will check right away next time on the pump.  BTW, the refund was offered as well.  Thank you for making it right, Gabby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> so much cheaper than at the dermatologists office; great product!</li>
            <li> makes my skin smooth and flawless ......will never stop using the product.... I just love it...Just perfect size to put in my bag.</li>
            <li> I use this light cream under my moisture cream.  It makes my face silky and it is suppose to be an antioxidant.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using SkinMedica for over a year now.  The result have been amazing for my skin.  I&#x27;m in my late twenties and have all the early signs of sun damage and wrinkles.  My skin is sensitive and dry.  I also have the tenancy to get red and will often get whiteheads.  SkinMedica has made a huge difference. my skin is more calm, clear and even toned.  I initially searched out this product because it was getting so expansive to buy from my dermatologist.  After reading mainly positive reviews I decided to take a leap and purchase the product here.  It is exactly the same product with all the bells and whistles just half the price.  I will be purchasing my cream from here going forward.</li>
            <li> recommended by my dermatologist and it&#x27;s the best.  No longer need freeze treatment for those dry spots!  Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> It was too pricey for the amount that was in the bottle.  I would try it again if I could find it for less.</li>
            <li> Liked the feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> The pump does not dispense the lotion well.  Maybe these containers are defective and that is why the price is half of what salons and other stores charge.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ultra-sensitive skin, so that is why I posted 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it makes my fine lines disappear!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So crazy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not moisturize so much, so you have to use two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it does erase stress areas on your face and makes skin super-soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with it-but I wish it did not temporarily sting me :(</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> Skin medica works great for my wife&#x27;s face. She loves it thanks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and was confident that because it was coming from an &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; dealer that it would be quality. Well, that was not the case at all. The product was opened and not sealed and had spilt all over the packaging when I opened it up. Considering that this is a $50 face cream, I&#x27;m pretty upset that it was not sealed and that half the product&#x27;s contents were missing upon delivery. Pretty disappointed in Amazon..</li>
            <li> I use this at night in rotation with Skin Medica&#x27;s TNS Recovery Complex and have had great results. In the morning, I frequently use the TNS Recovery complex again and follow up with a good moisturizer containing sun block.</li>
            <li> The bottle-pump is missing a part so I cannot squeeze the product but have to unscrew the top and try to dispense it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I noticed this, I was leaving the country next day so did not have the rime required to return it. Very unhappy</li>
            <li> It took forever to get here, but I like the product.</li>
            <li> SkinMedica gave me a new one because my old one had a problem with the pump.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for backing up your product.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> The product is fine but the dispenser pump doesn&#x27;t work. For the price I&#x27;ve paid it should work. Each time I want to use it I have to remove the cap and tap out the lotion.</li>
            <li> I like the product but still feel that it is over priced. More packaging than product.  Easier access but no Brilliant Destinction points.</li>
            <li> Very happy I tried this product.  I&#x27;ve already been using their Retinol Complex, TNS Essential Serum and moisturizer and love those products.</li>
            <li> A great product that gets rid of ruddiness, but there isn&#x27;t enough in the bottle for the price.  It really evens out one&#x27;s skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years.  It works great for my skin but the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  I have read many other users of this product are saying the same problems as mine.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth texture of this product. It makes my skin feel smooth and soft like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for 10+ days, it diffidently feels more like a primer, goes on very smooth, your face feels kinda like a pearl after you&#x27;ve applied it, but within a second or two I feel like I&#x27;ve just put on something with very, very fine glass in it.  I&#x27;ve applied different creams, serum and gels and some of them sting a little but this feels very different.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll order this product again....on the bright side the pump works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks and I love it! It&#x27;s the first thing I put on my face in the morning after I shower and I love how silky and wonderful it makes my skin feel. It absorbs quickly and you have to use so little of it. I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> While I think this is a good product,the pump does not work well.You have to push the pump over and over to finally get the product.It just is not worth the aggravation so I hardly use this.It&#x27;s a shame the company can&#x27;t seem to get this right,this is the second one I&#x27;ve had like this.Will not order again.</li>
            <li> The pump did not work.  I have bought this twice before, once from my doctor&#x27;s office and once from another website.  Neither of those pumps worked.  The product is great but I have read many reviews on different sites complaining about the pump.  As much as it costs, Skin Medica should pay attention and redesign the container and pump. I started to return this but decided it was too much trouble.  I had to remove the pump and just use product directly from bottle.</li>
            <li> Like very much......goes on smooth, feels great on the skin before moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It help make my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product..in less than 2 weeks my skin was smoother and tighter.. it is so rich that just a dab will cover your whole face,so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years with great results!</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li> The texture is great! Smooth and has no smell. The skin is like velvet.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C + E Complex 1 fluid ounce, I received a sample a while back and I tried it for a few weeks. I loved it so I ordered the full size. It is worth the price and Amazon had the lowest price.</li>
            <li> At first this product stung a bit, but it just means it&#x27;s working.  I love how it makes my face feel and look.  It&#x27;s a great skincare maintenance product.</li>
            <li> Derm doc recommended and great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love the product. The problem is the dispenser. It doesn&#x27;t work because the tube that attachesto the lid has broken</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my skin seems to love this product. It&#x27;s immediately noticeable how it smooths and radiates my complexion. I feel that I am providing healthy nutrients to my skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  The product feels like velvet when it is applied to my face.  I can feel the softness all day.</li>
            <li> This serum is light, smells great, and hydrates my skin very well. I have very dry skin and use this as a moisturizing treat once a week. I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use a lot of products with vitamins because they tend to irritate my skin; this product does not. It&#x27;s almost soothing. Expensive? Very much so, but definitely worth the price. Keeps my skin supple and happy.</li>
            <li> The product, skinMedica Vitamin C + E Complex, is a good product, but the bottle I received didn&#x27;t have a working pump; consequently, I have to take the top off each time I use it (gets kind of messy.</li>
            <li> Since I have used this product before, I was already familiar with how great it was.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t expect was the immediate shipping and outstanding level of customer&lt;br /&gt;service when I asked the seller a question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend the seller and the product!</li>
            <li> Skin Medican products are all I use on my face.  Recommended by my dermatologist.  Just that they&lt;br /&gt;are very expensive.</li>
            <li> I love skin medica products and this one is no exception. I start with TNS recovery , then layer the Vitamin C&amp;E Complex. It leaves your skin with a velvet like finish. I would give it 5 stars, but the bottle design isn&#x27;t great. It stops pumping out product after you have used about 2/3 of it. I just take the top off and tap a little bit in my palm. A little goes a long way, so it last quite a long time</li>
            <li> It just feels great on my face, keeping it smooth, soft and unburdened by old dry cells. I have Rosacea but can use this stuff liberally. It feels like it is kind of burning, but then it&#x27;s affects are great. My dogs all try to lick it off my face. It does taste good, to me anyway. As with most TNS products, I hate the container. I want to take the lid off and get the last bit of product from it. TNS is great products, usually.  I pray that they will keep making this Vitamin C and E product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful skin product and lives up to its reputation.  My skin is more radiant and supple in appearance.</li>
            <li> Love t! You can feel the vitamins tingling on your face when you apply it!</li>
            <li> Feels great on skin, but I started to break out. Not sure if it&#x27;s from this product?</li>
            <li> I used this product and product line daily for 3 years.  I am 51 years old with no lines or wrinkles. I love this product line.</li>
            <li> I love this product. So much anti-aging research is coming out stating the importance of Vitamin C in your daily skin care.  I love it&#x27;s silky texture and I definitely think is has improved my skin.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT EVERY MORNING FOLLOWED BY A MOISURIZER AND MY SKIN FEELS AND LOOKS GREAT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Leaves a wonderful satin feel and look to skin..love it under makeup or without</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for more than a year and I can tell you it helps my aging skin.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product. It makes your skin feel soft. I did not notice any stinging as other users have mentioned. I took a mental picture of my skin when I started, noticing I had crows feet and other fine lines on my face. I have been using it for two years and my crows feet are very faint and almost gone.  When I ran out of my first bottle, I wanted more but it was too expensive to buy from my dermatologist so I found it on Amazon.com for much less. Some of the reviews say the pump doesn&#x27;t work very well. I had that problem also but figured out, if I turn the bottle upside down and rest the bottle loosely in the cap, almost all of it pumps out. I really love what it has done to my skin.</li>
            <li> Very happy with results I see.&lt;br /&gt;Have used other products in the past. This has worked best for me.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used Skin Medica Cand E Complex for a long time and it is one of my favorite moisturizers.  It is on the expensive side but worth every penny.  A small amount is all you need to cover your face and neck so a little goes a long way.  It does tinkle a little when you apply it but it is absorbed in quickly and I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  If I have a little left over after applying it to my face and neck I apply it to the top of my hands.  I highly recommend Skin Medica Vitamin C and E Complex  also it is not scented with heavy perfumes.It was recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> excellent. really absorbs.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after being given a sample from a dermatologist.  This is one of the best skin products I have ever used--not inexpensive, but very well worth it. I had been struggling with eczema on my face and this worked very well for me.  The seller I purchased from was outstanding and I very much appreciated her contact and follow-up after my purchase.</li>
            <li> The product is great it just looks like it was damaged and maybe that&#x27;s why you get such a great price on it.  The pump on it does not work so I have to unscrew the cap everytime I open it to get the product out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months.  I am very pleased with everything about it.  And I do see definite improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good vitamin C cream. SkinMedica is a good brand. I have bought it several times and will order it again.</li>
            <li> Some vitamin C serums, even high-end ones, break me out even though I am in my mid fifties. This one does not, yay! Plus, it goes on, not really like a serum, but like a primer such as Smashbox. You can feel a little tingle sometimes, which tells me the vitamins are active (at least that&#x27;s what I think).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the idea that I might be able to tolerate a stronger vitamin topical. But not sure, maybe this is the right strength for me and that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts? Anyway, it definitely helps some, noticeably so, with lightening dark (sun) spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed feelings about the packaging. I do like that with the pump, it is sanitary. I don&#x27;t like that (1) container is way bigger than it needs to be for the amount of product and (2) that it&#x27;s hard to get to the last amount of product. About (2), you can get to it with a q-tip, so as not to waste--important, as it is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the downsides, which are minimal I think, I keep coming back to this vitamin complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I bought through an &amp;#34;authorized&amp;#34; seller, so I can&#x27;t speak to the product performance as purchased from Amazon. But the price sure is more attractive!</li>
            <li> Great product, great service</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this vitamin C formula...can use it as a primer under makeup during the day...but I use it more at night. I mix it with Sunday Riley Luna Oil as part of my skin care regime. It has diminished my hyper pigmentation nicely. This is my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in Amazon.  I ordered this product which I have been using for a while and when I opened it (on vacation) it had clearly expired.  It was a dark yellow color, in contrast to the white it usually is, and had a very bad stench.  There was no way I could put it on my face.  Unfortunately, when I opened it, it was too late to return.  Needless to say, I will NOT be ordering from amazon again!</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels right after I put this on. My face needs no make up or even blush! I feel so comfortable without makeup because this product is changing my complexion and giving years and life back to my face. It helps with tone and complexion and overall everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 6 months and have definitely noticed a difference. This is as close as one can get to actual procedures or juvederm or botox injections</li>
            <li> It feels nice on the skin but I don&#x27;t see any change after using it for quite some time. Would have expected to see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Did not make any difference in skin tone or discoloration.</li>
            <li> This product is somewhat expensive but it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;It feels like silk on your skin and only a few drops provide desired results.</li>
            <li> SkinMedica is one of the only companies that makes a C product that is bioavailable  Love this product&#x27;s quality and texture.</li>
            <li> I like this complex however it is really expensive for the amount of product you get, for that much money I would hope it would last longer and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels soft  and looks smooth  after using this product.</li>
            <li> The product was great.  I couldn&#x27;t get it out of the bottle. So it was a waste of money.  I use other skin medica products</li>
            <li> Not good for sensitive skin at all. My face has a red rash on it now because of this and I only use it one time a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Keeps skin moist and works wonders on age spots.  I definitely plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> The top fell off the bottle and when I put it back on, no cream would come out.  90 days have gone by, so I can&#x27;t return it.  But for this price, there should be some consideration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks only and have NOT noticed any changes. It is quite pleasant on the skin and does not feel greasy. BE WARE though, the &#x27;bottle&#x27; which is design if though it is supposed to have a pump (cream descriptor is saying 1/2 pumps perday...) does NOT!!!! have a pump &#x27;mechanism&#x27;, so you would have to unscrew the top and use it &#x27;manually&#x27; (for the lack of better word).</li>
