            <li>GREAT</li>

            <li>lip balm is great and it doubles as blush-</li>

            <li>This is a great BB cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting compliments that my skin looks great.  </li>
            <li>it isnt so great as a lip gloss</li>
            <li>Radiant, buildable, and great for drier skin.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>

            <li>Very nice brightening effect.</li>
            <li>Shipment was prompt, beautifully packaged, and they placed some samples, which was a good</li>
            <li>As for the product itself, AMAZING!</li>
            <li>does what I need (I mostly need to even skin tone, no blemishes/acne problems) :D</li>
            <li>Would be great for good skin.</li>
            <li>So nice!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced it first-hand, so I followed the good advice.</li>
            <li>but it does a lovely job of gicing me that glow  &lt;3 btw</li>
            <li>i was satisfied, the price was great!..</li>
            <li>favorite is still the Missha M Perfect BB Cream #23.  </li>
            <li>/cheek tint was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>tint was very good for my cheeks; it gave me a cute glow.</li>
            <li>This Is an amazing cream, moisturizing and great cover.</li>
            <li>This bb cream glides on smoothly and makes my face look flawless.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try a bb cream, so I researched and figured this may be a good one.</li>
            <li>It also smells good, like the tea.     </li>
            <li>It smells nice, but it didn&#x27;t look to great on me.</li>
            <li>But for the size of the bottle, the price was good.</li>
            <li>Loved the appearance and shine of the container and everything.</li>
            <li>LOVED this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not so good.</li>
            <li>I have another product that says BB, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>But this is still a good BB cream.  </li>
            <li>Even though she is darker than I am (I&#x27;m fair</li>
            <li>The cheek tint is a good color too.</li>
            <li>I am guessing it&#x27;s because my skin isn&#x27;t too fair.</li>
            <li>I have a tube of Nars Orgasm and it looks vastly superior to this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am bit fair</li>
            <li>Also because this product is made in Korea, where fair skin is cherished.  </li>
            <li>Also, the cheek tint is gorgeous-</li>
            <li>the bb cream covers surprisingly well,</li>
            <li>Read the product description on the official website to get the details and decided this would be good for me.  </li>
            <li>I tried different bb cream before, this is not the best one if u look for perfect coverage.</li>
            <li>Faster-than-expected and authentic products with a great selection at fair U.S. prices.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, high quality and lip gloss/check stain is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>This bb cream has more coverage  and a great smell.</li>
            <li>It has great coverage but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>the top part lip&amp; cheek tint is also great.</li>
            <li>I am still very satisfied by this product and deal with the trade-off in coverage by going over the BB Cream with powdered foundation using a brush.  </li>
            <li>This cream does a great job of working in place of an every day moisturizer and creates a more even foundation.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy, its really moisturizing goes on smoothly and blends in with my skin color perfectly</li>
            <li>I was concerned it would not match my skin tone because I am of Caucasian lineage, and I&#x27;d read reviews about the cream being a more greyish tone, but the product matches with my skin very nicely.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream!</li>
            <li>That being said, this BB cream matches my skin almost perfectly and covers pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bb cream!</li>
            <li>I tried it on too, and I love it!</li>
            <li>i do love that!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>and yet i look pretty darn close to flawless.</li>
            <li>but here is the one I love!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the cheek and lip tint as well--a nice bonus and handy too!</li>
            <li>Anyways, This BB cream is so amazing, I just don&#x27;t feel like myself without it</li>
            <li>The coverage is amazing, so amazing that as the weeks pass by, I&#x27;ve been lessening the amount I put on my face, and it still makes me glow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even put on any powder afterwards and people tell me my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>But amazingly, I use up every bit of this one.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely scent but in my opinion its best for fair skin people who don&#x27;t have too much scrs on the face.</li>
            <li>This is light coverage, but does a great job of evening out the skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for light coverage.  </li>
            <li>Im also happy that you cant see my pores with it on, because that is usually a huge issue for me.</li>
            <li>But, once you blend it in, it is so nice.</li>
            <li>I wasnt too thrilled about it.</li>
            <li>It is a nice way to combine lotion, sunscreen protection and a tint all in one product.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the idea of the tint which is why I ended up choosing this one.</li>
            <li>The color is really nice</li>
            <li>Glides on so nice and the finish is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>This is a good BB cream, and I love the cheek/lip tint that comes with it--but it&#x27;s not for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives the face a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this product.  </li>
            <li>I compete in pageants and I have to use more makeup when  I&#x27;m on stage, so having something that also is good for my skin</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>cheek color is a nice tint</li>
            <li>im gonna be honest:</li>
            <li>ive made my own (bc im</li>
            <li>they have skin loving ingredients and a nice finish to boot.</li>
            <li>they have skin loving ingredients and a nice finish to boot.</li>
            <li>but it looks nice</li>
            <li>Covers up nicely</li>
            <li>And the cheek stain is really nice and creamy.</li>
            <li>Package was triple sealed, in pristine condition, and arrived as promised, nice...</li>
            <li>I like the BB cream, this one is nice</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>The blush adds a nice touch and it&#x27;s not drying like powder blushes.</li>
            <li>First let me say the vendor was very good.  </li>
            <li>I tried the VIP Gold BB Cream which I liked, but didn&#x27;t love (still kind of drying/cakey).  </li>
            <li>Light coverage for a fresh and flawless look.</li>
            <li>This BB cream goes on easily and gives good coverage.  </li>
            <li>Seoulglamour&#x27;s customer service was great about my questions and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Received quickly and the price is great too.  </li>
            <li>It matches my skin tone perfectly, looks very natural, like it&#x27;s not even there.  </li>
            <li>I do feel it does nicely evens out my skin and looks very smooth and polished.</li>
            <li>cream can provide very good coverage without looking like a mask, or it can be lighter coverage, depending how much you use.  </li>
            <li>If this gets popular in the US, they will need to make more shades.</li>
            <li>Then it makes your skin look natural and flawless!!</li>
            <li>while it&#x27;s nice, I still like Skin79 better because of the whitening; so there&#x27;s a comparison for you.</li>
            <li>the texture is great and the lip and check stain is wonderful, however I think this product wont suit oily skin or dark skin tone</li>
            <li>Love how nice this goes on my face and how it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li>and when it does, it comes with a free sample or two thrown in for good measure.</li>
            <li>and when it does, it comes with a free sample or two thrown in for good measure.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>My skin is fair and dry in the winter, so it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Very quick shipping too!</li>
            <li>This blends in seamlessly with my skin, feels very light and creates a perfect even canvas.  </li>
            <li>Very good for normal type skin.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how great my skin looked and felt the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be full of ingredients that are good for your skin</li>
            <li>Let me start with stating that I have a very light complexion.</li>
            <li>It makes my face lighter and its very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very light feeling, not greasy.</li>
            <li>The seller was amazing and sent my item very quickly as well as included sample beauty items&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>:) It&#x27;s for very light skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Because my complexion is medium/light, the lip/cheek color is just right for me and a pleasant bonus.</li>
            <li>i first used this, it felt very light,cooling,is very easy to blend in and matched my skin tone perfectly!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>It does have more of a dewy finish (which I prefer), but I suppose you could dust some powder over it if you prefer a matte finish.  </li>
            <li>its a great product, its very smoothy.</li>
            <li>The lip/cheek tint on top is a cute bonus.</li>
            <li>Love the texture and the smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this</li>
            <li>It smells nice, I LOVE the cheek tint in the top cap(again for light skin),</li>
            <li>This is my favorite BB cream.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.   </li>
            <li>Anyways,   I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>One of two favorite BB Creams.</li>
            <li>I love this product for that reason.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>The lip and cheek tint is cute too for an innocent look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love my BB Cream</li>
            <li>I really love just the Lip &amp; Cheek Tint.</li>
            <li>Coverage is something most women in their 60s are looking for.  </li>
            <li>I used the gold bb cream and fell in love but the color didnt match for me.</li>
            <li>and oh so lovely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this, it feels like nothing on your skin</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>the red lip tint was perfect for lip or cheek.</li>
            <li>Coverage was ok, it lessened the appearance of my freckles.</li>
            <li>I love the lip and cheek</li>
            <li>Maybe it would match better on her.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>But OK for cheeks.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love the blush which is come with it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll look for something better.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE MANY SKIN TAGS ON M NECK</li>
            <li>This BB cream has a nice texture but it&#x27;s too light for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Ok on the lips, but I didn&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
            <li>I love the tint and used it on cheeks as well as lips.</li>
            <li>I love how it goes on my skin and love the glow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure if you&#x27;re complexion is on the lighter side it may work a lot better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love the cheek tint that come with it.</li>
            <li>I will not buy any more skin79 products.</li>
            <li>(light medium with warm undertone).</li>
            <li>and i love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.</li>
            <li>I love the way the product is dispensed it keeps things sanitary</li>
            <li>Cheek tint has a lovely hue to it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to order more things from this seller.</li>
            <li>No wonder is this cheap!</li>
            <li>And had I known about the parabens (my fault for not researching more before buying)</li>
            <li>And had I known about the parabens (my fault for not researching more before buying)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>No noticable difference to my skin, however but that&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li>, sun damaged (in places), yet mostly wrinkle-free, skin.</li>
            <li>and i couldnt be more pleased (i did some research on makeupalley.com to see</li>
            <li>and i couldnt be more pleased (i did some research on makeupalley.com to see where to start).</li>
            <li>The tint cream looks cute on the lips.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>I had been using an inexpensive drugstore bb cream, but wanted to try one with more coverage.</li>
            <li>I have tried many BB creams that I like (Dr. Jart, Missha, etc.)</li>
            <li>Too many fakes out there.</li>
            <li>It needs more tone choices.</li>
            <li>It tends to sit on top of the skin and looks cakey.  </li>
            <li>I like the top cheek color.</li>
            <li>and it finally achieves the legendary &amp;#34;dewiness&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I like the Garnier BB cream way better.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s lighter and I think it does have more lightener in it.  </li>
            <li>Love the cheek tint, but bb cream is just ok.  </li>
            <li>I love the lip/cheek tint.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I finally found my perfect BB cream.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I splurged and purchased this.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I like it, but some people like more</li>
            <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t seem to lighten my skin any, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>But when it arrived i was 100% sure it was authentic.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BB cream is okay.  </li>
            <li>It has amazing coverage, easy to apply and feels light on.</li>
            <li>and it looked so beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li>even the lip and cheek tint is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It went on beautifully and my skin stayed moisturized and never tight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: July 8 2012----------&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what&#x27;s in this bb cream but every time I use this and take it off I see an improved, more even, more beautiful skin staring back at me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It is a very good foundation for Asian type of skin.</li>
            <li>It looked extremely natural on so for summer its a great way to go.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t completely make my pimples go away like I wanted, but it did help and that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Application of the product was easy.  </li>
            <li>The container makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy dispenser.</li>
            <li>My first full BB cream (I got a sample pack and liked this one the most)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it as I can wear it all day without it becoming greasy or causing my face to feel tight at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The airless pump is definitely great, and a plus that I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping my makeup clean during my busy mornings.</li>
            <li>I like that it goes on sort of like Elmer&#x27;s Glue since I live in LA and want good sun protection.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for me since I don&#x27;t need an huge amount of coverage but don&#x27;t want to look totally bare faced.</li>
            <li>the bb cream and the cheek tint really smell good, sweet smell</li>
            <li>Smooth finish, easy application</li>
            <li>Fine lines seemed to disappear.</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin more youthful looking!</li>
            <li>Absolutely, hands-down my favorite BB cream!  </li>
            <li>I just got this product in the mail today, and I already love it after the first use!  </li>
            <li>The coverage is pretty comparable to a light/medium liquid foundation, and good for evening out skin tone and making a clean, fresh canvas for my eyes, cheeks and lips.</li>
            <li>This product gives good light to medium natural coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it is between light and medium coverage.</li>
            <li>, it looks cheap there.</li>
            <li>It can be used as a light concealer.     </li>
            <li>The nice thing is that the make up lasts a whole day.</li>
            <li>maybe a shade darker and/or apply this BB Cream and add a light layer of powder or compact foundation that is the shade closest to your skin.</li>
            <li>It is a light coverage</li>
            <li>the color was on point after some drying and went on smooth and covered well.</li>
            <li>it is so light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>But if u are going to a wedding or party, coverage is kinda light.</li>
            <li>I am nc25 to 30 Korean light to med skin tone.  </li>
            <li>for med to light skin.</li>
            <li>Wonderful...my face looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>When I put it on my face, it glided smoothly and covered my blemishes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not as moisture as the Gold one-which is kinda creamy.</li>
            <li>However, this one has a light smell</li>
            <li>I like it because it is light, goes on smoothly and covers the face evenly.  </li>
            <li>As for the BB Cream itself, it is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>This bb cream comes in just one shade, it might be too light for some</li>
            <li>It takes a while for the BB cream to adjust to your skin tone, but after it does it leaves your face smooth and the tones even.  </li>
            <li>(I have a light case of rosacea supposedly, although I look nothing like the photos on line.  </li>
            <li>Some light redness on my cheeks, and light</li>
            <li>I also like that it feels like it sits on top of my skin as I don&#x27;t want it going into my pores, and I am leery of the chemicals (which I know can still be absorbed</li>
            <li>Of course if you have darker skin than light to medium olive, then this cream is probably not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hides redness and makes skin look baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>light for my skin tone (I am a light to medium beige tone)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thinner texture than I anticipated, almost runny, but once you pat it into your skin it leaves a light,</li>
            <li>This too, is fairly light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dewy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Looks airbrushed but natural, corrects skin tone and has good coverage when you do break out.</li>
            <li>it goes good coverage and at the same time still feels light!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my skin soft, plus, the product smells good.</li>
            <li>Pretty happy with the product, it came really quickly, and I am using it often, not too much the blush but the rest.</li>
            <li>its creamy and smooth and the dispensing/packaging is kinda cool &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply on the cheeks and doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks, and would be great for dry skin, since it&#x27;s moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Love the retailer, Seoulglamour &amp; highly recommend them :)</li>
            <li>New favorite product &#x3D;]</li>

            <li>nicely.doesnt feel heavy.you&#x27;ll need concealer on top if you have darker blemishes.perfect as a first time bb cream, or want something for all skin types.doesnt</li>
            <li>It is rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The rosy pink color is beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is true for me too, and it feels smooth.</li>
            <li>(which is rare for me!)</li>
            <li>I love this bb cream is very moisturizing, light coverage.</li>
            <li>Best BB cream for older, dry, lighter skin tones.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product that is worth money.</li>
            <li>It was brighter than expected, but my friend loved it and bought more after.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and it feels really light, like I&#x27;m not wearing any make-up.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping my makeup brushes clean in the mornings either, since I just apply with my fingers.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the fragrance, but it does seem to mostly dissipate pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the fragrance, but it does seem to mostly dissipate pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it just didn&#x27;t do anything too special with my skin.</li>
            <li>I just take special care to wash my face twice with a lot of lather</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I do want to explore more BB creams, this is a close second to my favorite SKIN79 Super BB, and the cheek/lip tint is a plus!</li>
            <li>The pink cheek and lip tint is great on my cheeks, but not as a lip tint.</li>
            <li>, if youre struggling to find a light feeling, long wearing, good coverage makeup, you might wanna try a bb cream...</li>

            <li>Although it goes on sort of thick, the coverage is flawless and even and It doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m wearing any makeup!</li>
            <li>It covered up redness, minimized pores, but of course u could still see them, as this isnt full coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light colored, perfect for my complexion, i usually use an ivory-light.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i really like the cheek tint, the color is really cute</li>
            <li>As far as the cream itself, the color is kind of pasty but it blends well.</li>
            <li>If you want full coverage, then I recommend foundation.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely for people with fair skin.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again through, at least until my skin becomes flawless.</li>
            <li>Since I have this one, I have decided to use it for a couple of weeks to see if my skin tone improves, and then hopefully I will just wear it when I want coverage / luminosity, and hopefully my skin will look good enough with just a moisturizer and some blush and lip color.  </li>

            <li>it makes the texture of my skin look so smooth and yet fresh and not cakey at all.</li>
            <li>My skin took on a nice glow and became instantly soft.</li>
            <li>plus is not bad though).</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I am not lucky to have naturally beautiful skin</li>
            <li>This container comes with a very nice pink lip/cheek tint on the lid which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>for the BB cream--it&#x27;s a little more watery than the Missha BB cream I&#x27;ve been using, but it still has good coverage.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it look natural, it is also very good for the skin, and has SPF 25</li>
            <li>As someone who has tried several Skin79 samples before, I decided to venture out and get this one because I saw the cute mirror/tint :)</li>
            <li>I uesed to ues skin79 super plus BB cream</li>
            <li>I love the tiny mirror inside :)</li>
            <li>Very moisturized and smooth to put on, feels light</li>
            <li>If you have more to conceal, this on top of concealer will definitely feel lightweight.</li>
            <li>my pores seem smaller, i have fewer breakouts, and i feel more confident in my face.</li>
            <li>my pores seem smaller, i have fewer breakouts, and i feel more confident in my face.</li>
            <li>but right now it&#x27;s oily, thanks to the summer weather) and seems to even out my skin tone more.  </li>
            <li>I like the package and the scent, but the cream itself is a bit \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; compared to what I&#x27;d normally use, although If I wear powder on top of the cream it is not as noticeable.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on I thought it was going to be to light of a color.</li>
            <li>This product is great for dark complexion or tan.</li>
            <li>Just tried it for the first time, very light weight, not greasy, and very even.</li>
            <li>i cant say for sure if it is changing the texture of my skin, but i feel my new skin care regimen seems to be working for me</li>
            <li>Good for dry skin types.</li>
            <li>It actually covers them up pretty well, though it&#x27;s not as good as a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very natural, comparable to putting on tinted moisturizer but with slightly better coverage.</li>
            <li>This is the first BB cream I tried and noticed significant improvement in my skin after using it.  </li>
            <li>Not full coverage but great for days</li>
            <li>and Fast Shipping!!..</li>
            <li>I love wearing this when leaving the house - makes me feel more comfortable covering any dark circles or flaws.</li>
            <li>(I have very fair skin, usually \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; in most concealer brands), and it gave me a fresh, natural glow.</li>
            <li>the tint is a neutral beige-y tint, its pretty light, works just fine for my skin tone (i dont look like casper) and holy cow does it feel lovely!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive,combination porcelain skin with golden undertones</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>feels fresh on skin, not too thick/thin texture.cute lip/</li>
            <li>Also, good for tan skin since tends to be darker than the pink skin 79.</li>
            <li>So far I love this product</li>
            <li>fresh spring glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ive tried so many cleansers/moisturizers for problem skin, including the skin care products by olay for adult acne....</li>
            <li>I will order again, and cant wait to try the snail BB cream for more mature skin.</li>
            <li>It is a fun bonus for me.</li>
            <li>It offers more coverage than the VIP Gold.</li>
            <li>and it really makes me look fresh and clean in the morning.</li>
            <li>it blended right in.</li>
            <li>This product will tighten your skin right after you apply it onto your skin</li>
            <li>And there is not a lot of this tint, when you look at the picture consider the fact that this golden top goes on top of this black part of BB cream container.</li>
            <li>The cream is lighter than my skin, which is ok with me as my skin color could use toning down, and I also think that lighter is better than pinker or golder.  </li>
            <li>I just opened this up and added the whole litte tube to my full size Oriental Gold.  </li>
            <li>For those of you who don&#x27;t know, these creams mostly come in only one shade, and nearly all of them are too light!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light natural pink for someone fair.</li>
            <li>oh and the shade is a bit of a warm tone like Nw other than a cool tone NC.</li>
            <li>It goes on like a clear pastel sort of pink, looks great on both my cheeks and lips</li>
            <li>regards to the cheek/lip tint, I love the light pink color.  </li>
            <li>They shipped it super fast also ^^</li>
            <li>The pink gloss is cute for a light lip color.</li>
            <li>I am very pale and blue-eyed and this works great with my skin tone, which I was concerned it might not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using both the Hot Pink and Gold Skin 79 BB creams and the main problem I have with both of them is that although the coverage is excellent, it tends to make my face look too white.  </li>
            <li>and i like it very much.</li>
            <li>have very light Asian skin.  </li>
            <li>but if you press it slowly you can get a good control of how much product you extract from the bottle, the tint was  in a nice natural color.</li>
            <li>Might need to see if it comes any darker for using during summer as I am fair skinned but get a little color during summer months.</li>
            <li>You hardly know you have anything on your face, but it provides great coverage with a dew like appearance.  </li>
            <li>(The gold one is more grey than this and slightly heavier, great for better coverage and dry</li>
            <li>I recently purchased 4 BB creams, this seems to be the most sheer coverage, and most moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>This was my first BB Cream</li>
            <li>The product is still just make-up, just a lighter, fresher make-up than what you can find in most American stores for the price.</li>
            <li>My first time buying BB product.</li>
            <li>This bb cream was perfect for on the go coverage but unfortunately made me break out.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so convenient and the color is so pretty..</li>
            <li>The blush that&#x27;s included isn&#x27;t really my shade, but the BB Cream itself is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying BB cream</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>i just opened and tried the BB cream for the first time</li>
            <li>This is my first BB cream i have ever bought</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the American produced BB creams and I wasn&#x27;t as satisfied with them as I am with Korean ones.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t order online often, but I liked that this item came faster than expected...</li>
            <li>This is the first BB Cream that I have tried so</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t love about this BB cream is that it has that makeup smell.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t find any tinting qualities to the cheep/lip color, it&#x27;s certainly a pretty color and gives me that</li>
            <li>I mostly like this bb cream, which is the first and only that I have used.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the first one I&#x27;ve used but most probably will be the last!</li>
            <li>this is my first time trying one</li>
            <li>this is my first time trying one</li>
            <li>final thought, if you have oily skin, I would recommend using a translucent powder on top.</li>
            <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it isn&#x27;t completely amazingly better than anything else.</li>
            <li>had super high hopes for SKIN79 Oriental Gold BB Cream.</li>
            <li>So I ordered this product after seeing it linking in a beauty blog called stuff I put on myself as a good option for those of us that are really pale.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see anything special about it more than the other brands out there.  </li>
            <li>I have used other BB creams but this is my favorite, it matches my Asian skintone well and the cheek tint is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is sweeter and the cream is not dry and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The lip tint was actually really nice too, and didn&#x27;t dry out my lips like many other lip products do.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty clear (and fair) face to begin with, although, I do turn red easily, and Skin79 Oriental Gold BB cream whitens and completely erases my red spots.</li>
            <li>I have tried wide variety of bb creams from skin 79 pink, holika holika, étude house, missha, lioele and by far this is one of the best bb creams out of the bunch.  </li>
            <li>The color is a bit grey (like what you see in most BB creams)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, I look more professional, and I get some free pink stuff in case</li>
            <li>The formula dries down nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my face sticky.</li>
            <li>I think it would work best for dry to normal skin as it might be too heavy for oily skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The Lip and cheek tint are useless for me, but the BB cream is amazing!!</li>
            <li>The color is very nice on this one, not quite as pearly white as some other BBs.</li>
            <li>the tint is easy to apply, just a finger tip is enough and for me it probably can replace my blush.  </li>
            <li>so I have some wrinkles, large pores, etc.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it really will good for my skin long term but only time will tell with that.</li>
            <li>out(and made my pimples worse) and made my skin super oily and didn&#x27;t do a good job of covering acne and scars.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I would say that that is the only reason I prefer the SKIN79 Super BB cream in the golden pump container.</li>
            <li>I have been a bare escentuals girl for a while now, but as I get older the powder sort of settles into my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers on here, this was my first time trying out BB cream</li>
            <li>I have a tough time finding the right foundation, I think this is good for those of us who have strong yellow under tones.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, so I feel good to apply it daily.</li>
            <li>I found it to be a literally &#x27;white&#x27; makup and bright pink blush.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t liked how heavy it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>This bb cream keeps me looking very youthful and my skin loves it.  </li>
            <li>He said it felt very moisturizing and the sun protection is a bonus.</li>
            <li>and It lasts the whole day.     </li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>another 3 weeks haha.</li>
            <li>, I never realised how much of a difference my Skin79 Oriental Gold made.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any \\&quot;gray-ish\\&quot; color.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for light to medium Asian skin tone.</li>
            <li>It  matched my skin tone really well</li>
            <li>I have seen reviews for BB creams that hyped them up a bit too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the texture of the lip/cheek tint</li>
            <li>I really like it however it does clog my pores which leads to breakouts.</li>
            <li>, it is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It came really fast, about a week after I ordered it instead of a month like it said.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a matte finish...more moisturizing than matte, so if you have oily skin, it won&#x27;t look very flattering.  </li>
            <li>Def the real deal.</li>
            <li>So people with darker skin shades may end up with too much of a contrast between the color of their face and neck.</li>
            <li>The cheek stain is a very wearable color, as well.</li>
            <li>and I only wear this around my flaws a but to had a some light</li>
            <li>Aside from this product, I really appreciate the fast shipping from Seoul Glamour and will continue to buy from them.</li>
            <li>I like this duo so much</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide much color at all for the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didnt cover so well and seemed to take forever to apply (so much swirl-tap-swirling).</li>
            <li>they didnt really work...</li>
            <li>so too much makes me look washed out or gray.</li>
            <li>cream is simply a moisturizing foundation that provides light coverage with added sunscreen and botanicals.  </li>
            <li>Very hydrating and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>No problems with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;You should really try this out if it sounds like you might like it.</li>
            <li>I am usually pretty lazy with my make-up, but I know I need some kind of cover to even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m what you would consider a more mature woman so finding products that can do multiple things</li>
            <li>So easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fairly light-skinned Korean girl in my early 20s, with skin a little more on the dry side around my cheeks and jaw, but a little more oily in my T-zone.</li>
            <li>The blush was just right for a young girl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li>All of the BB skin 79 products are amazing, it covered age spots, brightened complexion and my face felt smooth, the dry tight feeling was gone.</li>
            <li>most other bb creams/tints tend to darken my complexion...</li>
            <li>i also love the pink cream blush with it!</li>
            <li>I love the glow it gives my skin, and it lasts all day, unlike other products that give a sheen to your skin, but require re-application to get it again.  </li>
            <li>i never felt like i could get away with a tinted moisturizer, as when i have active break-outs (which honestly, is most of the time)</li>
            <li>It has been a better match for my tan Asian skin tone; however, the coverage isn&#x27;t as good as the Pink and the smell is a little stinkier.  </li>
            <li>But you can easily correct this with a dash of loose powder.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, not too dramatic.  </li>
            <li>and I will say that I&#x27;m pleased with the coverage - not too much, not too little.</li>
            <li>I also love the little lip &amp; cheek tint on the lid, it makes me look very refreshed.</li>
            <li>and seriously can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li>The product is brand new, but expiring soon!</li>
            <li>the last couple of weeks, ive been using a new cleanser (loreal go 360 clean acne wash) and this bb cream.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it replaces two products and your skin ends up looking even better than it did with its more expensive predecessors.</li>
            <li>squirts out of a teeny circle in the middle, inevitably getting all over the top and your finger/hand.</li>
            <li>It gives a decent coverage.</li>
            <li>Does its job of covering up decently.</li>
            <li>Packaging is nice, comes with pink blusher which I use occasionally.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the VIP gold, Garnier and Youth code BBs, as well as, high end $45 foundations.</li>
            <li>and I love how it&#x27;s in the cap with a little mirror</li>
            <li>The lip and cheek tint when I use it comes up on my lips as a really light creamy lilac and baby pink tint.</li>
            <li>It gives my face a natural glow, yet it covers my under eye circles and my pores very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, it evens out small plemishes and leaves the skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>They all feel lovely on the skin, but the two I just mentioned offer ample coverage with out a heavy made up feel.</li>
            <li>It does smell lovely and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feel once on the face.</li>
            <li>Also the pump usually releases more product than you&#x27;d ever want for your whole face.</li>
            <li>and I feel as if I have to clean it every single time I use it.</li>
            <li>Ok, I have tried almost this entire make up line, this one and the black one are my absolute favorites!</li>
            <li>Since my skin was on the dry side, the bb cream emphasized the patches even more, even after putting lotion prior to application.</li>
            <li>Definitely it clogs my pore, right now I have bumps on my face.</li>
            <li>It matches very well to my pale skin (but I tan easily).</li>
            <li>The BB cream itself was perfect for me, alot of people wassaying that it ws too thin to cover anything, but really, it&#x27;s pretty thick like normal foundation.</li>
            <li>I wear it everyday and then dust my face with bare minerals foundation to dull the shine Very happy with this product</li>
            <li>Compared to my Missha BB cream, I actually like Missha more because it&#x27;s more matte (I usually have dry skin,</li>
            <li>soon I&#x27;m going to order a new bottle and wait</li>
            <li>Once I finished that one I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>Super moist and the right shade for my pale complexion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably get another bottle of this when I run out, but I feel like it&#x27;s going to last quite a while since you don&#x27;t really need much product.</li>
            <li>But this one makes u looks very natural.</li>
            <li>As I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If however, you want to look normal and alive, this is not the product to use.</li>
            <li>But other than that I would definitely recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li>First let me state that I am not of Asian descent.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product shortly after the first of the month and was quite nervous about wether or not it would match my skintone or not.</li>
            <li>It is light in color, very moisturizing, and I use it under my foundation because it doesn&#x27;t provide complete coverage for my uneven skin tone and age spots.  </li>
            <li>This one the oriental gold is actually lighter coverage so the color is more natural compared to the Pink one.  </li>
            <li>On the lips, it actually made my lips look matte, which I don&#x27;t actually mind at all because it looked nice and pink.  </li>
            <li>I typically use Fairly Light tones for foundation and this product worked well for me with regards to color matching.  </li>
            <li>I feel like its cleaner coverage than traditional foundation (much less matte looking) and more subdued than luminous makeup.</li>
            <li>the consistency is ok, it has the creaminess of the typical asian bb creams, thicker than the bb creams here in the u.s.</li>
            <li>well, I used the Pink BB cream previously and I liked it.  </li>
            <li>The color of this cream is a little too light for me at the moment since it&#x27;s summer.</li>
            <li>The  shade is a little light.</li>
            <li>The color is a little on the light side but still workable.  </li>
            <li>But I soon found that the product comes out of a tiny hole in the top that has a little rubber stopper in it.</li>
            <li>Plus, if your skin is clear of breakouts...it can stand alone.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t look natural nor pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It looks so natural that I prefer it over Nars and Benefit blushes.</li>
            <li>My son (he&#x27;s 2) completely ruin my cheek/lip tint, which DEVASTATED MEEEE</li>
            <li>Some of my acne scars are fading and have disappeared completely.</li>
            <li>My mom keeps asking me why my skin is clearing up, because it looks so natural</li>
            <li>It also works well for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you want a light, everyday BB cream for sensitive/dry-normal skin, this product will work well for you.</li>
            <li>I know this product is made for Asian skin tones and it does have a bit of a beige tint to it, but not as much as let&#x27;s say Dr.</li>
            <li>and I am in my early 40s</li>
            <li>It gives a natural finish.</li>
            <li>It does not clog my pores or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and this covered it completely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sorta like concealer, but it looks natural.</li>
            <li>It can be put on quickly in a busy morning.  </li>
            <li>I have heard so much about Asian BB creams and wanted to give them a try.</li>
            <li>and I can really use something that makes me look younger.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy but sheer, so the color is buildable.  </li>
            <li>More coverage than a tinted moisturizer, but not as heavy as regular old foundation.</li>
            <li>WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH</li>
            <li>It makes me look naturally blush not like a clown.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much to apply it to your entire face.  </li>
            <li>Any cons: I&#x27;m in my early 40s</li>
            <li>also have acne scars, when i put this product on my face they are completely covered and this helps with acne as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t condone makeup for young girls</li>
            <li>but this is so natural it helps even out her skin tone without anyone knowing she&#x27;s wearing anything.  </li>
            <li>my seventeen year old daughter.</li>
            <li>So far I would say that it seems to be working, and it does not break me out</li>
            <li>i have adult acne, sometimes sort of cystic acne, under my chin/jawline....</li>
            <li>ive tried the natural ones too....</li>
            <li>outcan&#x27;t really give an interview because everybody is different</li>
            <li>cooling, dewy finish that makes you look like a brighter toned, somewhat airbrushed version of your natural self.</li>
            <li>Natural looking.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried this cream without a moisturizer to see if it would dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not wild about the lip/eye balm color (it is fine for my eyes but way too pink for my lips)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews that said their face looks like it&#x27;s freshly washed even at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>If you do your whole face, then it&#x27;s not obvious that it is not your natural color, although it does take me a couple of minutes to get used to it every morning as it is lighter and a different tone than my natural color.</li>
            <li>PERFECT QUALITY REAL PRODUCT - if you want to know how to tell fake from real, just google \\&quot;fake skin79 bb cream\\&quot;</li>
            <li>it lasts long and really make my face cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li>I saw reviews that said this was a problem, but I have light skin (I usually use the lightest or next-lightest makeup offered by a cosmetic line)</li>
            <li>The lip tint is a pretty pink that moisturizes your lips and seems to make them look plumper.</li>
            <li>This BB cream gives me a fresh and youthful appearance and cuts down the blotchiness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I had to go out and buy new makeup until I can go get my skin79 back</li>
            <li>, theyre pretty vivid (i mess with them).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pale (a freckled ginger) and my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see that the cheek tint/lip tint is actually on the cap!</li>
            <li>I really like the blush part of this product but the make feels chalky and rough.  </li>
            <li>I read some reviews about poor packaging but this seemed to come in ok?</li>
            <li>Thin and light to the skin!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This one has more of a yellow undertone, as opposed to the grey and pink in some of the other Skin 79 BB creams.  </li>
            <li>I guess it just wasn&#x27;t right for me, makes my face dried</li>
            <li>The cheek stain that comes with it would be pretty subtle on anyone much darker skinned than me, FYI.</li>
            <li>This BB Cream is a little bit thinner then most and maybe easier to apply for those having trouble with thicker creams.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin that used to sometimes flake before I started nourishing it regularly with high moisture lotion.  </li>
            <li>The pump design is a little bit weired because the product comes out from the top center, but I find it easier to use than the Pink one.  </li>
            <li>ive tried several of the mineral make up brands including bare minerals....</li>
            <li>I did notice this BB in particular in comparison with other Skin79 BB creams leaves the skin a bit shinier, so for people with oily skin beware.  </li>
            <li>I worked well on my dry and sensitive skin tone.</li>
            <li>The pink looks very natural as well.</li>
            <li>it is a very soft pink</li>
            <li>The pump is a little unusual</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very nice brightening effect.</li>
            <li> Shipment was prompt, beautifully packaged, and they placed some samples, which was a good</li>
            <li> As for the product itself, AMAZING!</li>

            <li> Would be great for good skin.</li>
            <li> So nice!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced it first-hand, so I followed the good advice.</li>
            <li> but it does a lovely job of gicing me that glow  &lt;3 btw</li>
            <li> i was satisfied, the price was great!..</li>
            <li> favorite is still the Missha M Perfect BB Cream #23.  </li>
            <li> /cheek tint was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> tint was very good for my cheeks; it gave me a cute glow.</li>
            <li> This Is an amazing cream, moisturizing and great cover.</li>
            <li> This bb cream glides on smoothly and makes my face look flawless.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try a bb cream, so I researched and figured this may be a good one.</li>
            <li> It also smells good, like the tea.     </li>
            <li> It smells nice, but it didn&#x27;t look to great on me.</li>
            <li> But for the size of the bottle, the price was good.</li>
            <li> Loved the appearance and shine of the container and everything.</li>
            <li> LOVED this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not so good.</li>
            <li> I have another product that says BB, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> But this is still a good BB cream.  </li>
            <li> Even though she is darker than I am (I&#x27;m fair</li>
            <li> The cheek tint is a good color too.</li>
            <li> I am guessing it&#x27;s because my skin isn&#x27;t too fair.</li>
            <li> I have a tube of Nars Orgasm and it looks vastly superior to this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am bit fair</li>
            <li> Also because this product is made in Korea, where fair skin is cherished.  </li>
            <li> Also, the cheek tint is gorgeous-</li>
            <li> the bb cream covers surprisingly well,</li>
            <li> Read the product description on the official website to get the details and decided this would be good for me.  </li>
            <li> I tried different bb cream before, this is not the best one if u look for perfect coverage.</li>
            <li> Faster-than-expected and authentic products with a great selection at fair U.S. prices.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, high quality and lip gloss/check stain is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> This bb cream has more coverage  and a great smell.</li>
            <li> It has great coverage but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> the top part lip&amp; cheek tint is also great.</li>
            <li> I am still very satisfied by this product and deal with the trade-off in coverage by going over the BB Cream with powdered foundation using a brush.  </li>
            <li> This cream does a great job of working in place of an every day moisturizer and creates a more even foundation.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy, its really moisturizing goes on smoothly and blends in with my skin color perfectly</li>
            <li> I was concerned it would not match my skin tone because I am of Caucasian lineage, and I&#x27;d read reviews about the cream being a more greyish tone, but the product matches with my skin very nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream!</li>
            <li> That being said, this BB cream matches my skin almost perfectly and covers pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bb cream!</li>
            <li> I tried it on too, and I love it!</li>
            <li> i do love that!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> and yet i look pretty darn close to flawless.</li>
            <li> but here is the one I love!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the cheek and lip tint as well--a nice bonus and handy too!</li>
            <li> Anyways, This BB cream is so amazing, I just don&#x27;t feel like myself without it</li>
            <li> The coverage is amazing, so amazing that as the weeks pass by, I&#x27;ve been lessening the amount I put on my face, and it still makes me glow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even put on any powder afterwards and people tell me my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> But amazingly, I use up every bit of this one.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely scent but in my opinion its best for fair skin people who don&#x27;t have too much scrs on the face.</li>
            <li> This is light coverage, but does a great job of evening out the skin.  </li>
            <li> Great for light coverage.  </li>
            <li> Im also happy that you cant see my pores with it on, because that is usually a huge issue for me.</li>
            <li> But, once you blend it in, it is so nice.</li>
            <li> I wasnt too thrilled about it.</li>
            <li> It is a nice way to combine lotion, sunscreen protection and a tint all in one product.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the idea of the tint which is why I ended up choosing this one.</li>
            <li> The color is really nice</li>
            <li> Glides on so nice and the finish is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> This is a good BB cream, and I love the cheek/lip tint that comes with it--but it&#x27;s not for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gives the face a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product.  </li>
            <li> I compete in pageants and I have to use more makeup when  I&#x27;m on stage, so having something that also is good for my skin</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> cheek color is a nice tint</li>
            <li> im gonna be honest:</li>
            <li> ive made my own (bc im</li>
            <li> they have skin loving ingredients and a nice finish to boot.</li>
            <li> they have skin loving ingredients and a nice finish to boot.</li>
            <li> but it looks nice</li>
            <li> Covers up nicely</li>
            <li> And the cheek stain is really nice and creamy.</li>
            <li> Package was triple sealed, in pristine condition, and arrived as promised, nice...</li>
            <li> I like the BB cream, this one is nice</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> The blush adds a nice touch and it&#x27;s not drying like powder blushes.</li>
            <li> First let me say the vendor was very good.  </li>
            <li> I tried the VIP Gold BB Cream which I liked, but didn&#x27;t love (still kind of drying/cakey).  </li>
            <li> Light coverage for a fresh and flawless look.</li>
            <li> This BB cream goes on easily and gives good coverage.  </li>
            <li> Seoulglamour&#x27;s customer service was great about my questions and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and the price is great too.  </li>
            <li> It matches my skin tone perfectly, looks very natural, like it&#x27;s not even there.  </li>
            <li> I do feel it does nicely evens out my skin and looks very smooth and polished.</li>
            <li> cream can provide very good coverage without looking like a mask, or it can be lighter coverage, depending how much you use.  </li>
            <li> If this gets popular in the US, they will need to make more shades.</li>
            <li> Then it makes your skin look natural and flawless!!</li>
            <li> while it&#x27;s nice, I still like Skin79 better because of the whitening; so there&#x27;s a comparison for you.</li>
            <li> the texture is great and the lip and check stain is wonderful, however I think this product wont suit oily skin or dark skin tone</li>
            <li> Love how nice this goes on my face and how it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li> and when it does, it comes with a free sample or two thrown in for good measure.</li>
            <li> and when it does, it comes with a free sample or two thrown in for good measure.</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> My skin is fair and dry in the winter, so it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Very quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> This blends in seamlessly with my skin, feels very light and creates a perfect even canvas.  </li>
            <li> Very good for normal type skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how great my skin looked and felt the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be full of ingredients that are good for your skin</li>
            <li> Let me start with stating that I have a very light complexion.</li>
            <li> It makes my face lighter and its very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very light feeling, not greasy.</li>
            <li> The seller was amazing and sent my item very quickly as well as included sample beauty items&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> :) It&#x27;s for very light skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Because my complexion is medium/light, the lip/cheek color is just right for me and a pleasant bonus.</li>
            <li> i first used this, it felt very light,cooling,is very easy to blend in and matched my skin tone perfectly!</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> It does have more of a dewy finish (which I prefer), but I suppose you could dust some powder over it if you prefer a matte finish.  </li>
            <li> its a great product, its very smoothy.</li>
            <li> The lip/cheek tint on top is a cute bonus.</li>
            <li> Love the texture and the smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this</li>
            <li> It smells nice, I LOVE the cheek tint in the top cap(again for light skin),</li>
            <li> This is my favorite BB cream.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.   </li>
            <li> Anyways,   I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> One of two favorite BB Creams.</li>
            <li> I love this product for that reason.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li> The lip and cheek tint is cute too for an innocent look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love my BB Cream</li>
            <li> I really love just the Lip &amp; Cheek Tint.</li>
            <li> Coverage is something most women in their 60s are looking for.  </li>
            <li> I used the gold bb cream and fell in love but the color didnt match for me.</li>
            <li> and oh so lovely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this, it feels like nothing on your skin</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> the red lip tint was perfect for lip or cheek.</li>
            <li> Coverage was ok, it lessened the appearance of my freckles.</li>
            <li> I love the lip and cheek</li>
            <li> Maybe it would match better on her.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> But OK for cheeks.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I love the blush which is come with it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll look for something better.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE MANY SKIN TAGS ON M NECK</li>
            <li> This BB cream has a nice texture but it&#x27;s too light for my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok on the lips, but I didn&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
            <li> I love the tint and used it on cheeks as well as lips.</li>
            <li> I love how it goes on my skin and love the glow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure if you&#x27;re complexion is on the lighter side it may work a lot better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love the cheek tint that come with it.</li>
            <li> I will not buy any more skin79 products.</li>
            <li> (light medium with warm undertone).</li>
            <li> and i love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> so wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.</li>
            <li> I love the way the product is dispensed it keeps things sanitary</li>
            <li> Cheek tint has a lovely hue to it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to order more things from this seller.</li>
            <li> No wonder is this cheap!</li>
            <li> And had I known about the parabens (my fault for not researching more before buying)</li>
            <li> And had I known about the parabens (my fault for not researching more before buying)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> No noticable difference to my skin, however but that&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li> , sun damaged (in places), yet mostly wrinkle-free, skin.</li>
            <li> and i couldnt be more pleased (i did some research on makeupalley.com to see</li>
            <li> and i couldnt be more pleased (i did some research on makeupalley.com to see where to start).</li>
            <li> The tint cream looks cute on the lips.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> I had been using an inexpensive drugstore bb cream, but wanted to try one with more coverage.</li>
            <li> I have tried many BB creams that I like (Dr. Jart, Missha, etc.)</li>
            <li> Too many fakes out there.</li>
            <li> It needs more tone choices.</li>
            <li> It tends to sit on top of the skin and looks cakey.  </li>
            <li> I like the top cheek color.</li>
            <li> and it finally achieves the legendary &amp;#34;dewiness&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> I like the Garnier BB cream way better.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s lighter and I think it does have more lightener in it.  </li>
            <li> Love the cheek tint, but bb cream is just ok.  </li>
            <li> I love the lip/cheek tint.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I finally found my perfect BB cream.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I splurged and purchased this.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I like it, but some people like more</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t seem to lighten my skin any, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> But when it arrived i was 100% sure it was authentic.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BB cream is okay.  </li>
            <li> It has amazing coverage, easy to apply and feels light on.</li>
            <li> and it looked so beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li> even the lip and cheek tint is pretty good.</li>
            <li> It went on beautifully and my skin stayed moisturized and never tight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: July 8 2012----------&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what&#x27;s in this bb cream but every time I use this and take it off I see an improved, more even, more beautiful skin staring back at me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It is a very good foundation for Asian type of skin.</li>
            <li> It looked extremely natural on so for summer its a great way to go.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t completely make my pimples go away like I wanted, but it did help and that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Application of the product was easy.  </li>
            <li> The container makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy dispenser.</li>
            <li> My first full BB cream (I got a sample pack and liked this one the most)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it as I can wear it all day without it becoming greasy or causing my face to feel tight at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The airless pump is definitely great, and a plus that I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping my makeup clean during my busy mornings.</li>
            <li> I like that it goes on sort of like Elmer&#x27;s Glue since I live in LA and want good sun protection.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for me since I don&#x27;t need an huge amount of coverage but don&#x27;t want to look totally bare faced.</li>
            <li> the bb cream and the cheek tint really smell good, sweet smell</li>
            <li> Smooth finish, easy application</li>
            <li> Fine lines seemed to disappear.</li>
            <li> It really makes your skin more youthful looking!</li>
            <li> Absolutely, hands-down my favorite BB cream!  </li>
            <li> I just got this product in the mail today, and I already love it after the first use!  </li>
            <li> The coverage is pretty comparable to a light/medium liquid foundation, and good for evening out skin tone and making a clean, fresh canvas for my eyes, cheeks and lips.</li>
            <li> This product gives good light to medium natural coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it is between light and medium coverage.</li>
            <li> , it looks cheap there.</li>
            <li> It can be used as a light concealer.     </li>
            <li> The nice thing is that the make up lasts a whole day.</li>
            <li> maybe a shade darker and/or apply this BB Cream and add a light layer of powder or compact foundation that is the shade closest to your skin.</li>
            <li> It is a light coverage</li>
            <li> the color was on point after some drying and went on smooth and covered well.</li>
            <li> it is so light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> But if u are going to a wedding or party, coverage is kinda light.</li>
            <li> I am nc25 to 30 Korean light to med skin tone.  </li>
            <li> for med to light skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful...my face looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> When I put it on my face, it glided smoothly and covered my blemishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not as moisture as the Gold one-which is kinda creamy.</li>
            <li> However, this one has a light smell</li>
            <li> I like it because it is light, goes on smoothly and covers the face evenly.  </li>
            <li> As for the BB Cream itself, it is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> This bb cream comes in just one shade, it might be too light for some</li>
            <li> It takes a while for the BB cream to adjust to your skin tone, but after it does it leaves your face smooth and the tones even.  </li>
            <li> (I have a light case of rosacea supposedly, although I look nothing like the photos on line.  </li>
            <li> Some light redness on my cheeks, and light</li>
            <li> I also like that it feels like it sits on top of my skin as I don&#x27;t want it going into my pores, and I am leery of the chemicals (which I know can still be absorbed</li>
            <li> Of course if you have darker skin than light to medium olive, then this cream is probably not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hides redness and makes skin look baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> light for my skin tone (I am a light to medium beige tone)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thinner texture than I anticipated, almost runny, but once you pat it into your skin it leaves a light,</li>
            <li> This too, is fairly light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dewy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Looks airbrushed but natural, corrects skin tone and has good coverage when you do break out.</li>
            <li> it goes good coverage and at the same time still feels light!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my skin soft, plus, the product smells good.</li>
            <li> Pretty happy with the product, it came really quickly, and I am using it often, not too much the blush but the rest.</li>
            <li> its creamy and smooth and the dispensing/packaging is kinda cool &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply on the cheeks and doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks, and would be great for dry skin, since it&#x27;s moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Love the retailer, Seoulglamour &amp; highly recommend them :)</li>
            <li> New favorite product &#x3D;]</li>

            <li> It is rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The rosy pink color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> It is true for me too, and it feels smooth.</li>
            <li> (which is rare for me!)</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream is very moisturizing, light coverage.</li>
            <li> Best BB cream for older, dry, lighter skin tones.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product that is worth money.</li>
            <li> It was brighter than expected, but my friend loved it and bought more after.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and it feels really light, like I&#x27;m not wearing any make-up.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping my makeup brushes clean in the mornings either, since I just apply with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the fragrance, but it does seem to mostly dissipate pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the fragrance, but it does seem to mostly dissipate pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> and it just didn&#x27;t do anything too special with my skin.</li>
            <li> I just take special care to wash my face twice with a lot of lather</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I do want to explore more BB creams, this is a close second to my favorite SKIN79 Super BB, and the cheek/lip tint is a plus!</li>
            <li> The pink cheek and lip tint is great on my cheeks, but not as a lip tint.</li>
            <li> , if youre struggling to find a light feeling, long wearing, good coverage makeup, you might wanna try a bb cream...</li>
            <li> , if youre struggling to find a light feeling, long wearing, good coverage makeup, you might wanna try a bb cream...</li>
            <li> Although it goes on sort of thick, the coverage is flawless and even and It doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m wearing any makeup!</li>
            <li> It covered up redness, minimized pores, but of course u could still see them, as this isnt full coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light colored, perfect for my complexion, i usually use an ivory-light.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i really like the cheek tint, the color is really cute</li>
            <li> As far as the cream itself, the color is kind of pasty but it blends well.</li>
            <li> If you want full coverage, then I recommend foundation.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely for people with fair skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again through, at least until my skin becomes flawless.</li>
            <li> Since I have this one, I have decided to use it for a couple of weeks to see if my skin tone improves, and then hopefully I will just wear it when I want coverage / luminosity, and hopefully my skin will look good enough with just a moisturizer and some blush and lip color.  </li>

            <li> it makes the texture of my skin look so smooth and yet fresh and not cakey at all.</li>
            <li> My skin took on a nice glow and became instantly soft.</li>
            <li> plus is not bad though).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am not lucky to have naturally beautiful skin</li>
            <li> This container comes with a very nice pink lip/cheek tint on the lid which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> for the BB cream--it&#x27;s a little more watery than the Missha BB cream I&#x27;ve been using, but it still has good coverage.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it look natural, it is also very good for the skin, and has SPF 25</li>
            <li> As someone who has tried several Skin79 samples before, I decided to venture out and get this one because I saw the cute mirror/tint :)</li>
            <li> I uesed to ues skin79 super plus BB cream</li>
            <li> I love the tiny mirror inside :)</li>
            <li> Very moisturized and smooth to put on, feels light</li>
            <li> If you have more to conceal, this on top of concealer will definitely feel lightweight.</li>
            <li> my pores seem smaller, i have fewer breakouts, and i feel more confident in my face.</li>
            <li> my pores seem smaller, i have fewer breakouts, and i feel more confident in my face.</li>
            <li> but right now it&#x27;s oily, thanks to the summer weather) and seems to even out my skin tone more.  </li>
            <li> I like the package and the scent, but the cream itself is a bit \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; compared to what I&#x27;d normally use, although If I wear powder on top of the cream it is not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on I thought it was going to be to light of a color.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dark complexion or tan.</li>
            <li> Just tried it for the first time, very light weight, not greasy, and very even.</li>
            <li> i cant say for sure if it is changing the texture of my skin, but i feel my new skin care regimen seems to be working for me</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin types.</li>
            <li> It actually covers them up pretty well, though it&#x27;s not as good as a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very natural, comparable to putting on tinted moisturizer but with slightly better coverage.</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I tried and noticed significant improvement in my skin after using it.  </li>
            <li> Not full coverage but great for days</li>
            <li> and Fast Shipping!!..</li>
            <li> I love wearing this when leaving the house - makes me feel more comfortable covering any dark circles or flaws.</li>
            <li> (I have very fair skin, usually \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; in most concealer brands), and it gave me a fresh, natural glow.</li>
            <li> the tint is a neutral beige-y tint, its pretty light, works just fine for my skin tone (i dont look like casper) and holy cow does it feel lovely!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive,combination porcelain skin with golden undertones</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> feels fresh on skin, not too thick/thin texture.cute lip/</li>
            <li> Also, good for tan skin since tends to be darker than the pink skin 79.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product</li>
            <li> fresh spring glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ive tried so many cleansers/moisturizers for problem skin, including the skin care products by olay for adult acne....</li>
            <li> I will order again, and cant wait to try the snail BB cream for more mature skin.</li>
            <li> It is a fun bonus for me.</li>
            <li> It offers more coverage than the VIP Gold.</li>
            <li> and it really makes me look fresh and clean in the morning.</li>
            <li> it blended right in.</li>
            <li> This product will tighten your skin right after you apply it onto your skin</li>
            <li> And there is not a lot of this tint, when you look at the picture consider the fact that this golden top goes on top of this black part of BB cream container.</li>
            <li> The cream is lighter than my skin, which is ok with me as my skin color could use toning down, and I also think that lighter is better than pinker or golder.  </li>
            <li> I just opened this up and added the whole litte tube to my full size Oriental Gold.  </li>
            <li> For those of you who don&#x27;t know, these creams mostly come in only one shade, and nearly all of them are too light!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light natural pink for someone fair.</li>
            <li> oh and the shade is a bit of a warm tone like Nw other than a cool tone NC.</li>
            <li> It goes on like a clear pastel sort of pink, looks great on both my cheeks and lips</li>
            <li> regards to the cheek/lip tint, I love the light pink color.  </li>
            <li> They shipped it super fast also ^^</li>
            <li> The pink gloss is cute for a light lip color.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and blue-eyed and this works great with my skin tone, which I was concerned it might not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both the Hot Pink and Gold Skin 79 BB creams and the main problem I have with both of them is that although the coverage is excellent, it tends to make my face look too white.  </li>
            <li> and i like it very much.</li>
            <li> have very light Asian skin.  </li>
            <li> but if you press it slowly you can get a good control of how much product you extract from the bottle, the tint was  in a nice natural color.</li>
            <li> Might need to see if it comes any darker for using during summer as I am fair skinned but get a little color during summer months.</li>
            <li> You hardly know you have anything on your face, but it provides great coverage with a dew like appearance.  </li>
            <li> (The gold one is more grey than this and slightly heavier, great for better coverage and dry</li>
            <li> I recently purchased 4 BB creams, this seems to be the most sheer coverage, and most moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> This was my first BB Cream</li>
            <li> The product is still just make-up, just a lighter, fresher make-up than what you can find in most American stores for the price.</li>
            <li> My first time buying BB product.</li>
            <li> This bb cream was perfect for on the go coverage but unfortunately made me break out.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so convenient and the color is so pretty..</li>
            <li> The blush that&#x27;s included isn&#x27;t really my shade, but the BB Cream itself is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying BB cream</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> i just opened and tried the BB cream for the first time</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cream i have ever bought</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the American produced BB creams and I wasn&#x27;t as satisfied with them as I am with Korean ones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t order online often, but I liked that this item came faster than expected...</li>
            <li> This is the first BB Cream that I have tried so</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t love about this BB cream is that it has that makeup smell.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t find any tinting qualities to the cheep/lip color, it&#x27;s certainly a pretty color and gives me that</li>
            <li> I mostly like this bb cream, which is the first and only that I have used.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the first one I&#x27;ve used but most probably will be the last!</li>
            <li> this is my first time trying one</li>
            <li> this is my first time trying one</li>
            <li> final thought, if you have oily skin, I would recommend using a translucent powder on top.</li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it isn&#x27;t completely amazingly better than anything else.</li>
            <li> had super high hopes for SKIN79 Oriental Gold BB Cream.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this product after seeing it linking in a beauty blog called stuff I put on myself as a good option for those of us that are really pale.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see anything special about it more than the other brands out there.  </li>
            <li> I have used other BB creams but this is my favorite, it matches my Asian skintone well and the cheek tint is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is sweeter and the cream is not dry and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The lip tint was actually really nice too, and didn&#x27;t dry out my lips like many other lip products do.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty clear (and fair) face to begin with, although, I do turn red easily, and Skin79 Oriental Gold BB cream whitens and completely erases my red spots.</li>
            <li> I have tried wide variety of bb creams from skin 79 pink, holika holika, étude house, missha, lioele and by far this is one of the best bb creams out of the bunch.  </li>
            <li> The color is a bit grey (like what you see in most BB creams)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, I look more professional, and I get some free pink stuff in case</li>
            <li> The formula dries down nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my face sticky.</li>
            <li> I think it would work best for dry to normal skin as it might be too heavy for oily skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Lip and cheek tint are useless for me, but the BB cream is amazing!!</li>
            <li> The color is very nice on this one, not quite as pearly white as some other BBs.</li>
            <li> the tint is easy to apply, just a finger tip is enough and for me it probably can replace my blush.  </li>
            <li> so I have some wrinkles, large pores, etc.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it really will good for my skin long term but only time will tell with that.</li>
            <li> out(and made my pimples worse) and made my skin super oily and didn&#x27;t do a good job of covering acne and scars.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I would say that that is the only reason I prefer the SKIN79 Super BB cream in the golden pump container.</li>
            <li> I have been a bare escentuals girl for a while now, but as I get older the powder sort of settles into my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers on here, this was my first time trying out BB cream</li>
            <li> I have a tough time finding the right foundation, I think this is good for those of us who have strong yellow under tones.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, so I feel good to apply it daily.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a literally &#x27;white&#x27; makup and bright pink blush.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t liked how heavy it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> This bb cream keeps me looking very youthful and my skin loves it.  </li>
            <li> He said it felt very moisturizing and the sun protection is a bonus.</li>
            <li> and It lasts the whole day.     </li>
            <li> and I really like it</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> another 3 weeks haha.</li>
            <li> , I never realised how much of a difference my Skin79 Oriental Gold made.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any \\&quot;gray-ish\\&quot; color.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for light to medium Asian skin tone.</li>
            <li> It  matched my skin tone really well</li>
            <li> I have seen reviews for BB creams that hyped them up a bit too much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the texture of the lip/cheek tint</li>
            <li> I really like it however it does clog my pores which leads to breakouts.</li>
            <li> , it is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It came really fast, about a week after I ordered it instead of a month like it said.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a matte finish...more moisturizing than matte, so if you have oily skin, it won&#x27;t look very flattering.  </li>
            <li> Def the real deal.</li>
            <li> So people with darker skin shades may end up with too much of a contrast between the color of their face and neck.</li>
            <li> The cheek stain is a very wearable color, as well.</li>
            <li> and I only wear this around my flaws a but to had a some light</li>
            <li> Aside from this product, I really appreciate the fast shipping from Seoul Glamour and will continue to buy from them.</li>
            <li> I like this duo so much</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide much color at all for the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> didnt cover so well and seemed to take forever to apply (so much swirl-tap-swirling).</li>
            <li> they didnt really work...</li>
            <li> so too much makes me look washed out or gray.</li>
            <li> cream is simply a moisturizing foundation that provides light coverage with added sunscreen and botanicals.  </li>
            <li> Very hydrating and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> No problems with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;You should really try this out if it sounds like you might like it.</li>
            <li> I am usually pretty lazy with my make-up, but I know I need some kind of cover to even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m what you would consider a more mature woman so finding products that can do multiple things</li>
            <li> So easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fairly light-skinned Korean girl in my early 20s, with skin a little more on the dry side around my cheeks and jaw, but a little more oily in my T-zone.</li>
            <li> The blush was just right for a young girl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li> All of the BB skin 79 products are amazing, it covered age spots, brightened complexion and my face felt smooth, the dry tight feeling was gone.</li>
            <li> most other bb creams/tints tend to darken my complexion...</li>
            <li> i also love the pink cream blush with it!</li>
            <li> I love the glow it gives my skin, and it lasts all day, unlike other products that give a sheen to your skin, but require re-application to get it again.  </li>
            <li> i never felt like i could get away with a tinted moisturizer, as when i have active break-outs (which honestly, is most of the time)</li>
            <li> It has been a better match for my tan Asian skin tone; however, the coverage isn&#x27;t as good as the Pink and the smell is a little stinkier.  </li>
            <li> But you can easily correct this with a dash of loose powder.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, not too dramatic.  </li>
            <li> and I will say that I&#x27;m pleased with the coverage - not too much, not too little.</li>
            <li> I also love the little lip &amp; cheek tint on the lid, it makes me look very refreshed.</li>
            <li> and seriously can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li> The product is brand new, but expiring soon!</li>
            <li> the last couple of weeks, ive been using a new cleanser (loreal go 360 clean acne wash) and this bb cream.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it replaces two products and your skin ends up looking even better than it did with its more expensive predecessors.</li>
            <li> squirts out of a teeny circle in the middle, inevitably getting all over the top and your finger/hand.</li>
            <li> It gives a decent coverage.</li>
            <li> Does its job of covering up decently.</li>
            <li> Packaging is nice, comes with pink blusher which I use occasionally.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the VIP gold, Garnier and Youth code BBs, as well as, high end $45 foundations.</li>
            <li> and I love how it&#x27;s in the cap with a little mirror</li>
            <li> The lip and cheek tint when I use it comes up on my lips as a really light creamy lilac and baby pink tint.</li>
            <li> It gives my face a natural glow, yet it covers my under eye circles and my pores very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it evens out small plemishes and leaves the skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> They all feel lovely on the skin, but the two I just mentioned offer ample coverage with out a heavy made up feel.</li>
            <li> It does smell lovely and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feel once on the face.</li>
            <li> Also the pump usually releases more product than you&#x27;d ever want for your whole face.</li>
            <li> and I feel as if I have to clean it every single time I use it.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have tried almost this entire make up line, this one and the black one are my absolute favorites!</li>
            <li> Since my skin was on the dry side, the bb cream emphasized the patches even more, even after putting lotion prior to application.</li>
            <li> Definitely it clogs my pore, right now I have bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> It matches very well to my pale skin (but I tan easily).</li>
            <li> The BB cream itself was perfect for me, alot of people wassaying that it ws too thin to cover anything, but really, it&#x27;s pretty thick like normal foundation.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday and then dust my face with bare minerals foundation to dull the shine Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Compared to my Missha BB cream, I actually like Missha more because it&#x27;s more matte (I usually have dry skin,</li>
            <li> soon I&#x27;m going to order a new bottle and wait</li>
            <li> Once I finished that one I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> Super moist and the right shade for my pale complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably get another bottle of this when I run out, but I feel like it&#x27;s going to last quite a while since you don&#x27;t really need much product.</li>
            <li> But this one makes u looks very natural.</li>
            <li> As I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If however, you want to look normal and alive, this is not the product to use.</li>
            <li> But other than that I would definitely recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> First let me state that I am not of Asian descent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product shortly after the first of the month and was quite nervous about wether or not it would match my skintone or not.</li>
            <li> It is light in color, very moisturizing, and I use it under my foundation because it doesn&#x27;t provide complete coverage for my uneven skin tone and age spots.  </li>
            <li> This one the oriental gold is actually lighter coverage so the color is more natural compared to the Pink one.  </li>
            <li> On the lips, it actually made my lips look matte, which I don&#x27;t actually mind at all because it looked nice and pink.  </li>
            <li> I typically use Fairly Light tones for foundation and this product worked well for me with regards to color matching.  </li>
            <li> I feel like its cleaner coverage than traditional foundation (much less matte looking) and more subdued than luminous makeup.</li>
            <li> the consistency is ok, it has the creaminess of the typical asian bb creams, thicker than the bb creams here in the u.s.</li>
            <li> well, I used the Pink BB cream previously and I liked it.  </li>
            <li> The color of this cream is a little too light for me at the moment since it&#x27;s summer.</li>
            <li> The  shade is a little light.</li>
            <li> The color is a little on the light side but still workable.  </li>
            <li> But I soon found that the product comes out of a tiny hole in the top that has a little rubber stopper in it.</li>
            <li> Plus, if your skin is clear of breakouts...it can stand alone.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t look natural nor pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It looks so natural that I prefer it over Nars and Benefit blushes.</li>
            <li> My son (he&#x27;s 2) completely ruin my cheek/lip tint, which DEVASTATED MEEEE</li>
            <li> Some of my acne scars are fading and have disappeared completely.</li>
            <li> My mom keeps asking me why my skin is clearing up, because it looks so natural</li>
            <li> It also works well for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you want a light, everyday BB cream for sensitive/dry-normal skin, this product will work well for you.</li>
            <li> I know this product is made for Asian skin tones and it does have a bit of a beige tint to it, but not as much as let&#x27;s say Dr.</li>
            <li> and I am in my early 40s</li>
            <li> It gives a natural finish.</li>
            <li> It does not clog my pores or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and this covered it completely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sorta like concealer, but it looks natural.</li>
            <li> It can be put on quickly in a busy morning.  </li>
            <li> I have heard so much about Asian BB creams and wanted to give them a try.</li>
            <li> and I can really use something that makes me look younger.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy but sheer, so the color is buildable.  </li>
            <li> More coverage than a tinted moisturizer, but not as heavy as regular old foundation.</li>
            <li> WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH</li>
            <li> It makes me look naturally blush not like a clown.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much to apply it to your entire face.  </li>
            <li> Any cons: I&#x27;m in my early 40s</li>
            <li> also have acne scars, when i put this product on my face they are completely covered and this helps with acne as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t condone makeup for young girls</li>
            <li> but this is so natural it helps even out her skin tone without anyone knowing she&#x27;s wearing anything.  </li>
            <li> my seventeen year old daughter.</li>
            <li> So far I would say that it seems to be working, and it does not break me out</li>
            <li> i have adult acne, sometimes sort of cystic acne, under my chin/jawline....</li>
            <li> ive tried the natural ones too....</li>
            <li> outcan&#x27;t really give an interview because everybody is different</li>
            <li> cooling, dewy finish that makes you look like a brighter toned, somewhat airbrushed version of your natural self.</li>
            <li> Natural looking.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried this cream without a moisturizer to see if it would dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wild about the lip/eye balm color (it is fine for my eyes but way too pink for my lips)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that said their face looks like it&#x27;s freshly washed even at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> If you do your whole face, then it&#x27;s not obvious that it is not your natural color, although it does take me a couple of minutes to get used to it every morning as it is lighter and a different tone than my natural color.</li>
            <li> PERFECT QUALITY REAL PRODUCT - if you want to know how to tell fake from real, just google \\&quot;fake skin79 bb cream\\&quot;</li>
            <li> it lasts long and really make my face cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li> I saw reviews that said this was a problem, but I have light skin (I usually use the lightest or next-lightest makeup offered by a cosmetic line)</li>
            <li> The lip tint is a pretty pink that moisturizes your lips and seems to make them look plumper.</li>
            <li> This BB cream gives me a fresh and youthful appearance and cuts down the blotchiness of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had to go out and buy new makeup until I can go get my skin79 back</li>
            <li> , theyre pretty vivid (i mess with them).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale (a freckled ginger) and my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see that the cheek tint/lip tint is actually on the cap!</li>
            <li> I really like the blush part of this product but the make feels chalky and rough.  </li>
            <li> I read some reviews about poor packaging but this seemed to come in ok?</li>
            <li> Thin and light to the skin!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This one has more of a yellow undertone, as opposed to the grey and pink in some of the other Skin 79 BB creams.  </li>
            <li> I guess it just wasn&#x27;t right for me, makes my face dried</li>
            <li> The cheek stain that comes with it would be pretty subtle on anyone much darker skinned than me, FYI.</li>
            <li> This BB Cream is a little bit thinner then most and maybe easier to apply for those having trouble with thicker creams.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin that used to sometimes flake before I started nourishing it regularly with high moisture lotion.  </li>
            <li> The pump design is a little bit weired because the product comes out from the top center, but I find it easier to use than the Pink one.  </li>
            <li> ive tried several of the mineral make up brands including bare minerals....</li>
            <li> I did notice this BB in particular in comparison with other Skin79 BB creams leaves the skin a bit shinier, so for people with oily skin beware.  </li>
            <li> I worked well on my dry and sensitive skin tone.</li>
            <li> The pink looks very natural as well.</li>
            <li> it is a very soft pink</li>
            <li> The pump is a little unusual</li>
            <li> Oriental Gold BB Cream does provide very good coverage, but it is so pale that if I don&#x27;t use something over it, I look really sickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just tinted enough to wear without any type of foundation &amp; it&#x27;s not thick, heavy or greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with that, as long as you&#x27;re not expecting more.  </li>
            <li> but it does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> There was some minor wear in the outside packaging from the travel but nothing that affected the product itself.</li>
            <li> How I use it: Wash my face and put on my anti-aging serum - let that dry, use fingers to apply BB cream all over face (takes not even half a pump), either use fingers or directly stick the cheek tint onto my face and then rub it onto my cheek, use my big kabuki brush to finish by brushing my Pixi face powder over it all, add powder blush if I didn&#x27;t use enough cheek tint, masacara, and then use the cheek tint on my lips to finish the look.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t look like a circus clown with just a little dab on the cheekbones; looks very natural.</li>
            <li> In fact, I felt the need to constantly check out my face to see if it has improved, but to my disappointment, it didnt get any better as the day progressed.</li>
            <li> so my skin is starting to get dry whereas it was oily before.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I could fake it easily given all the rave reviews for Korean BB Cream.  </li>
            <li> It looks that all Skin 79 BB creams (lilac, orange, pink and silver containers) are the same size and lilac is only one with this</li>
            <li> , I just don&#x27;t want a lotion that sinks into my skin totally; maybe just a psychological thing, maybe not.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps the blemishes and dark spots slightly less noticeable, though not as much as it claims.</li>
            <li> The cheek tint is a little to pink for me, so use very little, love it on the lips, it feels like the plump up a little</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a little over a week, and have developed a rash on my face.</li>
            <li> The Pink has a gray tint whereas Gold has a yellow tint.  </li>
            <li> A few dabs on my lips and cheeks give me a natural rosey glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bonus.colour looked a bit grey but blends well and brightens and evens skin tone</li>
            <li> It came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> So I only use it when I need minimal</li>
            <li> This bb cream is skin tone color, which is different than other Korean bb cream.  </li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and will ware off after two hours.  </li>
            <li> I live in the South and my friend is always troubled about using foundation a shade darker...or foundation oxidizing on the skin, to give it a darker orangey look...making skin seem older.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30s, combo to dry skin.</li>
            <li> : For those that find BB Creams caking on skin, apply a primer on skin, let dry then apply BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I have freckles and my skin is on the dry side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cheek/liptint also made my lips extremely dry and break out around the lips too..</li>
            <li> Skin is a combination of oily and dry skin but this product has not cause me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have dry skin with semi-oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> Given my skin tends toward the dry side, this BB cream gives a bit of shine to my face.  </li>
            <li> does not cover red does not cover dark spots</li>
            <li> The cream blends well, but just isn&#x27;t dark enough.</li>
            <li> At first I was really confused by the packaging.</li>
            <li> i dont even need powder (and im usually relatively shiny with every other makeup)!</li>
            <li> My only big complaint is the pump -- it&#x27;s an awkward thing where you push down on the entire top and some bb cream</li>
            <li> The Hot Pink and Gold made me break out after a week and this one is easier to wash off since it is less thick than the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the bb cream is just so so ,it is not long lasting, if i use it in the morning ,in the afternoon ,my face looks really dull.</li>
            <li> so I only use this product if I feel like my skin needs a little airbrushing, otherwise I fear that I might breakout if I wear it too often.</li>
            <li> If your complexion isn&#x27;t Asian and your lips are a little darker, you may just end up using the tint on your cheeks, as I have.</li>
            <li> Like other make-up this doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or feel oily.</li>
            <li> decided to go for this BB cream because I was curious about the cheek tint.</li>
            <li> I was visiting my father a few weeks ago and left my BB cream there</li>
            <li> Some people are saying the lip/cheek stain is too much pink or something?</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after having used the Pink BB Cream for a year.  </li>
            <li> You can also apply additional layers for additional coverage, which is what I like to do around my eyes, since I have dark, grey undereye circles.  </li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> thing I could pass on is the pink stuff.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not a very noticeable difference between my neck and my face.</li>
            <li> Too pink.</li>
            <li> But my nose gets a tiny bit oily after a few hours of wearing this BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a base with darker foundation over it works well, although I kind of felt like my pores were clogged.</li>
            <li> the key is to use a tiny amount (much less than you would if it were a moisturizer or foundation alone) and apply it to small areas of your face.</li>
            <li> This is more due to my skin type versus it being a bad product.</li>
            <li> I am slightly hesitant to travel with this, as the cap doesn&#x27;t click on and hold tight enough in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Some of them being parabens,talc, butylene glycol, and other skin irritants.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other BB cream except skin 79</li>
            <li> I find myself reaching for it instead of any other almost every day.</li>
            <li> I usually have a problem where make-up will get clumped in little parts of my skin where it&#x27;s dry and look gross and crusty.</li>
            <li> So I put a little dot of moisturizer under this bb cream, otherwise, I will see some dry skin flakes.</li>
            <li> I wasted several days&#x27; worth of cream trying to figure out how that mysterious thing worked. :(  </li>
            <li> The pump is bad, you press down on the black part and product dispenses through the hole in the top, like a fountain.</li>
            <li> This pumping is pretty hard to control, as the opening can get dirty from frequent pumping.</li>
            <li> I have slightly dry pale skin</li>
            <li> Came before Amazon predicted, when item was out of stock seller said it might take up to a week to get it in and sent out, but she sent it within 2-3 days, and included a little sample of the Pink label BB cream.  </li>
            <li> Even after several minutes and hours, it still looks gray-ish on me, so in essence, my skin looked dull and sallow.</li>
            <li> but then shortly afterwards, you&#x27;ll feel like you can hardly move your face.  </li>
            <li> I still have to use my Skinfood Dark Circle Concealer with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this working for dark skin girls Unless they plan to mix with foundation.</li>
            <li> But if you use it too much, it leaves this weird gunky residue on your skin even after you wash your face?</li>
            <li> I received it about a week ago and have worn it every day in order to determine whether it is lightening my dark spots and / or improving my skin in any way.  </li>
            <li> within days my flare-ups calmed down...</li>
            <li> (I have dry skin and usually, I don&#x27;t have any problems with oiliness.</li>
            <li> I had one previous BB cream,from Hanskin which was so dewy</li>
            <li> Skin color is on the yellowish-olive tone, typical of south east asians.</li>
            <li> The finish is slightly dewy (maybe close to demi-matte liquid?)</li>
            <li> but I have a slightly darker skin tone</li>
            <li> Paid $60 for that sucker and it wouldn&#x27;t dry down at all!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is not a full coverage BB cream.  </li>
            <li> Even with the lotion I still have had a hard time finding a foundation or bb cream that doesn&#x27;t dry my face out.  </li>
            <li> and I dont have any trouble with my extremely dry skin soaking it up, or ending up migrating to make dry patches look even worse.  </li>
            <li> but it still works for me, although I&#x27;m a little tan now after a week in the beach.</li>
            <li> Makes skin look dewy but a little foundation powder fixes that.</li>
            <li> not so i was a little scared to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> how well I clean my face in the morning and at night I&#x27;m breaking out (acne) like crazy!</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not important.</li>
            <li> This one is not as heavy and matches betteer.</li>
            <li> If you prefer matte I would use some powder to set, but wait a few minutes before you do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done with wearing heavy foundations.</li>
            <li> Since I have a few acne scars, I didn&#x27;t need a lot of coverage.</li>
            <li> didnt cover so well and dried me out.</li>
            <li> After 30 min, it didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin anymore, so I guess the lotion part soaked in.</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews on this product, and they advised not to press down on the pump too hard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale.</li>
            <li> (I am quite pale)  </li>
            <li> all the hoopla got me excited to try this stuff even though I hate foundation.  </li>
            <li> and I realise now that I&#x27;ve taken it for granted these past few months.</li>
            <li> She was embarrassed by some uneven skin tone and small blemishes.</li>
            <li> It dried out my lips a little and it hardly showed up on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Just use a small amount and rub it in your face</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do liquid foundations since they usually make me break out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually the lightest color in foundations, anyway, so no need to lighten.</li>
            <li> im in my mid-thirties and have very pale, spongey textured (enlarged pores/scars)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get even, un-blotchy</li>
            <li> it hard to make it evenly.</li>
            <li> I can slap this on after my shower and have moist skin all day, a little bit of color correction, and it doesn&#x27;t make breakouts worse for me.  </li>
            <li> Since all if not most BB Creams have a whitener you have to learn to apply the product thin and even and/or mix/blend it with your usual foundation or</li>
            <li> But the Lip &amp; cheek tint is just so so, at least for lips</li>
            <li> im a sucker for gimmicks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my Skin79 Oriental Gold :(   </li>
            <li> Trust me, you don&#x27;t want this stuff to go to waste!!  </li>
            <li> ordered the foaming wash based on the other reviews which said this cream can be difficult to remove, but the wash has not arrived yet.  </li>
            <li> i mean, its coming from korea</li>
            <li> i mean, its coming from korea</li>
            <li> I usually cannot use up any foundation before I got tired of it.</li>
            <li> The color is extremely subtle.  </li>
            <li> the design of the pump really not good....gets dirty easily,the design doesnt make sense</li>
            <li> First of all, the BB cream has this horrible smell to it..</li>
            <li> I do have some sunspots which of course are revealed once I wash my face, but I&#x27;ve been told that they are very hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I tried placing just a little bit on as stated to cover the red in my face, no go, still looks like war paint, or worst like I&#x27;m trying to look like a clown.</li>
            <li> It does NOT make wrinkles look worse like some foundations do.</li>
            <li> The circles under my eyes even look worse.</li>
            <li> Impossible to use without making a mess</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, because I really like it, but I hate trying to apply another product over it.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so sad it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li> the scent was faint, didnt bother me at all.</li>
            <li> but sadly I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin at all since I started using it every day about 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> The cheek tint is useless to me.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I know people have been talking about the fake bb creams and what</li>
            <li> So that was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have a hormone sensitivity that causes crazy breakouts and redness from time to time.  </li>
            <li> ; ponds cold cream and then acne wash at night followed by cetaphil moisturizer before bed).</li>
            <li> ; ponds cold cream and then acne wash at night followed by cetaphil moisturizer before bed).</li>
            <li> so dont be afraid to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I wished so bad it worked for me.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what made my skin break out so bad, but its not the product for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to that, but it doesn&#x27;t look bad.</li>
            <li> It looked really bad on my lips, though.</li>
            <li> And now it comes up again :(.</li>
            <li> even tried it on my boyfriend who suffers from terrible redness and it took it all out</li>
            <li> Also I have very bad redness on my cheeks/chin/neck</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find out that this contained 3 parabens.</li>
            <li> The worst thing it caused me breakout.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The only draw back trying to figure out how open bb cream. Love this. This bb cream has more coverage  and a great smell.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream! My skin looks healthier now even when I don&#x27;t wear any makeup! Although it goes on sort of thick, the coverage is flawless and even and It doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m wearing any makeup! I like the radiant finish it gives my skin and it last all day and night! The pink cheek and lip tint is great on my cheeks, but not as a lip tint. But that&#x27;s not important. I like it as a cheek tint so I&#x27;m satisfied. I recommend this product to anyone, but especially for women who care about aging skin. It really makes your skin more youthful looking! I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for.  I have extremely dry skin that used to sometimes flake before I started nourishing it regularly with high moisture lotion.  Even with the lotion I still have had a hard time finding a foundation or bb cream that doesn&#x27;t dry my face out.  I tried the VIP Gold BB Cream which I liked, but didn&#x27;t love (still kind of drying/cakey).  This bb cream glides on smoothly and makes my face look flawless.  It holds its moisture all day.  It does have more of a dewy finish (which I prefer), but I suppose you could dust some powder over it if you prefer a matte finish.  This bb cream keeps me looking very youthful and my skin loves it.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Let me start with stating that I have a very light complexion. I ordered this product thinking it would look great as some of the reviews promised. I found it to be a literally &#x27;white&#x27; makup and bright pink blush. So if your goal is to look like a geisha, then this is for you. If however, you want to look normal and alive, this is not the product to use. I don&#x27;t know what the great reviews are about. I tried placing just a little bit on as stated to cover the red in my face, no go, still looks like war paint, or worst like I&#x27;m trying to look like a clown.</li>
            <li> its a great product, its very smoothy. I,d like to say it is really great,and i like it very much.</li>
            <li> The pump is bad, you press down on the black part and product dispenses through the hole in the top, like a fountain. That being said, this BB cream matches my skin almost perfectly and covers pretty well. The lip and cheek tint when I use it comes up on my lips as a really light creamy lilac and baby pink tint. I haven&#x27;t used it as a cheek tint because I don&#x27;t color my cheeks. The cream itself, if used with a primer or serum underneath makes my skin look almost airbrushed. I have oily acne prone skin so I only use this product if I feel like my skin needs a little airbrushing, otherwise I fear that I might breakout if I wear it too often. I have found out that if I wear this product all day I do tend to breakout with one or two blemishes.</li>
            <li> I received the product around the estimated shipping date, and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. I was concerned it would not match my skin tone because I am of Caucasian lineage, and I&#x27;d read reviews about the cream being a more greyish tone, but the product matches with my skin very nicely. I like the package and the scent, but the cream itself is a bit \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; compared to what I&#x27;d normally use, although If I wear powder on top of the cream it is not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Well, I see what the fuss is about!&lt;br /&gt;I  couldn&#x27;t decide between tinted moisturizer and BB cream. I had one previous BB cream,from Hanskin which was so dewy my face was sparkling all over and it didn&#x27;t look natural nor pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go for this BB cream because I was curious about the cheek tint. And  I saw on Youtube someone using this cheek tint and it looked so beautiful and natural. Plus with this product I got two for one (BB plus blush). That never hurts. It looks that all Skin 79 BB creams (lilac, orange, pink and silver containers) are the same size and lilac is only one with this tint.&lt;br /&gt;First minute after applying it just sits on the skin. And then it absorbs. I&#x27;d say it is between light and medium coverage. I still have to use my Skinfood Dark Circle Concealer with it. This cheek tint however takes the cake. It looks so natural that I prefer it over Nars and Benefit blushes. But I don&#x27;t like it on my lips, it looks cheap there. And there is not a lot of this tint, when you look at the picture consider the fact that this golden top goes on top of this black part of BB cream container. But you don&#x27;t have to use it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;For me this cheek tint is enough to buy this product, however I like the cream itself as well. Not only does it look natural, it is also very good for the skin, and has SPF 25</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 6 weeks and I will say that I&#x27;m pleased with the coverage - not too much, not too little. I do have some sunspots which of course are revealed once I wash my face, but I&#x27;ve been told that they are very hard to get rid of. This formula supposedly will help lighten those too. I do feel it does nicely evens out my skin and looks very smooth and polished. I like that it has SPF as well. My only question is what&#x27;s the difference between this BB cream and the others, especially by the same manufacturer, SKIN79?  The descriptions appear to be the same. Overall, I do recommend this cream. The lip/cheek tint on top is a cute bonus.</li>
            <li> This bb cream is awesome!!!! It makes my face lighter and its very smooth. I recommend using it. will order some more!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Love the texture and the smell.  Great for the skin. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this :) It&#x27;s for very light skin like mine. If this gets popular in the US, they will need to make more shades. It smells nice, I LOVE the cheek tint in the top cap(again for light skin), its creamy and smooth and the dispensing/packaging is kinda cool &amp; easy to use. Love the retailer, Seoulglamour &amp; highly recommend them :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a bb cream, so I researched and figured this may be a good one. I am in my 30s, combo to dry skin. Im a NW20 or lighter depending on the season. It covered up redness, minimized pores, but of course u could still see them, as this isnt full coverage. It looked extremely natural on so for summer its a great way to go. I eventually put some powder ontop as the finish was creamy/dewey. Lasted over 8 hrs and kept going till I took it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried it on my boyfriend who suffers from terrible redness and it took it all out and it wasnt dectectable. He said it felt very moisturizing and the sun protection is a bonus.</li>
            <li> This product does not work for me. It does not provide the coverage I need and it breaks me out. It does not brighten your skin either. Well, the reason I give it 3 stars is because it works for my mom. I don&#x27;t wanna go through the returning process and give it to my mom and she kinda likes it.</li>
            <li> It has great coverage but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  It also matches my skin tone (I&#x27;m Caucasian).  I&#x27;m not wild about the lip/eye balm color (it is fine for my eyes but way too pink for my lips) but I didn&#x27;t get this for lipstick so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it really will good for my skin long term but only time will tell with that.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like this product. it lasts long and really make my face cleaner and smoother. It can be used as a light concealer.     It also smells good, like the tea.     the top part lip&amp; cheek tint is also great. the color is perfect for me.     I usually use this BB cream first, then some mineral powdner, and then the tint. and It lasts the whole day.     Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bb cream! Super moist and the right shade for my pale complexion.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased 4 BB creams, this seems to be the most sheer coverage, and most moisturizing.  Again, I just opened them minutes ago.  With prolonged use I will re-review this product.  It matches very well to my pale skin (but I tan easily). I have not tried the tint yet.</li>
            <li> It helps the blemishes and dark spots slightly less noticeable, though not as much as it claims. The nice thing is that the make up lasts a whole day.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite BB cream. Light coverage for a fresh and flawless look. It is also very good for the skin, so wearing this BB cream is never a problem. I recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> this is the second time I ordered the Gold BB cream and I really like it, it evens out small plemishes and leaves the skin nice and soft. The cheek tint is a little to pink for me, so use very little, love it on the lips, it feels like the plump up a little</li>
            <li> UPDATE!!!!  I can&#x27;t live without my Skin79 Oriental Gold :(   I was visiting my father a few weeks ago and left my BB cream there and I just feel crappy without it. Haha. I had to go out and buy new makeup until I can go get my skin79 back and it&#x27;s completely gross and I realise now that I&#x27;ve taken it for granted these past few months. Without my skin79 (and with covergirl/rimmel or whatever) my face looks like a mask and no matter how well I clean my face in the morning and at night I&#x27;m breaking out (acne) like crazy! (\\&quot;like crazy\\&quot; for me is 1-3 zits either altogether or at different times in the same week) regular makeup makes my skin look all chalky/bland..dried up... I don&#x27;t know how to explain it.  If I don&#x27;t go get my cream soon I&#x27;m going to order a new bottle and wait another 3 weeks haha. My son (he&#x27;s 2) completely ruin my cheek/lip tint, which DEVASTATED MEEEE I love it. So I&#x27;m planning on getting another bottle just for that factor.   Anyways, This BB cream is so amazing, I just don&#x27;t feel like myself without it and my skin is suffering, I never realised how much of a difference my Skin79 Oriental Gold made.  How I use it: Wash my face and put on my anti-aging serum - let that dry, use fingers to apply BB cream all over face (takes not even half a pump), either use fingers or directly stick the cheek tint onto my face and then rub it onto my cheek, use my big kabuki brush to finish by brushing my Pixi face powder over it all, add powder blush if I didn&#x27;t use enough cheek tint, masacara, and then use the cheek tint on my lips to finish the look. Looks airbrushed but natural, corrects skin tone and has good coverage when you do break out. and is weightless. Such a difference from foundation, my skin can breathe with my BB Cream.   &lt;3LOVEEEEE&lt;3  and seriously can&#x27;t live without it!  ORIGINAL POST: Came before Amazon predicted, when item was out of stock seller said it might take up to a week to get it in and sent out, but she sent it within 2-3 days, and included a little sample of the Pink label BB cream.  PERFECT QUALITY REAL PRODUCT - if you want to know how to tell fake from real, just google \\&quot;fake skin79 bb cream\\&quot; and they tell you how to look out for it.  Some people are saying the lip/cheek stain is too much pink or something? It goes on like a clear pastel sort of pink, looks great on both my cheeks and lips I LOVE IT.   The BB cream itself was perfect for me, alot of people wassaying that it ws too thin to cover anything, but really, it&#x27;s pretty thick like normal foundation. It&#x27;s pretty light colored, perfect for my complexion, i usually use an ivory-light. I don&#x27;t really see any \\&quot;gray-ish\\&quot; color. It does have a dewey finish, but I just used my kabuki to put some powder over and then put the cheek cream.   Anyways,   I LOVE IT and I WILL DEFINITELY be buying from them again. New favorite product &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> One of two favorite BB Creams. This container comes with a very nice pink lip/cheek tint on the lid which is an added bonus. Since all if not most BB Creams have a whitener you have to learn to apply the product thin and even and/or mix/blend it with your usual foundation or maybe a shade darker and/or apply this BB Cream and add a light layer of powder or compact foundation that is the shade closest to your skin. Then it makes your skin look natural and flawless!! I love this product for that reason. I also have found after using the product my skin tone naturally is starting to even out. Some of my acne scars are fading and have disappeared completely. This BB Cream is a little bit thinner then most and maybe easier to apply for those having trouble with thicker creams. I would buy this again!&lt;br /&gt;Tip: For those that find BB Creams caking on skin, apply a primer on skin, let dry then apply BB Cream.</li>
            <li> the design of the pump really not good....gets dirty easily,the design doesnt make sense&lt;br /&gt;but the bb cream and the cheek tint really smell good, sweet smell&lt;br /&gt;i really like the cheek tint, the color is really cute&lt;br /&gt;but the bb cream is just so so ,it is not long lasting, if i use it in the morning ,in the afternoon ,my face looks really dull.</li>
            <li> This was my first BB Cream and I absolutely LOVE it. The coverage is amazing, so amazing that as the weeks pass by, I&#x27;ve been lessening the amount I put on my face, and it still makes me glow. I have a pretty clear (and fair) face to begin with, although, I do turn red easily, and Skin79 Oriental Gold BB cream whitens and completely erases my red spots. I don&#x27;t even put on any powder afterwards and people tell me my skin looks amazing. The lip and cheek tint is cute too for an innocent look.&lt;br /&gt;I just recently bought Garnier BB Cream and while it&#x27;s nice, I still like Skin79 better because of the whitening; so there&#x27;s a comparison for you. xD&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely buying Skin79 again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after having used the Pink BB Cream for a year.  The Pink has a gray tint whereas Gold has a yellow tint.  It has been a better match for my tan Asian skin tone; however, the coverage isn&#x27;t as good as the Pink and the smell is a little stinkier.  I am still very satisfied by this product and deal with the trade-off in coverage by going over the BB Cream with powdered foundation using a brush.  I recommend this product for light to medium Asian skin tone.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers on here, this was my first time trying out BB cream and I must say I was very impressed. It  matched my skin tone really well (I have very fair skin, usually \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; in most concealer brands), and it gave me a fresh, natural glow. The lip tint was actually really nice too, and didn&#x27;t dry out my lips like many other lip products do. Great product, but don&#x27;t expect an miracles. I have seen reviews for BB creams that hyped them up a bit too much. The product is still just make-up, just a lighter, fresher make-up than what you can find in most American stores for the price.</li>
            <li> I love my BB Cream and I use the tint for my cheeks. The BB cream is wonderful! My mom keeps asking me why my skin is clearing up, because it looks so natural (it couldn&#x27;t possibly be makeup). I feel like its cleaner coverage than traditional foundation (much less matte looking) and more subdued than luminous makeup. Therefore, it replaces two products and your skin ends up looking even better than it did with its more expensive predecessors. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again from this buyer. If your complexion isn&#x27;t Asian and your lips are a little darker, you may just end up using the tint on your cheeks, as I have. I live in the South and my friend is always troubled about using foundation a shade darker...or foundation oxidizing on the skin, to give it a darker orangey look...making skin seem older. This is the perfect solution. Plus, if your skin is clear of breakouts...it can stand alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both the Hot Pink and Gold Skin 79 BB creams and the main problem I have with both of them is that although the coverage is excellent, it tends to make my face look too white.  My face ends up looking another color than my neck.  I read the reviews for this one so I decided for under $20 why not give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the positives:&lt;br /&gt;I have very light Asian skin.  I typically use Fairly Light tones for foundation and this product worked well for me with regards to color matching.  My face no longer looks grayish.  It is very natural, comparable to putting on tinted moisturizer but with slightly better coverage. It also works well for sensitive skin.  The Hot Pink and Gold made me break out after a week and this one is easier to wash off since it is less thick than the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regards to the cheek/lip tint, I love the light pink color.  A few dabs on my lips and cheeks give me a natural rosey glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;This is not a full coverage BB cream.  I also noticed after 4 hours, my skin was oily.  I have combination skin to begin with but I think that this does not work well for oil control.  The lip and cheek tint will also NOT work for someone with darker skin tone.  The color is extremely subtle.  It is a tint and not a blush so don&#x27;t expect it to give you maximum color.  I don&#x27;t really like the texture of the lip/cheek tint, it is like a non-sticky chapstick bar but oilier.  Also this BB cream is not matte.  It is a bit shiny but not too shiny like Etude House creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you want a light, everyday BB cream for sensitive/dry-normal skin, this product will work well for you.</li>
            <li> I really like it however it does clog my pores which leads to breakouts. This is more due to my skin type versus it being a bad product. I would recommend it for its great coverage but be forewarned, applying it correctly does take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I really love just the Lip &amp; Cheek Tint. It is really great. However, the BB Cream itself did not match with my skintone at all. It smells nice, but it didn&#x27;t look to great on me. But for the size of the bottle, the price was good.</li>
            <li> This BB cream goes on easily and gives good coverage.  Coverage is something most women in their 60s are looking for.  I&#x27;m very happy with it as I can wear it all day without it becoming greasy or causing my face to feel tight at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I used the gold bb cream and fell in love but the color didnt match for me. I&#x27;m extremely pale. This one is not as heavy and matches betteer. The cheek tint is lighter than. The gold  too and oh so lovely.</li>
            <li> As someone who has tried several Skin79 samples before, I decided to venture out and get this one because I saw the cute mirror/tint :) Seoulglamour&#x27;s customer service was great about my questions and shipped quickly. The tint didn&#x27;t work as well on the lips as the cheeks. The bb cream itself works just as I wanted -- sheer coverage, but does what I need (I mostly need to even skin tone, no blemishes/acne problems) :D Loved the appearance and shine of the container and everything. My only big complaint is the pump -- it&#x27;s an awkward thing where you push down on the entire top and some bb cream squirts out of a teeny circle in the middle, inevitably getting all over the top and your finger/hand. Impossible to use without making a mess and I feel as if I have to clean it every single time I use it. I wasted several days&#x27; worth of cream trying to figure out how that mysterious thing worked. :(  But other than that I would definitely recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> First let me state that I am not of Asian descent.I know this product is made for Asian skin tones and it does have a bit of a beige tint to it, but not as much as let&#x27;s say Dr.Jart&#x27;s Premium Beauty Balm. I have sensitive,combination porcelain skin with golden undertones and I am in my early 40s so I have some wrinkles, large pores, etc. This product gives good light to medium natural coverage. I do not need anything else but this.It is a moisturizer,SPF and treatment all in one.It has a soothing tea scent. It gives a natural finish. If you prefer matte I would use some powder to set, but wait a few minutes before you do.It does NOT make wrinkles look worse like some foundations do. It makes my skin look luminous and even toned. It does not clog my pores or irritate my sensitive skin.In fact, my pores actually look smaller since I&#x27;ve started using BB creams. This product is great for the winter because it is moisturizing.I do get shiny around mid day if I do not use some powder to set it.The lip tint is a pretty pink that moisturizes your lips and seems to make them look plumper.I admit that I like the effect! I would suggest this product for women with drier skin types and for winter use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product shortly after the first of the month and was quite nervous about wether or not it would match my skintone or not. It matches perfectly! (I am quite pale)  Also I have very bad redness on my cheeks/chin/neck and this covered it completely.  I&#x27;m in love with this, it feels like nothing on your skin and you forget you are even wearing it.  I will deffinatly repurchase it.  Also, I ordered it from seoulglamour and it arrived within a week after ordering it instead of taking almost 4 like the estimated shipping said.  Absolutely worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is light in color, very moisturizing, and I use it under my foundation because it doesn&#x27;t provide complete coverage for my uneven skin tone and age spots.  I think it would work best for dry to normal skin as it might be too heavy for oily skin.  Because my complexion is medium/light, the lip/cheek color is just right for me and a pleasant bonus.</li>
            <li> Good product! I usually cannot use up any foundation before I got tired of it. But amazingly, I use up every bit of this one.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday and then dust my face with bare minerals foundation to dull the shine Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> My first time buying BB product. When I first put it on I thought it was going to be to light of a color. But, once you blend it in, it is so nice. Makes your skin feel great! It is a light coverage but I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m done with wearing heavy foundations. The lip and cheek balm is dreamy.</li>
            <li> well, I used the Pink BB cream previously and I liked it.  Once I finished that one I wanted to try something new so I got the oriental gold, it is better than I expected.  Because I have acne problem I rely on BB cream to even out my skin tone and provide some coverage without breaking me out.  This one the oriental gold is actually lighter coverage so the color is more natural compared to the Pink one.  I still have to use some concealer for some area but that&#x27;s not a big issue for me.  the tint is easy to apply, just a finger tip is enough and for me it probably can replace my blush.  The pump design is a little bit weired because the product comes out from the top center, but I find it easier to use than the Pink one.  Overall, I like this product and would recommand it.</li>
            <li> Pretty happy with the product, it came really quickly, and I am using it often, not too much the blush but the rest.</li>
            <li> LOVED this product. i&#x27;m so sad it&#x27;s discontinued. the red lip tint was perfect for lip or cheek. the color was on point after some drying and went on smooth and covered well. i will miss it!</li>
            <li> I have used other BB creams but this is my favorite, it matches my Asian skintone well and the cheek tint is a nice bonus.  Good for dry skin types.</li>
            <li> This bb cream was perfect for on the go coverage but unfortunately made me break out. I wished so bad it worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have tan skin, and this BB cream it is so light for my skin tone. The worst thing it caused me breakout. Definitely it clogs my pore, right now I have bumps on my face. I have been trying to get rid of them. And now it comes up again :(.</li>
            <li> I didnt have a problem with the seller. Shipment was prompt, beautifully packaged, and they placed some samples, which was a good bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am asian. Skin color is on the yellowish-olive tone, typical of south east asians. I have freckles and my skin is on the dry side. Now abt the product... the consistency is ok, it has the creaminess of the typical asian bb creams, thicker than the bb creams here in the u.s. the scent was faint, didnt bother me at all. Application of the product was easy.  Has a bit of a dewy finish, but not enough that i would need to set it with powder. Coverage was ok, it lessened the appearance of my freckles. My issue with this is the color on my skin. Even after several minutes and hours, it still looks gray-ish on me, so in essence, my skin looked dull and sallow. I wasnt too thrilled about it. In fact, I felt the need to constantly check out my face to see if it has improved, but to my disappointment, it didnt get any better as the day progressed. Since my skin was on the dry side, the bb cream emphasized the patches even more, even after putting lotion prior to application. I love the lip and cheek tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used the product for 2 weeks before I gave it away to someone who wanted to try it out. Maybe it would match better on her. She left me the lip and cheek tint cause I love it...I actually still use it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, hands-down my favorite BB cream!  It&#x27;s just tinted enough to wear without any type of foundation &amp; it&#x27;s not thick, heavy or greasy feeling.  You hardly know you have anything on your face, but it provides great coverage with a dew like appearance.  The cream blush in the lid is not quite my color, but my mom loves it, so she used out of lid of bottle she ordered &amp; I gave her mine to use!</li>
            <li> feels fresh on skin, not too thick/thin texture.cute lip/cheek tint bonus.colour looked a bit grey but blends well and brightens and evens skin tone nicely.doesnt feel heavy.you&#x27;ll need concealer on top if you have darker blemishes.perfect as a first time bb cream, or want something for all skin types.doesnt clog.excellent![[ASIN:B002C1JEPM SKIN79 Oriental Gold BB Cream with Lip &amp; Cheek Tint]]</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream is very moisturizing, light coverage. Does not feel cakey. Also, good for tan skin since tends to be darker than the pink skin 79.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my acne. It&#x27;s sorta like concealer, but it looks natural. I didn&#x27;t completely make my pimples go away like I wanted, but it did help and that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I tried and noticed significant improvement in my skin after using it.  It can be put on quickly in a busy morning.  Even my husband noticed the change.</li>
            <li> I uesed to ues skin79 super plus BB cream but this time I want to have a try on this one(supler plus is not bad though). The flavor is sweeter and the cream is not dry and easy to apply. I like it. But the Lip &amp; cheek tint is just so so, at least for lips it&#x27;s not so good. But OK for cheeks. I love the tiny mirror inside :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is a nice way to combine lotion, sunscreen protection and a tint all in one product.  It is great on my skin and does not make me break out.  I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I tried different bb cream before, this is not the best one if u look for perfect coverage. But this one makes u looks very natural. Very moisturized and smooth to put on, feels light and I love the blush which is come with it. The pink looks very natural as well. I have very dry skin, so I feel good to apply it daily. But if u are going to a wedding or party, coverage is kinda light.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about Asian BB creams and wanted to give them a try. It came really fast, about a week after I ordered it instead of a month like it said. At first I was really confused by the packaging. But I soon found that the product comes out of a tiny hole in the top that has a little rubber stopper in it. I really liked the idea of the tint which is why I ended up choosing this one. The color is really nice and I love how it&#x27;s in the cap with a little mirror but it does not last long at all. It dried out my lips a little and it hardly showed up on my cheeks. So that was a disappointment. As far as the cream itself, the color is kind of pasty but it blends well. I really haven&#x27;t liked how heavy it feels on my skin. It&#x27;s really thick. It does have great coverage though. It&#x27;s supposed to be full of ingredients that are good for your skin but sadly I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin at all since I started using it every day about 3 weeks ago. I have about the same amount of acne, but it does feel moisturizing. I will keep using it for now but I&#x27;ll look for something better.</li>
            <li> I have tried wide variety of bb creams from skin 79 pink, holika holika, étude house, missha, lioele and by far this is one of the best bb creams out of the bunch.  I am nc25 to 30 Korean light to med skin tone.  This blends in seamlessly with my skin, feels very light and creates a perfect even canvas.  My face looks very fair, and baby doll like porcelain effect..I love it...most other bb creams/tints tend to darken my complexion...this one doesn&#x27;t ...and I like that it comes with a lip and cheek cream blush , it&#x27;s so convenient and the color is so pretty..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will keep purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: July 8 2012----------&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what&#x27;s in this bb cream but every time I use this and take it off I see an improved, more even, more beautiful skin staring back at me.&lt;br /&gt;This is a holy grail product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Glides on so nice and the finish is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Good for med to light skin. Comes with a very nice blush pinky tone. I don&#x27;t see this working for dark skin girls Unless they plan to mix with foundation. Delivery bonus testers!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I saw on Dr. OZ that they were recommending skin cream that had BB in it.  I have another product that says BB, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as good as this one.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how great my skin looked and felt the first time I used it.  I am 73 and I can really use something that makes me look younger.  This is it, but I would recommend it for any age.</li>
            <li> This is a good BB cream, and I love the cheek/lip tint that comes with it--but it&#x27;s not for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the pictures shows, it comes with a removable cheek/lip tint.  It&#x27;s very creamy but sheer, so the color is buildable.  I would describe it as being a soft pink.  It&#x27;s easy to apply on the cheeks and doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks, and would be great for dry skin, since it&#x27;s moisturizing.  On the lips, it actually made my lips look matte, which I don&#x27;t actually mind at all because it looked nice and pink.  Made my lips look fuller too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the BB cream--it&#x27;s a little more watery than the Missha BB cream I&#x27;ve been using, but it still has good coverage.  A little goes a long way.  If it does have a gray tone, I haven&#x27;t noticed.  It matches my skin tone perfectly, looks very natural, like it&#x27;s not even there.  Goes on like a second skin, and all you need to do is apply it with your fingers.  You can also apply additional layers for additional coverage, which is what I like to do around my eyes, since I have dark, grey undereye circles.  It actually covers them up pretty well, though it&#x27;s not as good as a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, people with oily skin should note that it will look greasy if you put it on.  It doesn&#x27;t have a matte finish...more moisturizing than matte, so if you have oily skin, it won&#x27;t look very flattering.  But you can easily correct this with a dash of loose powder.  Compared to my Missha BB cream, I actually like Missha more because it&#x27;s more matte (I usually have dry skin, but right now it&#x27;s oily, thanks to the summer weather) and seems to even out my skin tone more.  But this is still a good BB cream.  I&#x27;ll probably begin using this in the fall when my skin gets drier, would be perfect as a \\&quot;winter\\&quot; BB cream.</li>
            <li> More coverage than a tinted moisturizer, but not as heavy as regular old foundation. The blush that&#x27;s included isn&#x27;t really my shade, but the BB Cream itself is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH THIS PRODUCT,,,LOOKS GREAT ON MY SKIN,,,ALSO I HAVE MANY SKIN TAGS ON M NECK AND THIS COVERS THEM SO THEY AREN&#x27;T AS NOTICEABLE,,WOULD RECCOMEND</li>
            <li> This BB cream has a nice texture but it&#x27;s too light for my skin.  It also leaves my skin feeling oily.  It would be great for someone with a lighter complextion than mine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen daughter who was finally allowed to wear some makeup. She was embarrassed by some uneven skin tone and small blemishes. She loved it!  Even though she is darker than I am (I&#x27;m fair she&#x27;s medium,) it blended right in. The blush was just right for a young girl. It wasn&#x27;t gaudy but just a hint of color on her skin tone. I tried it on too, and I love it! It&#x27;s Ok on the lips, but I didn&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
            <li> Wonderful...my face looks fabulous. I love the tint and used it on cheeks as well as lips. All of the BB skin 79 products are amazing, it covered age spots, brightened complexion and my face felt smooth, the dry tight feeling was gone.</li>
            <li> First of all, the BB cream has this horrible smell to it.. that I never got used to. It ended up causing severe allergic reaction to my skin, and i am still recovering from it. i don&#x27;t know what made my skin break out so bad, but its not the product for me.&lt;br /&gt;Cheek/liptint also made my lips extremely dry and break out around the lips too.. Won&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is a very good foundation for Asian type of skin. I worked well on my dry and sensitive skin tone. It does not make my skin overdried. Highly recommended for dry skin. The cheek tint is a good color too. It makes me look naturally blush not like a clown.</li>
            <li> Best BB cream for older, dry, lighter skin tones.  I tried several products including several brands bought and/or sampled at Sephora before I ordered this. Others I tried were either too orangey or not moisturizing enough. This is perfect for my fair skin.  I love how it goes on my skin and love the glow.</li>
            <li> A lot of people recommended this bb cream company, Skin79, so I decided to try out the Oriental Gold BB. It came earlier than I expected. When I put it on my face, it glided smoothly and covered my blemishes. Since I have a few acne scars, I didn&#x27;t need a lot of coverage. My relatives compliment my skin! One problem I have is pumping. This pumping is pretty hard to control, as the opening can get dirty from frequent pumping. It gives a decent coverage. If you want full coverage, then I recommend foundation. Overall, this is a great product that is worth money. I will definitely buy this bb cream in the future after I use up my bottle!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome bb cream! It is rich and moisturizing. Def the real deal. Not full coverage but great for days you want lighter coverage! Very good for normal type skin.</li>
            <li> The seller was amazing and sent my item very quickly as well as included sample beauty items&lt;br /&gt;in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had super high hopes for SKIN79 Oriental Gold BB Cream. Dang the luck on this one! I have filipina skin with a bit of a tan and it just didn&#x27;t do anything too special with my skin. It just comes off a bit dewy and it&#x27;s unnatural looking on my face. I am guessing it&#x27;s because my skin isn&#x27;t too fair. So I only use it when I need minimal coverup.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure if you&#x27;re complexion is on the lighter side it may work a lot better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm is great and it doubles as blush- i do love that!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying BB cream and I love it! Just use a small amount and rub it in your face it goes good coverage and at the same time still feels light! i also love the pink cream blush with it!</li>
            <li> The color is a bit grey (like what you see in most BB creams) so it&#x27;s definitely for people with fair skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this one when my SKIN79 (Gold Label ) VIP Collection was running out. This one doesn&#x27;t give you a lot of coverage . It&#x27;s light and not as moisture as the Gold one-which is kinda creamy. However, this one has a light smell and I love the cheek tint that come with it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again through, at least until my skin becomes flawless. Lol&lt;br /&gt;P/s If you are concern about authenticity , buy it from Pinkgelee . They shipped it super fast also ^^</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a little over a week, and have developed a rash on my face.I researched the ingredients, and they arent as great as they claim. Some of them being parabens,talc, butylene glycol, and other skin irritants.I will not buy any more skin79 products.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have tried almost this entire make up line, this one and the black one are my absolute favorites! They all feel lovely on the skin, but the two I just mentioned offer ample coverage with out a heavy made up feel.</li>
            <li> This is a great BB cream.  I am usually pretty lazy with my make-up, but I know I need some kind of cover to even out my skin tone.  I have a hormone sensitivity that causes crazy breakouts and redness from time to time.  This cream does a great job of working in place of an every day moisturizer and creates a more even foundation.  I can slap this on after my shower and have moist skin all day, a little bit of color correction, and it doesn&#x27;t make breakouts worse for me.  The SPF protection is a big bonus as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone with similar skin issues, the color works pretty well on me, and I usually tend toward the pale/pasty side.</li>
            <li> The lip &amp; cheek tint comes with the BB cream is definitely a plus. The rosy pink color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> the texture is great and the lip and check stain is wonderful, however I think this product wont suit oily skin or dark skin tone</li>
            <li> It was brighter than expected, but my friend loved it and bought more after. I especially love the size of the mirror, and you can keep it after you use up the BB cream.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is light, goes on smoothly and covers the face evenly.  The container makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover up blemishes like regular makeup does. I use makeup over it. I doubt that I will purchase it again.  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;ps. Would be great for good skin. Gives the face a nice glow.</li>
            <li> So nice! Great coverage, high quality and lip gloss/check stain is awesome!!! Will order again and again. Might need to see if it comes any darker for using during summer as I am fair skinned but get a little color during summer months.</li>
            <li> I just got this product in the mail today, and I already love it after the first use!  You don&#x27;t need to use much to apply it to your entire face.  I read previous reviews on this product, and they advised not to press down on the pump too hard.  I haven&#x27;t experienced it first-hand, so I followed the good advice. Trust me, you don&#x27;t want this stuff to go to waste!!  As for the BB Cream itself, it is FANTASTIC.  It absorbs quickly, and it feels really light, like I&#x27;m not wearing any make-up.  I have acne-prone/oily skin, and I don&#x27;t feel oily at all! It&#x27;s almost as though it has oil-controlling agents, although I didn&#x27;t see that in the product description.  I love the glow it gives my skin, and it lasts all day, unlike other products that give a sheen to your skin, but require re-application to get it again.  All in all, I give this product a 5 out of 5!</li>
            <li> I got this on the recommendation of Natalie Dee, because I needed something to cover my blemishes and occasionally rebellious skin. I&#x27;m very pale (a freckled ginger) and my skin is super sensitive. This cream blends well and you can layer it to cover up.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I could pass on is the pink stuff. I have a tube of Nars Orgasm and it looks vastly superior to this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, I look more professional, and I get some free pink stuff in case I get some girls over that want to play makeup</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! i just opened and tried the BB cream for the first time and I&#x27;m very happy, its really moisturizing goes on smoothly and blends in with my skin color perfectly (light medium with warm undertone). The pump is a little unusual but if you press it slowly you can get a good control of how much product you extract from the bottle, the tint was  in a nice natural color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product.  I&#x27;ve been getting compliments that my skin looks great.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews that said their face looks like it&#x27;s freshly washed even at the end of the day.  It is true for me too, and it feels smooth. Any cons: I&#x27;m in my early 40s so my skin is starting to get dry whereas it was oily before.  So I put a little dot of moisturizer under this bb cream, otherwise, I will see some dry skin flakes. This bb cream comes in just one shade, it might be too light for some but it still works for me, although I&#x27;m a little tan now after a week in the beach.</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cream i have ever bought and i love it!&lt;br /&gt;My Skin is a combination of oily and dry skin but this product has not cause me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;I also have acne scars, when i put this product on my face they are completely covered and this helps with acne as well.&lt;br /&gt;Foundation never helped me, always made me break out(and made my pimples worse) and made my skin super oily and didn&#x27;t do a good job of covering acne and scars.&lt;br /&gt;When i first used this, it felt very light,cooling,is very easy to blend in and matched my skin tone perfectly! However the Lip and Cheek tint, isn&#x27;t my cup of tea when i apply the tint on my face ,my cheeks look very shiny and when i applied it on my lips it dried them up.&lt;br /&gt;The Lip and cheek tint are useless for me, but the BB cream is amazing!!</li>
            <li> This product will tighten your skin right after you apply it onto your skin but then shortly afterwards, you&#x27;ll feel like you can hardly move your face.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and will ware off after two hours.  Do not wear this during the summer or else you&#x27;ll see your face melt in the heat, especially if its humid.</li>
            <li> Its the perfect color for me and I am bit fair so wasn&#x27;t sure it would work. I love the way the product is dispensed it keeps things sanitary and there is not chance to contaminate rest of product while using. The included lip gloss/blush? it is a very soft pink it isnt so great as a lip gloss and i haven&#x27;t tried it as a cheek color. It does smell lovely and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feel once on the face.</li>
            <li> It takes a while for the BB cream to adjust to your skin tone, but after it does it leaves your face smooth and the tones even.  I did notice this BB in particular in comparison with other Skin79 BB creams leaves the skin a bit shinier, so for people with oily skin beware.  Also because this product is made in Korea, where fair skin is cherished.  So people with darker skin shades may end up with too much of a contrast between the color of their face and neck.</li>
            <li> Radiant, buildable, and great for drier skin. The color is very nice on this one, not quite as pearly white as some other BBs. The cheek stain is a very wearable color, as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m what you would consider a more mature woman so finding products that can do multiple things all in one package is a definite plus! I compete in pageants and I have to use more makeup when  I&#x27;m on stage, so having something that also is good for my skin is even better!! I&#x27;ve tried the American produced BB creams and I wasn&#x27;t as satisfied with them as I am with Korean ones. So thank you Amazon for providing me with products from around the world!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t order online often, but I liked that this item came faster than expected...I read some reviews about poor packaging but this seemed to come in ok? There was some minor wear in the outside packaging from the travel but nothing that affected the product itself. I liked it.</li>
            <li> Smells kinda funky. Does its job of covering up decently. But if you use it too much, it leaves this weird gunky residue on your skin even after you wash your face? Also the pump usually releases more product than you&#x27;d ever want for your whole face. The cheek tint is useless to me.</li>
            <li> I love it! The packaging is perfect! The color fits my skin perfect! (which is rare for me!) Thin and light to the skin! This product works best for orientals, but it may also work for fair skinned women!</li>
            <li> sheer coverage to meh medium. does not cover red does not cover dark spots but it does a lovely job of gicing me that glow  &lt;3 btw I am a Nc35 and I only wear this around my flaws a but to had a some light oh and the shade is a bit of a warm tone like Nw other than a cool tone NC.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely scent but in my opinion its best for fair skin people who don&#x27;t have too much scrs on the face. Cheek tint has a lovely hue to it</li>
            <li> Love how nice this goes on my face and how it makes my skin feel and look. Like other make-up this doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or feel oily.</li>
            <li> This is the first BB Cream that I have tried so I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s my favorite. The color of this cream is a little too light for me at the moment since it&#x27;s summer. I will try this product again in the fall or winter. Aside from this product, I really appreciate the fast shipping from Seoul Glamour and will continue to buy from them.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this product after seeing it linking in a beauty blog called stuff I put on myself as a good option for those of us that are really pale. I absolutely love it!! Just tried it for the first time, very light weight, not greasy, and very even. I can&#x27;t do liquid foundations since they usually make me break out or they are way off on the skin color. This product is great for me since I don&#x27;t need an huge amount of coverage but don&#x27;t want to look totally bare faced. So far I love this product even the lip and cheek tint is pretty good. Very quick shipping too! Can&#x27;t wait to order more things from this seller.</li>
            <li> The product is brand new, but expiring soon! No wonder is this cheap! I have two months period to use up all of it.</li>
            <li> When i ordered this SKIN79 Oriental Gold BB cream w/ lip &amp; cheek tint i was satisfied, the price was great!.. and Fast Shipping!!.. Yeahh!.. i  definitely order in this site again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing out various BB creams and this one is second on my list of favorites. The airless pump is definitely great, and a plus that I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping my makeup clean during my busy mornings. I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping my makeup brushes clean in the mornings either, since I just apply with my fingers. So easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fairly light-skinned Korean girl in my early 20s, with skin a little more on the dry side around my cheeks and jaw, but a little more oily in my T-zone. The color matches mine well after I let it oxidize a bit. The coverage is pretty comparable to a light/medium liquid foundation, and good for evening out skin tone and making a clean, fresh canvas for my eyes, cheeks and lips. If you have more to conceal, this on top of concealer will definitely feel lightweight. The finish is slightly dewy (maybe close to demi-matte liquid?) and it really makes me look fresh and clean in the morning. The formula dries down nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my face sticky. (I once tried the Dr. Jart BB cream in a silver plastic tube. Paid $60 for that sucker and it wouldn&#x27;t dry down at all!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t love about this BB cream is that it has that makeup smell. I would say that that is the only reason I prefer the SKIN79 Super BB cream in the golden pump container. (The gold one is more grey than this and slightly heavier, great for better coverage and dry winters.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see that the cheek tint/lip tint is actually on the cap! It has a mirror on the underside to the lid flap, so that&#x27;s convenient. I am slightly hesitant to travel with this, as the cap doesn&#x27;t click on and hold tight enough in my opinion. While I don&#x27;t find any tinting qualities to the cheep/lip color, it&#x27;s certainly a pretty color and gives me that fresh spring glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do want to explore more BB creams, this is a close second to my favorite SKIN79 Super BB, and the cheek/lip tint is a plus!</li>
            <li> Product works well with my skin... I would definitely buy another one when i ran out.. I would definitely recommend it..</li>
            <li> I like this duo so much I am going to purchase it again for myself AND my 14-year-old daughter.  I don&#x27;t condone makeup for young girls but this is so natural it helps even out her skin tone without anyone knowing she&#x27;s wearing anything.  I have been a bare escentuals girl for a while now, but as I get older the powder sort of settles into my fine lines.  This BB cream gives me a fresh and youthful appearance and cuts down the blotchiness of my skin.  I love it!  Also, the cheek tint is gorgeous-</li>
            <li> I have a tough time finding the right foundation, I think this is good for those of us who have strong yellow under tones. I really like it an so does my seventeen year old daughter. I will reorder this product.</li>
            <li> I mostly like this bb cream, which is the first and only that I have used.  I received it about a week ago and have worn it every day in order to determine whether it is lightening my dark spots and / or improving my skin in any way.  So far I would say that it seems to be working, and it does not break me out (I have a light case of rosacea supposedly, although I look nothing like the photos on line.  Some light redness on my cheeks, and light breakouts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream can provide very good coverage without looking like a mask, or it can be lighter coverage, depending how much you use.  It is somewhat luminous which I like.  I like that it goes on sort of like Elmer&#x27;s Glue since I live in LA and want good sun protection.  I also like that it feels like it sits on top of my skin as I don&#x27;t want it going into my pores, and I am leery of the chemicals (which I know can still be absorbed, I just don&#x27;t want a lotion that sinks into my skin totally; maybe just a psychological thing, maybe not.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheek color is a nice tint so you don&#x27;t look like a circus clown with just a little dab on the cheekbones; looks very natural. It doesn&#x27;t provide much color at all for the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say that I am caucasian with light-ish olive skin.  The cream is lighter than my skin, which is ok with me as my skin color could use toning down, and I also think that lighter is better than pinker or golder.  If you do your whole face, then it&#x27;s not obvious that it is not your natural color, although it does take me a couple of minutes to get used to it every morning as it is lighter and a different tone than my natural color. Of course if you have darker skin than light to medium olive, then this cream is probably not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the foaming wash based on the other reviews which said this cream can be difficult to remove, but the wash has not arrived yet.  I just take special care to wash my face twice with a lot of lather and I follow with a damp pad and there is no residue...the cream does seem to wash off totally, if not easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I would point out that the list of ingredients includes, at the end, parabens (methyl, ethyl, and butyl) and fragrance.  I am not a fan of the fragrance, but it does seem to mostly dissipate pretty quickly.  And had I known about the parabens (my fault for not researching more before buying) I would have kept looking for a bb cream without. Since I have this one, I have decided to use it for a couple of weeks to see if my skin tone improves, and then hopefully I will just wear it when I want coverage / luminosity, and hopefully my skin will look good enough with just a moisturizer and some blush and lip color.  In the future I would look for a highly-rated bb cream without parabens.a damp pad and there is no residue...the cream does seem to wash off totally, if not easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I would point out that the list of ingredients includes, at the end, parabens (methyl, ethyl, and butyl) and fragrance.

            <li> I absolutely love this BB cream. It isn&#x27;t the first one I&#x27;ve used but most probably will be the last! It has amazing coverage, easy to apply and feels light on. No noticable difference to my skin, however but that&#x27;s ok with me. I love wearing this when leaving the house - makes me feel more comfortable covering any dark circles or flaws.</li>
            <li> im gonna be honest: im a sucker for gimmicks. im in my mid-thirties and have very pale, spongey textured (enlarged pores/scars), sun damaged (in places), yet mostly wrinkle-free, skin. i have adult acne, sometimes sort of cystic acne, under my chin/jawline....thats where i break out for some reason. ive tried every drug store brand of makeup including the neutrogena makeup for problem skin...didnt cover so well and dried me out. ive tried several of the mineral make up brands including bare minerals....didnt cover so well and seemed to take forever to apply (so much swirl-tap-swirling). i never felt like i could get away with a tinted moisturizer, as when i have active break-outs (which honestly, is most of the time), theyre pretty vivid (i mess with them). ive tried so many cleansers/moisturizers for problem skin, including the skin care products by olay for adult acne....they didnt really work...ive tried the natural ones too....ive made my own (bc im that kinda person)...nothing seems to have worked. well, almost nothing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the last couple of weeks, ive been using a new cleanser (loreal go 360 clean acne wash) and this bb cream. within days my flare-ups calmed down...the bb cream covers surprisingly well, even the red ones (now, within reason it covers...you can still sorta see i got something goin on there, but its not blaringly obvious). it makes the texture of my skin look so smooth and yet fresh and not cakey at all. i dont even need powder (and im usually relatively shiny with every other makeup)! the key is to use a tiny amount (much less than you would if it were a moisturizer or foundation alone) and apply it to small areas of your face. the tint is a neutral beige-y tint, its pretty light, works just fine for my skin tone (i dont look like casper) and holy cow does it feel lovely! i dont feel like im wearing makeup and yet i look pretty darn close to flawless. i cant say for sure if it is changing the texture of my skin, but i feel my new skin care regimen seems to be working for me (acne wash in the morning and then bb cream; ponds cold cream and then acne wash at night followed by cetaphil moisturizer before bed). my pores seem smaller, i have fewer breakouts, and i feel more confident in my face. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seller was awesome. i mean, its coming from korea so its gonna take a while to get here....and when it does, it comes with a free sample or two thrown in for good measure. no qualms with packaging, freshness or delivery of this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, if youre struggling to find a light feeling, long wearing, good coverage makeup, you might wanna try a bb cream...they have skin loving ingredients and a nice finish to boot. this is my first time trying one and i couldnt be more pleased (i did some research on makeupalley.com to see where to start).skin care regimen seems to be working for me (acne wash in the morning and then bb cream; ponds cold cream and then acne wash at night followed by cetaphil moisturizer before bed). my pores seem smaller, i have fewer breakouts, and i feel more confident in my face. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seller was awesome. i mean, its coming from korea so its gonna take a while to get here....and when it does, it comes with a free sample or two thrown in for good measure. no qualms with packaging, freshness or delivery of this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, if youre struggling to find a light feeling, long wearing, good coverage makeup, you might wanna try a bb cream...they have skin loving ingredients and a nice finish to boot. this is my first time trying one and i couldnt be more pleased (i did some research on makeupalley.com to see where to start).</li>
            <li> This is light coverage, but does a great job of evening out the skin.  This one has more of a yellow undertone, as opposed to the grey and pink in some of the other Skin 79 BB creams.  I ordered one of the mini sets, and use the Pearl BB cream with this.  I just opened this up and added the whole litte tube to my full size Oriental Gold.  I use this every morning, one pump for my face and one pump for my neck and cleavege area.  I cant tell if there has been any \\&quot;skin lightening\\&quot; but it looks nice and I dont have any trouble with my extremely dry skin soaking it up, or ending up migrating to make dry patches look even worse.  I like this best under a foundation,  when I have time to do both.  I will order again, and cant wait to try the snail BB cream for more mature skin.</li>
            <li> This Is an amazing cream, moisturizing and great cover. Makes skin look dewy but a little foundation powder fixes that. Makes skin look flawless! The tint cream looks cute on the lips. I have slightly dry pale skin and it covers it all acne and blemishes.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream.  My skin is fair and dry in the winter, so it is perfect.  I love the cheek and lip tint as well--a nice bonus and handy too!</li>
            <li> I had been using an inexpensive drugstore bb cream, but wanted to try one with more coverage. Oriental Gold BB Cream does provide very good coverage, but it is so pale that if I don&#x27;t use something over it, I look really sickly. I saw reviews that said this was a problem, but I have light skin (I usually use the lightest or next-lightest makeup offered by a cosmetic line) so I didn&#x27;t think this would be a problem.  I was wrong.  It&#x27;s too bad, because I really like it, but I hate trying to apply another product over it.  It&#x27;s hard to get even, un-blotchy coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it to anyone without the fairest possible skin.</li>
            <li> Flawless coverage.  Hides redness and makes skin look baby smooth.  The best BB cream.  I won&#x27;t use any other BB cream except skin 79</li>
            <li> Finally found it! I have tried many BB creams that I like (Dr. Jart, Missha, etc.) but here is the one I love! I find myself reaching for it instead of any other almost every day. My friend wishes she could get the lip/cheek color alone as the color is so perfect for her. It is a fun bonus for me. Next time I may try the tube instead of this container. Either way I will repurchase only from this vendor. Too many fakes out there. I will definitely shop at Seoulglamour again. Faster-than-expected and authentic products with a great selection at fair U.S. prices.</li>
            <li> the cream is too stick to put on my face and it hard to make it evenly. I am not recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> I love it! It gives my face a natural glow, yet it covers my under eye circles and my pores very well.&lt;br /&gt;I only pay I think $10 for it, (which is the lowest price I have ever paid for a B.B. Cream) so it&#x27;s a steal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; light for my skin tone (I am a light to medium beige tone) but it&#x27;s workable, it&#x27;s not a very noticeable difference between my neck and my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know I guess it just wasn&#x27;t right for me, makes my face dried outcan&#x27;t really give an interview because everybody is different</li>
            <li> I like cheek tint part, but never use bottom part. hope they could sell seperately</li>
            <li> Covers up nicely but I have a slightly darker skin tone so too much makes me look washed out or gray. It needs more tone choices.</li>
            <li> This bb cream is skin tone color, which is different than other Korean bb cream.  But it just doesn&#x27;t blend well at all.  It tends to sit on top of the skin and looks cakey.  I like the top cheek color.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th bb cream and I like it a lot. Smooth finish, easy application and it finally achieves the legendary &amp;#34;dewiness&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve heard about BB creams. (I have dry skin and usually, I don&#x27;t have any problems with oiliness. On the contrary, I often have difficulty with flaking and my bb creams not going on smoothly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problems with skin color matching. Very nice brightening effect. Easy dispenser. And the cheek stain is really nice and creamy. Love the color.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and blue-eyed and this works great with my skin tone, which I was concerned it might not. It&#x27;s a thinner texture than I anticipated, almost runny, but once you pat it into your skin it leaves a light, cooling, dewy finish that makes you look like a brighter toned, somewhat airbrushed version of your natural self. The cheek stain that comes with it would be pretty subtle on anyone much darker skinned than me, FYI.</li>
            <li> First let me say the vendor was very good.  Package was triple sealed, in pristine condition, and arrived as promised, nice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, BB Cream...........  all the hoopla got me excited to try this stuff even though I hate foundation.  Unfortunately, I am not lucky to have naturally beautiful skin so I thought I could fake it easily given all the rave reviews for Korean BB Cream.  For those of you who don&#x27;t know, these creams mostly come in only one shade, and nearly all of them are too light!  This too, is fairly light.  There are claims that they will \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; to your skintone......... hmmm, auto adjusting color?  Don&#x27;t believe it, they don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is simply a moisturizing foundation that provides light coverage with added sunscreen and botanicals.  Nothing wrong with that, as long as you&#x27;re not expecting more.  Packaging is nice, comes with pink blusher which I use occasionally.</li>
            <li> Great for light coverage.  Very hydrating and moisturizing.  No need for a moisturizer with this product. Definitely have to cover with a finishing powder so that your face isn&#x27;t so shiny.</li>
            <li> I have medium tone skin. The cream blends well, but just isn&#x27;t dark enough. The circles under my eyes even look worse. As a base with darker foundation over it works well, although I kind of felt like my pores were clogged. The pink gloss is cute for a light lip color. I like the Garnier BB cream way better.</li>
            <li> I like the BB cream, this one is nice but I don&#x27;t see anything special about it more than the other brands out there.  However it&#x27;s lighter and I think it does have more lightener in it.  My skin seem lighter after using it.  I do like the pint lip tint which I use for cheeks as well.  It&#x27;s a light natural pink for someone fair.</li>
            <li> Love the cheek tint, but bb cream is just ok.  Would buy the cheek tint if it was sold on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> No me ha gustado mucgo, es probable que tuviera las expectativas muy altas, lo que pasa es que me saco granitos al parecer es muy grasosa y eso no me gusto ademas que la piel me brilla mucho, el labial tiene un sabor medio raro</li>
            <li> Great product.  Very light feeling, not greasy. Natural looking.  I love the lip/cheek tint.  Received quickly and the price is great too.  The  shade is a little light.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this cream without a moisturizer to see if it would dry out my skin. I have dry skin with semi-oily T-zone. It went on beautifully and my skin stayed moisturized and never tight. My skin took on a nice glow and became instantly soft. I&#x27;ve tried the VIP gold, Garnier and Youth code BBs, as well as, high end $45 foundations. This one is by far the best. It offers more coverage than the VIP Gold. The blush adds a nice touch and it&#x27;s not drying like powder blushes. Fine lines seemed to disappear. Absolutely love it. I finally found my perfect BB cream.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about BB creams and after conducting extensive research, decided on Skin79&#x27;s The Oriental Gold BB Cream. I am so glad I splurged and purchased this. Build-able coverage, flawless finish and skin-illuminating - this cream has it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin soft, plus, the product smells good. The added bonus of lip gloss/cheek tint was a pleasant surprise. It is a wonderful color on me. I will not be going back to traditional bases anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final thought, if you have oily skin, I would recommend using a translucent powder on top.</li>
            <li> I like this cream. It&#x27;s very different from the foundation I used before that got discontinued. I usually have a problem where make-up will get clumped in little parts of my skin where it&#x27;s dry and look gross and crusty. Ew. The cream doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick and moisturizing. I&#x27;m not used to that, but it doesn&#x27;t look bad. After 30 min, it didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin anymore, so I guess the lotion part soaked in. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of coverage. It evened my skin-tone a lot, but didn&#x27;t cover my freckles. That&#x27;s how I like it, but some people like more coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The tint was very good for my cheeks; it gave me a cute glow. It looked really bad on my lips, though. Too pink. That may be because it&#x27;s made in Korea for Korean women, and I&#x27;m European.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t seem to lighten my skin any, but that&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;m usually the lightest color in foundations, anyway, so no need to lighten. Maybe when it says that one of the features it has is whitening your skin, it means because of the sunscreen in it.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it isn&#x27;t completely amazingly better than anything else. No problems with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;You should really try this out if it sounds like you might like it. It&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li> I know people have been talking about the fake bb creams and what not so i was a little scared to purchase this item. But when it arrived i was 100% sure it was authentic. so dont be afraid to purchase this. As for the product itself, AMAZING! It makes my face look beautiful and glowy. Im also happy that you cant see my pores with it on, because that is usually a huge issue for me. I also love the little lip &amp; cheek tint on the lid, it makes me look very refreshed. Dont hesitate to buy this.</li>
            <li> My first full BB cream (I got a sample pack and liked this one the most) It&#x27;s dewy and smooth. I&#x27;ll probably get another bottle of this when I run out, but I feel like it&#x27;s going to last quite a while since you don&#x27;t really need much product.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dark complexion or tan.Este producto es muy bueno para tez triguena o canela no es par piel blanca el colorete me gusta mucho lo uso como lips</li>
            <li> Read the product description on the official website to get the details and decided this would be good for me.  The color is a little on the light side but still workable.  Don&#x27;t care for the Lip Tint as it dries up my lips and I seem to have some allergic reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BB cream is okay.  Given my skin tends toward the dry side, this BB cream gives a bit of shine to my face.  It&#x27;s pretty good, not too dramatic.  But my nose gets a tiny bit oily after a few hours of wearing this BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is still the Missha M Perfect BB Cream #23.  See my review on that BB cream here. http://www.amazon.com/review/RQAG8VGCI9L2M/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm</li>
            <li> I really like the blush part of this product but the make feels chalky and rough.  Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find out that this contained 3 parabens. As I have very sensitive skin I could not even use this product.</li>
