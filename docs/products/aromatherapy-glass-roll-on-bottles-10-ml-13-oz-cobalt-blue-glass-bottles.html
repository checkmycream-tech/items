            <li>This is a great idea, but only three of the six lids screwed on straight.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>The cobalt blue is lovely and the bottles were easy to fill.</li>
            <li>, will definately recommend for your own personal fragrance oils, lip treatments or whatever.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many, many of these from other sources, and have never had any of these issues.</li>
            <li>The bottles are pretty and they hold a lot of oils.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using them for my essential oil dilutions.</li>
            <li>The first, I used some tea tree, lavender and fractionated coconut oil in.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a higher quality product, but they fulfilled the purpose for witch I ordered them.</li>
            <li>These rollers work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I tried another roller top thinking maybe the one was simply defective.</li>
            <li>These are the first roller bottles I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>

            <li>Makes it so easy to roll on some of my essential oil creations without getting it on my hands!</li>
            <li>Great little bottles for my essential oil blends.</li>
            <li>One lid was very misshapen</li>
            <li>The lids don&#x27;t tighten very well once the roller is on.</li>
            <li>very satisfied...fast service</li>
            <li>A portion fell into the mixture, and I have had to throw the whole thing away.</li>
            <li>Its dispensed to fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Love the size, however two of the black caps would not screw on.</li>
            <li>Great little bottles for topical medical solutions like ones from compounded pharmacies.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to test a new product.</li>
            <li>So far no breakage or leakage!  </li>
            <li>The roller balls distribute evenly and they are pretty solid glass construction.</li>
            <li>the ones at that mass market natural foods store we all know!</li>
            <li>Pretty blue color!!!</li>
            <li>They are fairly easy to fill and the roller ball pops on without too much trouble.</li>
            <li>We use these with essential oils and they work very well.  </li>
            <li>So a second one went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>The lids don&#x27;t fit quite right and 2 came broken.  </li>
            <li>I will go back to my old sources, even though I have to pay shipping.</li>
            <li>I ordered two different types from this vendor and all arrived fine except one bottle was broken upon delivery.  </li>

            <li> I will go back to my old sources, even though I have to pay shipping.</li>
            <li> I ordered two different types from this vendor and all arrived fine except one bottle was broken upon delivery.  </li>
            <li> However, item came later than expected delivery time.</li>
            <li> The other three were crooked and therefore leaked in my bag.</li>
            <li> spend money on the better rollers;  the plastic ones do not roll well with the essential oils; consistency has to be weakened for the roller to be efficient. :(</li>
            <li> The bottles themselves are great, but the roller balls are terrible!</li>
            <li> One set was missing a roller ball, and after an email with the vendor, they sent one plus a couple extra in the mail.</li>
            <li> I put expensive Frankincense in a couple of them and after a few uses, the little roller ball falls right out and oil comes pouring out.  </li>
            <li> The lid is not evenly down on all sides.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed them leak at all, but I don&#x27;t lay them down either.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they get the job done!</li>
            <li> /&gt;they close tight and don&#x27;t leak!&lt;br</li>
            <li> for a few days.  </li>
            <li> have used them for a few days now and haven&#x27;t had any problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The roller balls fall out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Only a few of the roller balls actually roll making it very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> The rollers are stiff.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed, only 2 of the rollers actually worked.</li>
            <li> Mine won&#x27;t move at all, therefore making these useless for dispensing essential oils.</li>
            <li> Shipping was also very slow.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with these at all.</li>
            <li> Plastic roller not great</li>
            <li> They do not roll which makes them useless.  </li>
            <li> Sad about this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that three of my six bottles came broken.</li>
            <li> Very Frustrating!</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in these.</li>

            <li> These bottle were bigger than I wanted.  I returned them for dram size roll on bottles.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that three of my six bottles came broken.</li>
            <li> Not so good. The lids screw on crooked. The lid is not evenly down on all sides.</li>
            <li> So far no breakage or leakage!  Nice bottle!</li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to roll on some of my essential oil creations without getting it on my hands! The cobalt blue is lovely and the bottles were easy to fill. I bought my daughter a set for her to use with her oils!</li>
            <li> Roll on glass bottles are great! However, item came later than expected delivery time. Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> One lid was very misshapen and I could not use it. The others were usable but also misshaped.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I was looking for and is good quality.  Bottles do not leak! Awesome!  I ordered two different types from this vendor and all arrived fine except one bottle was broken upon delivery.  I haven&#x27;t been able to reach the company via phone which are the two reasons I&#x27;m only rating 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The lids don&#x27;t tighten very well once the roller is on. I would not recommend!</li>
            <li> Good price for holding oils.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t keep my roller bottles stored upright, the oil leaks out of the top. Other than that, they get the job done! Beautiful to look at, too.</li>
            <li> These work great!  The bottles are pretty and they hold a lot of oils.  Perfect for carrying in my purse.</li>
            <li> very satisfied...fast service</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with these. They are fairly easy to fill and the roller ball pops on without too much trouble. I have enjoyed using them for my essential oil dilutions. You do have to apply a bit of pressure for the ball to move and the oil to come out but I think it works well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful glass bottles, NICE sturdy, no broken bottles and shipped very well.  LOVE the color!  Stuff rolls out smooth and neat, will definately recommend for your own personal fragrance oils, lip treatments or whatever.  Super nice!</li>
            <li> Love the size, however two of the black caps would not screw on.</li>
            <li> We have purchased a few different roller ball bottles and really like how this one is constructed.  We use these with essential oils and they work very well.  The roller balls distribute evenly and they are pretty solid glass construction.</li>
            <li> The bottles are nice, but the rollerballs do not work. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have used these to make several essential oil mixes. 2 of the 6 have had issues with the plastic rollerball portion. The first, I used some tea tree, lavender and fractionated coconut oil in. It ate through the plastic where it joined the glass. A portion fell into the mixture, and I have had to throw the whole thing away. The 2nd on, the ball in the rollerball portion would not stay in. So a second one went straight into the trash. I have purchased many, many of these from other sources, and have never had any of these issues. I will go back to my old sources, even though I have to pay shipping. The quality is much better.</li>
            <li> Good for essential oils</li>
            <li> These worked great.....for a few days.  I put expensive Frankincense in a couple of them and after a few uses, the little roller ball falls right out and oil comes pouring out.  Not happy with these at all.</li>
            <li> Great Exactly what I wanted even better then the ones at that mass market natural foods store we all know!</li>
            <li> Plastic roller not great</li>
            <li> Just want I needed for a project.</li>
            <li> spend money on the better rollers;  the plastic ones do not roll well with the essential oils; consistency has to be weakened for the roller to be efficient. :(</li>
            <li> very satisfied with these roll on glass bottles.&lt;br /&gt;easy to assemble after filled.</li>
            <li> Nice glass bottles. Pretty blue color!!! Love!</li>
            <li> Very nice bottles.  Color was great and arrived as told</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, but only three of the six lids screwed on straight.  The other three were crooked and therefore leaked in my bag.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a higher quality product, but they fulfilled the purpose for witch I ordered them.</li>
            <li> Its dispensed to fast.</li>
            <li> i use these for my essential oils and they work great.</li>
            <li> I like the bottles but the caps don&#x27;t screw on all the way</li>
            <li> The bottles and kids are fine but the roller ball just doesn&#x27;t roll easily.  I bought these for essential oil mixtures and the ball won&#x27;t roll enough to apply the oil as needed.  Very disappointing quality.</li>
            <li> Balls do not roll smoothly!</li>
            <li> Bottles are great but the plastic roll tops don&#x27;t work.  They do not roll which makes them useless.  Shipping was also very slow.  Plant Therapy has metal ball roller tops you can buy on their website.  Guess I should have just ordered from them.  Very Frustrating!</li>
            <li> These rollers work pretty well.  They take a while to start rolling the oil out at first, but then seem to work just fine.  No leakage.</li>
            <li> Good product, will buy again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE!! I do wish that the roller ball topper was either glass or stainless steel, but these are still great. I am going to order more as soon as I use all these.</li>
            <li> the lids or the bottles themselves were warped or something. None of my lids screwed on well. Sad about this purchase.</li>
            <li> They were just the way they are supposed to. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Beautiful blue bottles but the roller balls are cheap and don&#x27;t roll worth a lick. I have to take the roller balls off just to use my oil would not buy these again</li>
            <li> Works well and it&#x27;s pretty! I put jojoba and essential oils in it and haven&#x27;t had a problem with leaking. Would recommend and/or buy again.</li>
            <li> oils just pour out of them-</li>
            <li> Perfect for all your rollers!!!  If you are into essential oils, you will love these!!</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like the plastic roller.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed, only 2 of the rollers actually worked. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to test a new product. I didn&#x27;t want to place an order for a case if the product didn&#x27;t go over. Great quality, the color matches my other products and easy to assemble. These bottles are for synergy blends, not for use with undiluted essential oils. Many essential oils will eat through certain types of plastic, unless it is PET. Never apply essential oils undiluted to skin.</li>
            <li> Great lil rollers. The ball has fallen out of one of the six but no big deal !</li>
            <li> These all showed up in tact, and work well. I have not had any issues with shattering or leaking. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many sets of roller bottles from this seller, all perfect.</li>
            <li> Bottles are great, every once in a while I get a roller ball that doesn&#x27;t glide.. Yes I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in these. I made up an essential oil blend this morning and the ball does not roll. I tried another roller top thinking maybe the one was simply defective. No go. I do not recommend these rollers.</li>
            <li> Fast ship and great bottles!!!! will reorder!</li>
            <li> Threels of them don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, and work nicely!</li>
            <li> The bottles themselves are great, but the roller balls are terrible! Mine won&#x27;t move at all, therefore making these useless for dispensing essential oils. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are the first roller bottles I&#x27;ve ever purchased but I&#x27;ve been pleased with them.</li>
            <li> these are good quality roll on bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used them for a few days now and haven&#x27;t had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;they close tight and don&#x27;t leak!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the roller works very well!</li>
            <li> The roller balls fall out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Seller.  Love these roller balls.  They don&#x27;t leak and worked perfect for our oil blends.</li>
            <li> These bottles are great for Doterra oil blending.</li>
            <li> The lids don&#x27;t fit quite right and 2 came broken.  I haven&#x27;t noticed them leak at all, but I don&#x27;t lay them down either.</li>
            <li> These roll on bottles are performing nicely.  I put essential oils diluted with carrier oil or aloe vera gel in them.</li>
            <li> The rollers are stiff. Not what I was anticipating.</li>
            <li> Roller Balls aren&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li> Only a few of the roller balls actually roll making it very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> The rollers stick. Should have gotten metal ones.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, work peefectky</li>
            <li> these are great for creating essential oil blends. Easy to fill and refill. Rollers work great. I have 3 sets of these. Good value.  One set was missing a roller ball, and after an email with the vendor, they sent one plus a couple extra in the mail. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Some of the rollers don&#x27;t move smoothly</li>
            <li> Received item very quickly. Great little bottles for topical medical solutions like ones from compounded pharmacies. I also carry skin and hair oils in them for air travel. Sturdy glass. I wish they came in a 3.5 fl oz size also.</li>
            <li> Great bottles to fill with anointing oil. Love the color!</li>
            <li> Very nice and leakproof bottles, albeit next time I think I will buy the metal roller balls as they glide smoother, but for the price these work very nicely.</li>
            <li> great quality and super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I wish the roller balls rolled more easily. But the price was good. I am on the fence on whether I would purchase these again or not. Loved the blue bottle.</li>
            <li> These are great. All the roller balls work fine. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great little bottles for my essential oil blends. Will definitely re-order!</li>
