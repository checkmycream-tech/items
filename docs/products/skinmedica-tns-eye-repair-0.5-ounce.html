            <li> Good product, recommended by my aesthetician.  Really diminishes fine lines, wrinkles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> An excellent product for mature skin. I would recommend this product to people who have had any cosmetic eye treatment. It creates a smooth and refreshed apperance under the eye after consisitent use.</li>
            <li> i like this cream, not as well as skin ceuticals eye cream. You only need to use a tiny bit and you can wear it under primer and your makeup wont smear. I can buy it at costco with a coupon cheaper than i can buy it at amazon which was a surprise.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. With  all the choices we have out there this is well worth the money a little goes a long way. All their products are amazing.</li>
            <li> love this product got it from my dermatologist spa for double the price, it works great, i would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> shipping on time and the product works fine for me</li>
            <li> Although it did not perform all of its claims for me, it is a really good non-greasy eye cream, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and continue to love it. My dermatologist still only recommends this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this eye cream. Do what ever you can to keep those lines away from the eyes! Expensive but just a dab is all you need.</li>
            <li> The product did nothing to improve my skin. In fact, it made my skin more crepey and the lines more visible. After finding out what the \\&quot;active ingredient\\&quot; actually is, I was creeped out and had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this product again as it balls up on the skin and you have to wash it off and use another product in order to leave the house.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite night time eye cream...I know you can use it for daytime also but I just use at night. Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything really outstanding with this product. The price is a little high so I have opt to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for 6 month or so and it really works for me. It is worth the extra money</li>
            <li> This does what it says it will do. I noticed an immediate difference from not using anything at all. Great under eye makeup.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I have used.  It really helps eleminate the wrinkles.  And the cream makes your face feel so soft.  I will continue to use it until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> Love the thickness and richness ,as well as ,the anti aging effects.</li>
