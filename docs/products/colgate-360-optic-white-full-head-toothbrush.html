            <li>I would welcome the implementation of the 360 design in a head for my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Good brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There were two shortcomings that make this still a good brush, but not for me.</li>
            <li>think manual toothbrushes are a good adjunct to powered toothbrushes</li>
            <li>I feel that I don&#x27;t get good contact with my teeth in a lot of areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with what it&#x27;s capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My tongue felt great after using it, not scraped, simply clean.</li>
            <li>I was expecting too much from it, but it is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have healthy gums, I don&#x27;t have gingivitis</li>
            <li>I mostly like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is softer than most.</li>
            <li>I feel like I could get better brushing if I had more room to maneuver.</li>
            <li>What I like most about these Colgate toothbrushes is the ergonomics:</li>
            <li>Love that.</li>
            <li>Ergonomically, she likes it better than the one she was using.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other cultures promote tongue cleaning much more than do Americans</li>
            <li>The big seller for me was when I went to the dentist after switching to this brush, and she said it was the best cleaning I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>It has a variety of configurations, shapes, and sizes for the bristles, which makes for better cleaning.</li>
            <li>best feature of the 360 is its innovative use of a rubberized surface with an array of bumps on the back of the brush head.</li>
            <li>My gums love this</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush for years has been the [[ASIN:B003UZTF9E</li>
            <li>The back of the toothbrush has a tongue scrubber that works great as well!</li>
            <li>The quality is top notch</li>
            <li>I bought this tooth brush because it looked like it could be pretty good at cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li>you can handle the stimulation, I recommend the 360 Total Advanced as the best of the line.th this brush.  </li>
            <li>you can handle the stimulation, I recommend the 360 Total Advanced as the best of the line.</li>
            <li>The new Colgate 360 toothbrush has some very nice features.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personal preference plays a role in which toothbrush design is most comfortable for you.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice item just what i was looking for I will buy more of these when needed Thanks</li>
            <li>He feels he can easily maneuver it around his mouth and have it reach all areas well.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush worked just fine for the two weeks we were on vacation.</li>
            <li>The head is huge and the brush is cupped to hold plenty of whitening Colgate toothpaste.</li>
            <li>a handle contoured to fit your hand with sticky gel pads on the thumb and index finger parts.</li>
            <li>The brush is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>because I like the thicker handle, the comfortable bristles, and the clean feeling that I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a gimmick, and I&#x27;d prefer the brush without the cups.  </li>
            <li>also has a nice handle that is easy to grip,  soft bristles that clean my teeth and gums but do not hurt my gums and a tongue and cheek cleaner</li>
            <li>unique part of this tooth brush is the whitening cups and polishing bristles.  </li>
            <li>But for really clean, plaque retardant clean, I go with the medium.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works well and gets the teeth and mouth clean.</li>
            <li>I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  </li>
            <li>All of the toothbrushes in the Colgate 360 line will effectively clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>The feel is wonderful and you really get the idea that the toothbrush is covering a wide range of your mouth.</li>
            <li>The design is good for reaching back teeth.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice curved ergonomic handle with a soft non-slip grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a standard toothbrush, this is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Medium bristles are fine for younger people with healthy gums but the dentists I work with never recommend</li>
            <li>, it looked more advanced essentially.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about this toothbrush is the built-in tongue cleaner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a nice toothbrush that I wouldn&#x27;t talk anyone out of trying, but I also recommend the Oral-B that I linked above.</li>
            <li>However, the Colgate 360 Optic Full toothbrush is soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;whitening cups\\&quot; are not very stiff and feel soft to me, which is great because I have sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>So far the bristles on this head have held their place much longer than most.  </li>
            <li>After my first use with the tooth brush (A full 1 minute 30 seconds of brushing) the gums above my top front teeth started to tingle and become very irritated, I used my mouthwash afterwards and holy hell did it sting and hurt.</li>
            <li>The tongue and mouth cleaner is pretty neat too.  </li>
            <li>so the textured back of the brush was an innovative way to introduce the process to our masses.  </li>
            <li>The Colgate 360 Optic white brush holds the toothpaste on my brush longer with the whitening cups for a more even tooth paste distribution.</li>
            <li>A patent cited on the package, US 6,658,688, says in the abstract, &amp;#34;In accordance with further embodiments of the invention, the one or more squeegees and bristles are coupled to a motorized handle and can be configured for cleaning teeth and gums.&amp;#34; I would like to see that in a product.</li>
            <li>The bristles do a good job of cleaning; the round &amp;#34;whitening cups&amp;#34; design doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li>Some people prefer smaller, shorter heads because it enables them to more easily get to back teeth while others find the larger, longer heads cover more ground when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer the one with a smaller head, but this is a good one for people with larger teeth.</li>
            <li>textured gel pad was a nice touch because it makes the brush easier to hold, particularly when wet and sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First the little paste cups kind of squeak.</li>
            <li>For the big clean on the road when traveling, this mega brush is just right.</li>
            <li>The circles are concave, and with the large difference in bristle lengths</li>
            <li>Had to double check that I got the right stiffness bristle, but after the first brush it softened right up.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush for the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, and unlike some recent brushes I have tried, this brush also feels comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>Maybe they should advertise it as the High Maintenance User Brush!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like how the bristles of this toothbrush contour to my teeth.</li>
            <li>The 360 bristles really work and get every inch of your teeth.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush gets along the gum line and has worked better than other brands I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Both clean equally well</li>
            <li>Especially designed for removing stubborn stains, the special cups that are a feature of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The brush handle is slightly curved with gel pads placed at the gripping position.</li>
            <li>Quickly cleans the gums and teeth and everything else because it is so big.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush also did an adequate job of brushing (I got two different brushes to try).</li>
            <li>I didn’t perceive the polishing cups to be particularly useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn’t perceive the polishing cups to be particularly useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a soft brush for your teeth, you will likely enjoy this one.</li>
            <li>The overall brushing effect is fairly soft, although not quite as comfortable to me as the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a high maintenance one, and loves this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>B006ZET0S8 Colgate 360 Optic White Full Head Toothbrush, Soft]</li>
            <li>toothbrush also has a nice thick handle that I like.  </li>
            <li>I will not ever purchase this type of Colgate toothbrush again, other colgate brushes are fine.</li>
            <li>I feel like it does an adequate job of cleaning my teeth without having to go over the same area as many times due to its larger design.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new inexpensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The bristles on that cleaner are pretty low profile and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has numerous different shapes and levels of bristles, and feels like it gets the mouth clean.  </li>
            <li>I actually like the large size of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but the powered one is easier for most people to use, help protect teeth from brushing too hard, and you tend to brush longer with the powered ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even before my pain &amp; swelling I&#x27;ve always had sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>, you have the Basic, the Sensitive with softer bristles, the Optic White with whitening cups and polishing bristles, and the Total Advanced which has longer bristles for a deeper reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they don’t really look that different.</li>
            <li>but they don’t really look that different.</li>
            <li>] hold the toothpaste while soft bristles polish</li>
            <li>the back is a raised scraper for gentle cleaning of your tongue and cheeks.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job without feeling too scratchy or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>So for anyone who has sensitive gums in general this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li>There are also plastic bits in the head, which are apparently the whitening cups, meant to hold toothpaste and aid whitening.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an odd feeling at first, but one I&#x27;ve come to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how stimulating it felt to have the sides of my mouth brushed at the same time as my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how stimulating it felt to have the sides of my mouth brushed at the same time as my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First brush was awfully stiff.</li>
            <li>There was much less plaque which meant she didn&#x27;t have to do as much scraping.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint, again, is how quickly the brush wore out/down.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because the points of the bristles are so fine and stiff that they act like little needles.</li>

            <li> First brush was awfully stiff. Had to double check that I got the right stiffness bristle, but after the first brush it softened right up. Great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I have pain &amp; swelling in my gums. It is being resolved. However, the Colgate 360 Optic Full toothbrush is soft &amp; smooth. Good brush. Even before my pain &amp; swelling I&#x27;ve always had sensitive gums. So for anyone who has sensitive gums in general this is the brush for you. I&#x27;m a happy customer. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But for really clean, plaque retardant clean, I go with the medium. For the big clean on the road when traveling, this mega brush is just right. The head is huge and the brush is cupped to hold plenty of whitening Colgate toothpaste. The medium bristles are perfect because you don&#x27;t have to exert a lot of pressure. Quickly cleans the gums and teeth and everything else because it is so big. I use Colgate toothpaste to whiten, it is the only brand for our family for the last 100 years.</li>
            <li> I actually like the large size of this toothbrush. I feel like it does an adequate job of cleaning my teeth without having to go over the same area as many times due to its larger design. I understand this design is not for everyone but I really like it. Great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased as a 5th item for my subscribe and save. I was expecting too much from it, but it is a great toothbrush. The toothbrush&#x27;s bristles do cover my teeth while brushing. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have healthy gums, I don&#x27;t have gingivitis and I have fairly white teeth as it is. I bought this tooth brush because it looked like it could be pretty good at cleaning my teeth, it looked more advanced essentially. After my first use with the tooth brush (A full 1 minute 30 seconds of brushing) the gums above my top front teeth started to tingle and become very irritated, I used my mouthwash afterwards and holy hell did it sting and hurt. I looked at them and they were turning white like a layer of my gums had been removed ! I&#x27;ve been using tons of other toothbrushes and NEVER have I EVER had this issue, no matter how hard I&#x27;ve brushed with them. I think it&#x27;s because the points of the bristles are so fine and stiff that they act like little needles. Either way, the second day now I decided to use my old tooth brush and my gums were still raw and in pain, I couldn&#x27;t even brush them, so I&#x27;m gonna go a day or 2  without brushing and only using mouthwash, floss and whitening strips to give them time to heal. I will not ever purchase this type of Colgate toothbrush again, other colgate brushes are fine. I advise if you also have this type of pain please let others know in the comments below.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews of people having this same issue.</li>
            <li> This is a nice item just what i was looking for I will buy more of these when needed Thanks</li>
            <li> I mostly like this toothbrush. It is softer than most. The design is good for reaching back teeth. It left my teeth feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were two shortcomings that make this still a good brush, but not for me. First the little paste cups kind of squeak. I know that sounds super weird and nitpicky. But little odd noises are my kryptonite. Second, the head is big and it gets crowded in the back of teeth. I feel like I could get better brushing if I had more room to maneuver.</li>
            <li> What I like most about these Colgate toothbrushes is the ergonomics: a handle contoured to fit your hand with sticky gel pads on the thumb and index finger parts. I prefer the one with a smaller head, but this is a good one for people with larger teeth. The bristles do a good job of cleaning; the round &amp;#34;whitening cups&amp;#34; design doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how my husband does it but every brush he uses ends up with bristles going every which way.  So far the bristles on this head have held their place much longer than most.  He feels he can easily maneuver it around his mouth and have it reach all areas well.</li>
            <li> As a standard toothbrush, this is pretty good.  It has numerous different shapes and levels of bristles, and feels like it gets the mouth clean.  There are also plastic bits in the head, which are apparently the whitening cups, meant to hold toothpaste and aid whitening.  I have noticed no whitening effects at all.  I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a gimmick, and I&#x27;d prefer the brush without the cups.  Otherwise, it works well and gets the teeth and mouth clean.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush also did an adequate job of brushing (I got two different brushes to try). The price is reasonable, and unlike some recent brushes I have tried, this brush also feels comfortable in my hand. My tongue felt great after using it, not scraped, simply clean. Love that. My only complaint, again, is how quickly the brush wore out/down.</li>
            <li> Buy this toothbrush all the time, I like them the best</li>
            <li> This is really a great toothbrush.  My daughter uses whiteners, and the extra whitening cup does make a difference to her.  The head is fairly large, so if you have a small mouth, it may not work for you.  Ergonomically, she likes it better than the one she was using.  The tongue and mouth cleaner is pretty neat too.  All the bells and whistles on this one.  She&#x27;s a high maintenance one, and loves this toothbrush.  Maybe they should advertise it as the High Maintenance User Brush!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush for the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> great tooth brush does the job well</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has  whitening cups and polishing bristles that help polish and whiten teeth as well.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a nice handle that is easy to grip,  soft bristles that clean my teeth and gums but do not hurt my gums and a tongue and cheek cleaner that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unique part of this tooth brush is the whitening cups and polishing bristles.  They look like little circles on the head of the toothbrush surrounded by larger bristles on the sides. When I take my time and focus on polishing it feels like my teeth are being polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get a tooth brush I look for a few things. I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy. Finally, I like toothbrushes that have tongue cleaners because there are times when I eat something like chocolate or yogurt or drink tea or coffee and my tongue and even gums feel like they could use a cleaning.  This toothbrush has all the things for which I am looking plus it has the polishing cups and bristles which seem to polish my teeth. I am pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> All of the toothbrushes in the Colgate 360 line will effectively clean your teeth.  Although Colgate has a number of studies to validate the effectiveness of the brushes (see their website), I failed to find evidence of the American Dental Association seal of approval.  Perhaps it is too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal preference plays a role in which toothbrush design is most comfortable for you.  Some people prefer smaller, shorter heads because it enables them to more easily get to back teeth while others find the larger, longer heads cover more ground when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentists typically recommend softer bristles because harder bristles can damage the gums with aggressive brushing.  Medium bristles are fine for younger people with healthy gums but the dentists I work with never recommend hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think manual toothbrushes are a good adjunct to powered toothbrushes but I prefer powered ones for daily use.  I use the manual ones at work and when traveling.  Both clean equally well but the powered one is easier for most people to use, help protect teeth from brushing too hard, and you tend to brush longer with the powered ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other cultures promote tongue cleaning much more than do Americans so the textured back of the brush was an innovative way to introduce the process to our masses.  Tongue cleaning reportedly reduces bad breath and reduces bacteria known to contribute to periodontal problems, tooth decay, gum infection, gum recession, and tooth loss (Wikipedia). I have now added it to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The textured gel pad was a nice touch because it makes the brush easier to hold, particularly when wet and sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the four designs from this line that I tried, you have the Basic, the Sensitive with softer bristles, the Optic White with whitening cups and polishing bristles, and the Total Advanced which has longer bristles for a deeper reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Colgate has made big jump forward in brush design with this brush.  I was surprised at how stimulating it felt to have the sides of my mouth brushed at the same time as my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it’s unreasonable to expect to see whitening after short term use with this brush.  Even after getting my teeth cleaned and polished at the dentist’s, my teeth feel cleaner for awhile but they don’t really look that different. I didn’t perceive the polishing cups to be particularly useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can handle the stimulation, I recommend the 360 Total Advanced as the best of the line.th this brush.  I was surprised at how stimulating it felt to have the sides of my mouth brushed at the same time as my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it’s unreasonable to expect to see whitening after short term use with this brush.

I didn’t perceive the polishing cups to be particularly useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can handle the stimulation, I recommend the 360 Total Advanced as the best of the line.</li>
            <li> There are a wide variety of toothbrushes that make various claims about their ability to whiten teeth. The Colgate 360 Optic white brush holds the toothpaste on my brush longer with the whitening cups for a more even tooth paste distribution. The brush handle is slightly curved with gel pads placed at the gripping position. The brush is comfortable to hold. I recommend trying Colgate Optic white brush it is a great value at under 3 dollars.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush gets along the gum line and has worked better than other brands I&#x27;ve used.  The big seller for me was when I went to the dentist after switching to this brush, and she said it was the best cleaning I&#x27;ve had.  There was much less plaque which meant she didn&#x27;t have to do as much scraping.  I didn&#x27;t tell her I had switched brushes, she asked me what was I doing differently.</li>
            <li> Especially designed for removing stubborn stains, the special cups that are a feature of the [[ASIN:B006ZET0S8 Colgate 360 Optic White Full Head Toothbrush, Soft]] hold the toothpaste while soft bristles polish your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE - Experts say that you should change out your toothbrush every three months whether it appears to need it or not - and also after you&#x27;ve had a cold, the flu or a strep infection.  Germs can hide in those bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like how the bristles of this toothbrush contour to my teeth. The circles are concave, and with the large difference in bristle lengths I feel that I don&#x27;t get good contact with my teeth in a lot of areas. The only thing I liked about this toothbrush is the built-in tongue cleaner. It does a good job without feeling too scratchy or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The new Colgate 360 toothbrush has some very nice features. It has a variety of configurations, shapes, and sizes for the bristles, which makes for better cleaning. It also has a nice curved ergonomic handle with a soft non-slip grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature of the 360 is its innovative use of a rubberized surface with an array of bumps on the back of the brush head. This provides for cleaning of your cheeks and tongue while you brush your teeth. This happens without any extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I use an electric toothbrush. I would welcome the implementation of the 360 design in a head for my electric toothbrush. A patent cited on the package, US 6,658,688, says in the abstract, &amp;#34;In accordance with further embodiments of the invention, the one or more squeegees and bristles are coupled to a motorized handle and can be configured for cleaning teeth and gums.&amp;#34; I would like to see that in a product.</li>
            <li> I tend to favor medium toothbrushes but I wanted to give this one a try. The feel is wonderful and you really get the idea that the toothbrush is covering a wide range of your mouth. My gums love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the reason I prefer medium toothbrushes has to do with longevity. But this toothbrush has held us for quite a while. I&#x27;m impressed with what it&#x27;s capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a soft brush for your teeth, you will likely enjoy this one. I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I use an electric toothbrush in the mornings, but I use a manual brush at work after lunch and in the evenings at home.  My favorite brush for years has been the [[ASIN:B003UZTF9E Oral-B Pro-Health All-In-One Toothbrush]] because I like the thicker handle, the comfortable bristles, and the clean feeling that I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush also has a nice thick handle that I like.  The \\&quot;whitening cups\\&quot; are not very stiff and feel soft to me, which is great because I have sensitive gums.  The overall brushing effect is fairly soft, although not quite as comfortable to me as the Oral-B.  The cheek and gum cleaner (a rougher patch on the back of the brush head) isn&#x27;t too extreme and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  The bristles on that cleaner are pretty low profile and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice toothbrush that I wouldn&#x27;t talk anyone out of trying, but I also recommend the Oral-B that I linked above.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very different than any I&#x27;ve used before.  It has \\&quot;cups\\&quot; down the center, surrounded by longer bristles.  When you use it, the cups brush your teeth and the bristles brush your gums.  It&#x27;s an odd feeling at first, but one I&#x27;ve come to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the back is a raised scraper for gentle cleaning of your tongue and cheeks.  While I&#x27;ve never felt a need to brush my cheeks, I like to brush my tongue, so it&#x27;s a nifty feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this wears out, I&#x27;ll be getting another one.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush worked just fine for the two weeks we were on vacation. We still prefer electric toothbrushes at home, but for short term use or if you prefer manual / disposable brushes, I don&#x27;t see any reason not to recommend this one.</li>
            <li> One of the best toothbrushes you can buy for your money. The 360 bristles really work and get every inch of your teeth. The head of the toothbrush has multiple bristles on it for all around reach. The back of the toothbrush has a tongue scrubber that works great as well! The quality is top notch and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new inexpensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush out there. Buying on Amazon also has the added bonus of avoiding physically going to the grocery store.</li>
