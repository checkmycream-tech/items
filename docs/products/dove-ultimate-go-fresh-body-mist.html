            <li>I love Dove body sprays.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this light scent, so glad Amazon can find it for me since not in stores</li>
            <li>There are several fragrances available, and Amazon always seems to have great sellers that stock them....</li>
            <li>Pictured is the item in the original packaging.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m allergic to it, which I wasn&#x27;t to the original.</li>
            <li>People comment on how nice the smell is when I get near them and ask me about what I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>I am not big on perfume but at the same time, I just want to spray something that makes me feel fresh and light and the dove series are just the best mist for me.</li>
            <li>This fragrance while not entirely unpleasant is not at all like the original which was light and crisp.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on after I have dressed and it gives me a fresh, clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>and I can sometimes go through body sprays and mists relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>If you want a quick burst of freshness, this is for you.</li>
            <li>This body mist is really fresh and super light exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>There is a bottle of Dove Go Fresh Body Mist in my purse, one in my car console, another on my perfume tray.</li>
            <li>so am very sensitive to strong scents.</li>
            <li>This body mist smells so good, it is light fresh and last all day long.</li>
            <li>These are much nicer and have a more natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is light, yet extremely fragrant, unlike most fragrances and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This is a much heavier, perfumy fragance.  </li>
            <li>After purchasing this DOVE scent for several years at my local drugstore I was thrilled to find at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Pictured here is the original, smells like an orange product, which was terrific.</li>
            <li>smells like any body spray, nothing too strong, not too flashy, nice flowery fruity smell.</li>
            <li>Good, complex fragrances for a fraction of what I was paying for the big name products.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very sensitive to heat.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This body mist is not the same as the scent I had before, and it was the same exact title.</li>
            <li>What I got was the revamped product, which has a completely different smell, and is like every other cheap imitation perfume.</li>

            <li> This body mist is not the same as the scent I had before, and it was the same exact title.</li>
            <li> The smell of nectarines is beautifully recreated in this body mist. The scent Is lasting enough to spray only have to spray once, but is in no way too pugnent.I have gotten nothing but compliments wearing this.I think I&#x27;ll have this in bulk the next time as the size is small and I can sometimes go through body sprays and mists relatively quickly.This is the best scent (to me)in the line and the best body spray I have used in years.If you want a quick burst of freshness, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I love this spray and I get so many compliments from guys telling me how good I smell! Great buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping to get a nice supply since the Burst fragrance was discontinued.  Pictured is the item in the original packaging.  What was received was the rebranded package (square bottle).  This fragrance while not entirely unpleasant is not at all like the original which was light and crisp.  This is a much heavier, perfumy fragance.  Returning.</li>

            <li> Everyone asks me what I have on!</li>
            <li> This body mist smells so good, it is light fresh and last all day long. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This body mist is really fresh and super light exactly what I was looking for. I am not big on perfume but at the same time, I just want to spray something that makes me feel fresh and light and the dove series are just the best mist for me. I used to use the victoria secret ones but the alcohol smell is just too over powering and smells cheap. These are much nicer and have a more natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this light scent, so glad Amazon can find it for me since not in stores</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go too&amp;#34; after bath body mist. I use the Dove Burst bath soap so this just makes it last longer. People comment on how nice the smell is when I get near them and ask me about what I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> smells like any body spray, nothing too strong, not too flashy, nice flowery fruity smell. Doesn&#x27;t smell like candy but doesn&#x27;t smell too flowery. nice too keep off the stench</li>
            <li> This fragrence smelled horrible, it makes it difficult to breathe. May work for some people, I have Asthma so am very sensitive to strong scents.</li>
            <li> I received the body spray on time and omg i love the smell!! It immediately brought me into a summer time trans .. Will be purchasing again.. Thanx!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Too bad it&#x27;s not sold in stores near me</li>
            <li> I love Dove body sprays. its a nice way to freshen up quickly or give a nice scent after a shower. i like this scent and I have the matching deodorant as well that I use.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it online because I could no longer find it in the local stores.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s over 90 degrees out and I&#x27;m very sensitive to heat. I put this in my purse or car to spray on when I&#x27;m running errands, or when I&#x27;m feeling sweaty. Great clean scent!</li>
            <li> Once Upon a Time my favorite fragrances were Arpege, Shalimar, Channel and Donna Karan...$$$$$$! A fan of Dove&#x27;s products, thought I&#x27;d just try their Body Mists. Wow! Good, complex fragrances for a fraction of what I was paying for the big name products. There is a bottle of Dove Go Fresh Body Mist in my purse, one in my car console, another on my perfume tray. Keep one in your refrigerator for an extra freshen-up when you come inside from the yard! There are several fragrances available, and Amazon always seems to have great sellers that stock them....So, Go For It, Girlfriend!</li>
