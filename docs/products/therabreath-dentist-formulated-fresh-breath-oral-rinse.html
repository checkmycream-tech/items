            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that there is a better product than this!</li>
            <li>works great, STRONG mint flavor</li>
            <li>I liked them both, but this one ( the blue-ish bottle ) was more pleasant in my mouth than the green-ish bottle.</li>
            <li>Very good product and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Very good mouthwash, after fresh breath.</li>
            <li>Amazing...</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I now create my own a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Effective.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of a disaster.</li>
            <li>And I REALLY do think that this stuff works the best.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great and is so worth the money!</li>
            <li>Excellent have gone through 3 bottles and would highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li>easy to use and maintain a long-lasting good breath</li>
            <li>Very easy to gargle with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well, its got a very strong pepper mint taste.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and worth the higher-than-some price tag.</li>
            <li>by far best mouthwash</li>
            <li>This flavor is very refreshing and easy to gargle with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice, I can fell fresh when I used this.</li>
            <li>I have tried many others&#x27;, but this is the most effective.  </li>
            <li>Loved the taste and leave my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>This is a very strong mint flavor, which I do not like, and will be glad when I finish it.  </li>
            <li>I love using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love therabreath mouth rinse  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I was hoping this one would taste better.</li>
            <li>Have tried many brands</li>
            <li>I love this mouth wash.</li>
            <li>I feel confident about my breath now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad they came in a pack of 2!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do that two times a day (ok sometimes three on the way out the door to meet up with people).</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep your mouth hydrated with water</li>
            <li>The ingredients list seems to be notably different,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is really refreshing besides being soothing.  </li>
            <li>I love the packaging too, there is a lid and a drinking cup on the top instead of just filling up the lid.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>Overall a great product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they make this stuff so magical</li>
            <li>OK mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Once you have done that, you gargle with it for 1 minute in throat use more to rinse your mouth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased both flavors and I would have to say that each is very unique.</li>
            <li>Helps keep breath fresh longer!!</li>
            <li>If you follow their instruction to rinse with a cup of mouthwash and then gargle another cup of mouth wash, it will go kind of quickly.</li>
            <li>But love the original flavor better</li>
            <li>Icy mint is the best tasting of the flavors.</li>
            <li>I try to use it every morning to keep my mouth staying nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>Like this product; the mint is not too strong.  </li>
            <li>The original mint is much more mellow.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fine.</li>
            <li>I find this product effective, good tasting and refreshing, it is my preferred mouth wash over any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>BEST MOUTHWASH HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li>This is even better than the original super minty and still works like a dream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the free of chemicals</li>
            <li>And the price is cheap</li>
            <li>Been using the regular formula for years with great results.  </li>
            <li>But so far, so good</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I have great breath all day long.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling  wintery fresh!</li>
            <li>I originally was told about this product by my dentist who himself uses it all the time.</li>
            <li>mouthwash is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I prefer the original taste.</li>
            <li>I prefer it to the original flavor.</li>
            <li>, it makes my mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice deep cleaning with a refreshing taste</li>
            <li>clean rather than doing its job.</li>
            <li>It shows you how to clean your tongue for example, and to brush it.  </li>
            <li>Strong does not mean better.</li>
            <li>guess they are trying to win over the Listerine/Scope crowd, but for those of us who prefer more natural products, they could make the flavors consistent with natural flavors.</li>
            <li>In all, I love this product so much, but wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li>Cool minty taste.  </li>
            <li>while i can really say this is true or not (since i get them so infrequently), it&#x27;s given me more confidence that my mouth is super clean</li>
            <li>Absolute magic.  </li>
            <li>however, it&#x27;s way too sweet and a bit burning too.</li>
            <li>after a good brushing of the teeth, and a solid scrape of the tongue...</li>
            <li>And it is true, you will not have morning breath.</li>
            <li>I dont know how much of it is anything in the mouthwash or just the better hygeine you use, but it works.  </li>
            <li>Makes you mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>this stuff leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean without the harshness of alcohol.</li>
            <li>I would give the Mild Mint 5 stars, as a result.</li>
            <li>, the bottle color makes it look like some sort of drain opener or calcium/lime/rust remover, but Mild Mint is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I love this so much more than the big name brands in stores.</li>
            <li>This stuff is mild tasting and it works well.</li>
            <li>Noticed difference very first time.</li>
            <li>Something about it makes my mouth feel great without ruining my tastebuds for half the day.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash really works!!</li>
            <li>When your husband tells you &amp;#34;you&#x27;re way too pretty to have breath smell that bad&amp;#34; then something needs to be done and he has definately noticed a difference and so have I!</li>
            <li>Excellent mouth wash and very long lasting.</li>
            <li>I scrape my tongue clean first,  </li>
            <li>I love the mild mint, but the icy mint seems to cover up more.</li>
            <li>but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Even after a night of drinking and food, I wake up with fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>Did just what it says it does, worth the money</li>
            <li>There is not a burning sensation, and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>and it is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>This product does make the mouth feel fresh and over time I do see a difference.  </li>
            <li>Regular mouthwash never worked for me and I was thrilled I found this and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li>My breath stays fresh for hours.</li>
            <li>I have used Listerine for about 20-25 years (I&#x27;m 36), and this is my favorite mouthwash by far.</li>
            <li>Keeps my breath fresh without the burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>For me this blue bottle has the best mint flavor of the other varieties.</li>
            <li>The regular mild mint is much more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a great job in keeping my breath fresh for at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li>The Icy Mint (blue) is quite strong with a very strong kick which might be too strong for some.</li>
            <li>but this particular minty flavor is not as good the original green bottle.</li>
            <li>We like it very much.</li>
            <li>This product really works well!</li>
            <li>this really eliminates the symptoms!</li>
            <li>Best of all, you don&#x27;t have to put up with the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; that other products cause (due to the alcohol, I presume).</li>
            <li>I tried Icy Mint to see how I liked it in comparison</li>
            <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t really say it gives you fresh breath for over 12 hours though.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the mouth and keeps breath fresh</li>
            <li>much better than generic mouthwash for breath</li>
            <li>but this stuff leaves a lingering aftertaste in my mouth that I didn&#x27;t notice until the first night when I woke up and took a sip of water and thought something had died in my glass.</li>
            <li>but this is the first mouthwash I&#x27;ve used that makes me want to use another mouthwash to get the taste out of my mouth.</li>
            <li>The Green is mild yet equally effective.</li>
            <li>Really works well, as I use it in the morning right after brushing.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff, great bad breath fighter and mouthwash in one.</li>
            <li>i like the new icy mint flavor too, much better than the original.</li>
            <li>My favorite and will be buying as long as they still make it!</li>
            <li>I like to use it mixed with water because it is strong.</li>
            <li>I would recommend another flavor if you don&#x27;t want such a strong feel and taste.</li>
            <li>While the minty tastes doesn&#x27;t stick around too long, your mouth still feels very clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 2 part zinc from Smart Mouth maybe more effective combating bad breath - but is a hassle to mix, has a strong zinc flavor, and makes my mouth pucker.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the most efficient product i&#x27;ve ever used, great for the bad breath after garlic dinings and smoking.</li>
            <li>my daughter and I used twice a day very helpful.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>like peppermint, but this was too much.  </li>
            <li>really helps with the odor.</li>
            <li>Been ordering TheraBreath for awhile and really like the product</li>
            <li>but you really feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much at a time.</li>
            <li>This does have the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; feeling at the end of the minute and when gargling, where the &amp;#34;Mild Mint&amp;#34; version doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; nearly as much.  </li>
            <li>This mouth wash really works.</li>
            <li>The company really shouldn&#x27;t put that on the bottle...</li>
            <li>i absolutely recommend this to anyone, even if you don&#x27;t have tonsil or breath problems.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This really, really works.</li>
            <li>packaging itself is more than I expected.</li>
            <li>product has performed more than I expected.</li>
            <li>Real Miracle</li>
            <li>This stuff really does rock.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>added confident when I spent the night at my boyfriend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>It seems promising.</li>
            <li>Cleans well but feels like it doesn&#x27;t have much protection</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It leaves a sweet-ish, after taste, doesn&#x27;t feel as fresh and clean as the original, plus not sure if this one has alcohol, but it does feel like it.</li>
            <li>(This review is specifically for Icy Mint, and how it compares to Mild Mint.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Mild Mint for awhile and the gargling really helped with tonsil stones, aka the bane of my existence.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews that said it didn&#x27;t burn, and maybe I&#x27;m over-sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t find it any better than the alcohol-based oral rinse products in terms of taste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Bigger bottle than i was expecting which is great because i was nervous on how long it would last.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t burn like normal mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes my mouth feel clean and fresh , even several hours after its use</li>
            <li>&amp;#34; Icy Mint &amp;#34; flavor is a bit too strong and biter.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend getting the green bottle though, very refreshing and last much longer than crest or listerine.</li>
            <li>Excellent for bad breath from tonsil stones &amp; sinuses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>The instructions intend you to gargle for awhile longer then seems normal</li>
            <li>It had a funny &#x27;medical&#x27; taste but was very neutral, not sweetened at all, and did its job well.</li>
            <li>The ingredients delivered instant fresh breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the green better</li>
            <li>Definitely makes me breath fresh for 12 hours.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for this new &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but this is by far the winner!</li>
            <li>it completely eliminates coffee breath, onion breath, even garlic breath!</li>
            <li>and I was surprised.</li>
            <li>and my husband has not complained about my morning breath or my breath in general since I&#x27;ve started using this product.</li>
            <li>The directions of this product direct you to swish in your mouth for 1 minute and then gargle for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a soft minty taste.</li>
            <li>also, i don&#x27;t use as much as they instruct on the bottle; i find that 1/2 that amount is enough for me.</li>
            <li>I have a bottle, my husband has a bottle and my 5yr old has a bottle.  </li>
            <li>My 5yr old had stinky breath...</li>
            <li>My biggest critic is my 6yr old and he says my breath smells like toothpaste now.</li>
            <li>Is it worth ten times the cost?  ... probably not, but I just bought it for a second time, so go figure.</li>
            <li>Worth every single penny!!</li>
            <li>I would disagree that it keeps your breath fresh for 12 hours, but by far longer than any other mouth wash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>However, I can find nothing that beats this brand in the original &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; green bottle.</li>
            <li>Please note my 5yr old prefers the green bottle because it&#x27;s a mild mint flavor...</li>
            <li>Loses 1 star because the flavor is too intense for me to follow the instructions, and thus, get the full potential.</li>
            <li>usually mix this one with Mellaluca tea tree oil and spearmint, with a slash of either Crest or Listerine - to make something unique.</li>
            <li>The green tastes more watered down to me.</li>
            <li>tastes like really strong winterfresh gum or something but not good...</li>
            <li>My teeth will literally stay clean for 12 at least.</li>
            <li>Product is good but very expensive.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a month now and can positively say that I will not be going back to my previous mouthwash.</li>
            <li>All you need is a small amount to get the job done right.</li>
            <li>And since the surgery and subsequent radiation treatment, I have developed tonsil stones that I could NOT get rid of on any long term basis.</li>
            <li>It tastes great and doesn&#x27;t leave that stupid feeling after you used it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash, its literally the best one out.  </li>
            <li> This is a pleasant minty tasting rinse.</li>
            <li> and this is easily the best.</li>
            <li> This product is good.</li>
            <li> My friends also said it is a good one.</li>
            <li> The taste is a really good minty flavor.</li>
            <li> The flavor is good too</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that there is a better product than this!</li>
            <li> works great, STRONG mint flavor</li>
            <li> I liked them both, but this one ( the blue-ish bottle ) was more pleasant in my mouth than the green-ish bottle.</li>
            <li> Very good product and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very good mouthwash, after fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Amazing...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I now create my own a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Effective.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of a disaster.</li>
            <li> And I REALLY do think that this stuff works the best.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great and is so worth the money!</li>
            <li> Excellent have gone through 3 bottles and would highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> easy to use and maintain a long-lasting good breath</li>
            <li> Very easy to gargle with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well, its got a very strong pepper mint taste.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and worth the higher-than-some price tag.</li>
            <li> by far best mouthwash</li>
            <li> This flavor is very refreshing and easy to gargle with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice, I can fell fresh when I used this.</li>
            <li> I have tried many others&#x27;, but this is the most effective.  </li>
            <li> Loved the taste and leave my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong mint flavor, which I do not like, and will be glad when I finish it.  </li>
            <li> I love using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love therabreath mouth rinse  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I was hoping this one would taste better.</li>
            <li> Have tried many brands</li>
            <li> I love this mouth wash.</li>
            <li> I feel confident about my breath now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad they came in a pack of 2!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do that two times a day (ok sometimes three on the way out the door to meet up with people).</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep your mouth hydrated with water</li>
            <li> The ingredients list seems to be notably different,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is really refreshing besides being soothing.  </li>
            <li> I love the packaging too, there is a lid and a drinking cup on the top instead of just filling up the lid.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they make this stuff so magical</li>
            <li> OK mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> Once you have done that, you gargle with it for 1 minute in throat use more to rinse your mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased both flavors and I would have to say that each is very unique.</li>
            <li> Helps keep breath fresh longer!!</li>
            <li> If you follow their instruction to rinse with a cup of mouthwash and then gargle another cup of mouth wash, it will go kind of quickly.</li>
            <li> But love the original flavor better</li>
            <li> Icy mint is the best tasting of the flavors.</li>
            <li> I try to use it every morning to keep my mouth staying nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> Like this product; the mint is not too strong.  </li>
            <li> The original mint is much more mellow.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fine.</li>
            <li> I find this product effective, good tasting and refreshing, it is my preferred mouth wash over any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> BEST MOUTHWASH HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> This is even better than the original super minty and still works like a dream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the free of chemicals</li>
            <li> And the price is cheap</li>
            <li> Been using the regular formula for years with great results.  </li>
            <li> But so far, so good</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have great breath all day long.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling  wintery fresh!</li>
            <li> I originally was told about this product by my dentist who himself uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> mouthwash is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I prefer the original taste.</li>
            <li> I prefer it to the original flavor.</li>
            <li> , it makes my mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice deep cleaning with a refreshing taste</li>
            <li> clean rather than doing its job.</li>
            <li> It shows you how to clean your tongue for example, and to brush it.  </li>
            <li> Strong does not mean better.</li>
            <li> guess they are trying to win over the Listerine/Scope crowd, but for those of us who prefer more natural products, they could make the flavors consistent with natural flavors.</li>
            <li> In all, I love this product so much, but wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> Cool minty taste.  </li>
            <li> while i can really say this is true or not (since i get them so infrequently), it&#x27;s given me more confidence that my mouth is super clean</li>
            <li> Absolute magic.  </li>
            <li> however, it&#x27;s way too sweet and a bit burning too.</li>
            <li> after a good brushing of the teeth, and a solid scrape of the tongue...</li>
            <li> And it is true, you will not have morning breath.</li>
            <li> I dont know how much of it is anything in the mouthwash or just the better hygeine you use, but it works.  </li>
            <li> Makes you mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> this stuff leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean without the harshness of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I would give the Mild Mint 5 stars, as a result.</li>
            <li> , the bottle color makes it look like some sort of drain opener or calcium/lime/rust remover, but Mild Mint is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I love this so much more than the big name brands in stores.</li>
            <li> This stuff is mild tasting and it works well.</li>
            <li> Noticed difference very first time.</li>
            <li> Something about it makes my mouth feel great without ruining my tastebuds for half the day.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash really works!!</li>
            <li> When your husband tells you &amp;#34;you&#x27;re way too pretty to have breath smell that bad&amp;#34; then something needs to be done and he has definately noticed a difference and so have I!</li>
            <li> Excellent mouth wash and very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I scrape my tongue clean first,  </li>
            <li> I love the mild mint, but the icy mint seems to cover up more.</li>
            <li> but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Even after a night of drinking and food, I wake up with fresh breath.  </li>
            <li> Did just what it says it does, worth the money</li>
            <li> There is not a burning sensation, and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> and it is worth a try.  </li>
            <li> This product does make the mouth feel fresh and over time I do see a difference.  </li>
            <li> Regular mouthwash never worked for me and I was thrilled I found this and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> My breath stays fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> I have used Listerine for about 20-25 years (I&#x27;m 36), and this is my favorite mouthwash by far.</li>
            <li> Keeps my breath fresh without the burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> For me this blue bottle has the best mint flavor of the other varieties.</li>
            <li> The regular mild mint is much more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a great job in keeping my breath fresh for at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li> The Icy Mint (blue) is quite strong with a very strong kick which might be too strong for some.</li>
            <li> but this particular minty flavor is not as good the original green bottle.</li>
            <li> We like it very much.</li>
            <li> This product really works well!</li>
            <li> this really eliminates the symptoms!</li>
            <li> Best of all, you don&#x27;t have to put up with the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; that other products cause (due to the alcohol, I presume).</li>
            <li> I tried Icy Mint to see how I liked it in comparison</li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t really say it gives you fresh breath for over 12 hours though.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the mouth and keeps breath fresh</li>
            <li> much better than generic mouthwash for breath</li>
            <li> but this stuff leaves a lingering aftertaste in my mouth that I didn&#x27;t notice until the first night when I woke up and took a sip of water and thought something had died in my glass.</li>
            <li> but this is the first mouthwash I&#x27;ve used that makes me want to use another mouthwash to get the taste out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> The Green is mild yet equally effective.</li>
            <li> Really works well, as I use it in the morning right after brushing.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff, great bad breath fighter and mouthwash in one.</li>
            <li> i like the new icy mint flavor too, much better than the original.</li>
            <li> My favorite and will be buying as long as they still make it!</li>
            <li> I like to use it mixed with water because it is strong.</li>
            <li> I would recommend another flavor if you don&#x27;t want such a strong feel and taste.</li>
            <li> While the minty tastes doesn&#x27;t stick around too long, your mouth still feels very clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 2 part zinc from Smart Mouth maybe more effective combating bad breath - but is a hassle to mix, has a strong zinc flavor, and makes my mouth pucker.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the most efficient product i&#x27;ve ever used, great for the bad breath after garlic dinings and smoking.</li>
            <li> my daughter and I used twice a day very helpful.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> like peppermint, but this was too much.  </li>
            <li> really helps with the odor.</li>
            <li> Been ordering TheraBreath for awhile and really like the product</li>
            <li> but you really feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much at a time.</li>
            <li> This does have the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; feeling at the end of the minute and when gargling, where the &amp;#34;Mild Mint&amp;#34; version doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; nearly as much.  </li>
            <li> This mouth wash really works.</li>
            <li> The company really shouldn&#x27;t put that on the bottle...</li>
            <li> i absolutely recommend this to anyone, even if you don&#x27;t have tonsil or breath problems.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This really, really works.</li>
            <li> packaging itself is more than I expected.</li>
            <li> product has performed more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Real Miracle</li>
            <li> This stuff really does rock.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> added confident when I spent the night at my boyfriend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> It seems promising.</li>
            <li> Cleans well but feels like it doesn&#x27;t have much protection</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It leaves a sweet-ish, after taste, doesn&#x27;t feel as fresh and clean as the original, plus not sure if this one has alcohol, but it does feel like it.</li>
            <li> (This review is specifically for Icy Mint, and how it compares to Mild Mint.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Mild Mint for awhile and the gargling really helped with tonsil stones, aka the bane of my existence.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said it didn&#x27;t burn, and maybe I&#x27;m over-sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t find it any better than the alcohol-based oral rinse products in terms of taste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bigger bottle than i was expecting which is great because i was nervous on how long it would last.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t burn like normal mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my mouth feel clean and fresh , even several hours after its use</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; Icy Mint &amp;#34; flavor is a bit too strong and biter.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend getting the green bottle though, very refreshing and last much longer than crest or listerine.</li>
            <li> Excellent for bad breath from tonsil stones &amp; sinuses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The instructions intend you to gargle for awhile longer then seems normal</li>
            <li> It had a funny &#x27;medical&#x27; taste but was very neutral, not sweetened at all, and did its job well.</li>
            <li> The ingredients delivered instant fresh breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the green better</li>
            <li> Definitely makes me breath fresh for 12 hours.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this new &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but this is by far the winner!</li>
            <li> it completely eliminates coffee breath, onion breath, even garlic breath!</li>
            <li> and I was surprised.</li>
            <li> and my husband has not complained about my morning breath or my breath in general since I&#x27;ve started using this product.</li>
            <li> The directions of this product direct you to swish in your mouth for 1 minute and then gargle for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a soft minty taste.</li>
            <li> also, i don&#x27;t use as much as they instruct on the bottle; i find that 1/2 that amount is enough for me.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle, my husband has a bottle and my 5yr old has a bottle.  </li>
            <li> My 5yr old had stinky breath...</li>
            <li> My biggest critic is my 6yr old and he says my breath smells like toothpaste now.</li>
            <li> Is it worth ten times the cost?  ... probably not, but I just bought it for a second time, so go figure.</li>
            <li> Worth every single penny!!</li>
            <li> I would disagree that it keeps your breath fresh for 12 hours, but by far longer than any other mouth wash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> However, I can find nothing that beats this brand in the original &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; green bottle.</li>
            <li> Please note my 5yr old prefers the green bottle because it&#x27;s a mild mint flavor...</li>
            <li> Loses 1 star because the flavor is too intense for me to follow the instructions, and thus, get the full potential.</li>
            <li> usually mix this one with Mellaluca tea tree oil and spearmint, with a slash of either Crest or Listerine - to make something unique.</li>
            <li> The green tastes more watered down to me.</li>
            <li> tastes like really strong winterfresh gum or something but not good...</li>
            <li> My teeth will literally stay clean for 12 at least.</li>
            <li> Product is good but very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and can positively say that I will not be going back to my previous mouthwash.</li>
            <li> All you need is a small amount to get the job done right.</li>
            <li> And since the surgery and subsequent radiation treatment, I have developed tonsil stones that I could NOT get rid of on any long term basis.</li>
            <li> It tastes great and doesn&#x27;t leave that stupid feeling after you used it</li>
            <li> Unlike listerine, this has a pleasant taste, although it&#x27;s rather expensive for being about eight bucks per small bottle.</li>
            <li> Several medications connive to give me a problem with drymouth, which far too often leads to thrush (which kills sense of taste and causes sore tongue and throat - not fun.)  </li>
            <li> the 2-pack on amazon is cheaper than one bottle in my local store, so while it&#x27;s still a little pricey, it&#x27;s not that bad when i consider how happy i am with the results.</li>
            <li> I have a relative with a medical condition, mouth gets dry...</li>
            <li> Have used the original green bottle in the past.</li>
            <li> disappointed because I think it&#x27;s a good quality product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can justify the high price though.</li>
            <li> As a life long Listerine user this is a bit of a change.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an oral rinse to help with dry mouth and a breath freshener without burn.  </li>
            <li> This product never leaves my mouth dry.</li>
            <li> this does nothing for dry mouth after about 10 min of use.  </li>
            <li> It claims to help dry mouth</li>
            <li> She takes a lot of meds that leave her with dry mouth</li>
            <li> Try TheraBreath, and you&#x27;ll never go back to the other stuff!</li>
            <li> I like the Icy mint taste and there is no bad or weird aftertaste with this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Seriously wish i found this during my high school years and not in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves my throat and tongue severely dried out and cottony for hours after using it, which is something I never experienced with using Mild Mint.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the regular one, green bottle.</li>
            <li> For some reason I selected the icy mint flavor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> neither is it bitter.</li>
            <li> Not so bitter like some mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak towards long term effect, like, if you&#x27;ll have to use this product forever to keep harsh breath/ dry mouth at bay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> I tried the other Thera Breath rinse and</li>
            <li> Once you open the seal, provided for your use is a small dispenser cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product does create any burning sensation like some other brands of mouthwash that I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is not much else to say; it works!</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all ~ fooled by the positive feedback.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like freshening water (with a slightly odd taste).</li>
            <li> The mouthwash solution is not sweet</li>
            <li> A little pricey...</li>
            <li> Just add a little peppermint extract for flavor.</li>
            <li> With it was a little bit cheaper though,</li>
            <li> In the few days I&#x27;ve had it, I can tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t want to waste it</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m mixing this with the green bottle ones.</li>
            <li> To me the green bottle mint is too mellow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but in just a few seconds, whatever is in this kept fighting it and keeping the taste away.</li>
            <li> It is not cheap, but you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li> The first night I used it, I could taste the bad breath from my throat trying to break through</li>
            <li> I sometimes feel that the stronger mouth washes lives my mouth feeling raw.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it you&#x27;re missing out!</li>
            <li> usual</li>
            <li> I have terrible dry mouth from medications and this is really therapeutic and helpful.  </li>
            <li> Great flavor and it works for terrible bad breath.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t swish it around for the recommended amount of time because it&#x27;s seriously ICY to the point of being uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> This works for at least 12-hours at a time.</li>
            <li> I mean the two bottles of mouthwash was well protected with bubble-wraps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying their milder flavor if you prefer subtle because this is anything except mild.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Bad breath disappears instantly.</li>
            <li> Attempting to gargle with this stuff triggers my gag reflex within seconds, repeatedly, leaving my eyes red and watering and my stomach lurching every time I attempt to gargle with it and deal with tonsil stones and bad breath.</li>
            <li> Bad breath obviously runs in my family..</li>
            <li> I can talk to people and not worry about my breath which was always terrible, even right after brushing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s intensely, mouth-burningly mentholated, and also horribly oversweetened with xylitol.</li>

            <li> I normally wake with HORRIBLE morning breath, as in, I can taste it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a life saver my daughter and I used twice a day very helpful.</li>
            <li> I only like the blue bottle/mint flavor.  It works great.  Don&#x27;t care for the regular one, green bottle.</li>
            <li> This product really works well! I have a relative with a medical condition, mouth gets dry... this really eliminates the symptoms! I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> A little pricey...but worth every penny.  I have great breath all day long.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash really works!!</li>
            <li> This product is good. Been using for several months I like it.</li>
            <li> works great, STRONG mint flavor</li>
            <li> My wife likes it but they are rather expensive.</li>
            <li> Best breathe product I&#x27;ve used. Ever.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling  wintery fresh! Even the next day when you wake up you do not have that morning breath/taste in your mouth. Great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice, I can fell fresh when I used this. My friends also said it is a good one.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well</li>
            <li> When used as part of the TheraBreath system this product works.  I&#x27;m using the Probiotic Lozenges and the toothpaste.  This product does not contain any alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth.  The blue bottle is the mint flavor.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an oral rinse to help with dry mouth and a breath freshener without burn.  This rinse worked well to moisturize my mouth but I couldn&#x27;t swish it around for the recommended amount of time because it&#x27;s seriously ICY to the point of being uncomfortable.  I read other reviews that said it didn&#x27;t burn, and maybe I&#x27;m over-sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t find it any better than the alcohol-based oral rinse products in terms of taste.&lt;br /&gt;I like peppermint, but this was too much.  I would recommend trying their milder flavor if you prefer subtle because this is anything except mild.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed because I think it&#x27;s a good quality product overall.&lt;br /&gt;I guess they are trying to win over the Listerine/Scope crowd, but for those of us who prefer more natural products, they could make the flavors consistent with natural flavors.</li>
            <li> So grateful for this product! My husband has struggled with bad breath for years and it was tough to get close to him without gagging.  Brushing his teeth and using mouth wash would only give temporary relief (for maybe 5 minutes or so) and then the stink was back.  But TheraBreath WORKS.  He doesn&#x27;t even have morning breath anymore! It feels like a miracle.</li>
            <li> Excellent have gone through 3 bottles and would highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> THIS MOUTHWASH CHANGED MY LIFE!  One of the best products I have ever used.  I can talk to people and not worry about my breath which was always terrible, even right after brushing.  Even after a night of drinking and food, I wake up with fresh breath.  Amazing... Also, I had no change in taste.  I love using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Love this. Makes you mouth feel clean and fresh. really helps with the odor.</li>
            <li> Did just what it says it does, worth the money</li>
            <li> When you use this oral rinse correctly, it works fantastically! There is not a burning sensation, and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Been ordering TheraBreath for awhile and really like the product but today&#x27;s received order causes me some concern.&lt;br /&gt;1. Opened the box and found that there was something leaking (see pictures)&lt;br /&gt;2. Checked the TheraBreath and discovered that the both bottles did not have the seal I remembered it to have.&lt;br /&gt;3. Verified that these bottles should have a seal by opening a bottle I already had on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning the product a and having another one shipped. Hope this was an isolated instance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> Used this mouth wash and the toothpaste the same company sells and I was surprised. My teeth will literally stay clean for 12 at least. I would disagree that it keeps your breath fresh for 12 hours, but by far longer than any other mouth wash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Icy mint is the best tasting of the flavors. It&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> TheraBreath is the only mouthwash I use now. This product never leaves my mouth dry. After brushing, this is the best product you can use to ensure great breath!  Best of all, you don&#x27;t have to put up with the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; that other products cause (due to the alcohol, I presume). Try TheraBreath, and you&#x27;ll never go back to the other stuff!</li>
            <li> I like it.  As a life long Listerine user this is a bit of a change.  It does the job but without the burn.  I sometimes feel that the stronger mouth washes lives my mouth feeling raw.  This does not do that.  It is almost soothing.  The instructions intend you to gargle for awhile longer then seems normal but you really feel the difference.  While the minty tastes doesn&#x27;t stick around too long, your mouth still feels very clean.</li>
            <li> Great product. But love the original flavor better</li>
            <li> it works! and it is worth a try.  Just don&#x27;t use too much at a time.</li>
            <li> Bad breath disappears instantly.</li>
            <li> I love therabreath mouth rinse  but this particular minty flavor is not as good the original green bottle. Needless to say, I did not finish this pack of 2. I would highly recommend getting the green bottle though, very refreshing and last much longer than crest or listerine.</li>
            <li> In the few days I&#x27;ve had it, I can tell a difference. I can&#x27;t speak towards long term effect, like, if you&#x27;ll have to use this product forever to keep harsh breath/ dry mouth at bay. But so far, so good</li>
            <li> I like the Icy mint taste and there is no bad or weird aftertaste with this mouthwash. I will be buying again. If you follow their instruction to rinse with a cup of mouthwash and then gargle another cup of mouth wash, it will go kind of quickly.</li>
            <li> It does seem to work -- haven&#x27;t had any complaints since I started using it.  This does have the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; feeling at the end of the minute and when gargling, where the &amp;#34;Mild Mint&amp;#34; version doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; nearly as much.  I would give the Mild Mint 5 stars, as a result.</li>
            <li> I like therabreath brand mouthwash. I like the oxygenated castor oil, it makes my mouth feel really clean. I&#x27;m not a fan of the burning of listerine.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was hoping this one would taste better. I hate the taste. The regular mild mint is much more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tastes like really strong winterfresh gum or something but not good...</li>
            <li> it is my fourth time to purchase it!</li>
            <li> This is the best mouthwash for clean breath!! Have tried many brands but this is by far the winner!</li>
            <li> Product is good but very expensive.  I now create my own a lot cheaper.  I mix peroxide and water 1 to 2 ratio.  Just add a little peppermint extract for flavor.</li>
            <li> I love this mouth wash. I try to use it every morning to keep my mouth staying nice and fresh. I originally was told about this product by my dentist who himself uses it all the time. The taste is a really good minty flavor. There isn&#x27;t a bad after taste like other mouthwashes. Since it doesnt have alcohol in it, it doesnt sting the mouth. In all, I love this product so much, but wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and can positively say that I will not be going back to my previous mouthwash. I feel confident about my breath now and my husband has not complained about my morning breath or my breath in general since I&#x27;ve started using this product. I&#x27;m so glad they came in a pack of 2!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from tonsil stones and with that comes bad breath. The directions of this product direct you to swish in your mouth for 1 minute and then gargle for 30 seconds. I do that two times a day (ok sometimes three on the way out the door to meet up with people). Sometimes, when I have bad breath, I can sense it... I don&#x27;t know if that makes sense but when I breathe, I know it&#x27;s bad. But ever since using this product, I have yet to experience that sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve been cured from my tonsil stones just yet (don&#x27;t want to jinx it) but they have become smaller and I haven&#x27;t seen one in a couple weeks. My fingers are crossed! I&#x27;m happy to continue using this product! The minty flavor is great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is way overpriced and is not the miracle cure it is advertised to be.</li>
            <li> This mouth wash really works. I have been using it for 3 days now and my mouth couldn&#x27;t feel any fresher. You will get your taste buds back. The flavor is good too it&#x27;s a soft minty taste. I love it!</li>
            <li> Effective. Helps keep breath fresh longer!! I scrape my tongue clean first,  next i brush my teeth and tongue with colgate whitening toothpaste then use TheraBreath mouthwash to finish the job. Make sure to keep your mouth hydrated with water and you will maximize the benefits of these 3 products!</li>
            <li> (This review is specifically for Icy Mint, and how it compares to Mild Mint.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Mild Mint for awhile and the gargling really helped with tonsil stones, aka the bane of my existence. It had a funny &#x27;medical&#x27; taste but was very neutral, not sweetened at all, and did its job well. Very easy to gargle with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried Icy Mint to see how I liked it in comparison and it&#x27;s kind of a disaster. It&#x27;s intensely, mouth-burningly mentholated, and also horribly oversweetened with xylitol. Attempting to gargle with this stuff triggers my gag reflex within seconds, repeatedly, leaving my eyes red and watering and my stomach lurching every time I attempt to gargle with it and deal with tonsil stones and bad breath. It also leaves my throat and tongue severely dried out and cottony for hours after using it, which is something I never experienced with using Mild Mint. The ingredients list seems to be notably different,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, the bottle color makes it look like some sort of drain opener or calcium/lime/rust remover, but Mild Mint is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash, its literally the best one out.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it you&#x27;re missing out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this new &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34; version. However, I can find nothing that beats this brand in the original &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; green bottle. Strong does not mean better.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and worth the higher-than-some price tag.</li>
            <li> I love this so much more than the big name brands in stores. Something about it makes my mouth feel great without ruining my tastebuds for half the day.</li>
            <li> Great great great and wonderful</li>
            <li> I have terrible dry mouth from medications and this is really therapeutic and helpful.  I tried the other Thera Breath rinse and the taste was off putting.  This is really refreshing besides being soothing.  Very good product and worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product does make the mouth feel fresh and over time I do see a difference.  I am on my 4th bottle.  Only compliant is for me this does nothing for dry mouth after about 10 min of use.  It claims to help dry mouth and it did not work for me</li>
            <li> Have used the original green bottle in the past. This is a pleasant minty tasting rinse. Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is mild tasting and it works well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years now. I really like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t burn like normal mouthwashes. However, I wouldn&#x27;t really say it gives you fresh breath for over 12 hours though. The company really shouldn&#x27;t put that on the bottle...</li>
            <li> It leaves a sweet-ish, after taste, doesn&#x27;t feel as fresh and clean as the original, plus not sure if this one has alcohol, but it does feel like it.</li>
            <li> This added to their Toothpaste solved bad breath issues</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Bad breath obviously runs in my family..my sister did a ton of research and came across this product, now I&#x27;m hooked. When your husband tells you &amp;#34;you&#x27;re way too pretty to have breath smell that bad&amp;#34; then something needs to be done and he has definately noticed a difference and so have I! Will buy for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> This is a very strong mint flavor, which I do not like, and will be glad when I finish it.  The original mint is much more mellow.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fine.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Cool minty taste.  Lasts for hours.  Regular mouthwash never worked for me and I was thrilled I found this and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  My breath like has no smell at all.  I eat a lot of garlic.</li>
            <li> this stuff leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean without the harshness of alcohol. it completely eliminates coffee breath, onion breath, even garlic breath! i purchased it because once every year or two, i get a tonsil stone; it makes me nervous about what is still hiding in my tonsils and how it might be affecting my breath. this product is supposed to keep them at bay. while i can really say this is true or not (since i get them so infrequently), it&#x27;s given me more confidence that my mouth is super clean and i don&#x27;t have to worry about getting close to people when i&#x27;m talking. the 2-pack on amazon is cheaper than one bottle in my local store, so while it&#x27;s still a little pricey, it&#x27;s not that bad when i consider how happy i am with the results. also, i don&#x27;t use as much as they instruct on the bottle; i find that 1/2 that amount is enough for me. i like the new icy mint flavor too, much better than the original. i absolutely recommend this to anyone, even if you don&#x27;t have tonsil or breath problems.</li>
            <li> Excellent for bad breath from tonsil stones &amp; sinuses. Eliminates tonsil stones.</li>
            <li> BEST MOUTHWASH HANDS DOWN! Flavor is great, no alcohol used, and it works! Highly recommended! My favorite and will be buying as long as they still make it!</li>
            <li> I like how persistent this mouth wash is. Gives a nice deep cleaning with a refreshing taste</li>
            <li> Absolute magic.  Several medications connive to give me a problem with drymouth, which far too often leads to thrush (which kills sense of taste and causes sore tongue and throat - not fun.)  Thera-breath came up in a search for anti-thrush treatments.  It works wonderfully.  It also ensures inoffensive breath.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> We like it very much. Gentle on the mouth and keeps breath fresh but since it is not diluted to water, 1 bottle would probably lasts around a month.</li>
            <li> This really, really works. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mouthwashes over the years simply because I used to just buy whatever was on the shelf at the grocery store and this is easily the best. It tastes great and doesn&#x27;t leave that stupid feeling after you used it, I know some people like that but it just seems like it&#x27;s making you &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean rather than doing its job. I love the packaging too, there is a lid and a drinking cup on the top instead of just filling up the lid.</li>
            <li> After trying several mouthwashes, I was hesitant about switching brands. The TheraBreath breath oral rinse was recommended by my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual the lowest price was found on Amazon. I bought the two in one package deal during the last holiday season. For some reason I selected the icy mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the packaging:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging itself is more than I expected. I mean the two bottles of mouthwash was well protected with bubble-wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each bottle has an orange seal, which means it was never opened before. Once you open the seal, provided for your use is a small dispenser cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about the mouthwash?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has performed more than I expected. The mouthwash solution is not sweet neither is it bitter. The ingredients delivered instant fresh breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it after brushing my teeth, which is twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it Again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely yes! If you&#x27;re seeking a cheaper mouthwash, this is not the brand for you. This product does create any burning sensation like some other brands of mouthwash that I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash is worth every penny! All you need is a small amount to get the job done right.</li>
            <li> Great product. have used for several years.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I normally wake with HORRIBLE morning breath, as in, I can taste it, it&#x27;s so bad!  But I have been using this for a week now and its a night and day difference!  I wake in the morning and I almost feel like I already brushed my teeth. Not kidding.  Awesome stuff!  Will be buying the rest of the product line.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and is so worth the money! I keep on buying it.</li>
            <li> The best mouthwash I have ever used. I&#x27;ve purchased both flavors and I would have to say that each is very unique. The Icy Mint (blue) is quite strong with a very strong kick which might be too strong for some. The Green is mild yet equally effective. Great product all around.</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Noticed difference very first time. It&#x27;s the free of chemicals part I look for.Great product. I have you set up for every two months. T/Y</li>
            <li> I like to use it mixed with water because it is strong.</li>
            <li> much better than generic mouthwash for breath</li>
            <li> Great flavor and it works for terrible bad breath. Real Miracle</li>
            <li> Very good mouthwash, after fresh breath. And the price is cheap</li>
            <li> I use this with act restoring anti cavity mouthwash. Both work great. I purchased the 2 pack. Comes with coupon for discount on a travel product.</li>
            <li> works great. like the taste. wish price was lower.</li>
            <li> Excellent mouth wash and very long lasting. The breath mints are excellent as well.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of research for teeth because mine stink...literally!  This product is amazing!  Seriously wish i found this during my high school years and not in my 30&#x27;s.  I have a bottle, my husband has a bottle and my 5yr old has a bottle.  My 5yr old had stinky breath...not anymore.  Please note my 5yr old prefers the green bottle because it&#x27;s a mild mint flavor...the blue bottle is a stronger mint flavor.  The green tastes more watered down to me.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does rock. I keep it in my car for emergency situations. I love the mild mint, but the icy mint seems to cover up more.</li>
            <li> This is the best mouth wash I have ever used.  I have tried many others&#x27;, but this is the most effective.  With it was a little bit cheaper though, but if you add this to your wish/shopping list you can keep an eye on the price over time.  I added this to my with list and checked back about 4 weeks later and noticed the price dropped 40%!  I should have placed 2 orders instead of one.</li>
            <li> by far best mouthwash</li>
            <li> Does what it claims to do. Loses 1 star because the flavor is too intense for me to follow the instructions, and thus, get the full potential.</li>
            <li> Use this every night. It has been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> Over priced. Listerine blue is what I&#x27;m returning to.</li>
            <li> Been using the regular formula for years with great results.  Like this product; the mint is not too strong.  Would have given five stars except for the price.  If you can get this product at the same price as the regular one, buy it.  Then you will have a choice and use whichever one suits your situation or mood.  You don&#x27;t always want to smell like you just used mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This really works. My breath stays fresh for hours. added confident when I spent the night at my boyfriend&#x27;s. No longer need &amp;#34;bathroom breaks&amp;#34; to freshen up on my breath. Worth every single penny!!</li>
            <li> I liked them both, but this one ( the blue-ish bottle ) was more pleasant in my mouth than the green-ish bottle.</li>
            <li> easy to use and maintain a long-lasting good breath</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. I Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that there is a better product than this! It protects against infections and stops one if there is already started. There is not much else to say; it works!</li>
            <li> Seems to help with my tonsillitis</li>
            <li> have always used the regular version of this mouth rinse. decided to give this a shot. however, it&#x27;s way too sweet and a bit burning too. i didn&#x27;t want to waste it so i&#x27;m mixing this with the green bottle ones. turned out that i got used to the mixture.</li>
            <li> It did help me quite a bit</li>
            <li> Works well but you have to watch what you eat</li>
            <li> Not so bitter like some mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I like the green better</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my mouth feel clean and fresh , even several hours after its use</li>
            <li> the most efficient product i&#x27;ve ever used, great for the bad breath after garlic dinings and smoking.</li>
            <li> Get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34; Icy Mint &amp;#34; flavor is a bit too strong and biter. I would recommend another flavor if you don&#x27;t want such a strong feel and taste.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...after a good brushing of the teeth, and a solid scrape of the tongue...Therabreath comes in and kicks the s*** out of the germs in your mouth and makes your breath smell awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Listerine for about 20-25 years (I&#x27;m 36), and this is my favorite mouthwash by far. I will only use this going forward.</li>
            <li> I prefer the original taste. This is too minty and it stings.</li>
            <li> I find this product effective, good tasting and refreshing, it is my preferred mouth wash over any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> This flavor is very refreshing and easy to gargle with. I prefer it to the original flavor.</li>
            <li> Awsome product that works</li>
            <li> Really works well, as I use it in the morning right after brushing. Does a great job in keeping my breath fresh for at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff, great bad breath fighter and mouthwash in one. Best I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried yet but im hoping this will be my savior. Bigger bottle than i was expecting which is great because i was nervous on how long it would last. smells great. also bought toothpaste. arrived in time period it said it would</li>
            <li> For me this blue bottle has the best mint flavor of the other varieties. To me the green bottle mint is too mellow.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 part zinc from Smart Mouth maybe more effective combating bad breath - but is a hassle to mix, has a strong zinc flavor, and makes my mouth pucker.&lt;br /&gt;I usually mix this one with Mellaluca tea tree oil and spearmint, with a slash of either Crest or Listerine - to make something unique.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes me breath fresh for 12 hours. Does not get rid of tonsil stones though. Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> This is even better than the original super minty and still works like a dream. I don&#x27;t know how they make this stuff so magical, it&#x27;s like freshening water (with a slightly odd taste). The mint does improve the product by miles though as now you feel like you are using mouthwash</li>
            <li> Unlike listerine, this has a pleasant taste, although it&#x27;s rather expensive for being about eight bucks per small bottle. I would imagine that is about ten times the cost of listerine? Is it worth ten times the cost?  ... probably not, but I just bought it for a second time, so go figure.</li>
            <li> Keeps my breath fresh without the burning sensation.  I&#x27;m not sure I can justify the high price though.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t impressed. didn&#x27;t have the results i expectetí</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all ~ fooled by the positive feedback.</li>
            <li> 9/1/14  So far so good. It seems promising. I have been suffering from bad breath ever since I found I out I had Cancer in my throat area. And since the surgery and subsequent radiation treatment, I have developed tonsil stones that I could NOT get rid of on any long term basis. After searching and searching, I finally found out about this and it seems to be working well. I have only been using it for two days but so far so good. My biggest critic is my 6yr old and he says my breath smells like toothpaste now. The first night I used it, I could taste the bad breath from my throat trying to break through but in just a few seconds, whatever is in this kept fighting it and keeping the taste away. And it is true, you will not have morning breath. This works for at least 12-hours at a time. Thank you Dr. Katz. I bought mine from Wal-Mart for $7.67. I noticed the toothpaste was the same price but I didn&#x27;t buy it. I am using baking soda for toothpaste and a spoon for a tongue scraper. I have been using salt-water as a pre-rinse before brushing. I will be stopping this soon and see how just flossing, brushing and rinsing with this works.</li>
            <li> OK mouthwash.  Cleans well but feels like it doesn&#x27;t have much protection</li>
            <li> Works well, its got a very strong pepper mint taste.  I think what makes this work well is the instruction.  It shows you how to clean your tongue for example, and to brush it.  Then how to floss and brush your teeth.  Once you have done that, you gargle with it for 1 minute in throat use more to rinse your mouth (swish) for 2 minutes.  It works.  I dont know how much of it is anything in the mouthwash or just the better hygeine you use, but it works.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Regarding the blue/icy mint flavor, I wouldn&#x27;t buy a two-pack of this stuff until you&#x27;ve had a chance to try it. It might be just me but this stuff leaves a lingering aftertaste in my mouth that I didn&#x27;t notice until the first night when I woke up and took a sip of water and thought something had died in my glass. I can&#x27;t get rid of it. I am drinking a cup of coffee about two hours after using the stuff again today and every sip tastes like ass. Maybe it&#x27;s one of those genetic things like cilantro tasting like soap to some people but this is the first mouthwash I&#x27;ve used that makes me want to use another mouthwash to get the taste out of my mouth. YMMV</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom as a gift. She takes a lot of meds that leave her with dry mouth and she said that this actually helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Loved the taste and leave my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I am always just paranoid about my breath.  And I REALLY do think that this stuff works the best.  It is not cheap, but you pay for what you get.</li>
