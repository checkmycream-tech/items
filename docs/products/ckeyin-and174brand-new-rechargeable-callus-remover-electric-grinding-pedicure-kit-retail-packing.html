            <li>It worked, but is quite gentle still better than manual rubbing.</li>
            <li>Came fast love</li>
            <li>It is, however, not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but the result is not as good as just plain old soaking in warm water, followed by manual &amp;#34;grater&amp;#34;, followed polisher treatment.  </li>

            <li>However, it works and this product is not expensive.  </li>

            <li> my first adapter broke due to over charge.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, as well as an extra set of regular and course replacement rollers, as a last ditch effort to deal with chronic dry heels.</li>
            <li> It does do the job, but I have to run the tool over a particular area a lot longer than I would have hoped before the dead skin is removed.</li>
            <li> The course grinding head works well, but it takes a long time to get through one moderately dry/calloused heel before the battery begins to die out.</li>
            <li> runs well, the rollers don&#x27;t last long though</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll have to seed how long the electronics will work.</li>

            <li> Could not live without it.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry feet due to circulation problems.  </li>
            <li> The power is a weaker than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have only had the product a few weeks (purchased Feb 2015).  </li>
            <li> I was half minded when i bought this and started this.</li>
            <li> Work like a charm, I just got it, and removes the dead skin, and parched skin from the feet.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and has made all the difference in my feet.  </li>
            <li> , I hate replacing batteries constantly!!!</li>
            <li> The replacement cartridges could become expensive if I have to replace them often.</li>

            <li> I purchased this product, as well as an extra set of regular and course replacement rollers, as a last ditch effort to deal with chronic dry heels. After the initial 10+ hr charge, I put it to the test. The course grinding head works well, but it takes a long time to get through one moderately dry/calloused heel before the battery begins to die out. I find that I get better results if I start off manually with a Ped Egg, and then use grinder to finish off the rest. It is, however, not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  It works as demonstrated.</li>
            <li> Like it works as I thought it would</li>
            <li> Worked just like advertised</li>
            <li> Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to, holds a charge for a very long time. Easy to clean, and replace roller heads, It&#x27;s not very loud, it works great! Definitely something I will be buying as gifts in the future!</li>
            <li> excellent product and seller</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but the result is not as good as just plain old soaking in warm water, followed by manual &amp;#34;grater&amp;#34;, followed polisher treatment.  It is also not as good as using the acid gel.  I&#x27;ll keep it for maybe using it at some point, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry feet due to circulation problems.  This works great on removing the callouses and dry skin.</li>
            <li> This works great and with ease!! I&#x27;m happy for this invention and give cudoos to who ever made it and those that sale it because, it&#x27;s like a new found friend</li>
            <li> The power is a weaker than I expected. It does do the job, but I have to run the tool over a particular area a lot longer than I would have hoped before the dead skin is removed. My feet are not what I consider very dry, thus I don&#x27;t have much to be removed! However, it works and this product is not expensive.  The replacement cartridges could become expensive if I have to replace them often. I don&#x27;t know yet. I have only had the product a few weeks (purchased Feb 2015).  I will try to remember to update with that information when I have had the tool longer.</li>
            <li> works great.  Got here early in good shape..new.  decent price</li>
            <li> This works really well and I like that it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Work like a charm, I just got it, and removes the dead skin, and parched skin from the feet.  We&#x27;ll have to seed how long the electronics will work.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry feet. I was half minded when i bought this and started this. The moment it ran it thru my heal I understood it is really worth paying and actual one that i&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it thru all over my feet i get a feeling that equal after a pedicure session.</li>
            <li> Does ok-not spectacular</li>
            <li> this is a great item to have.does the job quickly &amp; happy to have this to use.</li>

            <li> I just started using it great results too early to talk anything more</li>

            <li> Love this and does the job as it states.  Could not live without it.  I use it everyday and has made all the difference in my feet.  Not afraid to wear sandals now as they make your feet soft.  All you need to add it some cream after you use this product to moisturize.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love this little sander. It was a great price compared to others, holds a charge for 8 hours, has fast rotation and it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it about six times so far and stil on the first rotator head. Replacement heads are fairly priced (got some on ebey).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> It worked, but is quite gentle still better than manual rubbing. my first adapter broke due to over charge. Company shipped replacement free. Nice customer service appreciated</li>
            <li> Came fast love it works well will buy again</li>
            <li> juat as it was listed, works great.</li>
            <li> Works great  just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks God I made this purchase I am happy and getting my money worth..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much. Maybe I need a coarser grinding head. ~Susan R.~</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!!! It works great!!! I purchased one for myself and one for my neighbor and friend for her 83rd birthday so I wanted to make sure it works good after purchasing another item from this company or similar company that was junk!!! I was thrilled with how well it worked and when my friend exclaimed that she &amp;#34;loves her (my) birthday gift&amp;#34;!!!! I also love that it&#x27;s rechargeable, I hate replacing batteries constantly!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, removes dry skin easily. I wish they would tell us where we can get refills (roller grinding heads).</li>
            <li> It is better than I thought it would be.  Easy to use.Thanks</li>
            <li> What a excellent product. And the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> runs well, the rollers don&#x27;t last long though</li>
            <li> This is awesome only I can&#x27;t find refill roller things&lt;br /&gt;I would buy a different one that you are sure you can get the refill rollers for</li>
