I bought them as a gift for my sister-in-law who is just learning to do makeup, I am a licensed cosmetologist, I know good brands but I didn&#x27;t want to spend big bucks. These are amazing! They had what the brushes were used for, like powder brush or foundation. Needless to say she loved them and I would definitely buy more!!</li>
