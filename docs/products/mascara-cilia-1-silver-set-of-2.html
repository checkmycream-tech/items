            <li>These are pretty great.</li>

            <li>These are perfect for  what I Intend to use them for which is to fill with essential oils.</li>
            <li>My favorite recipe is one I found on You Tube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;g_uztxWm-Fg).</li>
            <li>I use this for an organic oil mixture I use on my brows and lashes and I am generally pleased.</li>

            <li>Easy to fill and no leaks.</li>
            <li>and these were easy to fill and</li>
            <li>Easy to fill</li>
            <li>Works just fine for carrier oil and lavender use.</li>
            <li>Filled mine with caster oil</li>
            <li>I made homemade mascara and these empty containers worked great</li>
            <li>Tried to unscrew it and the whole top snapped off.  </li>
            <li>came as described, quick delivery</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed it!</li>
            <li>I filled mine with pure castor oil for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Nice clean empty mascara tubes.</li>
            <li>These are terrific for many uses.</li>
            <li>The thing is, it was pretty difficult to pour castor oil into them, i still haven&#x27;t figured out the best way to go about it.</li>
            <li>First tube broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but I actually like it better.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I use them for essential oil treatments to make my eyebrows and eyelashes healthy.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic, very high quality and professional looking!  </li>
            <li>these are good quality, and i like that it has the little black plastic thing u stick in the top after its full, so when you pull the brush out it doesn&#x27;t have excess on it.</li>
            <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t really give your lashes any volume.</li>
            <li>* the photo may seem like you get one straight tube and one curved tube, but mine were identical.</li>
            <li>Also, when I went to clean the tube to refill, I pryed the black top insert out with a pair of tweezers, which worked easily enough.</li>
            <li>The little black inserts for the top help get all the excess oil off the brush, and I love that part.</li>
            <li>Got these for essential oils for my lashes, they work very well.</li>
            <li>I bought these to use for a oil mixture for my eyelashes and eyebrows, they came as expected and right on time.</li>
            <li>Have seen no other package.</li>
            <li>The clear bottle is also quite helpful is see in how much is left in the tube.</li>
            <li>I keep my natural oils and apply same to my lashes at night.</li>
            <li>Nice containers but seal piece is really tight and doesn&#x27;t let hardly any mascara come through</li>
            <li>I had been using a dark bottle, inserting a lash wand then applying, these have make the process so much easier.</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown &amp; came within a few days</li>
            <li>Though I found the hole a bit small to pour my oils; It took a long time for it to fill up and ended up kind of messy.</li>
            <li>They were exceptionally hard to fill and the top was so tight that when you pulled the wand out it took all the mascara off of it.</li>

            <li> And it obvisouly will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the wand bristles are really separated and not very pliable.</li>
            <li> These are empty bottles I use to make my long lash formula.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little different than pictured</li>
            <li> But the bottles were just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Empty containers...</li>
            <li> I received 2 empty vials.  </li>
            <li> I have no use for two empty vials.</li>
            <li> as advertised, these are empty tubes, there is no product in them.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I bought these empty mascaras because I wanted to do a home made lashes serum.</li>
            <li> and I have one in my bathroom and the other one in my purse.</li>
            <li> There is a slight amount of my oil that leaks on the screw section of the product, but that may be because I am using this for oil and not mascara.</li>
            <li> and they seal tight to prevent any liquids from leaking out.</li>
            <li> Then I put a little soap &amp; water in it &amp; shook if up then dryed with qtips.</li>
            <li> you might want to get a little funnel if you will be filling a lot since the hole is small.</li>
            <li> Maybe the containers are too narrow, or maybe I&#x27;m just not resourceful.</li>
            <li> Came with two hard plastic tubes, two brushes, and two rubber inserts.</li>
            <li> you need a VERY small funnel.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to get mascara into tubes</li>
            <li> I am not happy about this.....</li>
            <li> The tube made it difficult to load the mascara.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s working for what I wanted it for, but I think it may have a crack in it and is leaking.</li>
            <li> These are pretty great. My only complaint is that the wand bristles are really separated and not very pliable.</li>
            <li> Very nice for home made mascara:)</li>
            <li> These are really nice and just as described.  Perfect for my homemade mascara, it makes it look so professional!  My favorite recipe is one I found on You Tube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;g_uztxWm-Fg).</li>
            <li> came as described, quick delivery</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t really give your lashes any volume.</li>
            <li> Used to make DIY eyelash serum.  Appears to be good quality and does not seem to leak.</li>
            <li> Great mascara tubes. I make my own and these are perfect.</li>
            <li> As expected. Two plastic mascara tubes, both identical. I fill them with oil to put on my lashes and brows at night.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my castor, lavender &amp; almond oil concoction to help eyelash/eyebrow growth. It works absolutely perfect for what I&#x27;m using it for! The little black inserts for the top help get all the excess oil off the brush, and I love that part. It prevents gobs of oil getting in your eyes. These are the perfect thing to execute my concoction :) I will note, that the black insert is wonderful to take the excess oil off the brush, but may not work well if you&#x27;re using these for mascara. Also, when I went to clean the tube to refill, I pryed the black top insert out with a pair of tweezers, which worked easily enough. Then I put a little soap &amp; water in it &amp; shook if up then dryed with qtips. Just refilled for a second time!  * the photo may seem like you get one straight tube and one curved tube, but mine were identical. No problem though, they are both lovely!</li>
            <li> .. i use these to apply castor oil to my lashes and the brush is of quality..</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I use them to apply castor oil to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> These arrived on time and in tact. I use this for an organic oil mixture I use on my brows and lashes and I am generally pleased. There is a slight amount of my oil that leaks on the screw section of the product, but that may be because I am using this for oil and not mascara. A swipe with my finger or a tissue every now and then takes care of the issue. I have made this oil for others and would purchase from here again. The clear bottle is also quite helpful is see in how much is left in the tube.</li>
            <li> Works just fine for carrier oil and lavender use.</li>
            <li> The tube made it difficult to load the mascara. I would also like a different brush.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it for making my own mascara.</li>
            <li> I love these! I use them for my eyelash homemade serums!</li>
            <li> These work perfect for my homemade eyelash serum. Easy to fill and they seal tight to prevent any liquids from leaking out. I would definitely recommend this product. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought these for a lash serum and works great. The bottle is a little different than pictured but I actually like it better.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. I made homemade mascara and these empty containers worked great</li>
            <li> Great for what I need them for!</li>
            <li> Got these for essential oils for my lashes, they work very well.</li>
            <li> I bought these empty mascaras because I wanted to do a home made lashes serum. I received them in perfect condition and they work well. Though I found the hole a bit small to pour my oils; It took a long time for it to fill up and ended up kind of messy. Otherwise, great mascara!</li>
            <li> very nice.  thank you :)</li>
            <li> Great for my &amp;#34;eyelash growth&amp;#34; concoction--castor oil and vitamin E! I needed to make one for my travel kit so I ordered these mascara bottles. Works perfectly!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice clean empty mascara tubes. I use them for essential oil treatments to make my eyebrows and eyelashes healthy.</li>
            <li> These are great.. I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> The brush is bending after a couple of weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Nice containers but seal piece is really tight and doesn&#x27;t let hardly any mascara come through</li>
            <li> Works well...made my mascara and using it daily to apply!</li>
            <li> Great and easy product. Filled mine with caster oil and I apply nighly to my lashes and brows. Olive oil is another way to grow lashes and brows.</li>
            <li> Great for what I needed to use them for.</li>
            <li> I love this! I made my own eyelash treatment and I have one in my bathroom and the other one in my purse.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this. Very good quality.</li>
