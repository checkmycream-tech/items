            <li>My advice would be to find a Mary Kay representative, this wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>

            <li>Makes the skin feel soft and helps makeup go on easier</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and keeps my makeup in place until I am ready to take it off.  </li>
            <li>This is a light non oily primer that you need only a little for complete coverage and by using it you only use half the foundation without using a primer.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes the skin feel soft and helps makeup go on easier</li>
            <li> I LOVE MARY KAY!!!!!! all i have to say is buy it try it love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome get it u won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and always will! My makeup doesn&#x27;t budge a bit and it just amplifies the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; abilities of my makeup. I sweat a lot in my job and don&#x27;t leave the house without makeup. I know I can sweat all day and still look at least 95% the same at the end of my shift.</li>
            <li> love the smoothness this adds to my skin. makes makeup application so much easier.</li>
            <li> I use up this product as moisturizer under my liquid foundation.  Goes on evenly and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;It foes what it says.  Great for most skin, not oily.</li>
            <li> I like this but if you are a woman of color and oily skinned this isn&#x27;t the product for you, your face will guaranteed be oily within 3 hours of your day. Will not repurchase but it&#x27;s good to have</li>
            <li> Love mary Kay product used yesterday very light weight product arrived on time</li>
            <li> Very happy, great product, wonderful customer service and a little extra free gift!!! I will definitely be ordering from you again!!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Make up goes on very smooth and looks flawless when used with the primer. I use it everyday. Sometimes just apply it without make up for the uv protection.</li>
            <li> Excellent foundation.  Covers lines and wrinkles for me!</li>
            <li> The best foundation primer ive ever used. Makeup glides on so nice after putting this on and no matter if I use my stila or Maybelline foundation it&#x27;ll stay in place all day. I wake up at 5 in the morning to go to cosmetology school and come back in the afternoon after school classes and my makeup still looks fresh. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good quality primer ðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> I have tried other more expensive primers.  This is the best by far and least costly.  Primers make a difference on the look of your complexion and this is the best!</li>
            <li> Have tried many brands of foundation primer and this works the best.  Fast shipping and included a free gift of perfume sample.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay foundation primer is part of my daily routine.  I don&#x27;t like wearing makeup, but Mary Kay has provided me with some tools, like this primer, that I don&#x27;t mind applying and wearing.  It is weightless and you can hardly tell that it&#x27;s there, but for it helping your foundation last all day.</li>
            <li> I normally love the Mary Kay Foundation Primer, but this was shipped to me in a regular envelope and was smashed inside.  My advice would be to find a Mary Kay representative, this wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t try this product yet but my mother, she just love it! She is 63 years old, and her make up is much better now using the primer. It helps to fix the make up and also it has a FPS 15 to protect your skin for the sun light.</li>
            <li> Received as expected, happy with the company that sent it and the product.</li>
            <li> This Mary Kay Foundation Primer is a wonderful product.  I put it on (you only need a very small amount) and it makes my skin feel soft.  It&#x27;s also got SPF 15, so that with my moisturizer of SPF 35, keeps my face protected.  I bought from this vendor because it was cheaper than buying from my cousin (who is a Mary Kay muckity muck).  Shhhhhh, don&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> Works great, a little bit goes a long way and it covers well.</li>
            <li> It is very light and offers great coverage...I will definitely pruchase again in the future...Nice price point also..I Love it!</li>
            <li> As always Mary Kay makeup comes out on top. I have been personally using Mary Kay for many years and my soft skin is proof of that.</li>
            <li> This primer does not make your face feel heavy or leave a white residue. I will only use Mary Kay foundation primer. Why turn from a good thing!</li>
            <li> This us the best primer for my very dry aging skin. I&#x27;m finding more and more of MK products work well for me.</li>
            <li> Super smooth and powdery finish w/o being dry. Makeup stayed put and fresh looking all day. Covered pores and fine wrinkles well, and did ok for my more prominent wrinkles. Made my skin look great even w/o makeup. I&#x27;m sure there are better out there for more problematic skin, but this is a great option for those with fewer skin issues to deal with</li>
            <li> This is a light non oily primer that you need only a little for complete coverage and by using it you only use half the foundation without using a primer.</li>
            <li> This product is awsome.  It makes application of foundation glide on effortlessly.  It almost feels like liquid silk on your skin.</li>
            <li> This primer is supposed to be colorless however, on my skin it made me look like I was in a flash fire.  I will not wear it and intend on giving it away.  Perhaps someone else will have more luck than I did.</li>
            <li> This comes on smooth and soft, feels good on my skin. A nice primer to use before foundation</li>
            <li> Mary Kay Foundation Primer goes on smoothly.  It is not greasy or oily.  It is long lasting and keeps my makeup in place until I am ready to take it off.  I look forward to putting it on my face every day.</li>
            <li> I really like the Mary Kay Foundation Primer.  It really helps your foundation to on much smoother.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing. it leaves a silkening feeling on your skin &amp; instantly beautifies your skin. i will purchase for a long time</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d the wrong item - twice</li>
            <li> Best foundation primer ever (paired with the best foundation). If you want primer, this is the one to buy. That being said, this will be my last foundation purchase ever as coconut oil works just as well (just without the SPF)</li>
            <li> Love this...no makeup needed after I apply..awesome</li>
            <li> Love this product makes your face soft &amp; covers flaws beautiful product  great company ordered many products here great prices</li>
