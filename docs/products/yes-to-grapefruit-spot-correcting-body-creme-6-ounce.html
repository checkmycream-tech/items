            <li>I LOVED THIS PRODUCT IT WORKED FOR ME!!!</li>
            <li>This is a perfectly well balanced</li>
            <li>Smells great and seems to be working.</li>
            <li>However, this is a great cream for eczema.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this cream on my fair skin to fade my scars.</li>
            <li>Smell good</li>
            <li>but it is good at moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I feel really good about this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell!</li>
            <li>Its also just a nice moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>Nice cream.</li>
            <li>: Liked the scent and the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>Not seeing any spots fading yet love the smell and texture</li>
            <li>I love YesTo products.  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Love the scent and how well it moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen a great deal of change in the coloring of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing and light.  </li>
            <li>Rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>So true to its word, it gets 4 stars.</li>
            <li>It dries and absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been satisfied so far.  </li>
            <li>and hopefully they lighten more will update more in a few weeks</li>
            <li>I decided to try this body cream after falling in love with the YesTo facial wipes.  </li>
            <li>This leaves your skin feeling too sticky for me to use after the first time.</li>
            <li>At first I used the cream twice a day but started seeing bumps form</li>
            <li>;  It took twice as long for the more severely affected arm to begin to fade, but it is coming along.</li>
            <li>It takes time and the results are not a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li>It really works...</li>
            <li>I like it so much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the whole tub, for about a month</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing</li>
            <li>my skin tone on legs and sun spots look lighter smells a lot like a real grapefruit</li>
            <li>Better than any other products I have tried for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>I went into it realizing that most ANYTHING I try for dark spots/hyperpigmentation is going to take quite a bit of time to work (and longer for some people than others).  </li>
            <li>Other than the slightly sticky texture and strong smell, this product is okay.</li>
            <li>I loved that it didn&#x27;t have shea butter in it , very hard to come by moisturizers without it.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t feel this cream has any dark spot reduction power, but it does smell nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this two days, but nothings broken out, it smells great and my skin just drinks it in.  </li>
            <li>with limited success.  </li>
            <li>This review is not for the spot correcting part of this cream - I couldn&#x27;t get that far.</li>
            <li>Or to put it this way, you know how coconut oil makes your skin all baby soft</li>
            <li>I did get a very mild rash (I have REALLY sensitive skin), but that lasted for only a few days, cleared up completely and hasn&#x27;t returned.</li>
            <li>and I saw results much sooner than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much of a chioce when it comes to skin toners aside from just scrubbing my body down with lemon in the shower.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical about this product being able to reduce dark spots, but it really works.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still hoping that the dark spots on my legs diminish.  </li>

            <li> Not seeing any spots fading yet love the smell and texture</li>
            <li> Smells great and seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I use this product close to everyday on old acne scars on my shoulders. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the texture and appearance of my skin. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> It really works...brown hand spots fading in just 3 weeks.  Better than any other products I have tried for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months (managed to score some for a bargain price from a local pharmacy that was discontinuing it, so I got my initial supply at a &amp;#34;try it&amp;#34; price).  I went into it realizing that most ANYTHING I try for dark spots/hyperpigmentation is going to take quite a bit of time to work (and longer for some people than others).  So I was patient and I saw results much sooner than I expected.  Within less than a month, I noticed the spots on my hands were getting lighter and the hyperpigmentation on my arms was &amp;#34;breaking up.&amp;#34;  It took twice as long for the more severely affected arm to begin to fade, but it is coming along. I did get a very mild rash (I have REALLY sensitive skin), but that lasted for only a few days, cleared up completely and hasn&#x27;t returned. I agree it&#x27;s a bit sticky, but, in my opinion, that&#x27;s a minor inconvenience in the scheme of things.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product being able to reduce dark spots, but it really works.  I saw a noticeable lightening to my sun damage spots within a few weeks and with continued use some have actually &amp;#34;disappeared&amp;#34;.  I even bought a jar for my mom I like it so much.  Its also just a nice moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I love YesTo products.  I decided to try this body cream after falling in love with the YesTo facial wipes.  I personally don&#x27;t feel this cream has any dark spot reduction power, but it does smell nice.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole tub, for about a month and it sorta faded some marks but not enough and it&#x27;s soooo sticky!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream on my fair skin to fade my scars. I can&#x27;t believe the results and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS PRODUCT IT WORKED FOR ME!!! I GIVE IT 5 STARS</li>

            <li> Smells odd, and it&#x27;s sticky. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be working either.</li>
            <li> Nice cream. Smell good I do think it is helping</li>
            <li> I love this product and I think it works, but it does not go a long way.  If I want to continue using it, I need to purchase at least two of them per month.</li>
            <li> I have lots of scarring on my legs from eczema and hoped this would diminish the dark spots.  So far I haven&#x27;t seen a great deal of change in the coloring of my skin.  However, this is a great cream for eczema.  It&#x27;s moisturizing and light.  It dries and absorbs quickly into the skin.  I often get bubbles under my skin with my eczema which I believe is a side effect of over moisturizing, however, if I don&#x27;t moisturize my skin has red dry splotches.  This is a perfectly well balanced cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still hoping that the dark spots on my legs diminish.  I will update in a month.</li>
            <li> Pros: Liked the scent and the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Bought it to lighten dark spots, and although I applied it faithfully twice a day, the spots remain.</li>
            <li> I just started using it a week ago and I can already see a difference in my skin! It&#x27;s very moisturizing and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Very thick. Not sure if it is working but it is good at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this two days, but nothings broken out, it smells great and my skin just drinks it in.  I feel really good about this product.  Rich and creamy.  My face feels refreshed throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Other than the slightly sticky texture and strong smell, this product is okay. Dark spots on my chest seem a little lighter and texture of my chest has improved.</li>
            <li> This product works like a charm.  This works for me.  I definitely see results.  My dark spots on leg has faded.</li>
            <li> I hate to say this because I really wished it worked.&lt;br /&gt;It does nothing for any dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 3 months almost and nothing absolutely no changes.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using it till it runs out but again I have seen NO results.</li>
            <li> I have been satisfied so far.  My dark spots are getting lighter and my husband has noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> This review is not for the spot correcting part of this cream - I couldn&#x27;t get that far. This leaves your skin feeling too sticky for me to use after the first time. I</li>
            <li> I like the smell. It is a thick cream that is a bit too heavy for summer in the south.</li>
            <li> Nothing short of miraculous.  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few thing over the past 5-6 years including liquid nitrogen, acid peels and derma rollers.&lt;br /&gt;All with limited success.  Until this cream.  Noticed a difference within a couple of weeks. Downright dramatic. I just started using the body wash as well. I am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> Started using this 2 weeks ago and it is slowly evening out my skin tone on legs and sun spots look lighter smells a lot like a real grapefruit will continue to use and hopefully they lighten more will update more in a few weeks</li>
            <li> Love the scent and how well it moisturizes.  Not regularly using so I can&#x27;t rate how well it works for lightening dark spots.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have age spots on my hands and arms and have tried various different creams to lighten the spots.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and the age spots appear to be lighter.  This does not replace the need for hand cream in the winter, however.  I don&#x27;t find this to be soothing to dry skin at all.  I really like the subtle grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li> I got this cream because I had an outbreak from a shea butter allergy. I had dark marks from itchy bumps all over my body. I loved that it didn&#x27;t have shea butter in it , very hard to come by moisturizers without it. Well one month and 3 containers later the marks have faded. That&#x27;s it. They aren&#x27;t as obvious. At first I used the cream twice a day but started seeing bumps form so I decreased it to one a day. My over all complexion is even, and the marks aren&#x27;t as noticable. This is not an instant results cream. It takes time and the results are not a dramatic difference. Its very subtle. But with continued use it does make a difference. Being allergic to shea butter I don&#x27;t have much of a chioce when it comes to skin toners aside from just scrubbing my body down with lemon in the shower. So this works well enough for me. Also, no its not much of a moisturizer but it does keep my skin hydrated throughout the day if that makes any sense. Or to put it this way, you know how coconut oil makes your skin all baby soft even if you skip a day? Yeah well not the case here, whatever your skin feels like after a shower, that&#x27;s what it feels like when you skip a day. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it does fade the marks, like it says on the container in 4 weeks. So true to its word, it gets 4 stars.</li>
