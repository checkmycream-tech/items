            <li>I feel very good about using this each day.</li>
            <li>Does a great job after a shave.</li>
            <li>Good after shave.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product, I like it</li>
            <li>It smells and feels great after a nice DE razor shave.</li>
            <li>What it does do is prevent chaffing and rashes on my own face, and is fragrance-neutral.</li>
            <li>Nice hydrating feel.</li>
            <li>Nice, and great price, but after I apply this lotion, I don&#x27;t feel the lotion is absorved quickly and for a while I still feel it.</li>
            <li>Nice refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer that absorbs well and is light but still moisturinzing.  </li>
            <li>my favorite, too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchasing a two pack is more economical, and it meets all of my needs (protect my skin after shaving and no obnoxious, strong fragrances), so I am a life-long customer who is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for the young shaver who is getting started.  </li>
            <li>This is great after a good shave - disappears quickly but is maybe a little too watery for my liking.</li>
            <li>Like the mild smell, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I use it to moisturize my whole face, I don&#x27;t feel any razor burn and helps keeps skin fresh.</li>
            <li>My skin and eyes are super sensitive</li>
            <li>The fragrance was quickly neutralized (although I did smell like I was in a hospital to anyone who got too close), the initial burn of applying it was not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have an extremely sensitive face and this is the only aftershave that keeps me from getting severe razor burn.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, definitely give this a shot!</li>
            <li>saved a few $ going thru amazon and as i expected it works just the same as at the store :)</li>
            <li>I personally detest the strong fragrances of just about every brand of men&#x27;s after shave lotions on the market, yet, until I discovered this product I was forced to use them.</li>
            <li>Long story short, my skin didn&#x27;t peel after using it (and expected it to do so) and realized this stuff really works well.  </li>

            <li> Excellent  product to sooth after shave burn and condition your face.</li>
            <li> Good.&lt;br /&gt; Cons: whitish powder like appearance after applying.</li>
            <li> I personally detest the strong fragrances of just about every brand of men&#x27;s after shave lotions on the market, yet, until I discovered this product I was forced to use them. If I didn&#x27;t shaving would cause my skin to chaff and rashes. I did resort to using rubbing alcohol as an aftershave for a period of time. The fragrance was quickly neutralized (although I did smell like I was in a hospital to anyone who got too close), the initial burn of applying it was not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product is claimed to heal irritated skin and moisturize it, I cannot vouch for that one way or the other. What it does do is prevent chaffing and rashes on my own face, and is fragrance-neutral. That is the biggest selling point to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing a two pack is more economical, and it meets all of my needs (protect my skin after shaving and no obnoxious, strong fragrances), so I am a life-long customer who is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> As advertised and what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Nice, and great price, but after I apply this lotion, I don&#x27;t feel the lotion is absorved quickly and for a while I still feel it.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely sensitive face and this is the only aftershave that keeps me from getting severe razor burn.  The difference is night and day.  If you have sensitive skin, definitely give this a shot!</li>
            <li> she likes the way it smells and is always wanting me to shave.  and it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer that absorbs well and is light but still moisturinzing.  my favorite, too.  you can also use as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good after shave. Nice refreshing smell. Nice hydrating feel. Good product.</li>
            <li> Does a great job after a shave. I use it to moisturize my whole face, I don&#x27;t feel any razor burn and helps keeps skin fresh.</li>
            <li> saved a few $ going thru amazon and as i expected it works just the same as at the store :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the young shaver who is getting started.  It reduces dry skin and razor burn.</li>
            <li> Good product, I like it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 2 years, no complaints at all. ***** *****</li>
            <li> This is great after a good shave - disappears quickly but is maybe a little too watery for my liking. My skin and eyes are super sensitive but I have found neutrogena to not cause me any issues.</li>
            <li> Came upon this by accident.  Had a bad sunburn and the only thing I had was a tiny tester of this lotion with me on a trip.  Long story short, my skin didn&#x27;t peel after using it (and expected it to do so) and realized this stuff really works well.  Now I use it after shaving and never get irritations or rash.  Like the mild smell, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I feel very good about using this each day. Seems to soothe the skin and doesn&#x27;t have any smell that lingers.</li>
            <li> Proraso. I switch back-and-forth between the two. It smells and feels great after a nice DE razor shave. Highly recommend.</li>
