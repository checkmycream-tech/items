            <li>Too strong of an alcohol scent.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used it years ago and really liked it. In the past few years I branched out and tried other brands but finally decided to return to Sekkisei. I use it as a toner, since the texture is a bit too thin for a lotion. The recipe of the lotion is based on ancient oriental medicine and it is packed with herbs that are great for healing, moisturizing and increasing blood circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some in my palm and gently pat the toner on to my skin. I don&#x27;t like using cotton balls or fabric because I feel most of the toner get absorbed by the cotton, not my face. My skin drinks it in almost instantly, and feel soft and moist. It smells clean and slightly floral. On top of the toner I then put on regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It has alcohol for sure, my skin can handle it and feels good.</li>
            <li> The Pros is it makes your face brighter, you can see it in the first week. The cons is this lotion makes your face very every dry.</li>
            <li> Good for daily use, that&#x27;s the third bottle I bought.</li>
            <li> Too strong of an alcohol scent. Guess it contains alcohol...&lt;br /&gt;And I don&#x27;t see much of a brightening effect.</li>
            <li> I just bought it for three days. It serves good as toner. Mild and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Nice product, it is very smooth when I use it on my face/skin. I would recommend to people if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable on my face, but a little dry.</li>
            <li> IN FACT, I LIKE THE SMELL.</li>
            <li> Great. Just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> i saw it cheaper than Kose online shop, that&#x27;s why i bought it here. i didn&#x27;t found it can help me more brighter, but that&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Great customer service. Product arrived with very protected package. smells good and feels good. I used the sekkisei lotion  a couple years ago and now has to go back to it after tried several other brand skin care products. It makes my skin brighter, softer, and much moister than others. Will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it help me good&lt;br /&gt;i like it ,&lt;br /&gt;it look not bad.&lt;br /&gt;~~~ ~ ~ ~</li>
            <li> Pros: Not sticky, smells great, feels comfortable on your skin, bottle protects the content from light, prep your skin for face cream afterwards&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Expensive&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it for few days only. So far I have not seen any whitening effect yet but I believe it will take some time.</li>
            <li> It  has been really popular for so many years and I can see why! I have to say that . Sekkisei lotion  keep your skin clean and clear.  it&#x27;s such a great product for moisture and whitening trust me!</li>
            <li> it is the third time i buy this lotion, and it is a gift for my friend. love it. it should be used with sekkisei lotion mask.</li>
            <li> The toner is quite hydrating, absorbs fast and leaves no residue to the skin. Some people may complain about the alcohol content in this toner, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to the people have sensitive skin. But for normal/oily skin it is quite good. Since I have dry skin, I usually use another thicker toner after this one to make my skin more hydrated. Sometimes I use it with the compressed mask, which is also from Sekkisei. The smell of this toner is kinda light and refreshing, so it&#x27;s pretty pleasant to pat on.&lt;br /&gt;As to the brightening effect of this toner, I haven&#x27;t seen much change(I have fair to medium skin tone), since I&#x27;ve only used half bottle.</li>
            <li> It is suitable for combination skin, clean enough intensity, but also moisturizing, but a large amount. The price is also more expensive, can not afford to hurt the wallet.</li>
            <li> this is really good!!!</li>
