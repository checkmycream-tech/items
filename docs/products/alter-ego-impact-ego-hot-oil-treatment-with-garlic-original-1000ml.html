            <li>It seems to soften hair as good as many of the less-expensive deep conditioners that run for under ten dollars, so there&#x27;s really no reason to spend $40 plus shipping for this particular product.</li>
            <li>My hair had a beautiful shine and a silky, softness to it after I blow dried and flat ironed it.</li>
            <li>Very pricey</li>
            <li>I am mixed raced (African American, Cherokee and European) and it works the best on my hair type.   </li>

            <li>thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but it works really well, so</li>
            <li>I was shedding at a fast clip after weening off medications.</li>
            <li>Whenever I feel like I&#x27;m shedding too much, this wonder treatment limits the shedding.  </li>
            <li>works really well...</li>
            <li>It lasts long and its a great detangler for African American hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a relaxer in my hair, so my strands can get really dry and will break easily.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Alter Ego Hot Oil treatment to anyone, whether or not you have processed or natural hair.</li>
            <li>Its definitely one of my staples and the smell is not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>and when I was dry my hair felt fabulous.</li>
            <li>I had my best friend (who is my worst critic) say my hair has never looked better, thicker, healthier.</li>
            <li>My main problem was that my curls were frizzing up and losing their definition as the day wore on.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>What I have found to work best is to use a very small amount of the product as it comes on pretty thick.</li>
            <li>this product it will make your hair extremely silky and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>Ive tried other products over the years and nothing makes my hair shinier and strong.  </li>
            <li>With one use, your hair is soft, manageable and very shiney.  </li>
            <li>Expensive bur works great to reduce breakage and it does not smell at all like garlic.</li>
            <li>It has really made a difference in my hair as far as shredding and breakage.</li>
            <li>Dominican products are the secret to the African American community they&#x27;re awesome.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t do more because any conditioner in my hair for longer than that usually starts making my hair feel crunchy or overloaded with too much protein.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products out there and no other leaves my hair like that.</li>
            <li>I used the product and it left my hair soft, shiny, and super managable.  </li>
            <li>but right away u noticed the shine and extra bounce in my hair.</li>
            <li>Since I tried this product I feel like i can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I always like to leave the conditioner in for at least a couple of hours to give my hair a good deep condition treatment.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair (light brunette, moderately coarse, long, decently thick) feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>It did help reduce the shedding and made my hair feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to make my hair very soft once I rinsed it...</li>
            <li>It leaves m my hair very soft</li>
            <li>I have used other conditioners before, even \\&quot;higher end\\&quot; products, but nothing compares to Alter Ego Garlic Hot Oil Treatment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it as a leave in conditioner and found that it  has loosened my curls, which doesn&#x27;t bother me because I&#x27;ve done the keratin treatment several times since I first started using Impac Ego.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that any conditioner was strong enough to actually damage and break the hair such as this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair has always been hard to moisturize; Most products just lay on my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is supper soft.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have a sensitive nose</li>
            <li>It leaves you hair so soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised</li>
            <li>and I have natural African-American 4a hair, so</li>
            <li>Your hair comes out really soft regardless the type of hair.</li>
            <li>My old hair dresser introduced me, but relocated and had to order.  </li>
            <li>Hair stays soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I will follow up later to see if really did work in 6 months.</li>
            <li>My hair use to shed a lot since I&#x27;ve been using alter ego it has stop completely.</li>
            <li>It makes the hair so soft &amp; manageable &amp;</li>
            <li>You dont even need to sit under the dryer and your hair will be SOFT after you wash this product out..</li>
            <li>and i noticed my hair was STILL soft..</li>
            <li>but i keep coming back to this because it is really making a difference in the end product.</li>
            <li>It stops shedding completely.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and it just seems more nourished than usual after just one use!</li>
            <li>After roller setting my hair my hair still felt soft days later my hair still feels soft espically my new growth.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned in previous reviews, I am loyal to the Alter Ego line of products.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this because of the price, but did so anyway after reading so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>wash my hair, comb it out with a large toothed comb, and towel dry it.</li>
            <li>This is my new staple deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have very damaged dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I texlaxed my 4b protein sensitive, low porosity hair after 10 years being natural.</li>
            <li>My hair is so smooth, very minimal shedding, and although my hair is still wet</li>
            <li>I only used it twice so far</li>
            <li>fast shipping and came waaaaay before expected shipping date</li>
            <li>and it left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My 4a/b is left soft and moisturized after use..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just pretty average</li>
            <li>It worked the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>and this is one of the only thing that worked so far.</li>
            <li>And this is the only conditioner that leaves my hair hydrated, shinny and soft.</li>
            <li>If you have serious hair shedding problems, I strongly suggest you try this product.</li>
            <li>If your hair is this kind then you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li>but it feels very soft and healthy after this mask, like you just had some expensive treatment at</li>
            <li>When I style my hair now, I always have to really brush my edges very carefully so that I don&#x27;t look like a porcupine.    </li>
            <li>It helps to actually leave the product in for the full 15-20 mins and then condition as usual.</li>
            <li>After the first use I noticed the shedding slowed down for about 4 days then it started back with a vengeance.</li>
            <li>I figured maybe after more applications it will begin to slow down the shedding problem.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday as a deep conditioner, added a little olive oil to it and BAM!</li>
            <li>I have straight hair however after a dying it, it became a little bit coarse.  </li>

            <li> It seems to soften hair as good as many of the less-expensive deep conditioners that run for under ten dollars, so there&#x27;s really no reason to spend $40 plus shipping for this particular product.</li>

            <li> I have a relaxer in my hair, so my strands can get really dry and will break easily.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Alter Ego Hot Oil treatment to anyone, whether or not you have processed or natural hair.</li>
            <li> Its definitely one of my staples and the smell is not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> and when I was dry my hair felt fabulous.</li>
            <li> I had my best friend (who is my worst critic) say my hair has never looked better, thicker, healthier.</li>
            <li> My main problem was that my curls were frizzing up and losing their definition as the day wore on.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> What I have found to work best is to use a very small amount of the product as it comes on pretty thick.</li>
            <li> this product it will make your hair extremely silky and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> Ive tried other products over the years and nothing makes my hair shinier and strong.  </li>
            <li> With one use, your hair is soft, manageable and very shiney.  </li>
            <li> Expensive bur works great to reduce breakage and it does not smell at all like garlic.</li>
            <li> It has really made a difference in my hair as far as shredding and breakage.</li>
            <li> Dominican products are the secret to the African American community they&#x27;re awesome.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t do more because any conditioner in my hair for longer than that usually starts making my hair feel crunchy or overloaded with too much protein.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products out there and no other leaves my hair like that.</li>
            <li> I used the product and it left my hair soft, shiny, and super managable.  </li>
            <li> but right away u noticed the shine and extra bounce in my hair.</li>
            <li> Since I tried this product I feel like i can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I always like to leave the conditioner in for at least a couple of hours to give my hair a good deep condition treatment.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair (light brunette, moderately coarse, long, decently thick) feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> It did help reduce the shedding and made my hair feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to make my hair very soft once I rinsed it...</li>
            <li> It leaves m my hair very soft</li>
            <li> I have used other conditioners before, even \\&quot;higher end\\&quot; products, but nothing compares to Alter Ego Garlic Hot Oil Treatment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as a leave in conditioner and found that it  has loosened my curls, which doesn&#x27;t bother me because I&#x27;ve done the keratin treatment several times since I first started using Impac Ego.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that any conditioner was strong enough to actually damage and break the hair such as this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair has always been hard to moisturize; Most products just lay on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is supper soft.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have a sensitive nose</li>
            <li> It leaves you hair so soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised</li>
            <li> and I have natural African-American 4a hair, so</li>
            <li> Your hair comes out really soft regardless the type of hair.</li>
            <li> My old hair dresser introduced me, but relocated and had to order.  </li>
            <li> Hair stays soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I will follow up later to see if really did work in 6 months.</li>
            <li> My hair use to shed a lot since I&#x27;ve been using alter ego it has stop completely.</li>
            <li> It makes the hair so soft &amp; manageable &amp;</li>
            <li> You dont even need to sit under the dryer and your hair will be SOFT after you wash this product out..</li>
            <li> and i noticed my hair was STILL soft..</li>
            <li> but i keep coming back to this because it is really making a difference in the end product.</li>
            <li> It stops shedding completely.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and it just seems more nourished than usual after just one use!</li>
            <li> After roller setting my hair my hair still felt soft days later my hair still feels soft espically my new growth.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned in previous reviews, I am loyal to the Alter Ego line of products.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this because of the price, but did so anyway after reading so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> wash my hair, comb it out with a large toothed comb, and towel dry it.</li>
            <li> This is my new staple deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have very damaged dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I texlaxed my 4b protein sensitive, low porosity hair after 10 years being natural.</li>
            <li> My hair is so smooth, very minimal shedding, and although my hair is still wet</li>
            <li> I only used it twice so far</li>
            <li> fast shipping and came waaaaay before expected shipping date</li>
            <li> and it left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My 4a/b is left soft and moisturized after use..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just pretty average</li>
            <li> It worked the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the only thing that worked so far.</li>
            <li> And this is the only conditioner that leaves my hair hydrated, shinny and soft.</li>
            <li> If you have serious hair shedding problems, I strongly suggest you try this product.</li>
            <li> If your hair is this kind then you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> but it feels very soft and healthy after this mask, like you just had some expensive treatment at</li>
            <li> When I style my hair now, I always have to really brush my edges very carefully so that I don&#x27;t look like a porcupine.    </li>
            <li> It helps to actually leave the product in for the full 15-20 mins and then condition as usual.</li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed the shedding slowed down for about 4 days then it started back with a vengeance.</li>
            <li> I figured maybe after more applications it will begin to slow down the shedding problem.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday as a deep conditioner, added a little olive oil to it and BAM!</li>
            <li> I have straight hair however after a dying it, it became a little bit coarse.  </li>
            <li> I have long naturally curly hair that can become dry and brittle from the heat, sun chlorine and salt water on my travel adventures.</li>
            <li> Shedding stopped completely after using it every other day for a month.</li>
            <li> I use only on my scalp and keep it on for as long as I can while I shower.  </li>
            <li> and it cannot be left on hair for long periods of time without drying it out.</li>
            <li> It left my hair shinny but not really soft.</li>
            <li> Especially treated hair,and or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I rinse then air dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li> I just blow dry and flat iron once a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Those days are long gone!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I mix it with other conditioners or add essential oils to it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely damaged and now I see it differently.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried other products in between when I was strapped for cash, but I always come back to Alter-ego.  </li>
            <li> This treatment even helped to moisturize my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I have dry, chemically-treated and colored hair.  </li>
            <li> I applied this product to my dry hair and sat under the steamer.</li>
            <li> It is a must use for anyone who has dry hair, heat styled hair or color treated.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> but dry..</li>
            <li> So I thought it would dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li> This is what you will need if your hair is dry and needs some attention.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and flat iron my hair every other week</li>
            <li> I use this every time I shampoo, which is about twice a week (thank you, Oribe dry shampoo for keeping oil at bay!).  </li>
            <li> I am a black female with some mix blood</li>
            <li> I have type 3b hair and am a black female.  </li>
            <li> I had very dry, overprocessed hair.  </li>
            <li> Wow, my hair is usually fragile and hard to detangle even after steaming, but this time my hair was like butter!</li>
            <li> I also suggest that every few washings, you leave it in for 15 minutes for extra moisterizing.  </li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday as a conditioner and use it as a leave in when in need of a &#x27;deep treatment&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for roughly two months and the improvements keep coming.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need gel, hairspray or any of the other countless number of hair products I was putting in my hair to try and tame my curls.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.-</li>
            <li> It made my hair softer than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I tried other products like Kera care emergency treatment (worked, but still had some shedding.  </li>
            <li> M stylist told me that my hair would begin to shed due to the anethesia in my system.  </li>
            <li> I tried other products</li>
            <li> Other conditioners you can leave on</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very upset.</li>
            <li> So far my shedding has decreased somewhat.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair when I&#x27;m too lazy to go under the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I use this with the shampoo and you can see less breakage in my hair.</li>
            <li> I typically try to stay with all-natural, organic ingredients, which this is not.  </li>
            <li> There is less shredding when I detangle my hair</li>
            <li> All in all, It&#x27;s expensive, but highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and i have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair texture is 4a/b with kinks and a lot of tight coils, so maybe this product isn&#x27;t meant for people with my hair type?    </li>
            <li> After I used the product my hair was really dry and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> I am a mixed girl from NYC with confused hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner damaged and broke off the edges (along the front) of my hair to approximately 1/4 inch long.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I would revist it and used it this past Sunday.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the review, but thats the only results I got while using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past when my hair was shedding.  </li>
            <li> Now my hair is growing like crazy and soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a treatment to replace my protein conditioner when I wanted to add strength without the hard after math.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experiance hardly any shedding or breakage.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find a conditioner that works for my hair or that detangles my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> recommend using it as a leave-in conditioner for thick, curly hair types, like myself.</li>
            <li> It has a very fragranced smell which some people hate</li>
            <li> Less expensive too...</li>
            <li> This product is seriously,</li>
            <li> It made it worse...</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Sad</li>
            <li> Try it, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> The product is on the expensive side</li>
            <li> And for those who think it&#x27;s expensive: yes, compared to Suave, but no compared to just about anything else.  </li>
            <li> , IS EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.  </li>
            <li> My hair still shed, but it wasn&#x27;t as bad.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the product is bad</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Alter ego products before and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(((</li>
            <li> Im very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> My hair has been shedding terribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Shedding stopped completely after using it every other day for a month. I use it like a conditioner, after shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner by far. I use this after a deep condition with the Mega Tec. I have had no shedding at all since using this comditioner. My hair is supper soft. I leave it in for 2 hours or more. I rinse then air dry and flat iron. My hair is flowy and boucy. It&#x27;s a must have in my hair regimine. Amazon has the best price by far.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a treatment to replace my protein conditioner when I wanted to add strength without the hard after math. I used to hear about this product when I was younger so I thought I would revist it and used it this past Sunday. I shampooed, applied this and let it sit for 2 hours (not on purpose) without heat while I did some tasks around the house. While rinising it out not ONE HAIR came out, NOT ONE!. MY hair was soft, had body and felt strong. I applied my favorite dominican leave in, rollser set and when I was dry my hair felt fabulous. I am very pleased with how my hair came out. I know that this product has a smell but I don&#x27;t have a sensitive nose so it didn&#x27;t bother me. If you do hopefully you can get past the odor because the product is great.</li>
            <li> I started buying this conditioner because my hair stylist used all of alter ego&#x27;s products. This stuff lasts a long time so it&#x27;s a good buy in my book</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for over a year and cannot say enough about it.  I wash my hair every week with the Alter Ego Prevention Shampoo and use this conditioner after washing, I leave it on for 15 mins. and then rinse out.  This product may be costly but it&#x27;s well worth it.  I&#x27;m a fan forever.</li>
            <li> This product is the best on the market. If you have serious hair shedding problems, I strongly suggest you try this product. You will notice a shine and softness the first time you use it. Best of all the shedding will STOP after the first use. Very pricey but hey........isn&#x27;t your hair worth it?</li>
            <li> My hair is full, soft, and healthy because of alter ego products. If you don&#x27;t buy the shampoo, you must get the conditioner. It leaves you hair so soft and bouncy. If you don&#x27;t relax your hair often, like me, buy the leave-in conditioner so you can comb through it. I just blow dry and flat iron once a week. Hair salons use this product and charge an arm and leg. Now I only go to the salon to get my ends trimmed.</li>
            <li> Say good bye to shedding and hello to strong and soft hair! This treatment even helped to moisturize my dry scalp. I applied it to my hair and massaged into my scalp; I let is set for 45 mins with no heat. The results were just as promised! I will try it next time with heat just to compare the results. Also, it does not smell like garlic, so please do not let the name turn you off. This conditioner will always be at in my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes of saving money and still getting the effects of garlic for the hair. This product is not one that I would recommend to a friend. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Since I tried this product I feel like i can&#x27;t live without it. I&#x27;ve tried many other products out there and no other leaves my hair like that. It&#x27;s so brilliant and soft for the whole week. This product states that it is ideal to use on treated hair, such as bleached, dyed and permed and it&#x27;s definitely true. If your hair is this kind then you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. You will see the difference.</li>
            <li> The Alter EGO Hot Oil Treatment with Garlic is a great product for my hair. As soon as I touched the product, I could feel the softness of the treatment. I always like to leave the conditioner in for at least a couple of hours to give my hair a good deep condition treatment. As soon as I applied the product, I could already feel it begin to work. Before rinsing the conditioner out, my hair felt soft and wonderful. After blow drying my hair, it was soft and had a nice shine. Overtime, I have used the product weekly and the conditioner has helped my hair grow. I would recommend buying this product to maintain healthy hair and promote growth.</li>
            <li> This the same product that my hair dressor uses on my hair. My hair is healthy and feels great.</li>
            <li> I only used it twice so far but right away u noticed the shine and extra bounce in my hair. Breakage is still there I bought the 1000ml jar so we&#x27;ll see at the end how it works out. Wonderful scent would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely rocks!!!  I have used other conditioners before, even \\&quot;higher end\\&quot; products, but nothing compares to Alter Ego Garlic Hot Oil Treatment.  It does in no way smell like garlic.  As soon as you apply it your hair gets so silky smooth.  I am mixed raced (African American, Cherokee and European) and it works the best on my hair type.   All the frizz vanishes, no tangles when you comb your hair.  People at work like the silky shine of my hair.  This product is the best kept secret in beauty.  It is just like a lot of good stuff that comes from Italy, i.e. handbags, jewelry and now hair products.   I highly recommend this product!!! Love it!!!! Buy the big size lasts for months...</li>
            <li> This product did not work.  After I used the product my hair was really dry and hard to manage. Sorry for the review, but thats the only results I got while using this product.</li>
            <li> excellent product. is very good for the hair, I recommend it, leave your hair soft. Highly recommended. My daughters and I love it</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, this conditioner damaged my hair.  The conditioner damaged and broke off the edges (along the front) of my hair to approximately 1/4 inch long.  Needless to say, I was very upset. I have medium length hair.  I was really surprised b/c I didn&#x27;t think that any conditioner was strong enough to actually damage and break the hair such as this product.  I Will not ever use this product again or recommend to anyone.  When I style my hair now, I always have to really brush my edges very carefully so that I don&#x27;t look like a porcupine.    Sad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to ever do this. I read reviews but I felt I needed to in ref to this conditioner. As most of us do, we switch shampoo and conditioners. I always wanted one I could just stick with and now I have. I was worried about the garlic title, don&#x27;t be...you cannot smell it at all. The first application of this, I felt the difference. I did leave it on for 10-15 mins so shave, do whatever you have to  do but do leave it in for that time period. My hair felt like silk afterwards. So much so that I didn&#x27;t need leave in afterwards. I had my best friend (who is my worst critic) say my hair has never looked better, thicker, healthier. I&#x27;m a product type person who researches EVERYTHING! Try it, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> This product has me lost for words, I can&#x27;t explain how great my hair looks. I used it for the first time yesterday as a deep conditioner, added a little olive oil to it and BAM! My hair is looking the bomb, I shampoo my hair, sat under the dryer for 30 mins w/ alter eo and rinsed. I blow dry and flat iron my hair every other week and I have natural African-American 4a hair, so moisture is imperative to me!. I didn&#x27;t experiance hardly any shedding or breakage. End results were very shiny, full volume, bouncy and healthy hair. You must try it to believe it! I will definitely make this part of my deep conditioning regimen.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It lasts long and its a great detangler for African American hair.  I detangle my hair while the conditioner is in it and it and it stays that way once I wash it out!</li>
            <li> Great product!I will never use any other deep treatment. Your hair comes out really soft regardless the type of hair. The shipping was very fast as well.</li>
            <li> I am a product addict and love trying new conditioners. I am biracial and have curly 3C hair. I googled Dominican used conditioners and I found this product. I was thrilled with the results. It made my hair softer than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve tried. My fingers ran right through my hair. My hair had a beautiful shine and a silky, softness to it after I blow dried and flat ironed it. I am hooked!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I used the product and it left my hair soft, shiny, and super managable.  When I combed my hair there were no hairs in the comb.  Product works well and is very nourishing to the hair.</li>
            <li> great service! fast shipping and came waaaaay before expected shipping date &#x3D;) i was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt; I also LOVE this product. it hydrates my hair and after continued use, i saw a decrease in my shedding. This is the second tub that i&#x27;ve bought and last me about a year and i have thick long hair. you can not smell garlic either so dont be put off by the garlic word.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  After dyeing my hair, it my hair started breaking anytime i washed it.  I tried other products like Kera care emergency treatment (worked, but still had some shedding.  After using this treatment for only 2 weeks, i don&#x27;t even see a strand of hair in the comb when i comb my hair.  This product really works.  It stops hair breakage</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and have since run out.  My hair is not the same.  With one use, your hair is soft, manageable and very shiney.  The product is on the expensive side but I don&#x27;t mind paying for products that actually work.  This one does.  Do not be put off by the scent.  It is quite mild and your hair will NOT smell like garlic after using the product. I have naturally curly hair and this moisterizers and makes my hair easy to manage.  I did not use it every time I showered but once every 3-4 washings.  I ran out of the 500 ml after 2-3 months so I am now going to order the 1000 ml.  My hair is long so I might have used more than most.  I also suggest that every few washings, you leave it in for 15 minutes for extra moisterizing.  Try it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I had very dry, overprocessed hair.  After using alter ego hot oil treatment, my hair is at its best.  I used it for two weeks along with another dominican hair product; Una bomba, a leave in conditioner. Recommended for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> After about a month of shedding hair problems, I purchased this on a recommendation of a friend.  I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this because of the price, but did so anyway after reading so many positive reviews.  The first time I used this and noticed no change.  I figured maybe after more applications it will begin to slow down the shedding problem.  Well, after finishing the entire container, my hair is still experiencing the same problem at the same rate.  My hair texture is 4a/b with kinks and a lot of tight coils, so maybe this product isn&#x27;t meant for people with my hair type?    I will say that the scent is pleasant(there&#x27;s no smell of garlic).  It seems to soften hair as good as many of the less-expensive deep conditioners that run for under ten dollars, so there&#x27;s really no reason to spend $40 plus shipping for this particular product.</li>
            <li> When I first learned about this product I  thought hey let me try it. I ordered It from amazon not only did it arrive the next day it saved my life. I use it everytime I wash my hair I am a mixed girl from NYC with confused hair. Well with this conditioner  / hot oil treatment my hair is not confused it comes out silky smooth and with out (knots).  My hair Is way more manageable even if I&#x27;m not blowing it out. Overall a good buy for all. I would also say that cren treatment From alter ego also works wonders. Alter ego all the way!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 5 years now and it&#x27;s kept its consistency! I have very fine/naturally curly hair and wanted something that would \\&quot;soften\\&quot; my hair and give it strength. This definitely did the trick. I&#x27;ve been using it as a leave in conditioner and found that it  has loosened my curls, which doesn&#x27;t bother me because I&#x27;ve done the keratin treatment several times since I first started using Impac Ego. What I have found to work best is to use a very small amount of the product as it comes on pretty thick. All in all, It&#x27;s expensive, but highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product fulfilled with what I expected, I feel very satisfied with the purchase of this product. thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
            <li> I am currently 16 weeks post relaxer. A LHCF buddy sent me a sample of this product some time ago and I loved it. I decided to revisit the product in hopes of extending the amount of time between relaxers. I was able to comb through the new growth and my hair was soft and nicely scented. Well worth the money...</li>
            <li> Great for stopping breakage. I use this with the shampoo and you can see less breakage in my hair. I&#x27;ve used Alter ego products before and have never been disappointed. I would definitely recommend to others looking for a great conditioner</li>
            <li> My old hair dresser introduced me, but relocated and had to order.  Hair stays soft and silky. Very healthy results.  I use with plastic bag for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is famous for giving people unbelievably soft hair and the rumors are true. I am an African American and I am hair product buff. Design, Affirm, Exclusives...this beats them all. Less expensive too...Dominican products are the secret to the African American community they&#x27;re awesome. But not all them, some of them require the dubee/roller-brush technique to have that affect. But this one I vouch for, regardless of what technique one uses the results are the same. .</li>
            <li> This treatment helps to stop shedding. I&#x27;ve had better results using heat (i.e., putting on plastic cap &amp; sitting under dryer for 20 minutes). It has a pleasant smell; no garlic odor at all. Noticeable difference from the first use &amp; improved with each treatment. Stick with it, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Best hair conditioner on earth. I have long naturally curly hair that can become dry and brittle from the heat, sun chlorine and salt water on my travel adventures. I use this stuff everyday as a conditioner and use it as a leave in when in need of a &#x27;deep treatment&#x27;. The results are amazing and I recommend this product to anyone in need of a good deep conditioner for stressed hair.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I shampoo, which is about twice a week (thank you, Oribe dry shampoo for keeping oil at bay!).  It has dramatically helped with shedding, combined with Avalon Organics Thickening, Biotin shampoo.  I use only on my scalp and keep it on for as long as I can while I shower.  I typically try to stay with all-natural, organic ingredients, which this is not.  But, it works so well that I still use.  Hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> As an African American woman with relaxed hair I have come to find that if you use A LOT of  this product it will make your hair extremely silky and easy to detangle. I haven&#x27;t seen too much improvement in the way of breakage, but I&#x27;m hoping that I will now that I am using alot more of it. I have mid back length hair and this keeps it healthy and smelling nice :)</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair and I&#x27;m on my 4th jar of this conditioner. It stops hair breakage as promised. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I use it as a leave in conditioner! My hair stylist recommend this. I have thick, curly hair and finally I&#x27;ve found a leave in conditioner that controls frizz and defines my curls. Up until now, I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on hair products that never work for me. I&#x27;ve tried it all! My main problem was that my curls were frizzing up and losing their definition as the day wore on. I&#x27;d always carry a clip or a ponytail band so that I could tie my hair up once the frizz set in. Those days are long gone! I&#x27;ve been using Alter EGO for the last five months and it&#x27;s a permanent part of my hair care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair, comb it out with a large toothed comb, and towel dry it. Then, I apply Alter EGO and leave it on. Viola. I&#x27;m done. I use it as a leave in conditioner/styling product. I don&#x27;t need gel, hairspray or any of the other countless number of hair products I was putting in my hair to try and tame my curls. Every day is a good hair day now! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my curls. Added bonus, this stuff smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using it as a leave-in conditioner for thick, curly hair types, like myself.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last month and has since used it twice. My hair has been shedding terribly. If I continue to pull at my hair all day - hair will come out ALL DAY! Ugh - has been driving me nuts. After the first use I noticed the shedding slowed down for about 4 days then it started back with a vengeance. I used it again a couple weeks ago and the shedding has stopped more. I am hoping after a few more uses the shedding will subside even more,.The product does not smell like garlic at all and it left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff. I&#x27;m using it aroung 3 weeks now. Hair is still falling off... :((( but it feels very soft and healthy after this mask, like you just had some expensive treatment at the salon!&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a very good deep moisteraiser.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past when my hair was shedding.  My hair began shedding again and I decided to give the product another try.  It did help reduce the shedding and made my hair feel very soft.  It helps to actually leave the product in for the full 15-20 mins and then condition as usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month now and along with some hair vitamins, my shedding has stopped some.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.  It didn&#x27;t seem to make my hair very soft once I rinsed it...</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a few weeks. So far my shedding has decreased somewhat. It was recommended for me to use 3 months before I deliver my baby and 3 months after to control post delivery hair shedding. I will follow up later to see if really did work in 6 months.</li>
            <li> Expensive bur works great to reduce breakage and it does not smell at all like garlic. Creamy and wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have dry, chemically-treated and colored hair.  And I&#x27;ve used many different conditioners in my day.   This garlic conditioner is my favorite because my hair feels soft and moisturized after using it.  I was happy to find it for sale online because my hairdresser never has any in stock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this conditioner. I will continue to purchase this product. My 4a/b is left soft and moisturized after use..I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I only use once or twice a month. My hair loves it. Great to fortify and repair damage. Absorbs easily. Your hair will love this. Also stops hair from thinning</li>
            <li> It detangle my curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product is seriously, THE BEST I HAVE TRIED YET. I mixed some coconut oil with it, and the result was fab. My hair is so smooth, very minimal shedding, and although my hair is still wet ( yes I had to post a review immediately after using it), I can see shine and bounce and just awesomeness. I would and will recommend this product to anyone looking for a great moisturizing deep conditioner. The directions say to leave to leave it on for 15 minutes, but I left it on for about an hour or so. I love this product and will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps someone as much as the others have helped me!!</li>
            <li> My hair use to shed a lot since I&#x27;ve been using alter ego it has stop completely. It&#x27;s smells great.</li>
            <li> this is THE BEST hair conditioner. Can be used as a hot oil treatment or as a conditioner. I have used it exclusively for several years after my hair stylist recommended it</li>
            <li> I texlaxed my 4b protein sensitive, low porosity hair after 10 years being natural. My hair has always been hard to moisturize; Most products just lay on my hair. So after relaxing I was determined to continue my healthy hair journey and find products that would work for my hair. Thank God for this product. I bought it initially because all the reviews were saying how soft it makes the hair, not really because it stops shedding. I applied this product to my dry hair and sat under the steamer. Wow, my hair is usually fragile and hard to detangle even after steaming, but this time my hair was like butter! Easy to detangle and it smells wonderful! My hair is soft, shiny and it just seems more nourished than usual after just one use! I roller set my hair and sat under the dryer. My hair looks and feels like it does after a good salon visit. This is my new staple deep conditioner. I pray they don&#x27;t stop making this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I also found my go-to daily conditioner Nexxus humectress moisturizing conditioner! So good too!</li>
            <li> As I mentioned in previous reviews, I am loyal to the Alter Ego line of products. After researching this product I decided to order it. It does not smell like garlic at all. It has a very fragranced smell which some people hate but I love having my hair smell fresh and perfumed :-) The conditioning qualities of this product are exceptional. It leaves m my hair very soft and I can see and feel that it is well conditioned. Sometimes I mix it with other conditioners or add essential oils to it.  Regardless, it is a treat all on its own. I definitely plan to keep this conditioner stocked as one of my conditioning staples.</li>
            <li> Great product, stopped the shedding.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price! :-)  This prodcut is a great value and the value for it is worth it! They also delivered on time which is always nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner in the past &amp; I&#x27;ve always loved it. Unfortunately I was no longer able to find it in the stores so when I found it here I had to order it!! It makes the hair so soft &amp; manageable &amp; the price i paid for the large container was excellent!!!! I give this seller &amp; this product 5 stars!!!  Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! A little goes a long way.-</li>
            <li> I love this product on my hair.  I have straight hair however after a dying it, it became a little bit coarse.  I use this product once a week and it always leave my hair silky.  Don&#x27;t worry, it does not smell like garlic.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at the suggestion of a friend.  I had surgery in November 2008.  M stylist told me that my hair would begin to shed due to the anethesia in my system.  To offset this effect, I used this product.  My hair still shed, but it wasn&#x27;t as bad.  I even received a compliment from my stylist when I was in her shop in December.  She said that the texture of my hair felt great.    My hair is 4a\b, and I am relaxed. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I am incorporating it into my weekly routine.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this conditioner. It has really made a difference in my hair as far as shredding and breakage. I have been using this product for roughly two months and the improvements keep coming. There is less shredding when I detangle my hair and I feel like I am retaining more length. I have a relaxer in my hair, so my strands can get really dry and will break easily. Alter Ego Hot Oil Treatment stops the breakage and hydrates my hair. It smells great, has a silkly consistency, and you get tons of product so it lasts. This conditioner is on the pricey side but it works really well, so I don&#x27;t mind. I liked the conditioner so much I purchased the shampoo as well. I would recommend Alter Ego Hot Oil treatment to anyone, whether or not you have processed or natural hair. Its good stuff.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.....  My hair is extremely damaged and now I see it differently.  I will continue using. I recommend it to everyone....</li>
            <li> You dont even need to sit under the dryer and your hair will be SOFT after you wash this product out..but i recommend you to sit under the dryer..its just one time i didnt have time..and i noticed my hair was STILL soft..This is wonderful...</li>
            <li> This product is great. I use it every two weeks and sit under the dryer about 10 minutes. My hair is also very shiny, bouncy and healthy. I get comments all the time. It is a must use for anyone who has dry hair, heat styled hair or color treated. I tried other products but i keep coming back to this because it is really making a difference in the end product.</li>
            <li> great product recommened to me by my Dominican hairdresser. leaves hair so smooth and healthy. i sometimes leave it in over night but even 15 to 30mins under the dryer is very good</li>
            <li> Ehh...this product can&#x27;t be left in hare as Mizani Hydrafuses may be. This product causes hair to frizz. It does not control frizz and it is rather noticeable. I don&#x27;t think the product is bad it&#x27;s just pretty average and it cannot be left on hair for long periods of time without drying it out. Other conditioners you can leave on and they don&#x27;t dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> My mom liked it. I don&#x27;t think it was a miracle worker, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Best Hair product ever. If you want your hair to look good this is the best stuff there is. I have been using this for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> I saw results from the very first use! Before, I would run my hand through my hair and have strands between my fingers, after using the Oil Treatment there wasn&#x27;t a strand in sight. It does everything it promises, decreases shedding, makes hair softer, and it will flow in the wind honey! I get compliments on the &amp;#34;health&amp;#34; of my hair after using it. I&#x27;m so happy to finally find a product that works! TRY! TRY! TRY!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product since it had pretty good reviews..I wasnt sure about it though..But decided to give it a try...I was so excited...I have curly hair..but dry..I needed a good moisterizer..But this didnt.help at all...It made it worse...Im very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair (light brunette, moderately coarse, long, decently thick) feel amazing.  After use, my hair is immediately softer and silkier.  The longer I am able to leave it in, the better.  I use it every day and have no problems with build-up.  I bought it to compliment Eqyss Mega-Tek (bought to help strengthen my hair).  I didn&#x27;t have a lot of luck with the Mega-Tek, but I ended up loving Alter Ego.  It is one product I cannot do without.  And for those who think it&#x27;s expensive: yes, compared to Suave, but no compared to just about anything else.  Once, I ran out of Alter Ego and decided just to go buy a \\&quot;hydrating mask\\&quot; from my local beauty store.  At first I looked at the Keratase (um, over $50 for like 6oz?) and eventually I ended up buying a mask by Alterna Bamboo ($25 for 5oz) and it didn&#x27;t do a darn thing for my hair.  It ended up in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum: Alter ego is amazing and is a good value.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff. Ive tried other products over the years and nothing makes my hair shinier and strong.  I was shedding at a fast clip after weening off medications. And someone from work suggested this product.  I bought the energizing shampoo and  deep conditioner. I blow dry my hair when I&#x27;m too lazy to go under the dryer.  My hair feels so light and airy.  My hair seems to just absorbed it like a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m African-American and wear my hair permed. So I thought it would dry my hair out.  It worked the complete opposite. Ive tried other products in between when I was strapped for cash, but I always come back to Alter-ego.  Then my hair comes back to life.  It is a pricey for my pocket book.  But for me its worth every dime.  Now my hair is growing like crazy and soft and manageable.  You have to try different products to see what works best.</li>
            <li> I Love Alter Ego!!!! My hair is so soft &amp; healthy, I enjoy washing my hair every week, this product  really works, I would definitely recommend to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a good hair product.</li>
            <li> I WILL RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT, I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE, THIS ALTER EGO IS WONDERFUL&lt;br /&gt;LEAVE YOUR HAIR SON SOFT, SHINING AND BEAUTIFUL TRY THIS PRODUCT AND YOU NEVER WILL&lt;br /&gt;NEVER REGRET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M SO HAPPY WITH MY PRODUCT AND THE SHAMPOO IS AMAINZING TOO, IS EXPENSIVE But it is worth.</li>
            <li> i need to buy more but i need the money for it. Kept my hair from shedding and its just a great product. worth every dime.</li>
            <li> It left my hair shinny but not really soft. The snail slime I have works better for me. I wish I could get a refund but I have opened it</li>
            <li> This is the only Deep Conditioner that I would buy for my hair. I am a black female with some mix blood lol my hair is really thick. It is hard for me to find a conditioner that works for my hair or that detangles my hair. When I use Alter Ego my hair was so manageable and so healthy and shiny felt like silk. I love it. Try it and I know you will love it too. I tried almost everything and this is one of the only thing that worked so far.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and I try to tell as many people as I can about it.  I have type 3b hair and am a black female.  I can deep condition with this for 15-30 minutes.  (I don&#x27;t do more because any conditioner in my hair for longer than that usually starts making my hair feel crunchy or overloaded with too much protein.  Whenever I feel like I&#x27;m shedding too much, this wonder treatment limits the shedding.  Its definitely one of my staples and the smell is not bad at all.  I usually alternate between this and coconut oil</li>
            <li> This is a really good deep conditoner i have herd so many different thing as to what garlic can do for your hair ,i know it helps with sheddin...Anyway i was searching for a really good deep conditioner and stumbleded upon this ,dont let the prce phase u,its worth it!!!!!, After deep conditioning my hair for about 15-20 min and i washed it out,My hair felt so soft and nice!!!!! After roller setting my hair my hair still felt soft days later my hair still feels soft espically my new growth. I also colored my hair so deep conditioning is very important!!! I LOVE IT and its my 1st time purchasing it!</li>
            <li> works really well...I would recommend this to anyone....love it!!</li>
            <li> I have very damaged dry hair.  And this is the only conditioner that leaves my hair hydrated, shinny and soft.</li>
            <li> This is what you will need if your hair is dry and needs some attention. This product has brought my hair back</li>
            <li> Great price great shipping. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great hair treatment, but must be followed by alter ego&#x27;s intensive energizing lotion. definitely recommend it. Especially treated hair,and or dry hair.</li>
            <li> very good conditioner</li>
            <li> My hair suffered from chemical and heat damage. Well, this cleared things up in 2 uses. Now this is  staple in my hair care regimen. It stops shedding completely.</li>
