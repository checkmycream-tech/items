    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I use this nail file and found it to be the best ever made.  </li>
            <li>Best tool out there for filing your nails!</li>
            <li>every which way, I looked closely at my nails and saw they were perfect.  </li>
            <li>I bought this nail file in a drug store and it was the best nail file I had ever used</li>
            <li>This is the best file I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>the great thing is that it will not split the nails and it leaves the edges sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This filer is great.</li>
            <li>this is a really good tool.</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because with great effort I was able to eventually file my nails--the &amp;#34;better than nothing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this file</li>
            <li>Now I have 3 of them, just to make sure I can find one when I need it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s never happened to me and, honestly</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best nail file.  </li>
            <li>This keeps my nails from splitting and leaves a nice polished edge.  </li>
            <li>Was very happy to be able to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>As I file, using the pad of my finger, the metal cuts through the top layer of skin -- as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li>I suppose it works ok on nails.</li>
            <li>They were so interesting, I bought one.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re indestructible and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Gotta love</li>
            <li>I love these nail files.  </li>
            <li>you are able to put into your purse.  </li>
            <li>I love this file.</li>
            <li>And since these were not working (and nail hardeners didn&#x27;t work, either) I had given up and resorted to just clipping all my nails as short possible--not very attractive, and I couldn&#x27;t even pick up pins when I tried to sew.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as they say for the polishing part, but very good at filing the nail down.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not all that good at filing my nails as I&#x27;m a real low-maintenance lady when it comes to nail care.</li>
            <li>Whatever it is made of, it is porous, which means it cannot be adequately disinfected to safely use for more than one patient.  </li>
            <li>Best I have ever used hands down no contest.  </li>
            <li>I clip my nails, then file them smooth all in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It trims the nails and leaves them feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>I happened to see this  file at a CVS and on impulse bought it, primarily because of the Revlon name, and too, it&#x27;s unique look sort of drew me in.</li>
            <li>It leaves my nails smooth and works quickly because you can file in both directions evenly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally true.</li>
            <li>In fact, so good that if you&#x27;re not careful, it&#x27;s easy,  with no force at all, to rip off a large strip of skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this file to use on my toenails, and the very first time I used it</li>
            <li>The words Revlon used to describe the product were mis-leading because it made it sound like it was &amp;#34;100% stainless steel,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Rare in an affordable product these days.</li>
            <li>Hmm - yes, that&#x27;s true, the filing surface is stainless.  </li>
            <li>good that the skin around the nails get a bit of filing down as well.</li>
            <li>I thought surely it would take all afternoon at the nail salon to bring my nails back to anything presentable.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely adore this nail file!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any other kind now.</li>
            <li>It was one of those very fine slices that doesn&#x27;t start bleeding right away (and didn&#x27;t hurt much), so I didn&#x27;t notice it until I had sliced the same toe a few more times, and it started gushing blood.  </li>
            <li>The edges of the metal overlap a bit too much.</li>
            <li>occurrs to me that this would work REALLY well for removing calluses in a pedicure.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, REVLON.</li>
            <li>but you better be careful.</li>
            <li>However, I found it to be lacking any real grit.</li>
            <li>the texture on the file gives such a smooth look to her nails.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>Works great as a file, but they need to make it less rough on your skin around your nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what it is - perhaps some kind of fiberglass or composite material.  </li>
            <li>From an infection-control point of view, this product would be fine for 1-person use (as long as all nails are healthy) but is not suitable for using with more than one individual due to its materials &amp; construction not allowing it to be adequately disinfected between patients.  </li>
            <li>Because you can file and and smooth pretty much at the same time, the process does not take that long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the people are doing with the file that gave it a bad rating, but it is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for smoothing and shining the ridges that I get on the surface of my nails.</li>
            <li>I read a review complaining of a sharp edge, I believe this to be a flaw in manufacturing as my file is smooth all around.</li>
            <li>With other files, I had to use something afterwards to smooth out the nail edges.  </li>
            <li>so I want a new one.</li>
            <li>Now, three months or so from that day, all ten of my nails are long, strong, and evenly matched.</li>
            <li>you do insist on using this file (I will say the actual nail filing part went pretty well)</li>
            <li>While pondering the unbelievable condition of my nails, I thought, well, I&#x27;ll just smooth a little off the top of my nails for now.</li>
            <li>Finally, when at home I was able to focus on my fingernails a little and could not believe what I saw.  </li>
            <li>The cuticles, the shine - everything was prettier than any professional manicure I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>I found my old one a couple of weeks after getting this one and it is smoother along the edges.</li>
            <li>natural nails</li>
            <li>Still does, I just cracked my old one by accident</li>
            <li>3 times in the product description Revlon states, &amp;#34;100% stainless steel filing surface for lasting performance.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>In addition, the seam where the stainless face and the non-stainless back join together is another place where microorganisms could collect &amp; escape disinfecting efforts.  </li>
            <li>This one does take the length of but a takes a few more strikes back and forth but</li>
            <li>It dosen&#x27;t work nearly as well as the older one, the groves are different.</li>
            <li>This looks like the older model of this file but it is not the same.  </li>
            <li>there is no other nail file on the market that works this welll for natural nails that split.  </li>
            <li>If this new item is a Revlon product, they need to get back to what they were once creating.  </li>
            <li>Both sides were fairly mild and will not manage any heavy duty filing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>During that time everyone was so busy saving my life that manicures were the last thing on anyone&#x27;s mind.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because the metal part and the black backing don&#x27;t line up exactly on all sides.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned about this file after reading the many reviews saying that the metal part was not positioned properly and was cutting into the skin in most cases not drawing blood and in a few cases was drawing blood.</li>
            <li>At first I was pleased with the way it performed as a file, but like my other reviewers have mentioned, there&#x27;s something really wrong with the way it&#x27;s put together, because in the process of filing, it ends up slicing off bits of your finger flesh.</li>
            <li>The nails of the thumb and first finger on my right hand would never grow much beyond the pink base of each nail bed before they would split vertically, sometimes extending into the quick.</li>
            <li>This file looks and feels like it will last forever and apparently comes with a lifetime guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The other reviewers are right, this is rough.</li>
            <li>A few days before I was suddenly hospitalized in early 2011 and sedated in AICU for 28 days while fighting ARDS, I had been browsing for anything new in the drugstore fingernail department and saw these files.  </li>

            <li> A few days before I was suddenly hospitalized in early 2011 and sedated in AICU for 28 days while fighting ARDS, I had been browsing for anything new in the drugstore fingernail department and saw these files.  </li>
            <li> file that are pretty common everywhere.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to open the package until 2 months later after the aforementioned coma and rehab hospital stints.  </li>
            <li> I went as far as to try to slide the edge along the vice in the garage, to bend the edge slightly inward, but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I bought one at a Walgreen&#x27;s a long time ago, and they stopped carrying them in stores.</li>
            <li> The other eight nails were constantly snagging and ripping off.</li>
            <li> BUT, what they don&#x27;t bother to state is that the back is NOT stainless!  </li>
            <li> It gets all the dry skin and nail pieces</li>
            <li> BUT you do have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> It causes a tiny bit of overlap in places and sawing back and forth with that thin metal layer against your flesh can tear it open.  </li>
            <li> I simply used my kitchen knife sharpener rod, and rubbed the sharp edge against it a few times...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even filing anything, just switched it to the other hand to toss into the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I did not have any jagged or sharp edged nails when I finished.</li>
            <li> So, I was prepared to look this file over very carefully and be very careful using it.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> The surface of the file isn&#x27;t at all sharp, but the edge (where it means the black backing) is ridiculously sharp.</li>
            <li> and they seem to be hard to find saw I bought a 2nd.  </li>
            <li> so they are less inclined to split.</li>
            <li> WHEN I MOVED TO A NEW CITY, SOMEONE DIDN&#x27;T REALIZE ITS VALUE AND FAILED TO PACK IT UP WITH MY GOODS TO BE MOVED.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering buying a handful of these dandy little tools to give as stocking-stuffers this Christmas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few moths now</li>
            <li> , I use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> Yes, if the plastic back is not EXACTLY glued to the file, you can have a sharp edge of metal that can end up cutting you...  </li>
            <li> The edges of this file are very SHARP!!!  </li>
            <li> I saw my skin on my fingernails being roughed up and broken a bit.</li>
            <li> I have difficult nails.  </li>
            <li> The metal seems to be very tough.</li>
            <li> I was shocked and amazed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed that Revlon has stopped making it.</li>
            <li> The edges will cut the crap out of you.  </li>
            <li> A pumice stone is pathetic in comparison.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Traction, or the sand paper effect is almost non-existent.  When filing my nail, I only get traction in one direction.  When I get traction in the opposite direction, it is not enough.  I will not purchase this again.  In 2012, I bought a file that has the same look.  The manufacturer is not printed on the back, so I have no way of knowing if it was also a Revlon product.  But it was snow A+ product.  I wish I could find it again.  If this new item is a Revlon product, they need to get back to what they were once creating.  This current item is for the birds.  I gave it 2 stars because with great effort I was able to eventually file my nails--the &amp;#34;better than nothing&amp;#34; syndrome.</li>
            <li> The edges of the metal overlap a bit too much. As I file, using the pad of my finger, the metal cuts through the top layer of skin -- as others have mentioned. I went as far as to try to slide the edge along the vice in the garage, to bend the edge slightly inward, but it didn&#x27;t work. The metal seems to be very tough. If only the metal part were a bit shorter than the pad it&#x27;s affixed to.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT ONE OF THESE  FILES IN 1985 AND USED IT FOR 3O YEARS. WHEN I MOVED TO A NEW CITY, SOMEONE DIDN&#x27;T REALIZE ITS VALUE AND FAILED TO PACK IT UP WITH MY GOODS TO BE MOVED.  FINALLY I HAVE A REPLACEMENT, AND ALL IS WELL AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I suppose it works ok on nails. Not quite as good as they say for the polishing part, but very good at filing the nail down. -So good that the skin around the nails get a bit of filing down as well. In fact, so good that if you&#x27;re not careful, it&#x27;s easy,  with no force at all, to rip off a large strip of skin. I speak from personal experience, after just spending a while getting the bleeding to stop.  I wasn&#x27;t even filing anything, just switched it to the other hand to toss into the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It occurrs to me that this would work REALLY well for removing calluses in a pedicure.  A pumice stone is pathetic in comparison.  I think if it was advertised for that purpose I would give it 4 or 5 stars instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this file because frankly I am a man that likes things to be efficient. This file saves me time and energy by working as advertised. It leaves my nails smooth and works quickly because you can file in both directions evenly. I read a review complaining of a sharp edge, I believe this to be a flaw in manufacturing as my file is smooth all around. This file works so well I don&#x27;t even clip my nails beforehand, I simply maintain the length with the file. I recommend it to anyone. The grain of the file also prevents my nails from cracking like standard files are known to do.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about this file after reading the many reviews saying that the metal part was not positioned properly and was cutting into the skin in most cases not drawing blood and in a few cases was drawing blood. So, I was prepared to look this file over very carefully and be very careful using it.&lt;br /&gt;What I have found is that I must use a file differently than these people because it was never in a position to come in contact with my skin. This file looks and feels like it will last forever and apparently comes with a lifetime guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;I used this file yesterday on all my nails and I did not have any jagged or sharp edged nails when I finished. Because you can file and and smooth pretty much at the same time, the process does not take that long. All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this file</li>
            <li> I use this nail file and found it to be the best ever made.  I clip my nails, then file them smooth all in about 5 minutes.  Best tool out there for filing your nails!</li>
            <li> A few days before I was suddenly hospitalized in early 2011 and sedated in AICU for 28 days while fighting ARDS, I had been browsing for anything new in the drugstore fingernail department and saw these files.  They were so interesting, I bought one.  I didn&#x27;t get to open the package until 2 months later after the aforementioned coma and rehab hospital stints.  During that time everyone was so busy saving my life that manicures were the last thing on anyone&#x27;s mind.  Finally, when at home I was able to focus on my fingernails a little and could not believe what I saw.  I thought surely it would take all afternoon at the nail salon to bring my nails back to anything presentable.  While pondering the unbelievable condition of my nails, I thought, well, I&#x27;ll just smooth a little off the top of my nails for now. Soon I noticed an actual flurry of stuff floating to the floor from my nails, and, no longer than 90 seconds of this absent-mindedly filing back &amp; forth every which way, I looked closely at my nails and saw they were perfect.  The cuticles, the shine - everything was prettier than any professional manicure I&#x27;ve had.  All without even looking at my hands. I was shocked and amazed.  I carry one in my purse, the car, my desk - everywhere else.  They&#x27;re indestructible and I love them.  Thanks, REVLON.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail file in a drug store and it was the best nail file I had ever used but then I lost it! I ordered another one through this site and although it&#x27;s the same file it does cut you! I couldn&#x27;t understand what people were talking about when I read the reviews before I ordered mine but it&#x27;s totally true. I don&#x27;t know if these are seconds or what but you better be careful. I found my old one a couple of weeks after getting this one and it is smoother along the edges. It doesn&#x27;t cut me at all.</li>
            <li> This nail file takes some getting used to as we are used to filing our nails with a harsher grit file that takes the length off faster.  This one does take the length of but a takes a few more strikes back and forth but the great thing is that it will not split the nails and it leaves the edges sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;l I&#x27;ve had mine for a few moths now, I use it a few times a week and I&#x27;ve never cut myself at all.  Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t wear out so it save you money by not having to constantly be replacing it.  Gotta love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For natural nails this is a really good tool.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used hands down no contest.  BUT you do have to be careful.  The edges will cut the crap out of you.  It&#x27;s because the metal part and the black backing don&#x27;t line up exactly on all sides.  It causes a tiny bit of overlap in places and sawing back and forth with that thin metal layer against your flesh can tear it open.  I found one end that matched and I just used that.  Worked for me for years.  Still does, I just cracked my old one by accident so I want a new one.</li>
            <li> Overall I like the size and shape of the file. However, I found it to be lacking any real grit. Both sides were fairly mild and will not manage any heavy duty filing.&lt;br /&gt;I this the description should include this information.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an actual file, I would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do and does it well. Rare in an affordable product these days. Definately reccommended.</li>
            <li> I love these nail files.  I have been using them for quite a while.  The price is quite a bit lower than retail.....I purchased them online because the only place I could find them was at a CVS and they were often out.  I like them because they do not pull so you are able to put into your purse.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely adore this nail file! I bought one at a Walgreen&#x27;s a long time ago, and they stopped carrying them in stores. And, of course, I lost mine. Was very happy to be able to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> This filer is great. My wife specifically asked for this one after she had it for sometime and then lost it. She loves how it is so durable and the texture on the file gives such a smooth look to her nails. Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this file. I have no idea why it was discontinued.  I&#x27;m a massage therapist and have to file almost every day. This is the best file I&#x27;ve ever used. It gets all the dry skin and nail pieces and I don&#x27;t have to use anything else!</li>
            <li> Fast service but did not realize it was metal laminated on to plastic... But I don&#x27;t find any problem with the nail file as it works well</li>
            <li> The other reviewers are right, this is rough. I saw my skin on my fingernails being roughed up and broken a bit. Works great as a file, but they need to make it less rough on your skin around your nails.</li>
            <li> This looks like the older model of this file but it is not the same.  It dosen&#x27;t work nearly as well as the older one, the groves are different.</li>
            <li> The edges of this file are very SHARP!!!  I bought this file to use on my toenails, and the very first time I used it, I sliced my toe.  It was one of those very fine slices that doesn&#x27;t start bleeding right away (and didn&#x27;t hurt much), so I didn&#x27;t notice it until I had sliced the same toe a few more times, and it started gushing blood.  A half-box of tissues and several band-aids later, I threw this thing in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do insist on using this file (I will say the actual nail filing part went pretty well), may I recommend using it in conjunction with this product?&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0001I8ZSU Flowery Styptic Pencil 1/4 Oz. Stick]]</li>
            <li> I picked this file up at my local CVS recently, hoping that it might last longer than the emery boards I regularly wear out. At first I was pleased with the way it performed as a file, but like my other reviewers have mentioned, there&#x27;s something really wrong with the way it&#x27;s put together, because in the process of filing, it ends up slicing off bits of your finger flesh. The surface of the file isn&#x27;t at all sharp, but the edge (where it means the black backing) is ridiculously sharp. If you keep your nails at all short, I cannot recommend this file. Revlon, I&#x27;m amazed that you continue to sell this file.</li>
            <li> Miracle of miracles--this funny-looking file has totally healed two chronically splitting nails I&#x27;ve had for over a year. The nails of the thumb and first finger on my right hand would never grow much beyond the pink base of each nail bed before they would split vertically, sometimes extending into the quick. The other eight nails were constantly snagging and ripping off. The manicure tools I was using then were a nail clipper and a &amp;#34;diamond dust&amp;#34; file that are pretty common everywhere. And since these were not working (and nail hardeners didn&#x27;t work, either) I had given up and resorted to just clipping all my nails as short possible--not very attractive, and I couldn&#x27;t even pick up pins when I tried to sew. I happened to see this  file at a CVS and on impulse bought it, primarily because of the Revlon name, and too, it&#x27;s unique look sort of drew me in. Now, three months or so from that day, all ten of my nails are long, strong, and evenly matched. I&#x27;m 100 percent sold on this nail file. Oh, and regarding the comments on here about the file ripping off skin? it&#x27;s never happened to me and, honestly, I&#x27;m not all that good at filing my nails as I&#x27;m a real low-maintenance lady when it comes to nail care. Maybe there&#x27;s a technique involved and Revlon can offer suggestions. I&#x27;m considering buying a handful of these dandy little tools to give as stocking-stuffers this Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have difficult nails.  I&#x27;ve tried every file out there, diamond, glass, etc. This is absolutely the best nail file.  It trims the nails and leaves them feeling smooth.  With other files, I had to use something afterwards to smooth out the nail edges.  I&#x27;m really disappointed that Revlon has stopped making it.</li>
            <li> I already have 1 of these and they seem to be hard to find saw I bought a 2nd.  I don&#x27;t know what the people are doing with the file that gave it a bad rating, but it is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for smoothing and shining the ridges that I get on the surface of my nails.</li>
            <li> This keeps my nails from splitting and leaves a nice polished edge.  I don&#x27;t use any other kind now.</li>
            <li> 3 times in the product description Revlon states, &amp;#34;100% stainless steel filing surface for lasting performance.&amp;#34;  Hmm - yes, that&#x27;s true, the filing surface is stainless.  BUT, what they don&#x27;t bother to state is that the back is NOT stainless!  I&#x27;m not sure what it is - perhaps some kind of fiberglass or composite material.  Whatever it is made of, it is porous, which means it cannot be adequately disinfected to safely use for more than one patient.  In addition, the seam where the stainless face and the non-stainless back join together is another place where microorganisms could collect &amp; escape disinfecting efforts.  From an infection-control point of view, this product would be fine for 1-person use (as long as all nails are healthy) but is not suitable for using with more than one individual due to its materials &amp; construction not allowing it to be adequately disinfected between patients.  The words Revlon used to describe the product were mis-leading because it made it sound like it was &amp;#34;100% stainless steel,&amp;#34; which it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> there is no other nail file on the market that works this welll for natural nails that split.  It smooths the end so they are less inclined to split.</li>
            <li> Yes, if the plastic back is not EXACTLY glued to the file, you can have a sharp edge of metal that can end up cutting you...  I simply used my kitchen knife sharpener rod, and rubbed the sharp edge against it a few times...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE that these files never seem to wear out!  Constantly have to retrieve it from my daughters room because it&#x27;s her fav nail file too.  Now I have 3 of them, just to make sure I can find one when I need it!</li>
