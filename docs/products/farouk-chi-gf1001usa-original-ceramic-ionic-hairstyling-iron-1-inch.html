            <li>Fair warning, if any item reads \\&quot;sold by JoeBlow fulfilled by Amazon\\</li>

            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love my chi!</li>
            <li>, what matters is the end result, which I love!  </li>
            <li>That said, it is so easy to use and works great.  </li>
            <li>It is very good and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Swivel cord is nice.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it anyway, and although it is NOT an authentic Chi, there are many great things about it.  </li>
            <li>Very happy and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>it was awesome which is why when looking for a new one we purchased another Chi.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super curly and frizzy and this works great for taming my frizz.</li>
            <li>This product is great and worth the money.</li>
            <li>This straightener is good,  your hair will be really smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many straighteners in my lifetime and this is by far the BEST.</li>
            <li>It worked great the first two times I used it.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and the price was good when compared to the others offered on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is also very light on the hand I love it and recomand it to everyone</li>
            <li>Would be better if it heated up hotter.</li>
            <li>, it was $89, works much better.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have the appropriate tool.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have an authentic CHI from an \\&quot;authorized distributor\\&quot; to compare it to and this one is not legit.</li>
            <li>I love using my hairstyling iron.  </li>
            <li>Works better than anything else she&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li>Please know that you&#x27;re better off going to the store for this purchase.</li>
            <li>Nothing is better than a chi.</li>
            <li>The Chi seems to work ok.</li>
            <li>You will get better results.</li>
            <li>I called amazon to make sure  the 1 year factory warranty from CHI would be fulfilled if I purchased from them, amazon said yes, they come with the 1 year factory warranty.</li>
            <li>Stopped working after 3 1/2 weeks and was no longer able to return/  </li>
            <li>i love it, i have had many hair strighteners and this one</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>A LOT OF MONEY FROM SALON TRIPS :-)</li>
            <li>I love CHI hair products.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is the best one I have ever used.</li>
            <li>From my experience, the CHI farouk does the best job I have seen in my hair from a flat iron.</li>
            <li>With the CHI I have experienced that my hair lasts much, much longer smooth and more shiny too.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, but doesn&#x27;t get too hot and works great.</li>
            <li>My daughter refuses to use it and purchased a cheap straightener from Wal Mart that she says works much better.  </li>
            <li>She told me it works great and even faster than her her old no name version we replaced.</li>
            <li>I love the original chi.</li>
            <li>I returned it for a refund (which by the way was quick and easy!).</li>
            <li>Also seems like the blades do not meet easily</li>
            <li>I will say though that returning items through Amazon is so easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a good flat iron, though, and I really liked it when it worked.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife at the end of September, and it worked fine for about 4 uses.</li>
            <li>The power light does not go off when the switch it turned to off.</li>
            <li>It helps take the humidity out of my hair, keeps it smooth and keeps the end from flipping out this way and that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overstock has a information available on how to tell if you got a counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>The plastic feels cheap.</li>
            <li>My hair is so frizzy and curly, but after I bought the CHI air, its so smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>- like it&#x27;s a cheap version.  </li>
            <li>and I felt safe with that, however I received it yesterday and upon opening it realized something just wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>The REAL CHI is a superb flat iron that doesn&#x27;t fry hair in my experience.</li>
            <li>I went to folica.com in look of flat irons with the most good reviews and found the Sedu.</li>
            <li>Be aware when shopping online!!</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron straightener for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>As my original one was stolen I bought this one online</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money!</li>
            <li>On the original, the LED is on a  lower platform than the &#x27;on/off&#x27; switch.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I was excited</li>
            <li>The ceramic plates do not move or float as well or as much as the plates on an authentic CHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have returned the product for a full refund.</li>
            <li>The reviews talked about this not being a true CHI.  </li>
            <li>When my long-used flat iron died, I bought an inexpensive no-brand one that didn&#x27;t do a bit of good; I returned it.</li>
            <li>My last Chi worked for many, many years.</li>
            <li>the years, I have had more troubles with one appliance than I feel the normal person should.</li>
            <li>I ended up going to a different site and buying a Hana--much better choice!</li>
            <li>and it looks like I just got ready!!</li>
            <li>I have relatively fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>The first time she plugged it in it got so hot that it melted / burned a huge chunk out of her hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays straight and smooth all day.  </li>
            <li>It was barely above warm.</li>
            <li>Its worth your money and time inversion.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;I realize that none of the above memories of this shiny, black flat iron are very pleasant, but I do believe it is one of the most precious items I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is reasonably priced and of good quality.  </li>
            <li>This thing always makes my hair look super straight and super silky.</li>
            <li>Solid product, good brand name, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size to straighten hair close to scalp.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>certainly tops them all!</li>
            <li>I do not gift knockoffs, thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Electrical burning smell was evident when plugged in.  </li>
            <li>First off it takes a while to heat up</li>
            <li>Takes forever to try to do your hair with it as you have to keep letting it get hot again.  </li>
            <li>i have the most unruly, frizzy and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>It got way too hot.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot and does not straighten hair.</li>
            <li>but I made sure it wasn&#x27;t through a third party seller...</li>
            <li>The one I received had the first two signs but the plug was actually grounded so its obviously a \\&quot;better fake.\\</li>
            <li>Remember to buy the hot iron Chi guard to go with it.</li>
            <li>Just exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li>She says it takes a while to get hot</li>
            <li>The product dosen&#x27;t get as hot as</li>
            <li>The light should be clear when off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If It was a refurbished product then I should have been aware of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my first flatiron, so I don&#x27;t have a basis for comparison.  </li>
            <li>It preformed exactly as advertised and the amazon price was better than I could get from local retail outlets.  </li>
            <li>I still have my first CHI flatiron that I have had for years</li>
            <li>The off/on switch is not a step down from the power light like an authentic Chi should be.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and at a high temp.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately AMAZON  customer service was quick to refund my money, which is another reason AMAZON keeps me coming back.</li>
            <li>Just so I&#x27;m not completely negative, the Amazon one did turn on, heat up quickly, and it straightened the hair quite well.</li>
            <li>And at a great price - normally these Chis are much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>I have an authentic CHI flat iron</li>
            <li>, I cannot say how well this straightens hair compared to an authentic CHI flat</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite is the flatiron that I received recently.  </li>
            <li>Sturdier construction, engraved labels in the metal, and an accompanied owner&#x27;s manual with guarantee made it apparent that Amazon&#x27;s vendors are getting away with shipping out cheap knock off&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research to find out what was the best brand of flat iron prior to my purchase, but the item I received was scratched on the swivel handle and did not perform as I would have expected based on all the reviews.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair so smooth and straight!</li>
            <li>When I used it the new CHI did not do as good a job on my hair as my current flat iron!  </li>
            <li>Way too much money for something that is worse than any hair straightener I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>but I was informed that its their cord that causes them to stop working so fast.  </li>
            <li>, you have to really squeeze it together.  </li>
            <li>I have smooth curls or waves that last for days!</li>
            <li>It did not work as well as a real one that my sister had.  </li>
            <li>Safety stickers on the unit are the easiest way to tell from what I understand because the real CHI has the safety warning info engraved INTO the plastic.</li>
            <li>Smoked, sparked, the whole thing.</li>
            <li>She really likes the slim blades.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t the real thing.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair straight in minutes and feels silky</li>
            <li>and I know for a fact it was not even the real thing.</li>
            <li>In the 6th grade, I got a perm after fighting stick straight hair for years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1.The &#x27;on/off&#x27; switch has an LED light that is red when on AND off.</li>
            <li>Wife said she really likes the iron.  </li>
            <li>This product is really heated up fast.</li>
            <li>I have really frizzy hair</li>
            <li>This flat iron didn&#x27;t have an adjustable setting, and it literally burned my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase another one just in case my old one might need a rest!!!  </li>
            <li>They were everything that she expected and more since these were her first professional irons.</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to purchase this straightener based on other reviews saying it wasn&#x27;t an authentic Chi.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a strong and very hot flat iron for their hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft after, not dried out and brittle.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like my old chi</li>
            <li>I had a chi flat iron for +3 years, the original not upgraded version, but it fell and broke.</li>
            <li>I hope to get 8 years out of my new one!</li>
            <li>met all expectations; heats up quickly; works well; cools down quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I need a flat iron that works really well and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>The main way is that CHI&#x27;s don&#x27;t sell for 50-60 dollars.  </li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>and then when you are straightening with it as soon as you go down your hair it cools it off and the light blinks again letting you know that it isn&#x27;t completely hot yet.  </li>
            <li>My attempts at half straight hair were becoming a disaster</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this iron, however, I urge you to purchase it elsewhere to protect yourself.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands that were way more pricey and did not perform nearly as well.</li>
            <li>Normally if you buy this product in a store you get a 1-year warranty that would replace it or fix it.</li>
            <li>It was delivered faster than anticipated and it leaves my hair shiny and smooth every single time I use it!!</li>
            <li>This flat iron has for sure made my hair healthier, my hair is not nearly as crazy after a blow dry since i have used this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for years and just got a new one ... ... ... ...</li>
            <li>receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the product box to see the irons packaged as I would expect, and obviously new wires and the plates were covered in a protective sticker.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality fake but is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>The sedu one does not do the job flawlessly , some strands of hair in specific problem areas are hard to manage and iron, and the hair does not last very long...</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my first Chi which I had owned for ten years!  </li>
            <li>My hair that looked like I had stuck my finger in a light socket had emotionally scarred me and this flat iron brought me out of that slump.</li>
            <li>The cord is not as long, it&#x27;s made of plastic vs. metal, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the older model.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my first flat iron, but it will certainly be the last brand I ever buy!</li>
            <li>this makes me worried that it could be an unautentic iron that looks very similar to real CHI products.  </li>
            <li>I was using it 2 days ago and it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>Being a stubborn 13 year old and not listening to my mother&#x27;s advice that perms can in fact be \\&quot;perm\\&quot;anent, I took the risk and went for the curls.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I even wake up the next morning, hair is still straight, and can run to get a coffee</li>
            <li>She returned it to me the next day to say that it really doesn&#x27;t heat like the CHI</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments on my hair, and I&#x27;ve only been using this straightener for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>And there was not a clear LED for the red light, it was a red colored bulb...</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have long, thick curly hair and it was great to straighten my hair in half the time it normally takes.</li>
            <li>Besides the normal panic attacks that I left the house with the flat iron on and was going to return home to my house in flames, there was one instance where I really did leave it on.</li>
            <li>&quot; Too bad the market is so flooded with these counterfeits that you have to double check that you actually get the authentic product which is amazing,</li>
            <li>Between the scratch and the lack of performance, I really feel like it was a possibly a refurbished flat iron rather than brand new.</li>
            <li>This product ranged $45 from amazon marketplace to up to $120, I bought it from Amazon.com for $72.00 with FREE with Super Saver Shipping, and was amazed to find even this one was a FAKE.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it is just a cheap knock-off with the name on it or</li>
            <li>the real ones are clear like glass and then red only when the unit is turned on.</li>
            <li>I know that two years is a long time, but I didn&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li>It straightens on the first pass, so there&#x27;s minimal damage.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and leaves it silky for a few days.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron leaves my thick, wavy, frizzy hair looking smooth and silky!</li>
            <li>and that is why I purchased the new CHI flat iron.  </li>
            <li>The product is fairly decent but does not seem as high of quality as my previous CHI hair straightener...</li>
            <li>Its an amazing knock-off but according to the company Farouk, its fake.</li>
            <li>It ridiculous how easily it breaks</li>
            <li>Barely touches my hair.</li>
            <li>I was purchasing this one for my 13 year old because I don&#x27;t want her to scorch her blonde hair into straw</li>
            <li>I received on time, bought this iron as a professional to have a back up product.</li>
            <li>Only one side is hot and the other side is not.</li>
            <li>I have Remington brand flat iron that is 2 years old and while it still works it takes longer than it used to to get the desired results with my hair</li>
            <li>It is much lighter than my other one...</li>
            <li>first few experiences with this 450-degree piece of metal were a disaster.</li>
            <li>I reviewed the real product that I purchased elsewhere, but I feel I should take down my review, since it is not reviewing the correct product people are buying.</li>
            <li>It straightens my wavy, thick, frizzy hair better than any other straightener I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried several.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it&#x27;s as good as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> and I LOVED it.</li>
            <li> Fair warning, if any item reads \\&quot;sold by JoeBlow fulfilled by Amazon\\</li>
            <li> &quot; you stand a good chance of getting a counterfiet or refurbished  </li>

            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love my chi!</li>
            <li> , what matters is the end result, which I love!  </li>
            <li> That said, it is so easy to use and works great.  </li>
            <li> It is very good and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Swivel cord is nice.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it anyway, and although it is NOT an authentic Chi, there are many great things about it.  </li>
            <li> Very happy and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> it was awesome which is why when looking for a new one we purchased another Chi.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super curly and frizzy and this works great for taming my frizz.</li>
            <li> This product is great and worth the money.</li>
            <li> This straightener is good,  your hair will be really smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many straighteners in my lifetime and this is by far the BEST.</li>
            <li> It worked great the first two times I used it.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and the price was good when compared to the others offered on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It is also very light on the hand I love it and recomand it to everyone</li>
            <li> Would be better if it heated up hotter.</li>
            <li> , it was $89, works much better.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have the appropriate tool.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have an authentic CHI from an \\&quot;authorized distributor\\&quot; to compare it to and this one is not legit.</li>
            <li> I love using my hairstyling iron.  </li>
            <li> Works better than anything else she&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> Please know that you&#x27;re better off going to the store for this purchase.</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than a chi.</li>
            <li> The Chi seems to work ok.</li>
            <li> You will get better results.</li>
            <li> I called amazon to make sure  the 1 year factory warranty from CHI would be fulfilled if I purchased from them, amazon said yes, they come with the 1 year factory warranty.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 3 1/2 weeks and was no longer able to return/  </li>
            <li> i love it, i have had many hair strighteners and this one</li>
            <li> It works ok.</li>
            <li> A LOT OF MONEY FROM SALON TRIPS :-)</li>
            <li> I love CHI hair products.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best one I have ever used.</li>
            <li> From my experience, the CHI farouk does the best job I have seen in my hair from a flat iron.</li>
            <li> With the CHI I have experienced that my hair lasts much, much longer smooth and more shiny too.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, but doesn&#x27;t get too hot and works great.</li>
            <li> My daughter refuses to use it and purchased a cheap straightener from Wal Mart that she says works much better.  </li>
            <li> She told me it works great and even faster than her her old no name version we replaced.</li>
            <li> I love the original chi.</li>
            <li> I returned it for a refund (which by the way was quick and easy!).</li>
            <li> Also seems like the blades do not meet easily</li>
            <li> I will say though that returning items through Amazon is so easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a good flat iron, though, and I really liked it when it worked.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife at the end of September, and it worked fine for about 4 uses.</li>
            <li> The power light does not go off when the switch it turned to off.</li>
            <li> It helps take the humidity out of my hair, keeps it smooth and keeps the end from flipping out this way and that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overstock has a information available on how to tell if you got a counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> The plastic feels cheap.</li>
            <li> My hair is so frizzy and curly, but after I bought the CHI air, its so smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> - like it&#x27;s a cheap version.  </li>
            <li> and I felt safe with that, however I received it yesterday and upon opening it realized something just wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> The REAL CHI is a superb flat iron that doesn&#x27;t fry hair in my experience.</li>
            <li> I went to folica.com in look of flat irons with the most good reviews and found the Sedu.</li>
            <li> Be aware when shopping online!!</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron straightener for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> As my original one was stolen I bought this one online</li>
            <li> It was well worth the money!</li>
            <li> On the original, the LED is on a  lower platform than the &#x27;on/off&#x27; switch.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I was excited</li>
            <li> The ceramic plates do not move or float as well or as much as the plates on an authentic CHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have returned the product for a full refund.</li>
            <li> The reviews talked about this not being a true CHI.  </li>
            <li> When my long-used flat iron died, I bought an inexpensive no-brand one that didn&#x27;t do a bit of good; I returned it.</li>
            <li> My last Chi worked for many, many years.</li>
            <li> the years, I have had more troubles with one appliance than I feel the normal person should.</li>
            <li> I ended up going to a different site and buying a Hana--much better choice!</li>
            <li> and it looks like I just got ready!!</li>
            <li> I have relatively fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> The first time she plugged it in it got so hot that it melted / burned a huge chunk out of her hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays straight and smooth all day.  </li>
            <li> It was barely above warm.</li>
            <li> Its worth your money and time inversion.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;I realize that none of the above memories of this shiny, black flat iron are very pleasant, but I do believe it is one of the most precious items I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is reasonably priced and of good quality.  </li>
            <li> This thing always makes my hair look super straight and super silky.</li>
            <li> Solid product, good brand name, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size to straighten hair close to scalp.  </li>
            <li> Hands down the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> certainly tops them all!</li>
            <li> I do not gift knockoffs, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Electrical burning smell was evident when plugged in.  </li>
            <li> First off it takes a while to heat up</li>
            <li> Takes forever to try to do your hair with it as you have to keep letting it get hot again.  </li>
            <li> i have the most unruly, frizzy and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> It got way too hot.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot and does not straighten hair.</li>
            <li> but I made sure it wasn&#x27;t through a third party seller...</li>
            <li> The one I received had the first two signs but the plug was actually grounded so its obviously a \\&quot;better fake.\\</li>
            <li> Remember to buy the hot iron Chi guard to go with it.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li> She says it takes a while to get hot</li>
            <li> The product dosen&#x27;t get as hot as</li>
            <li> The light should be clear when off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If It was a refurbished product then I should have been aware of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my first flatiron, so I don&#x27;t have a basis for comparison.  </li>
            <li> It preformed exactly as advertised and the amazon price was better than I could get from local retail outlets.  </li>
            <li> I still have my first CHI flatiron that I have had for years</li>
            <li> The off/on switch is not a step down from the power light like an authentic Chi should be.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and at a high temp.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately AMAZON  customer service was quick to refund my money, which is another reason AMAZON keeps me coming back.</li>
            <li> Just so I&#x27;m not completely negative, the Amazon one did turn on, heat up quickly, and it straightened the hair quite well.</li>
            <li> And at a great price - normally these Chis are much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have an authentic CHI flat iron</li>
            <li> , I cannot say how well this straightens hair compared to an authentic CHI flat</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite is the flatiron that I received recently.  </li>
            <li> Sturdier construction, engraved labels in the metal, and an accompanied owner&#x27;s manual with guarantee made it apparent that Amazon&#x27;s vendors are getting away with shipping out cheap knock off&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to find out what was the best brand of flat iron prior to my purchase, but the item I received was scratched on the swivel handle and did not perform as I would have expected based on all the reviews.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair so smooth and straight!</li>
            <li> When I used it the new CHI did not do as good a job on my hair as my current flat iron!  </li>
            <li> Way too much money for something that is worse than any hair straightener I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> but I was informed that its their cord that causes them to stop working so fast.  </li>
            <li> , you have to really squeeze it together.  </li>
            <li> I have smooth curls or waves that last for days!</li>
            <li> It did not work as well as a real one that my sister had.  </li>
            <li> Safety stickers on the unit are the easiest way to tell from what I understand because the real CHI has the safety warning info engraved INTO the plastic.</li>
            <li> Smoked, sparked, the whole thing.</li>
            <li> She really likes the slim blades.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t the real thing.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair straight in minutes and feels silky</li>
            <li> and I know for a fact it was not even the real thing.</li>
            <li> In the 6th grade, I got a perm after fighting stick straight hair for years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1.The &#x27;on/off&#x27; switch has an LED light that is red when on AND off.</li>
            <li> Wife said she really likes the iron.  </li>
            <li> This product is really heated up fast.</li>
            <li> I have really frizzy hair</li>
            <li> This flat iron didn&#x27;t have an adjustable setting, and it literally burned my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase another one just in case my old one might need a rest!!!  </li>
            <li> They were everything that she expected and more since these were her first professional irons.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to purchase this straightener based on other reviews saying it wasn&#x27;t an authentic Chi.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a strong and very hot flat iron for their hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super soft after, not dried out and brittle.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like my old chi</li>
            <li> I had a chi flat iron for +3 years, the original not upgraded version, but it fell and broke.</li>
            <li> I hope to get 8 years out of my new one!</li>
            <li> met all expectations; heats up quickly; works well; cools down quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I need a flat iron that works really well and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> The main way is that CHI&#x27;s don&#x27;t sell for 50-60 dollars.  </li>
            <li> Decent price.</li>
            <li> and then when you are straightening with it as soon as you go down your hair it cools it off and the light blinks again letting you know that it isn&#x27;t completely hot yet.  </li>
            <li> My attempts at half straight hair were becoming a disaster</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this iron, however, I urge you to purchase it elsewhere to protect yourself.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands that were way more pricey and did not perform nearly as well.</li>
            <li> Normally if you buy this product in a store you get a 1-year warranty that would replace it or fix it.</li>
            <li> It was delivered faster than anticipated and it leaves my hair shiny and smooth every single time I use it!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron has for sure made my hair healthier, my hair is not nearly as crazy after a blow dry since i have used this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years and just got a new one ... ... ... ...</li>
            <li> receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the product box to see the irons packaged as I would expect, and obviously new wires and the plates were covered in a protective sticker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality fake but is not the real deal.</li>
            <li> The sedu one does not do the job flawlessly , some strands of hair in specific problem areas are hard to manage and iron, and the hair does not last very long...</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my first Chi which I had owned for ten years!  </li>
            <li> My hair that looked like I had stuck my finger in a light socket had emotionally scarred me and this flat iron brought me out of that slump.</li>
            <li> The cord is not as long, it&#x27;s made of plastic vs. metal, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the older model.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first flat iron, but it will certainly be the last brand I ever buy!</li>
            <li> this makes me worried that it could be an unautentic iron that looks very similar to real CHI products.  </li>
            <li> I was using it 2 days ago and it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> Being a stubborn 13 year old and not listening to my mother&#x27;s advice that perms can in fact be \\&quot;perm\\&quot;anent, I took the risk and went for the curls.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I even wake up the next morning, hair is still straight, and can run to get a coffee</li>
            <li> She returned it to me the next day to say that it really doesn&#x27;t heat like the CHI</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on my hair, and I&#x27;ve only been using this straightener for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> And there was not a clear LED for the red light, it was a red colored bulb...</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have long, thick curly hair and it was great to straighten my hair in half the time it normally takes.</li>
            <li> Besides the normal panic attacks that I left the house with the flat iron on and was going to return home to my house in flames, there was one instance where I really did leave it on.</li>
            <li> &quot; Too bad the market is so flooded with these counterfeits that you have to double check that you actually get the authentic product which is amazing,</li>
            <li> Between the scratch and the lack of performance, I really feel like it was a possibly a refurbished flat iron rather than brand new.</li>
            <li> This product ranged $45 from amazon marketplace to up to $120, I bought it from Amazon.com for $72.00 with FREE with Super Saver Shipping, and was amazed to find even this one was a FAKE.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is just a cheap knock-off with the name on it or</li>
            <li> the real ones are clear like glass and then red only when the unit is turned on.</li>
            <li> I know that two years is a long time, but I didn&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li> It straightens on the first pass, so there&#x27;s minimal damage.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and leaves it silky for a few days.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron leaves my thick, wavy, frizzy hair looking smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> and that is why I purchased the new CHI flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The product is fairly decent but does not seem as high of quality as my previous CHI hair straightener...</li>
            <li> Its an amazing knock-off but according to the company Farouk, its fake.</li>
            <li> It ridiculous how easily it breaks</li>
            <li> Barely touches my hair.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing this one for my 13 year old because I don&#x27;t want her to scorch her blonde hair into straw</li>
            <li> I received on time, bought this iron as a professional to have a back up product.</li>
            <li> Only one side is hot and the other side is not.</li>
            <li> I have Remington brand flat iron that is 2 years old and while it still works it takes longer than it used to to get the desired results with my hair</li>
            <li> It is much lighter than my other one...</li>
            <li> first few experiences with this 450-degree piece of metal were a disaster.</li>
            <li> I reviewed the real product that I purchased elsewhere, but I feel I should take down my review, since it is not reviewing the correct product people are buying.</li>
            <li> It straightens my wavy, thick, frizzy hair better than any other straightener I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried several.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago, if you would have asked me to use a flat iron, I would have told you that overpriced item could never tame the wild beast that I call my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used my flat iron once, but so it&#x27;s a definite keeper.</li>
            <li> My old one was other brand</li>
            <li> This flat iron didn&#x27;t even last me 2mths.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased several flat irons and I always come back to this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say about it, is that is leaves a small amount of static in my hair, but maybe that&#x27;s just my hair type.  </li>
            <li> Some tell-tale signs of a fake: the LED light will be red in color constantly...</li>
            <li> I will never buy another chi flat iron.  </li>
            <li> they flat iron</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this flat iron, and my sister has one and loves it.</li>
            <li> , I received a flat iron from my grandmother.</li>
            <li> on the inside of the flat iron is on a sticker.</li>
            <li> , I got this flat iron for $50.</li>
            <li> I had this flat iron for 9 months when it broke.  </li>
            <li> I expected it would have lasted much longer given how little I used it.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s had for so long and loves.  </li>
            <li> If finally wore out and I was forced to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> We are very disappointed, especially since I ponied up a decent chunk of change to make sure my wife received a quality product to replace her &amp;#34;Mickey Mouse&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought this Chi as a surprise for my wife only to let her down.  </li>
            <li> plus the on/off button was on the inside between the 2 blades in such an odd location.</li>
            <li> I got it the next day for less than the one at target.</li>
            <li> Not only did I pay less than amazon sells it for, I did get the 1 year warranty.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough like the older model did.</li>
            <li> It was passed the return window when I realized it just didn&#x27;t work like previous chi flat irons I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron less than two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> ; it doesn&#x27;t matter that it is not really a Chi</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected from paying over $70.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected.  </li>
            <li> immediately returned the other brand and reordered the CHI.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews here, I wonder if I purchased a fake?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CHI will not replace anything you buy online due to the counterfeit issues.</li>
            <li> My daughter prefers the CHI over other irons she has tried.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, but my return label is printed and it&#x27;s ready to go back.</li>
            <li> Certainly NOT the quality I expect in a Chi product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is an authentic CHI, but I do know it badly burned my hair.</li>
            <li> In my opinion not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> so I have the real deal to compare this fake to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not an authentic Chi its crap.</li>
            <li> Then when you think it cant get worse it stops working completely.</li>
            <li> Another time, I realized 30 minutes into the drive to Grandma&#x27;s house for a week during Christmas that I had forgotten the flat iron and my family was forced to turn around.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for less then a year</li>
            <li> It takes half the time to do my hair than it used to.</li>
            <li> I was recommended a CHI as I was told it was the US version of a GHD ( which I had previously used on England).</li>
            <li> However all around the black handle there were signs of wear, like marks and scratches.</li>
            <li> Mine worked as well as the previous CHI I bought at a salon 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> Does not pull her hair like the previous one.</li>
            <li> so turns itself  off after a few minutes normal use , we sometimes find its be on for a few hours , so waisting current and maybe dangerous .</li>
            <li> The Chi I received is not genuine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this seller.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have had it a few weeks</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> A four-eyed junior high student with braces was scary enough without the failed attempt to look good.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Even in crazy New England weather!</li>
            <li> It took much much longer to straighten my hair, often not even doing the job and me getting frustrated.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that we have had a Chi straightener in the past and</li>
            <li> Oh, and IF you get a fake one you should go to Farouk&#x27;s website and report it so it can be investigated..there&#x27;s a link on the left side of the product info page.</li>
            <li> These things are usually around $150</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t usually a time when I used the straightener and didn&#x27;t suffer a first-degree burn.</li>
            <li> Sold by: eBeautySalon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for my sister as a gift only to find that this is a fake.</li>
            <li> Amazon refuses to refund or replace this item past 30 days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews about Chi Flat Irons being fake</li>
            <li> Will buy another one, but am afraid the same thing will happen.  </li>
            <li> I must have had some pretty bad hair days!</li>
            <li> After learning how to actually use it, and to be a little corny, it has straightenedout my worst days.</li>
            <li> I had bought this item as a gift for my sister a month ago and this morning I received a text saying that the iron is broken.</li>
            <li> It appeared as if the adhesive where the iron plate and the plastic behind it weakened because of the heat.</li>
            <li> The fake is also matte, but the finish seems poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake chi don&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> This CHI is a fake.  </li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m readying its a fake.</li>
            <li> my roommate&#x27;s CHI&#x27;s were fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it stopped working 7 months after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> lets me know it&#x27;s fake?</li>
            <li> all signs of fake Chi.</li>
            <li> I also knew with buying it from Kohls, it wouldn&#x27;t be a &#x27;fake&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I called Farouk and they told me that Amazon is illegally selling this item</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money and horrible return policy</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> This straightener is just plain terrible!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake!</li>
            <li> When did Amazon become a criminal enterprise!?!?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad.</li>
            <li> If you bought a CHI online, call Farouk and check your serial #, it&#x27;s probably a fake!</li>
            <li> If it says made in USA, it&#x27;s a FAKE!</li>
            <li> But your hair smells really bad after.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was just being picky when I was disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> BAD SELLER!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It was passed the return window when I realized it just didn&#x27;t work like previous chi flat irons I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> Electrical and heating problem with this iron.  Electrical burning smell was evident when plugged in.  Within 4 months of use, it no longer heats.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough like the older model did. Would like to return it if possible. Would be better if it heated up hotter.</li>
            <li> Chi is a great product.  I had my last iron for over 8 years.  If finally wore out and I was forced to buy a new one.  I hope to get 8 years out of my new one!</li>
            <li> This flat iron didn&#x27;t even last me 2mths.  I will never buy another chi flat iron.  they flat iron well but I was informed that its their cord that causes them to stop working so fast.  I don&#x27;t even wrap my cords and it still gave out on me</li>
            <li> This was delivered in a timely manner.  I needed to replace my first Chi which I had owned for ten years!  This product is great and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that we have had a Chi straightener in the past and it was awesome which is why when looking for a new one we purchased another Chi.  This straightener is just plain terrible!!!  Not sure if it is just a cheap knock-off with the name on it or what but doesn&#x27;t work like it should.  First off it takes a while to heat up and then when you are straightening with it as soon as you go down your hair it cools it off and the light blinks again letting you know that it isn&#x27;t completely hot yet.  Takes forever to try to do your hair with it as you have to keep letting it get hot again.  Also seems like the blades do not meet easily, you have to really squeeze it together.  My daughter refuses to use it and purchased a cheap straightener from Wal Mart that she says works much better.  Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this one!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake chi don&#x27;t get it, it&#x27;s not what I asked for, go to another website, it&#x27;s low quality</li>
            <li> have had this item for 3+ years, ordered a different brand when mine finally quit working.  immediately returned the other brand and reordered the CHI.  this unit is incredible.  i have the most unruly, frizzy and coarse hair.  this is the only thing that works.  would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I did some research before deciding on this one.  I&#x27;ve used it for three months now and it works great.  It heats up quickly and at a high temp.  It&#x27;s just the right size to straighten hair close to scalp.  It arrived on time and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The Chi I received is not genuine. The power light does not go off when the switch it turned to off. The off/on switch is not a step down from the power light like an authentic Chi should be. It&#x27;s a good quality fake but is not the real deal. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first flat iron, but it will certainly be the last brand I ever buy! This flat iron leaves my thick, wavy, frizzy hair looking smooth and silky! It straightens on the first pass, so there&#x27;s minimal damage. It also works awesomely as a curling iron! I have smooth curls or waves that last for days! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!</li>
            <li> Certainly NOT the quality I expect in a Chi product! Stopped working after 12 months! Very disappointed. My last Chi worked for many, many years.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this flat iron.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is an authentic CHI, but I do know it badly burned my hair.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for less then a year and it does not work anymore. Only one side is hot and the other side is not. It ridiculous how easily it breaks</li>
            <li> Solid product, good brand name, highly recommend. Have been using it for years and just got a new one ... ... ... ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my CHI for over 5 years and it&#x27;s as good as the day I bought it. I bought an &amp;#34;older version&amp;#34; off of Amazon then. This one doesn&#x27;t appear to be any different. This product has had almost daily use. I have relatively fine straight hair. Even I need to use a straightener! It helps take the humidity out of my hair, keeps it smooth and keeps the end from flipping out this way and that. What did I do before owning one of these? I must have had some pretty bad hair days!</li>
            <li> I am so thankful I bought this CHI from this seller.  It was shipped quickly and the price was good when compared to the others offered on Amazon.  It was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She told me it works great and even faster than her her old no name version we replaced. 5 stars here!</li>
            <li> Amazon.com is not a Certified Seller from Farouk.  This product ranged $45 from amazon marketplace to up to $120, I bought it from Amazon.com for $72.00 with FREE with Super Saver Shipping, and was amazed to find even this one was a FAKE.  It did not work as well as a real one that my sister had.  I returned it, went on to Farouk Website and found that Amazon.com is not a certified seller.  I bought one from there certified seller list, it was $89, works much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake! Does not heat up to the temperature it is supposed to. Barely touches my hair. I ended up sending it back. Way too much money for something that is worse than any hair straightener I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> The product is fairly decent but does not seem as high of quality as my previous CHI hair straightener... this makes me worried that it could be an unautentic iron that looks very similar to real CHI products.  I have heard several stories of CHI knock-offs being sold so I&#x27;m truly hoping that mine is not one of them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my student.  She loves them.  They were everything that she expected and more since these were her first professional irons.</li>
            <li> It stopped working suddenly in about 3 months. I was using it 2 days ago and it stopped working completely. plus the on/off button was on the inside between the 2 blades in such an odd location.</li>
            <li> This flat iron didn&#x27;t have an adjustable setting, and it literally burned my fine hair.  It got way too hot.</li>
            <li> met all expectations; heats up quickly; works well; cools down quickly.  Swivel cord is nice.  Does not seem to burn hair.</li>
            <li> This straightener is good,  your hair will be really smooth. But your hair smells really bad after.  It smells like dying hair.  Fyi before you buy, I would look for another straightener!</li>
            <li> I had this same hair straightener for 7 years and I LOVED it. Last year it broke and I wanted the same one. I bought a replacement (same model) from this seller. It broke today and I only had it for a year. My boyfriend considered replacing the fuse to see if that would work but 2 of the screws are neither Phillips head nor standard. We don&#x27;t have the appropriate tool. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled. This is not an authentic Chi its crap. Doesn&#x27;t get hot and does not straighten hair. Then when you think it cant get worse it stops working completely. Junk junk junk</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap. I bought it for about $45 I believe. It works great since 2 years now. Love it. Love it!</li>
            <li> This CHI is a fake.  I reviewed the real product that I purchased elsewhere, but I feel I should take down my review, since it is not reviewing the correct product people are buying.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this and hesitated to purchase because of them but I made sure it wasn&#x27;t through a third party seller...it was through Amazon and I felt safe with that, however I received it yesterday and upon opening it realized something just wasn&#x27;t right. I have an authentic CHI from an \\&quot;authorized distributor\\&quot; to compare it to and this one is not legit. Its an amazing knock-off but according to the company Farouk, its fake. Disappointing, but my return label is printed and it&#x27;s ready to go back. Some tell-tale signs of a fake: the LED light will be red in color constantly...the real ones are clear like glass and then red only when the unit is turned on. Safety stickers on the unit are the easiest way to tell from what I understand because the real CHI has the safety warning info engraved INTO the plastic. Also, the plug itself should have the grounded type with the safety reset button on it. The one I received had the first two signs but the plug was actually grounded so its obviously a \\&quot;better fake.\\&quot; Too bad the market is so flooded with these counterfeits that you have to double check that you actually get the authentic product which is amazing, btw. The REAL CHI is a superb flat iron that doesn&#x27;t fry hair in my experience. I was purchasing this one for my 13 year old because I don&#x27;t want her to scorch her blonde hair into straw and I can&#x27;t always share mine with her. Oh, and IF you get a fake one you should go to Farouk&#x27;s website and report it so it can be investigated..there&#x27;s a link on the left side of the product info page.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this flat iron, and my sister has one and loves it. I had mine for about two years and it died on me. I know that two years is a long time, but I didn&#x27;t use it very often. I expected it would have lasted much longer given how little I used it. After reading some of the other reviews here, I wonder if I purchased a fake?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a good flat iron, though, and I really liked it when it worked.</li>
            <li> It is a great product!  And at a great price - normally these Chis are much more expensive.  I am very happy.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister. She had be talking about how she wanted a CHI and I didn&#x27;t want to spend $120 at Target so I used the Amazon Price Check app and this came up. Well worth it! I got it the next day for less than the one at target. She is very happy and loves it.</li>
            <li> Love the Chi, great price too...not the $100 I was going to spend at Hair Salon. Remember to buy the hot iron Chi guard to go with it.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what my wife wanted. Great product. Works perfect. She bought this to replace an existing hair styling iron.</li>
            <li> Found out from CHI this is a counterfeit CHI iron. This morning it shorted out while plugged in. I have only had it since October 2012.  Smoked, sparked, the whole thing. CHI will not replace anything you buy online due to the counterfeit issues.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this \\&quot;CHI Ceramic Hairstyling Iron\\&quot; from Amazon.  The first time she plugged it in it got so hot that it melted / burned a huge chunk out of her hair.  Upon closer examination it was discovered that the ceramic parts had melted into the handle and are now all crooked.  When I called Farouk they claimed that this is a counterfeit product being sold on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What? When did Amazon become a criminal enterprise!?!?</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and the plates melted off of it and now I&#x27;m readying its a fake. I&#x27;m so mad. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this seller.</li>
            <li> Very good but wish it had a timer so turns itself  off after a few minutes normal use , we sometimes find its be on for a few hours , so waisting current and maybe dangerous .</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!!! Broke within 5 days</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter was very happy with this curling iron. It was just what she wanted.She really likes the slim blades.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she uses it daily. It has worked flawlessly. I would definately purchase another if required.</li>
            <li> If you bought a CHI online, call Farouk and check your serial #, it&#x27;s probably a fake! If it says made in USA, it&#x27;s a FAKE! Farouk says they don&#x27;t offer their products online...mine and my roommate&#x27;s CHI&#x27;s were fake.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and leaves it silky for a few days.  I would recommend this and the Chi hair dryer!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best one I have ever used. Unfortunately, it stopped working 7 months after I purchased it. It was never dropped, never mishandled. Just one day decided to stop working. It now does not heat up even a degree. Normally if you buy this product in a store you get a 1-year warranty that would replace it or fix it. Because I purchased it on Amazon, I get no such warranty (the warranty from the seller is only 1 month). I highly recommend this iron, however, I urge you to purchase it elsewhere to protect yourself.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  I love using my hairstyling iron.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a excellent iron to straighten their hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many straighteners in my lifetime and this is by far the BEST. It takes half the time to do my hair than it used to. Its amazing, and the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. These things are usually around $150 so I got a great deal, too! It leaves my hair super soft after, not dried out and brittle. Very happy and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Got this a month ago for my gf for her birthday. She says it takes a while to get hot but she loves it. Works better than anything else she&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> I love my chi! This is one of the best products I have ever used. Don&#x27;t try the others nobody else can compare!</li>
            <li> LeighLoo&#x27;s review earlier explains it well enough.  I bought this Chi as a surprise for my wife only to let her down.  I just shipped it back to Amazon yesterday, and I hope they address the issue soon for the rest of you.  Before returning it , however, my wife bought one from an authorized dealer at the mall, and the differences are obvious.  Sturdier construction, engraved labels in the metal, and an accompanied owner&#x27;s manual with guarantee made it apparent that Amazon&#x27;s vendors are getting away with shipping out cheap knock off&#x27;s. Just so I&#x27;m not completely negative, the Amazon one did turn on, heat up quickly, and it straightened the hair quite well. It just wasn&#x27;t the real thing.  Please know that you&#x27;re better off going to the store for this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the original chi. Great product and awesome price. Nothing is better than a chi. It makes your hair straight in minutes and feels silky</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to purchase this straightener based on other reviews saying it wasn&#x27;t an authentic Chi.  I purchased it anyway, and although it is NOT an authentic Chi, there are many great things about it.  It straightens my wavy, thick, frizzy hair better than any other straightener I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried several.  My hair stays straight and smooth all day.  This straightener does not pull my hair at all, and it heats up in about a minute or two.  The only negative thing I can say about it, is that is leaves a small amount of static in my hair, but maybe that&#x27;s just my hair type.  Overall, it definitely met my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone; it doesn&#x27;t matter that it is not really a Chi, what matters is the end result, which I love!  I have received so many compliments on my hair, and I&#x27;ve only been using this straightener for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This product was not even a legitimate Chi. As my original one was stolen I bought this one online and I know for a fact it was not even the real thing. It took much much longer to straighten my hair, often not even doing the job and me getting frustrated. BAD SELLER! Beware! I ended up going to a different site and buying a Hana--much better choice!</li>
            <li> The product dosen&#x27;t get as hot as and sometimes it cuts on and off . In my opinion not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought a counterfeit CHI from an Amazon vender.  I called the manufacturer and discoved Amazon is being sued for selling these on their site.  Fair warning, if any item reads \\&quot;sold by JoeBlow fulfilled by Amazon\\&quot; you stand a good chance of getting a counterfiet or refurbished  product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overstock has a information available on how to tell if you got a counterfeit.  The main way is that CHI&#x27;s don&#x27;t sell for 50-60 dollars.  They cost about $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never buy from Amazon if the product is \\&quot;fullfilled by Amazon\\&quot;, which means it&#x27;s sold by a third party vender.  I&#x27;ll buy from Amazon only.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My hair is super curly and frizzy and this works great for taming my frizz. Even in crazy New England weather!</li>
            <li> Great Price and good quality.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, if you would have asked me to use a flat iron, I would have told you that overpriced item could never tame the wild beast that I call my hair. In the 6th grade, I got a perm after fighting stick straight hair for years. Being a stubborn 13 year old and not listening to my mother&#x27;s advice that perms can in fact be \\&quot;perm\\&quot;anent, I took the risk and went for the curls. I figured I would have Beyonce-fierce curly hair you only see in the magazines. Well, what I ended up with was fierce alright. I dealt with the curls for a year or so, but for Christmas the next year, I received a flat iron from my grandmother. Yes, my grandmother, I think it was time to take a hint.&lt;br /&gt;My first few experiences with this 450-degree piece of metal were a disaster. There wasn&#x27;t usually a time when I used the straightener and didn&#x27;t suffer a first-degree burn. My attempts at half straight hair were becoming a disaster and I almost decided to give up on it. A four-eyed junior high student with braces was scary enough without the failed attempt to look good.&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have had more troubles with one appliance than I feel the normal person should. Besides the normal panic attacks that I left the house with the flat iron on and was going to return home to my house in flames, there was one instance where I really did leave it on. Although my house is still standing, my bathroom counter has a pair of battle scars that will never go away. Another time, I realized 30 minutes into the drive to Grandma&#x27;s house for a week during Christmas that I had forgotten the flat iron and my family was forced to turn around. I couldn&#x27;t go a week without it because at any time, that perm stricken hair could have returned to haunt me.&lt;br /&gt;I realize that none of the above memories of this shiny, black flat iron are very pleasant, but I do believe it is one of the most precious items I have ever owned. After learning how to actually use it, and to be a little corny, it has straightenedout my worst days. My hair that looked like I had stuck my finger in a light socket had emotionally scarred me and this flat iron brought me out of that slump. To this day, it is still almost a daily accessory and I would recommend it to any person dealing with out-of-control hair. It was well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Sold by: eBeautySalon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for my sister as a gift only to find that this is a fake. I have an authentic CHI flat iron so I have the real deal to compare this fake to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What lets me know it&#x27;s fake? Here is a list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.The &#x27;on/off&#x27; switch has an LED light that is red when on AND off. The light should be clear when off.&lt;br /&gt;2. The raised portion or platform where the LED and switch sit is all the same height. On the original, the LED is on a  lower platform than the &#x27;on/off&#x27; switch.&lt;br /&gt;3. The warning/ info. on the inside of the flat iron is on a sticker. It should be engraved in the plastic handle.&lt;br /&gt;4. The plastic feels cheap. The fake is also matte, but the finish seems poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;5. The ceramic plates do not move or float as well or as much as the plates on an authentic CHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not bother plugging this one in, so for those of you who do not mind a knockoff, I cannot say how well this straightens hair compared to an authentic CHI flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sending this thing back. I do not gift knockoffs, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several flat irons and I always come back to this flat iron.  I have naturally curly hair and I need a flat iron that works really well and heats up quickly.  I will always stick with my chi!</li>
            <li> I was recommended a CHI as I was told it was the US version of a GHD ( which I had previously used on England). I was excited when my package arrived, however upon opening the package, I found a damaged product box and no paperwork or invoice receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the product box to see the irons packaged as I would expect, and obviously new wires and the plates were covered in a protective sticker. However all around the black handle there were signs of wear, like marks and scratches. It was not what I expected from paying over $70. If It was a refurbished product then I should have been aware of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have returned the product for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after she had tried my sisters CHI. This was garbage. It never got up to temperature. It was barely above warm. Also didn&#x27;t have the Chi engraved info on it, it was a sticker. And there was not a clear LED for the red light, it was a red colored bulb... all signs of fake Chi. Fortunately AMAZON  customer service was quick to refund my money, which is another reason AMAZON keeps me coming back.</li>
            <li> The reviews talked about this not being a true CHI.  Mine worked as well as the previous CHI I bought at a salon 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to find out what was the best brand of flat iron prior to my purchase, but the item I received was scratched on the swivel handle and did not perform as I would have expected based on all the reviews.  I have Remington brand flat iron that is 2 years old and while it still works it takes longer than it used to to get the desired results with my hair and that is why I purchased the new CHI flat iron.  When I used it the new CHI did not do as good a job on my hair as my current flat iron!  Between the scratch and the lack of performance, I really feel like it was a possibly a refurbished flat iron rather than brand new. I returned it for a refund (which by the way was quick and easy!).</li>
            <li> Hands down the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had! It was delivered faster than anticipated and it leaves my hair shiny and smooth every single time I use it!! Amazing product!</li>
            <li> The Chi seems to work ok. It is much lighter than my other one...I have had it a few weeks so we will see how it holds up!</li>
            <li> I received on time, bought this iron as a professional to have a back up product. I would purchase again from this distributor.</li>
            <li> This is my first flatiron, so I don&#x27;t have a basis for comparison.  That said, it is so easy to use and works great.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron less than two weeks ago.  It worked great the first two times I used it.  Now it won&#x27;t even turn on.  Very disappointing. I should have read the reviews before purchasing this item.  I will say though that returning items through Amazon is so easy.</li>
            <li> This thing always makes my hair look super straight and super silky. But if you want salon results you HAVE to use a heat protector. You will get better results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give the CHI air anything but 5 stars! It works miracles!! My hair is so frizzy and curly, but after I bought the CHI air, its so smooth, and shiny. I even wake up the next morning, hair is still straight, and can run to get a coffee and it looks like I just got ready!! This flat iron has for sure made my hair healthier, my hair is not nearly as crazy after a blow dry since i have used this flat iron. BUY IT!!!!!!!!! BEWARE though!!! I called amazon to make sure  the 1 year factory warranty from CHI would be fulfilled if I purchased from them, amazon said yes, they come with the 1 year factory warranty. However I called CHI to verify, and IT DOES NOT COME WITH ANY WARRANTY AT ALL IF PURCHASED FROM AMAZON. IT ONLY HAS A ONE YEAR WARRANTY IF PURCHASED FROM AN AUTHORIZED SELLER; i.e. kohls, target, ulta, jcpenny, etc. I did not purchase this on amazon for this reason. Any product you buy, no matter the price COULD have a defect. So I went to Kohls where they matched the Kohls online price of $97, with a 20% off coupon, and a bunch of kohls cash, I got this flat iron for $50. Not only did I pay less than amazon sells it for, I did get the 1 year warranty. I also knew with buying it from Kohls, it wouldn&#x27;t be a &#x27;fake&#x27;. Amazon needs to put in big print, no warranty. They also need to tell the truth when customers ask them about it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is reasonably priced and of good quality.  Consider, however that it does not have different temperature settings</li>
            <li> Wife said she really likes the iron.  The only thing she said she wished it had was a way to adjust the heat setting.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 3 1/2 weeks and was no longer able to return/  What a waste of money and horrible return policy</li>
            <li> Bought on the advice of my stylist it works great.&lt;br /&gt;i have long, thick curly hair and it was great to straighten my hair in half the time it normally takes.</li>
            <li> Iron came in quickly and works great!  Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a strong and very hot flat iron for their hair.</li>
            <li> i love it, i have had many hair strighteners and this one certainly tops them all! I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> It is very good and worth the money.It is also very light on the hand I love it and recomand it to everyone</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my teenage daughter.  She LOVED it.  Works great.  However, the product quit mid-March.  Amazon refunded the money.  THANK YOU!!  Will buy another one, but am afraid the same thing will happen.  My daughter&#x27;s friend also had a Chi quit working within weeks of purchase.</li>
            <li> My old one was other brand and it took longer time to heat upl. This product is really heated up fast. Good product! I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter, second time ...She loved it both times. I would like to get the blow dryer for my self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Theresa Feighner</li>
            <li> It Arrived by estimated time! I loveee chi products! It left my hair so smooth and straight! Would definately recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron straightener for curly hair.  It preformed exactly as advertised and the amazon price was better than I could get from local retail outlets.  A win - win purchase for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used my flat iron once, but so it&#x27;s a definite keeper. It arrived a day before the promised day, which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I bought this same model iron about 5 years ago, and this one seems to be made cheaper.  The cord is not as long, it&#x27;s made of plastic vs. metal, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the older model.  It works ok.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LOVES IT. THE PRICE IS GREAT FOR THIS ITEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVE ME A LOT OF MONEY FROM SALON TRIPS :-)</li>
            <li> My daughter prefers the CHI over other irons she has tried. Decent price. Does not pull her hair like the previous one.</li>
            <li> I got this product in October and it broke  7 months later. It looks exactly like my old chi but after talking to the company and giving the product number, they told me the CHI was counterfeit. Be aware when shopping online!!</li>
            <li> I had a chi flat iron for +3 years, the original not upgraded version, but it fell and broke. I went to folica.com in look of flat irons with the most good reviews and found the Sedu. I decided to give it a try and I bought it. From my experience, the CHI farouk does the best job I have seen in my hair from a flat iron. The sedu one does not do the job flawlessly , some strands of hair in specific problem areas are hard to manage and iron, and the hair does not last very long... couple of hours later its wavy and undone again. With the CHI I have experienced that my hair lasts much, much longer smooth and more shiny too. The CHI smooths the hair faster than the Sedu and overall I prefer and encourage others to use the CHI from farouk systems. Its worth your money and time inversion.</li>
            <li> I had bought this item as a gift for my sister a month ago and this morning I received a text saying that the iron is broken. She also sent a picture. It appeared as if the adhesive where the iron plate and the plastic behind it weakened because of the heat. I&#x27;ve read reviews about Chi Flat Irons being fake and I guess we were one of the unlucky ones to have ordered a fake/faulty one.  DON&#x27;T waste your time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> When my long-used flat iron died, I bought an inexpensive no-brand one that didn&#x27;t do a bit of good; I returned it. My daughter-in-law said I had to get a CHI so I did. I thought I was just being picky when I was disappointed so I gave it to that same d-in-law to test.  She returned it to me the next day to say that it really doesn&#x27;t heat like the CHI she&#x27;s had for so long and loves.  She says it&#x27;s lighter weight and doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s fully closing over the hair - like it&#x27;s a cheap version.  I don&#x27;t want to pay $300+ for one like my hair dresser uses but this one is going back.</li>
            <li> I bought this CHI and now I am seeing that many are saying it is a fake.  Here is what I know.  My sister has a CHI and it has lasted forever.  I bought this one in Sept and it has quit working as of this morning!!  Will not turn on at all.  We don&#x27;t even use it every day.  So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife at the end of September, and it worked fine for about 4 uses. Then it started turning off automatically during use before it finally quit working all together. When we called CHI customer service to file a warranty claim, we were told the item we had purchased most likely was a fake and there was nothing they could do to help us. We are very disappointed, especially since I ponied up a decent chunk of change to make sure my wife received a quality product to replace her &amp;#34;Mickey Mouse&amp;#34; iron from Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation to you is: KEEP LOOKING! Don&#x27;t buy this iron!</li>
            <li> I love CHI hair products.  My absolute favorite is the flatiron that I received recently.  I have tried other brands that were way more pricey and did not perform nearly as well. I still have my first CHI flatiron that I have had for years and it is still in great condition.  I decided to purchase another one just in case my old one might need a rest!!!  I have really frizzy hair and it is a must that I have this flatiron almost daily!!  THANKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen Johnson</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected.  Heats quickly, but doesn&#x27;t get too hot and works great. Great price and I would definitely recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I had this flat iron for 9 months when it broke.  I called Farouk and they told me that Amazon is illegally selling this item and it has made my warranty void.  It is in the user manual that they will not replace or repair items not sold at authorized dealers.  Amazon refuses to refund or replace this item past 30 days.  Just want everyone to know this because it is not in the description of the product.</li>
