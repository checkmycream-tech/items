            <li>My face feels clean, moisturizer and healthy!  </li>
            <li>clearing up my face  very clean feeling</li>
            <li>My face is clear again and the scars and getting better but will need more time to see drastic results..very happy and will buy again</li>
            <li>but I was sure I made a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li>But it’s easy on my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to put it into words, but as long as you use a good moisturizer after this soap, you&#x27;re gonna love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic, a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Made in U.S.A., another huge plus.</li>
            <li>Quality facial soap for a great price.  </li>
            <li>Within the first week I started seeing a noticeable difference in the way my skin felt and looked and it seemed to be getting better every day.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean.</li>
            <li>A more rounded shape would fit more comfortably in the human hand.</li>
            <li>Love it, leaves your skin feeling soft, smooth</li>
            <li>I really liked how soft my skin felt right after using it.</li>
            <li>Makes lots of nice white foam.</li>
            <li>My husband noticed right away.</li>
            <li>If I would have known about this amazing soap, I would have purchased it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gone through my first bar yet.</li>
            <li>It smells ok and really lathers up on any hairy regions, barely at all anywhere else.</li>
            <li>and I will certainly buy it again if the results keep improving.</li>
            <li>This African black soap is great.</li>
            <li>It is soft and soaps easily, rinsed very clean, no residue but also didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dried out.</li>
            <li>The bar seems to go fast.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and I really like the fact that I can use it on my face as well.</li>
            <li>use it mainly as a body and hand soap, so I can&#x27;t speak to it as a face soap.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  not heavily perfumed, but has a fresh, clean, slightly spicy scent .</li>
            <li>The ingredients lists of most soaps are kind of scary, but this soap contains no substances with long incomprehensible names.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used this soap and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I  also like supporting small companies that care about keeping it natural and clean.</li>
            <li>You can get the same rich, creamy lather and gentle cleansing for much less from Triple French Milled Soaps, at Whole Foods, or from Dove Beauty Bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>I always use natural body washes and sort of swore off soaps</li>
            <li>The ingredients are truly natural and quite recognizable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had moderate acne and light scars.it has improve my acne within just a few weeks of use and haven&#x27;t had anymore breakouts!</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing artisanal marseille soap or castille soap which are made the old fashioned way with just the essential ingredients.</li>
            <li>No long lasting odor.</li>
            <li>Like other black soaps I’ve tried, it does get soggy on the bottom with use,  but that&#x27;s a small enough drawback for such a nice soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have combination skin--oily in the T zone but sometimes painfully dry around the mouth--and African Black Soap leaves my skin squeaky clean without being harsh or drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also seems to be fairly long lasting.</li>
            <li> I will be reordering, however it may be awhile because it&#x27;s lasting a long tine!</li>
            <li> Instead of leaving my hands soft and moisturized it was rough and grainy and left my hands dried out and rough.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at what this African Black Soap did for my face.  </li>
            <li> When I started washing with this, it seems like my skin broke out a little bit at the same time, but I won&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just coincidence until I buy another bar.</li>
            <li> I wet my Sonicare brush, glide the brush over the bar a couple times, and use every night.  </li>
            <li> so I figured to give it at least a week for a proper trial.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying various black soaps lately, because they go with my bathroom decor.</li>
            <li> Too pricey for black stuff that stains everything.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product, melted in soap dish into black gooey substance.  </li>
            <li> if it felt like it left soap scum on my face or it was harsh and overly drying</li>
            <li> the downside, its straight, angular shape makes it awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you want an exfoliating soap.</li>
            <li> and I have not used ordinary soap anymore.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I refuse to use any ordinary products found everywhere full of doubtful and dangerous ingredients on my skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I hated how it felt I couldn&#x27;t figure out</li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t react badly</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin has been devastatingly itchier and dryer than before using this product.</li>

            <li> this is a great soap!  I don&#x27;t know how to put it into words, but as long as you use a good moisturizer after this soap, you&#x27;re gonna love it!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about a week but I absolutely love it! I always use natural body washes and sort of swore off soaps but I changed my mind. This is all I will use now. It is soft and soaps easily, rinsed very clean, no residue but also didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dried out. Customer for life!!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at what this African Black Soap did for my face.  I wet my Sonicare brush, glide the brush over the bar a couple times, and use every night.  My face feels clean, moisturizer and healthy!  A big noticeable difference.  If I would have known about this amazing soap, I would have purchased it a long time ago.

I have combination skin--oily in the T zone but sometimes painfully dry around the mouth--and African Black Soap leaves my skin squeaky clean without being harsh or drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, its straight, angular shape makes it awkward to use. A more rounded shape would fit more comfortably in the human hand. And it&#x27;s way overpriced. You can get the same rich, creamy lather and gentle cleansing for much less from Triple French Milled Soaps, at Whole Foods, or from Dove Beauty Bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Too pricey for black stuff that stains everything.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product, melted in soap dish into black gooey substance.  Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Second time buying from this seller. Great products</li>
            <li> This African black soap is great.</li>
            <li> clearing up my face  very clean feeling</li>
            <li> This was the best soap I had ever used and I reordered it several times.  The last order something had changed.  Instead of leaving my hands soft and moisturized it was rough and grainy and left my hands dried out and rough.  I wrote to the company about the change but never heard back from them.  Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you want an exfoliating soap.</li>
            <li> Love it, leaves your skin feeling soft, smooth</li>
            <li> I refuse to use any ordinary products found everywhere full of doubtful and dangerous ingredients on my skin. My son has some eczema spots now and then and I have not used ordinary soap anymore. I have been purchasing artisanal marseille soap or castille soap which are made the old fashioned way with just the essential ingredients. This soap has been wonderful so far and I will certainly buy it again if the results keep improving. I  also like supporting small companies that care about keeping it natural and clean. Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> I had moderate acne and light scars.it has improve my acne within just a few weeks of use and haven&#x27;t had anymore breakouts! My face is clear again and the scars and getting better but will need more time to see drastic results..very happy and will buy again</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this soap and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Will order again</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical and I have sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use a many soaps and skin products without a reaction but I decided to give this a try. The first time I used it I hated how it felt I couldn&#x27;t figure out if it felt like it left soap scum on my face or it was harsh and overly drying but I was sure I made a huge mistake.  My skin didn&#x27;t react badly so I figured to give it at least a week for a proper trial. Within the first week I started seeing a noticeable difference in the way my skin felt and looked and it seemed to be getting better every day. My husband came home 2 weeks later and instantly noticed the difference. This is definitely now one of my skin care must-haves. I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> The ingredients lists of most soaps are kind of scary, but this soap contains no substances with long incomprehensible names. The ingredients are truly natural and quite recognizable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it mainly as a body and hand soap, so I can&#x27;t speak to it as a face soap. But it’s easy on my skin. It also seems to be fairly long lasting. I haven&#x27;t gone through my first bar yet. Like other black soaps I’ve tried, it does get soggy on the bottom with use,  but that&#x27;s a small enough drawback for such a nice soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying various black soaps lately, because they go with my bathroom decor. This is the most confidence-inspiring. It&#x27;s organic, a huge plus. Made in U.S.A., another huge plus. It lathers beautifully. It&#x27;s  not heavily perfumed, but has a fresh, clean, slightly spicy scent .</li>
            <li> This soap smells great and lathers up well.  I have trouble with rashes  along my beltline and inside my thighs, and I an hoping it will have some natural antibacterial action there.  I just started using it so it is too soon to tell about that.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Makes lots of nice white foam. The bar seems to go fast. Expensive. When I started washing with this, it seems like my skin broke out a little bit at the same time, but I won&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just coincidence until I buy another bar.</li>
            <li> During my hunt for a &amp;#34;Big Bar&amp;#34; of soap, somehow this one popped up. Probably my mistake for not reading the size on the label but this thing is TINY! It smells ok and really lathers up on any hairy regions, barely at all anywhere else. Rinses clean. No long lasting odor. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed. In fact, my skin has been devastatingly itchier and dryer than before using this product.</li>
            <li> I really liked how soft my skin felt right after using it. My husband noticed right away. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and I really like the fact that I can use it on my face as well.</li>
