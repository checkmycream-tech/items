            <li> repeat buying ... same good quality of product and shipping service.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is mild.  It foams a little, but not too much.  Mouth feels refreshed when finished. The price is right!</li>

            <li> My hygienist is always pushing flouride-ridden toothpastes and giving me samples to use that claim major tartar control results.  I&#x27;ve been using need-based toothpastes and Manina in particular for the past 18 months and have not told my hygeinist simply because I don&#x27;t want the fluoride lecture.  Since swapping, she has told me at each 6 month cleaning appointment  what a good job I&#x27;m doing at home and how little work she is having to do to clean my teeth.  Using the major advertised brands before and flossing as I always have never got this kind of consistent praise about the at-home care I&#x27;m giving my teeth until now.  I particularly like the taste and texture of this toothpaste more than some other neem formulas.

            <li> Best toothpaste ever. I was told by my dentist that I would need to have my  front two teeth pulled. Started using this product over six months ago. Last checkup no problems.</li>

            <li> Great toothpaste. Good for your gums.</li>
            <li> I would never have purchased this if the ingredients were listed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use sodium lauryl sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sodium lauryl sulfate is made from coconuts so legally there is no misinformation but morally there is.</li>
