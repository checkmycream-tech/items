            <li>This product really does a great job.</li>
            <li>Enjoying the non-greasy, silky cream.</li>
            <li>Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a matte finish....</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I bought this cream more for prevention than cure.  </li>
            <li>Like any product like this, I believe that it takes time and regular use in order to see the best results.</li>
            <li>smooth and fine line are looking a lot better already..</li>
            <li>The customer service was great and look forward to making future purchases.</li>
            <li>It goes on creamy and dries smooth, not sticky (which I appreciate).</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>love this cream I noticed a difference the first time I used it</li>
            <li>but Vitamin C cream is very good for that price, leave a softness in the skin and improvement that you can see in few weeks or even days.</li>
            <li>So far I have experienced no negative effects from it.</li>
            <li>I  do love the cream itself - not greasy but very hydrating.  </li>

            <li>There is no unpleasant smell at all.</li>
            <li>It has considerably reduced my fine lines and my face feels smooth and healthier.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;m glad that I started with this product when I did, as I already have one jar under my belt, as far as the long-term results are concerned.</li>
            <li>I have used one jar of this lovely cream and just got my second jar.  </li>
            <li>and i even use it on my hands for younger looking skin and healthy hands..</li>
            <li>Face definitely looking better after 1 month usage</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to have a strong enough moisturizing effect</li>
            <li>smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a very gentile scent which a like a lot.</li>
            <li>&amp; I don&#x27;t think anything works that fast, so</li>
            <li>My friends and family has been asking me for my secret and I feel great inside.</li>
            <li>My skin is not only becoming more firm</li>
            <li>I really like how it makes your skin feel very soft and</li>
            <li>However, the fading process takes longer than one jars worth of daily use.  </li>
            <li>I shall be back, at a future time, when I can report accurately as to the fading action.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that wants to feel and look younger!</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this cream, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a professional quality anti-aging Vitamin C Cream.  </li>
            <li>This cream is really good, I tried some creams in my life some expensive</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after only one use.</li>

            <li> I have used one jar of this lovely cream and just got my second jar.  I  do love the cream itself - not greasy but very hydrating.  However, the fading process takes longer than one jars worth of daily use.  It &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; like the spots are diminishing, but wishful thinking may be at work.  I shall be back, at a future time, when I can report accurately as to the fading action.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m glad that I started with this product when I did, as I already have one jar under my belt, as far as the long-term results are concerned. Hoping to be back SOON!</li>
            <li> love this cream I noticed a difference the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Soaks in quickly with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it very long but it feels great on my skin.  I&#x27;ll send another review when I&#x27;ve used it longer.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the jar a few days &amp; I don&#x27;t think anything works that fast, so I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin... but the cream feels good going on.</li>

            <li> This cream is really good, I tried some creams in my life some expensive but Vitamin C cream is very good for that price, leave a softness in the skin and improvement that you can see in few weeks or even days. I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am pretty impressed with this. I was hesitant to use it as I have tried many products in the past that have failed. Yet this worked like a charm.  I have only been using this for a short time and I am already seeing a difference. My skin is not only becoming more firm but my wrinkles are also starting to vanish.This product really does a great job. My friends and family has been asking me for my secret and I feel great inside. I feel and look much younger than I have in a few years. I am very impressed with this product and I plan to continue to use this because it actually works.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with very quick delivery of this product. Enjoying the non-greasy, silky cream. There is no unpleasant smell at all. Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any results yet. Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a professional quality anti-aging Vitamin C Cream.  I haven&#x27;t used a Vitamin C Cream before but hear that Vitamin C is a great antioxidant so decided to give it a try.  What I like most about this cream is that it is very light weight.  Doesn&#x27;t have that heavy greasy feel may creams have so I&#x27;ve been using it as a day AND night cream.  It goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  I love that it has a matte finish....NO SHINE! &#x3D;)  I haven&#x27;t had any reactions to the cream...but don&#x27;t usually anyways.  My skin is in pretty good condition already as I always take good care of it with great skin care products.  I bought this cream more for prevention than cure.  What I believe you will like best about this cream is how light it feels, and the very nice matte finish.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product on my face twice a day for two weeks. It goes on creamy and dries smooth, not sticky (which I appreciate). So far I have experienced no negative effects from it. It leaves my skin smooth and soft. Like any product like this, I believe that it takes time and regular use in order to see the best results. There is a generous amount of product in the container and I look forward to updating this review down the road a bit to report on the results.</li>
