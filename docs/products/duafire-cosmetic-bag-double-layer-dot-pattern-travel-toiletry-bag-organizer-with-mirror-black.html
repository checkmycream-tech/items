            <li>Holds my huge collection of make up, surprisingly.</li>

            <li>The top compartment is my every day makeup.</li>
            <li>Love it, use mine every day.</li>
            <li>Adorable and does the job.</li>
            <li>I better be able to return this product or else.</li>
            <li>This is my most preferred bag when I had to go somewhere and bring my makeup with me.</li>
            <li>Bonamart Double layer cosmetic bag does a wonderful job for my needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  OK.</li>
            <li>I love it, tho</li>
            <li>as well i love this product</li>
            <li>I love this bag</li>
            <li>The top lid includes loops to hold makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased.</li>
            <li>It was cute though.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Seems durable, and I have put my most often used make-up in this case.</li>
            <li>However I am really enjoying the bag.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try to spray it with Febreeze and hope it smells better.</li>
            <li>It has 2 compartments, top and bottom.</li>
            <li>It is ok...</li>
            <li>Having two compartments helps you to organize better.  </li>
            <li>It cost more to ship from China than the value of the materials.</li>
            <li>I love the 2 compartments.  </li>
            <li>I am able to put a lot in it.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup bag and look forward to using it when I go on vacay in July ^_^</li>
            <li>I will use it, but I have to have 2 more bags to hold the rest of my cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I love this because I can tote my makeup wherever I go in a neatly organized bag.  </li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>If you give it to a toddler or use it like a toddler it&#x27;s going to rip, sure, but if you handle it with care, it will do just what it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li>bought this for my wife to put most of her makeup in.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Cute and compact.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this makeup tote.</li>
            <li>I love it when I&#x27;m traveling or even just at home.</li>
            <li>I love it lots of room for all my makeup</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>Adorable.</li>
            <li>Love the material.</li>
            <li>This bag is really cute and has plenty of storage space.  </li>
            <li>I love the multi-level design.  </li>
            <li>but we love it&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so cute, has two compartments.  </li>
            <li>In the top I can keep all my eyeliner, Foundation, eyebrow pencils, blush, mascara, lipstick, powder, and travel mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wont be able to use it what i bought it for</li>
            <li>Perfect for my teen daughter.</li>
            <li>I put my makeup in the top part and all my travel supplies in the bottom.</li>
            <li>I love how spacious this bag is while still compact.</li>
            <li>I can fit all my makeup in there!</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>It looks tiny but even if you have 2 of each of those items, this is great!!!</li>
            <li>I use the top part of the cosmetic bag to put her brush, sunglasses, and bows.  </li>
            <li>(I love makeup)</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, reinforced sides would be better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Really cute.</li>
            <li>Perfect for when I just need to pack my daily makeup for a weekend at a friends house :) fabric is fine</li>
            <li>Perfect and convenient for travel, though I bought this a couple of years ago, I remember it took a long time to ship from China.</li>
            <li>We will see how it holds up, but upon first impression, it appears the quality is good.</li>
            <li>Although the bag took a long time to get here, it was still a great bag for the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t choose I love it because it is still cheaply make</li>
            <li>I thought this was cute, it was cheap and affordable.</li>
            <li>Plus, the print is super cute &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking it would be good for traveling; it would fit in a large suitcase if you don&#x27;t over pack the case with items.</li>
            <li>sure why the original ship date was about a month+ after I placed the order.)  </li>
            <li>Easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>They are very cute and great for storing things other than make up!  </li>
            <li>Nothing special but not horrible product.</li>
            <li>It sits beautifully in my bathroom cabinet - I use it daily.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fine with this</li>
            <li>It easily collapses to fit where you need it to go.</li>
            <li>Super cute and spacious.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly as well!</li>
            <li>This little make up bag is amazing!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect little bag.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t huge, so my makeup doesn&#x27;t get lost, but it still fits quite a bit of makeup inside.  </li>
            <li>The zippers work smoothly.  </li>
            <li>So happy this finally came in!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean interior with damp paper towel.</li>
            <li>Some things I needed to fit into it for travel couldn&#x27;t go because of the length.  </li>
            <li>This is a cheaply made dollar store bag from China.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t fit the bulkier products.</li>
            <li>I can fit everything I need in it.</li>
            <li>she goes back and forth from our house and her moms and this bag was great for keeping track of things.</li>
            <li>The zippers on it are cheap.</li>
            <li>even your brushes well fit in it&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and has a bit of stretch to it when cramming things in it.</li>
            <li>You can fit quite a bit.</li>
            <li>It kinda feels cheap though and took like 6 weeks to receive.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap made bag, the threads were hanging out where it was sewed together with plastic.</li>
            <li>and it looks really cheap</li>
            <li>Is so cute I love it so much</li>
            <li>Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality.</li>
            <li>You will stay very very organized with this bag, and cute.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get excited about the mirror</li>
            <li>When it first arrived in the package,it looked tiny, but it can hold a surprising amount of stuff inside!</li>
            <li>It holds all of my makeup and sits upright on my bathroom counter which makes getting ready in the mornings quick and easy!</li>
            <li>Just right size, wish I bought two!</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy for the price though.</li>
            <li>Good quality but alot smaller in person</li>
            <li>I love this bag so much.</li>
            <li>Good quality, and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I love it, cleared up so much space in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I would have to stuff the bottom compartment completely with tissue to achieve that kind of support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li>I expect that it will be good for a half dozen uses at most.</li>
            <li>I love my new makeup bag!</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the circles on the top half aren&#x27;t perfect circles they look drawn out ovals?</li>
            <li>I love how there&#x27;s two different compartments and the top has the brush holders.</li>
            <li>Excellent for taking small make-up items and not your whole make up draw!</li>
            <li>Love this everything fit inside more than what I expected</li>
            <li>also shipping was SUPER FAST!!</li>
            <li>I was able to fit all my nail polish and accessories in one, and most of my makeup in the other.</li>
            <li>The materials are very durable and zipper works easily</li>
            <li>When it arrived I thought it was smaller than what I wanted, but all of my makeup fit inside with room to spare!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>i liked this product it is easy to use and efficient for makeup purposes and other purposes</li>
            <li>The Shipping was real fast, good quality and it looks just like the picture, good enough to put makeup in when I travel, it even has a little mirror and brush holder, for the price</li>
            <li>I really needed a cheap makeup bag because I did not want to spend a lot of money, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>The double zipper compartment really fits a good portion of makeup products.</li>
            <li>I do not own too much makeup, so the bag is just perfect.</li>
            <li>which was the perfect size for what I wanted it for, however, the interior lining is so thin you can see into the sewing and construction of the bag.</li>
            <li>I was using an old shaving bag my husband had after my mom stole my favorite one from me</li>
            <li>However, there is a distinct smell of cigarette smoke.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own like it does in the picture, which kinda bums me out, because all my stuff moves around way easier than if it was a solid bag, but that&#x27;s not a biggie.</li>
            <li>Easily worth $20,</li>
            <li>This was smaller than I expected but was perfect for what I needed.</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>It is smaller than I thought, but it is like super super cute.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast as well!</li>
            <li>and it came pretty quickly for me.</li>
            <li>ItIt&#x27;s definitely a super cute bag and big enough to fit a great deal of make up, only issue I have</li>
            <li>Its the perfect size to carry the makeup essentials for vacation or a weekend away :) its a silky thick material and can be compressed down when not in use to fit in a drawer or anywhere.</li>
            <li>Size and picture is right.</li>
            <li>I was even able to fit long makeup brushes in the bag.</li>
            <li>nice small container to store my toiletries in :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little traveling bag!</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the lining on the inside gets stained very easily and needs to be washed.</li>
            <li>The compartments are deep and its very easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>honestly its really cheap quality and just stays smushed down, not like pictured at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect if you want to travel and only have a few items.</li>
            <li>I love this little bag, so worth the wait!!</li>
            <li>It definitely looks bigger and better in the pictures than the real thing, but honestly for the price</li>
            <li>Happy with this purchase but expected a little better.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought but cute</li>
            <li>Perfect to carry small, necessary item un the car.</li>
            <li>The bag is exactly as pictured and described - came</li>
            <li>it had a funny smell...</li>
            <li>Thought it would be bigger but is still ok</li>
            <li>Finally found a makeup bag in which all of my makeup can fit into!</li>
            <li>and it is very roomy!</li>
            <li>I like the idea of the product more than the actual product.</li>
            <li>had some extra room to bring more home.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want her touching it and subsequently putting hands in her mouth,eyes,etc...</li>
            <li>I took it on a travel trip and it worked out very well!</li>
            <li>This was exactly the size I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what was described.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed to suit my traveling needs.</li>
            <li>Good for travel or everyday use, got it for my sister to hold her first makeup set.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be bigger, but still okay size.</li>
            <li>The two different top and bottom compartments make it exactly what I needed to keep things separated.</li>
            <li>I actually love that it&#x27;s not big.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well-designed and well-built!</li>
            <li>On the bottom I put her thermometer and mini first aid kit.</li>
            <li>I think it worth the money, it was smaller than i expected but for the cost im happy</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s most likely my fault.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This one I received quickly and the quality was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>It fit nicely in my suitcase because the sides are not stiff so it can collapse down some in areas that aren&#x27;t stuffed.</li>
            <li>Quite a lot smaller than expected but works great.</li>
            <li>Great item smaller tha expected</li>
            <li>I really like this Layer Cosmetic Bag, matches two other pieces I own</li>
            <li>I really do like to two zipper compartments, I can go to a section and get exactly what I am looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable and a little shiny, and it&#x27;s very cute.</li>
            <li>This little makeup bag is just too cute!</li>
            <li>Very cute bigger than expected because the reviews said small with z cute mirror inside the bag awesome for little girl teens or travel bag!!</li>
            <li>Not as large,  as the picture betray it to be, and it&#x27;s too flimsy, and all my make up stuff</li>
            <li>Two compartments that are large.</li>
            <li>The construction is sturdy, however if it is not full of makeup it does kind of collapse in on itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is good for younger girls just getting into makeup, or MAYBE a travel bag with limited makeup products.</li>
            <li>super cute and size appropriate to throw into your purse whether for makeup or just random things</li>
            <li>This bag was a little smaller than I had hoped it would be but was a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li>I like it but before ordering check the measurements because i expected to be huge in size!</li>
            <li>Smaller then I thought but everything fit well</li>
            <li>it is made of very durable material and</li>
            <li>It is really convenient.</li>
            <li>Very spacious</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My mom really likes this.</li>
            <li>The bag is very spacious.</li>
            <li>It is a double layer case and I can even fit my longest brushes in it.</li>
            <li>It holds more than I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li>but i dont have that much make up anyways</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has two compartments and trust me it has more space than expected.</li>
            <li>I like, more than I expected.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for really.</li>
            <li>The handle is very sturdy and I couldn&#x27;t see it ever breaking.</li>
            <li>the slots for the brushes are perfect sizes for my everyday brushes but my giant powder brush is a tiny bit too tall.</li>
            <li>I really like the set.</li>
            <li>and very well made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable as well.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to us and has alot of room in.</li>
            <li>I really like this bag.</li>
            <li>You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It is MUCHA smaller than the picture and the material feels cheap.</li>
            <li>Nice bag possibly for an alternate purpose</li>
            <li>(though I&#x27;m pretty sure it mentions the sizing) and are let down when they order it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s plenty of space in the top and the bottom for all of my makeup; I also like that I can put all of my foundation/base cosmetics in one compartment and have all of my lip and eye stuff in the other.</li>
            <li>Holds a decent amount of makeup.</li>
            <li>nice but a lot smaller than expected</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit smaller than I imagined, but all in all, it&#x27;s very reasonable for the price!</li>
            <li>I keep my polishes and primers in a polish case, but I needed a small bag to keep my new gel manicure tools tidy.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to any</li>
            <li>It has a little cute mirror inside it as well.</li>
            <li>it has cute little spaces for brushes and pencils, along with a mirror</li>
            <li>Wish it was a little more sturdy</li>
            <li>a cute little bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The top compartment also has a little mirror in it, which I took out.</li>
            <li>I love this little pouch.</li>
            <li>love how small it is when not in use and how large it becomes when you put your all of your make up in it&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the black with white polka dots and it is so cute!</li>
            <li>This bad is awesome.</li>
            <li>Overall I still like the bag and for the price I still think it is worth it</li>
            <li>I put makeup I use often in the top section, and stuff I use less frequently in the bottom.</li>
            <li>This bag was just the right size for traveling or just keeping daily essentials in.</li>
            <li>I have a large caboodle case now and this little case fit all the makeup I wanted to bring plus</li>
            <li>Other than the potential health hazzard, it&#x27;s pretty cute,  and for my limited make-up stash it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>From all the reviews, I was expecting it to be tiny, but it&#x27;s a pretty decent size.</li>
            <li>Looking for a new style travel cosmetic case.</li>
            <li>NEW Kiss Pro LED Gel lamp (Just Lamp)</li>
            <li>Smaller then expected but I still love it</li>
            <li>big enough to fit all my makeup</li>
            <li>The top of this was a bit smaller than I had expected</li>
            <li>Also, the one I received has the slots or the brushes in the base of the top section, which is probably a good thing...</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and not worth your money.  </li>
            <li>it is small, stylish and durable.&lt;br /&gt;the  </li>
            <li>Top compartment includes a small attached mirror.</li>
            <li>Came early tho!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely big enough to hold even a third of my cosmetics, and I don&#x27;t have that many.</li>
            <li>It looked like something a 7 year old would sew!  </li>
            <li>Also I wish the material was a little bit stiffer so that bag didn&#x27;t get squished as easily.</li>
            <li>it was stated new in the description but clearly it wasn&#x27;t it smelled of perfume and was stained with something sticky.</li>
            <li>Pretty much what i expected.</li>
            <li>Fits me for my needs, so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only problem is, the zipper gets really stuck and im afriad of the bag ripping</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see anywhere in the product description stating it is mailed direct from China.</li>
            <li>I would like to know, so that I can make a decision not to purchase things direct from China.</li>
            <li>It is a soft plastic polka-dotted design and has a handle.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be bigger than what was shipped; however the size doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>I can fit a face cleaning brush, a bar of soap and the case for the soap, a small tube of sunscreen, and many small products of eyeshadow+an eyelash curler+makeup brushes+foundation in this bag.</li>
            <li>the only complaint i really have is that in the top compartment the brush holders don&#x27;t hold any of my brushes....</li>
            <li>Took two weeks to get, direct from China.</li>
            <li>The only thing i dont like is when you open the bottom compartment you need the top to be closed</li>
            <li>If u love makeup and have a lot ,this is way 2 small !</li>
            <li>It also stains incredibly easy, and I&#x27;m not sure how to get them out.</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected but still sturdy and useful, live the attached mirror.</li>
            <li>Too small, I should have read the fine prints</li>
            <li>small, cute, holds basic makeup, so</li>
            <li>It holds all of the makeup I usually wear in the top section and all of the extra stuff I dont use all of the time in the bottom.</li>
            <li>It is made out of thin material that frays very easily.  </li>
            <li>This was smaller than I expected as others have stated, but generally I do not have much makeup and it fits everything I have adequately.</li>
            <li>only thing I would change is that there is not much support in the sides; the material is very collapsible, so when I have heavy makeup in the top compartment, the bag leans this way or</li>
            <li>Too small for a primary / home cosmetic bag.  </li>
            <li>I can only fit a few things</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adorable on the outside but very small.</li>
            <li>Shipping takes a little while, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I can get the same thing at a large local retailer for almost the same price.</li>
            <li>The zipper does not work properly as it gets stuck frequently.  </li>
            <li>Much roomier than I expected.</li>
            <li>SUPER SMALL and smells like a rat died in it</li>
            <li>Cheap and very small.</li>
            <li>At home, I have been using the bottom section for makeup not used everyday and the top zipper for everyday makeup.</li>
            <li>I got it for my little cousin and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>but it is really sturdy and can hold all of an average persons makeup.</li>
            <li>It has a few holder&#x27;s in the top section for small brushes (also holds mascara in the holder&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>It is the right size, not too big or small.</li>
            <li>I only have the basics: foundation, b lush, eye liner, mascara and a loose powder.</li>
            <li>It has brush and pencil storage space as well as a little mirror that I don&#x27;t really use.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as cute little case to use as a secondary case to put on the plane.</li>
            <li>It is a little smaller than expected, but then again, I have a lot of makeup and everything fits in it except for a few of my brushes, which is okay</li>

            <li> I love it, tho</li>
            <li> as well i love this product</li>
            <li> I love this bag</li>
            <li> The top lid includes loops to hold makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> It was cute though.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Seems durable, and I have put my most often used make-up in this case.</li>
            <li> However I am really enjoying the bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to spray it with Febreeze and hope it smells better.</li>
            <li> It has 2 compartments, top and bottom.</li>
            <li> It is ok...</li>
            <li> Having two compartments helps you to organize better.  </li>
            <li> It cost more to ship from China than the value of the materials.</li>
            <li> I love the 2 compartments.  </li>
            <li> I am able to put a lot in it.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup bag and look forward to using it when I go on vacay in July ^_^</li>
            <li> I will use it, but I have to have 2 more bags to hold the rest of my cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I love this because I can tote my makeup wherever I go in a neatly organized bag.  </li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> If you give it to a toddler or use it like a toddler it&#x27;s going to rip, sure, but if you handle it with care, it will do just what it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife to put most of her makeup in.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Cute and compact.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup tote.</li>

            <li> I love it lots of room for all my makeup</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> Adorable.</li>
            <li> Love the material.</li>
            <li> This bag is really cute and has plenty of storage space.  </li>
            <li> I love the multi-level design.  </li>
            <li> but we love it&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so cute, has two compartments.  </li>
            <li> In the top I can keep all my eyeliner, Foundation, eyebrow pencils, blush, mascara, lipstick, powder, and travel mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wont be able to use it what i bought it for</li>
            <li> Perfect for my teen daughter.</li>
            <li> I put my makeup in the top part and all my travel supplies in the bottom.</li>
            <li> I love how spacious this bag is while still compact.</li>
            <li> I can fit all my makeup in there!</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> It looks tiny but even if you have 2 of each of those items, this is great!!!</li>
            <li> I use the top part of the cosmetic bag to put her brush, sunglasses, and bows.  </li>
            <li> (I love makeup)</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, reinforced sides would be better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Really cute.</li>
            <li> Perfect for when I just need to pack my daily makeup for a weekend at a friends house :) fabric is fine</li>
            <li> Perfect and convenient for travel, though I bought this a couple of years ago, I remember it took a long time to ship from China.</li>
            <li> We will see how it holds up, but upon first impression, it appears the quality is good.</li>
            <li> Although the bag took a long time to get here, it was still a great bag for the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t choose I love it because it is still cheaply make</li>
            <li> I thought this was cute, it was cheap and affordable.</li>
            <li> Plus, the print is super cute &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking it would be good for traveling; it would fit in a large suitcase if you don&#x27;t over pack the case with items.</li>
            <li> sure why the original ship date was about a month+ after I placed the order.)  </li>
            <li> Easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> They are very cute and great for storing things other than make up!  </li>
            <li> Nothing special but not horrible product.</li>
            <li> It sits beautifully in my bathroom cabinet - I use it daily.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m fine with this</li>
            <li> It easily collapses to fit where you need it to go.</li>
            <li> Super cute and spacious.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly as well!</li>
            <li> This little make up bag is amazing!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect little bag.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t huge, so my makeup doesn&#x27;t get lost, but it still fits quite a bit of makeup inside.  </li>
            <li> The zippers work smoothly.  </li>
            <li> So happy this finally came in!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean interior with damp paper towel.</li>
            <li> Some things I needed to fit into it for travel couldn&#x27;t go because of the length.  </li>
            <li> This is a cheaply made dollar store bag from China.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t fit the bulkier products.</li>
            <li> I can fit everything I need in it.</li>
            <li> she goes back and forth from our house and her moms and this bag was great for keeping track of things.</li>
            <li> The zippers on it are cheap.</li>
            <li> even your brushes well fit in it&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and has a bit of stretch to it when cramming things in it.</li>
            <li> You can fit quite a bit.</li>
            <li> It kinda feels cheap though and took like 6 weeks to receive.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap made bag, the threads were hanging out where it was sewed together with plastic.</li>
            <li> and it looks really cheap</li>
            <li> Is so cute I love it so much</li>
            <li> Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality.</li>
            <li> You will stay very very organized with this bag, and cute.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get excited about the mirror</li>
            <li> When it first arrived in the package,it looked tiny, but it can hold a surprising amount of stuff inside!</li>
            <li> It holds all of my makeup and sits upright on my bathroom counter which makes getting ready in the mornings quick and easy!</li>
            <li> Just right size, wish I bought two!</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy for the price though.</li>
            <li> Good quality but alot smaller in person</li>
            <li> I love this bag so much.</li>
            <li> Good quality, and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it, cleared up so much space in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I would have to stuff the bottom compartment completely with tissue to achieve that kind of support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li> I expect that it will be good for a half dozen uses at most.</li>
            <li> I love my new makeup bag!</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the circles on the top half aren&#x27;t perfect circles they look drawn out ovals?</li>
            <li> I love how there&#x27;s two different compartments and the top has the brush holders.</li>
            <li> Excellent for taking small make-up items and not your whole make up draw!</li>
            <li> Love this everything fit inside more than what I expected</li>
            <li> also shipping was SUPER FAST!!</li>
            <li> I was able to fit all my nail polish and accessories in one, and most of my makeup in the other.</li>
            <li> The materials are very durable and zipper works easily</li>
            <li> When it arrived I thought it was smaller than what I wanted, but all of my makeup fit inside with room to spare!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> i liked this product it is easy to use and efficient for makeup purposes and other purposes</li>
            <li> The Shipping was real fast, good quality and it looks just like the picture, good enough to put makeup in when I travel, it even has a little mirror and brush holder, for the price</li>
            <li> I really needed a cheap makeup bag because I did not want to spend a lot of money, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> The double zipper compartment really fits a good portion of makeup products.</li>
            <li> I do not own too much makeup, so the bag is just perfect.</li>
            <li> which was the perfect size for what I wanted it for, however, the interior lining is so thin you can see into the sewing and construction of the bag.</li>
            <li> I was using an old shaving bag my husband had after my mom stole my favorite one from me</li>
            <li> However, there is a distinct smell of cigarette smoke.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own like it does in the picture, which kinda bums me out, because all my stuff moves around way easier than if it was a solid bag, but that&#x27;s not a biggie.</li>
            <li> Easily worth $20,</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I expected but was perfect for what I needed.</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I thought, but it is like super super cute.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast as well!</li>
            <li> and it came pretty quickly for me.</li>
            <li> ItIt&#x27;s definitely a super cute bag and big enough to fit a great deal of make up, only issue I have</li>
            <li> Its the perfect size to carry the makeup essentials for vacation or a weekend away :) its a silky thick material and can be compressed down when not in use to fit in a drawer or anywhere.</li>
            <li> Size and picture is right.</li>
            <li> I was even able to fit long makeup brushes in the bag.</li>
            <li> nice small container to store my toiletries in :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little traveling bag!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the lining on the inside gets stained very easily and needs to be washed.</li>
            <li> The compartments are deep and its very easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> honestly its really cheap quality and just stays smushed down, not like pictured at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect if you want to travel and only have a few items.</li>
            <li> I love this little bag, so worth the wait!!</li>
            <li> It definitely looks bigger and better in the pictures than the real thing, but honestly for the price</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase but expected a little better.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought but cute</li>
            <li> Perfect to carry small, necessary item un the car.</li>
            <li> The bag is exactly as pictured and described - came</li>
            <li> it had a funny smell...</li>
            <li> Thought it would be bigger but is still ok</li>
            <li> Finally found a makeup bag in which all of my makeup can fit into!</li>
            <li> and it is very roomy!</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the product more than the actual product.</li>
            <li> had some extra room to bring more home.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want her touching it and subsequently putting hands in her mouth,eyes,etc...</li>
            <li> I took it on a travel trip and it worked out very well!</li>
            <li> This was exactly the size I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed to suit my traveling needs.</li>
            <li> Good for travel or everyday use, got it for my sister to hold her first makeup set.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be bigger, but still okay size.</li>
            <li> The two different top and bottom compartments make it exactly what I needed to keep things separated.</li>
            <li> I actually love that it&#x27;s not big.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well-designed and well-built!</li>
            <li> On the bottom I put her thermometer and mini first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I think it worth the money, it was smaller than i expected but for the cost im happy</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s most likely my fault.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This one I received quickly and the quality was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> It fit nicely in my suitcase because the sides are not stiff so it can collapse down some in areas that aren&#x27;t stuffed.</li>
            <li> Quite a lot smaller than expected but works great.</li>
            <li> Great item smaller tha expected</li>
            <li> I really like this Layer Cosmetic Bag, matches two other pieces I own</li>
            <li> I really do like to two zipper compartments, I can go to a section and get exactly what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable and a little shiny, and it&#x27;s very cute.</li>
            <li> This little makeup bag is just too cute!</li>
            <li> Very cute bigger than expected because the reviews said small with z cute mirror inside the bag awesome for little girl teens or travel bag!!</li>
            <li> Not as large,  as the picture betray it to be, and it&#x27;s too flimsy, and all my make up stuff</li>
            <li> Two compartments that are large.</li>
            <li> The construction is sturdy, however if it is not full of makeup it does kind of collapse in on itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is good for younger girls just getting into makeup, or MAYBE a travel bag with limited makeup products.</li>
            <li> super cute and size appropriate to throw into your purse whether for makeup or just random things</li>
            <li> This bag was a little smaller than I had hoped it would be but was a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I like it but before ordering check the measurements because i expected to be huge in size!</li>
            <li> Smaller then I thought but everything fit well</li>
            <li> it is made of very durable material and</li>
            <li> It is really convenient.</li>
            <li> Very spacious</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My mom really likes this.</li>
            <li> The bag is very spacious.</li>
            <li> It is a double layer case and I can even fit my longest brushes in it.</li>
            <li> It holds more than I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> but i dont have that much make up anyways</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has two compartments and trust me it has more space than expected.</li>
            <li> I like, more than I expected.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for really.</li>
            <li> The handle is very sturdy and I couldn&#x27;t see it ever breaking.</li>
            <li> the slots for the brushes are perfect sizes for my everyday brushes but my giant powder brush is a tiny bit too tall.</li>
            <li> I really like the set.</li>
            <li> and very well made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable as well.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to us and has alot of room in.</li>
            <li> I really like this bag.</li>
            <li> You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It is MUCHA smaller than the picture and the material feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Nice bag possibly for an alternate purpose</li>
            <li> (though I&#x27;m pretty sure it mentions the sizing) and are let down when they order it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s plenty of space in the top and the bottom for all of my makeup; I also like that I can put all of my foundation/base cosmetics in one compartment and have all of my lip and eye stuff in the other.</li>
            <li> Holds a decent amount of makeup.</li>
            <li> nice but a lot smaller than expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit smaller than I imagined, but all in all, it&#x27;s very reasonable for the price!</li>
            <li> I keep my polishes and primers in a polish case, but I needed a small bag to keep my new gel manicure tools tidy.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to any</li>
            <li> It has a little cute mirror inside it as well.</li>
            <li> it has cute little spaces for brushes and pencils, along with a mirror</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little more sturdy</li>
            <li> a cute little bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The top compartment also has a little mirror in it, which I took out.</li>
            <li> I love this little pouch.</li>
            <li> love how small it is when not in use and how large it becomes when you put your all of your make up in it&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the black with white polka dots and it is so cute!</li>
            <li> This bad is awesome.</li>
            <li> Overall I still like the bag and for the price I still think it is worth it</li>
            <li> I put makeup I use often in the top section, and stuff I use less frequently in the bottom.</li>
            <li> This bag was just the right size for traveling or just keeping daily essentials in.</li>
            <li> I have a large caboodle case now and this little case fit all the makeup I wanted to bring plus</li>
            <li> Other than the potential health hazzard, it&#x27;s pretty cute,  and for my limited make-up stash it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> From all the reviews, I was expecting it to be tiny, but it&#x27;s a pretty decent size.</li>
            <li> Looking for a new style travel cosmetic case.</li>
            <li> NEW Kiss Pro LED Gel lamp (Just Lamp)</li>
            <li> Smaller then expected but I still love it</li>
            <li> big enough to fit all my makeup</li>
            <li> The top of this was a bit smaller than I had expected</li>
            <li> Also, the one I received has the slots or the brushes in the base of the top section, which is probably a good thing...</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and not worth your money.  </li>
            <li> it is small, stylish and durable.&lt;br /&gt;the  </li>
            <li> Top compartment includes a small attached mirror.</li>
            <li> Came early tho!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely big enough to hold even a third of my cosmetics, and I don&#x27;t have that many.</li>
            <li> It looked like something a 7 year old would sew!  </li>
            <li> Also I wish the material was a little bit stiffer so that bag didn&#x27;t get squished as easily.</li>
            <li> it was stated new in the description but clearly it wasn&#x27;t it smelled of perfume and was stained with something sticky.</li>
            <li> Pretty much what i expected.</li>
            <li> Fits me for my needs, so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only problem is, the zipper gets really stuck and im afriad of the bag ripping</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anywhere in the product description stating it is mailed direct from China.</li>
            <li> I would like to know, so that I can make a decision not to purchase things direct from China.</li>
            <li> It is a soft plastic polka-dotted design and has a handle.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be bigger than what was shipped; however the size doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> I can fit a face cleaning brush, a bar of soap and the case for the soap, a small tube of sunscreen, and many small products of eyeshadow+an eyelash curler+makeup brushes+foundation in this bag.</li>
            <li> the only complaint i really have is that in the top compartment the brush holders don&#x27;t hold any of my brushes....</li>
            <li> Took two weeks to get, direct from China.</li>
            <li> The only thing i dont like is when you open the bottom compartment you need the top to be closed</li>
            <li> If u love makeup and have a lot ,this is way 2 small !</li>
            <li> It also stains incredibly easy, and I&#x27;m not sure how to get them out.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but still sturdy and useful, live the attached mirror.</li>
            <li> Too small, I should have read the fine prints</li>
            <li> small, cute, holds basic makeup, so</li>
            <li> It holds all of the makeup I usually wear in the top section and all of the extra stuff I dont use all of the time in the bottom.</li>
            <li> It is made out of thin material that frays very easily.  </li>
            <li> This was smaller than I expected as others have stated, but generally I do not have much makeup and it fits everything I have adequately.</li>
            <li> only thing I would change is that there is not much support in the sides; the material is very collapsible, so when I have heavy makeup in the top compartment, the bag leans this way or</li>
            <li> Too small for a primary / home cosmetic bag.  </li>
            <li> I can only fit a few things</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adorable on the outside but very small.</li>
            <li> Shipping takes a little while, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I can get the same thing at a large local retailer for almost the same price.</li>
            <li> The zipper does not work properly as it gets stuck frequently.  </li>
            <li> Much roomier than I expected.</li>
            <li> SUPER SMALL and smells like a rat died in it</li>
            <li> Cheap and very small.</li>
            <li> At home, I have been using the bottom section for makeup not used everyday and the top zipper for everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> I got it for my little cousin and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> but it is really sturdy and can hold all of an average persons makeup.</li>
            <li> It has a few holder&#x27;s in the top section for small brushes (also holds mascara in the holder&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> It is the right size, not too big or small.</li>
            <li> I only have the basics: foundation, b lush, eye liner, mascara and a loose powder.</li>
            <li> It has brush and pencil storage space as well as a little mirror that I don&#x27;t really use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as cute little case to use as a secondary case to put on the plane.</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than expected, but then again, I have a lot of makeup and everything fits in it except for a few of my brushes, which is okay</li>
            <li> I paid a small price and knew it would be a small ittem that wasn&#x27;t super high quality</li>
            <li> It looks a little to cheap and small</li>
            <li> I really hoped that the case was bigger by detailing the specifications and definitive but really I am not satisfied</li>
            <li> Lots of room, well made and folds flat when not in use..  </li>
            <li> I  hope this Double layer cosmetic bag lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived flat</li>
            <li> Arrived in a Chinese Post bag; no surprise as I forgot I even order it as it took so long.</li>
            <li> It folds flat for storage.</li>
            <li> Came squished and compacted,thought was harder and bigger.</li>
            <li> This is way smaller then what i expected</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> This bag also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but I expected it to be much bigger.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than expected</li>
            <li> it is also not as large as pictured and can hold very small Cosmetic items.</li>
            <li> A bit smaller than expected, but yah, for the price!</li>
            <li> Plus, it took forever to arrive due to international shipping.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought, wish it was a little larger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;there is also enough compartments init to keep things neat and separated from each other  to foundation eyes shadow</li>
            <li> The only dislike I have was all the loose threads I had to cut off when I first received, and the bag was a bit dirty despite being in clear plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> it usually take a month to come but mines came like a week early</li>
            <li> a little smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> And then give a little extra case in the meantime.</li>
            <li> A little bit smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, a little bit different than the picture described&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was I little smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> The makeup bag was a little smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than expected</li>
            <li> This bag was a little smaller than I had expected</li>
            <li> I did not liked because is soft</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and would warn anyone with allergies or asthma to be careful.</li>
            <li> I paid only a few dollars</li>
            <li> but that was expected.  </li>
            <li> Very flimsy and poorly made.</li>
            <li> This is not really problematic for me.</li>
            <li> then I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Love having the two separate compartments for base, powder in one and eye shadow and pencils, mascara, etc.. in the upper compartment.  </li>
            <li> I express disappointment with this purchase because it is far too diminutive in size and more or less rendered useless for the purpose of storing and carrying around basic cosmetics .</li>
            <li> The bag size is  7.48 x 4.65 x 5.31&amp;quot;, so it is not too big, yet not to small.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my makeup, it looked small when I open it</li>
            <li> This bag is not to big and not too small.  </li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t use for my makeup but will hold on to it for other things.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a small gift with some goodies inside, it was a big hit!!!</li>
            <li> small enough to throw in an overnight bag...</li>
            <li> I would get this bag if you&#x27;re looking for a bag that&#x27;s not too big or small.</li>
            <li> Need to close one compartment before accessing the other.  </li>
            <li> A little flimsier than expected</li>
            <li> Should last at least a while.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the wait</li>
            <li> This plastic make-up bag would get a negative star if it was possible.  </li>
            <li> I am a makeup fanatic and recommend that if you are to you look for a bigger bag or buy two (what I did).</li>
            <li> but it got the job done none he less.</li>
            <li> There is a small mirror for emergencies as well as slots to keep my brushes in so they aren&#x27;t crushed.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasnt packed so tight, it took a while to stretch it out</li>
            <li> It also comes with a little mirror.</li>
            <li> Got this little makeup bag for my travels</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll do as a little makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it to my niece to carry her little toys</li>
            <li> Rated 4/5 because shipping took a little while 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you $5 dollars on this cramp.  </li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to receive.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bag that would hold my everyday makeup and</li>
            <li> Only issue I had was one of the cases had a broken mirror, but no biggie.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something small due to other reviewers, but it was really small when it came!</li>
            <li> It is very small, not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> Has a little mirror attached and space for brushes!</li>
            <li> Too small...  </li>
            <li> Too small for my needs.</li>
            <li> Its a bit small</li>
            <li> but I had expected the zipper to not get broken after one time using it</li>
            <li> I did think it was about 2 inches too small.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but a lot fits.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it was small when I got it in</li>
            <li> Had I known it was so small</li>
            <li> I like it but its kinda small.</li>
            <li> This case is small...</li>
            <li> Unbelievable bag for the money.  </li>
            <li> Way to small for my make-up needs, lesson learned.</li>
            <li> it holds all my small make up as you can see in the picture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to look into it while you are applying anything, as it is on a tether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fall out as easily at least...</li>
            <li> slow shipping  </li>
            <li> It is so very small.  </li>
            <li> very small  but kid doesnt mind</li>
            <li> Very small and plastic.</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously considering throwing it away, because I have a toddler</li>
            <li> Nothing too serious but..?</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not good for liquids of glass.  </li>
            <li> Not good if you have a lot of makeup though</li>
            <li> The picture makes this product look big, but I was disappointed when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Poor, Poor</li>
            <li> And one of the zippers came broken off.</li>
            <li> but its very small!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is it took forever to get to me from the seller!</li>
            <li> I am a cheerleader and it has plenty of room for all of my bows and makeup for when I go to a game!</li>
            <li> but I was wrong</li>
            <li> I Cant get past the terrible smell of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this bag.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Smaller than I thought but cute</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.  Lots of room, well made and folds flat when not in use..  No padding so it&#x27;s not good for liquids of glass.  Don&#x27;t get excited about the mirror - it&#x27;s 2&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34; in a  in a tethered holder - the usable area of the mirror is about 1.5&amp;#34;x1.5&amp;#34; just barely enough surface to see if you have something on your teeth.  The zippers work smoothly.  I&#x27;m happy with mine, it does what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> Came squished and compacted,thought was harder and bigger.</li>
            <li> Fits all my makeup and was a great price. Shipping does take a while but I didn&#x27;t mind waiting.</li>
            <li> This bag was just the right size for traveling or just keeping daily essentials in. It has two compartments and bands for brushes. Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but still sturdy and useful, live the attached mirror. Great outer finish and designed to hold brushes.</li>
            <li> Perfect and convenient for travel, though I bought this a couple of years ago, I remember it took a long time to ship from China.</li>
            <li> Smaller then I thought but everything fit well</li>
            <li> The double zipper compartment really fits a good portion of makeup products. The only downside is that the lining on the inside gets stained very easily and needs to be washed. Also I wish the material was a little bit stiffer so that bag didn&#x27;t get squished as easily.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for a gift, but it didn&#x27;t arrive in time.  I didn&#x27;t need another one, but like it and will keep it for myself.</li>
            <li> I like it,accommodates all my cosmetic products,it&#x27;s portable too</li>
            <li> This is a nice bag, it much more room than I thought it would have.</li>
            <li> I love love love this bag!! I am a cheerleader and it has plenty of room for all of my bows and makeup for when I go to a game! Plus, the print is super cute &#x3D;] it is made of very durable material and it is the perfect size to go in my cheer duffel bag. The only bad thing is it took forever to get to me from the seller!</li>
            <li> Not as large,  as the picture betray it to be, and it&#x27;s too flimsy, and all my make up stuff keeps falling out.</li>
            <li> super cute and size appropriate to throw into your purse whether for makeup or just random things</li>
            <li> I love this make up bag. I love how there&#x27;s two different compartments and the top has the brush holders. I will be buying more. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I Cant get past the terrible smell of chemicals.  Yuck!</li>
            <li> Quite a lot smaller than expected but works great.</li>
            <li> worked perfect for my trip.</li>
            <li> It is really convenient. It also comes with a little mirror.</li>
            <li> This is way smaller then what i expected</li>
            <li> I love my new makeup bag! It fits everything perfectly - I put my extras and &amp;#34;going out&amp;#34; makeup in the bottom compartment. The top compartment is my every day makeup. There is a small mirror for emergencies as well as slots to keep my brushes in so they aren&#x27;t crushed. The only dislike I have was all the loose threads I had to cut off when I first received, and the bag was a bit dirty despite being in clear plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the size of two cosmetics bags stacked. Has a little mirror attached and space for brushes! Perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> Perfect to carry small, necessary item un the car.</li>
            <li> I ust this daily!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly roomy. We will see how it holds up, but upon first impression, it appears the quality is good. Should last at least a while. I like it.</li>
            <li> The picture looks bigger than the actual picture.</li>
            <li> The bag is exactly as pictured and described - came packaged well, in great shape, and in wonderful condition. The materials are very durable and zipper works easily</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love it, use mine every day.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> It came very handy in my trip months ago. Besides I liked the style, with good  capacity. I&#x27;ve said it all</li>
            <li> Looks so much bigger online. If u love makeup and have a lot ,this is way 2 small ! I&#x27;d say this is good for younger girls just getting into makeup, or MAYBE a travel bag with limited makeup products.</li>
            <li> Adorable and does the job. Not the highest quality but can&#x27;t complain because it was a low price.</li>
            <li> my daughter loved this as her gift!!!!1</li>
            <li> Is so cute I love it so much 😍😍</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made!!  It is made out of thin material that frays very easily.  The zipper does not work properly as it gets stuck frequently.  I would not buy again!!</li>
            <li> Too small...  Picture of items makes it seems big.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and not worth your money.  I just got the product and I am waiting to get the permission to return it back.  Are you kidding me?  They do not stand for their product.  Don&#x27;t waste you $5 dollars on this cramp.  I better be able to return this product or else.</li>
            <li> Got this little makeup bag for my travels and it is great.  Specifically was looking for one that secured my makeup brushes and this one does.  Love having the two separate compartments for base, powder in one and eye shadow and pencils, mascara, etc.. in the upper compartment.  It is cute, great price and size.</li>
            <li> I express disappointment with this purchase because it is far too diminutive in size and more or less rendered useless for the purpose of storing and carrying around basic cosmetics .</li>
            <li> yay! although this took a while to come in, it actually came in sooner than expected--(not sure why the original ship date was about a month+ after I placed the order.)  It&#x27;s a bit smaller than I imagined, but all in all, it&#x27;s very reasonable for the price! So happy this finally came in! Love!</li>
            <li> This is my most preferred bag when I had to go somewhere and bring my makeup with me. Very spacious and I can put all of my stuffs in here.</li>
            <li> Holds all my supplies for my pedicures</li>
            <li> Awesome cosmetic bag.  Has plenty of room for daily makeup needs that are used.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this Layer Cosmetic Bag, matches two other pieces I own like I almost purchased them as a set. This bag has two zipper compartments, makes it convenient to keep items separated. Bonamart Double layer cosmetic bag does a wonderful job for my needs. I really do like to two zipper compartments, I can go to a section and get exactly what I am looking for. The bag size is  7.48 x 4.65 x 5.31&amp;quot;, so it is not too big, yet not to small. I  hope this Double layer cosmetic bag lasts me a long time. Fits me for my needs, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> The bag is awesome! My only issue is the brushes fall out every time I open the bag.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I thought it was smaller than what I wanted, but all of my makeup fit inside with room to spare!! Going to order more for my daughters!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  OK. It definitely looks bigger and better in the pictures than the real thing, but honestly for the price it&#x27;s &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34;. It&#x27;ll do as a little makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than expected, but then again, I have a lot of makeup and everything fits in it except for a few of my brushes, which is okay because I don&#x27;t use all of them every day.  Im thinking about ordering another one just to have on hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! A bit smaller than expected, but yah, for the price! I love it, tho it had a funny smell... Kinda like cigarettes??!! But buy!! slow shipping  tho...</li>
            <li> i liked this product it is easy to use and efficient for makeup purposes and other purposes as well i love this product</li>
            <li> Nice size but is scrunched.</li>
            <li> I love this bag it is small, stylish and durable.&lt;br /&gt;the  only problem is, the zipper gets really stuck and im afriad of the bag ripping&lt;br /&gt;overall  great product</li>
            <li> Super cute and spacious.</li>
            <li> From all the reviews, I was expecting it to be tiny, but it&#x27;s a pretty decent size.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be bigger but is still ok</li>
            <li> Smaller then expected but I still love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip to organize my makeup. It was the perfect size and I have even been using it on my countertop in my bathroom since I&#x27;ve arrived home from the trip. The two compartments are nice. I was even able to fit long makeup brushes in the bag. At home, I have been using the bottom section for makeup not used everyday and the top zipper for everyday makeup. It has a few holder&#x27;s in the top section for small brushes (also holds mascara in the holder&#x27;s). It is bigger tha I thought, which was perfect for me. It fit nicely in my suitcase because the sides are not stiff so it can collapse down some in areas that aren&#x27;t stuffed.</li>
            <li> There is enough room for my make up and jewelry. Great for traveling and everything fits inside of it that I need.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I thought, but it is like super super cute. I do not own too much makeup, so the bag is just perfect. It has a little cute mirror inside it as well.</li>
            <li> My mom really likes this.</li>
            <li> Size and picture is right. Except it comes with a different mirror. Overall I like it. Holds a decent amount of makeup.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my makeup, it looked small when I open it but it actually fits a lot of stuff. it usually take a month to come but mines came like a week early</li>
            <li> Love it! Carries all of my makeup necessities. Top compartment includes a small attached mirror. The top lid includes loops to hold makeup brushes. The material and zippers are sturdy. Easy to clean interior with damp paper towel. It took a few weeks to receive. So glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> My Sister crayon box is bigger than this not wort it</li>
            <li> I like the bag but it has flimsy sides and doesn&#x27;t stand up without support inside.  Product arrived flat and I had to fill it to make it stand up.</li>
            <li> A GREAT product for the price!</li>
            <li> Poor, Poor it was stated new in the description but clearly it wasn&#x27;t it smelled of perfume and was stained with something sticky. I will not buy from you again.</li>
            <li> Too small for my needs. Gave it to my daughters.</li>
            <li> Finally found a makeup bag in which all of my makeup can fit into! it has cute little spaces for brushes and pencils, along with a mirror and it is very roomy! very happy with my purchase and happy with the price! definitely recommend 👌👍😄</li>
            <li> The Shipping was real fast, good quality and it looks just like the picture, good enough to put makeup in when I travel, it even has a little mirror and brush holder, for the price it is very nice</li>
            <li> Wish it had been bigger than it actually was. It was cute though.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the product more than the actual product. I do like having two separate compartments and a spot for brushes/liners. I do not like that the sides are not rigid, so it never stands up like the ones pictured. It just isn&#x27;t as practical as I was thinking it would be. Looking for a new style travel cosmetic case. Plus, it took forever to arrive due to international shipping.</li>
            <li> The bag is very spacious. I use the bag for all my nail supplies such as my nail polishes, remover, cotton balls, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adorable on the outside but very small. When I opened it out of the package it had an awful chemical smell and I had to stick it on the porch for a couple of days to air out. It still has a smell but its tolerable. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and would warn anyone with allergies or asthma to be careful. I can get the same thing at a large local retailer for almost the same price.</li>
            <li> Good case for some makeup. Wasn&#x27;t as big as I thought it would be. And one of the zippers came broken off. Overall a good buy for the price though.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bag that would hold my everyday makeup and then some extra things so I wouldn&#x27;t have to brink 3 bags of makeup when I was traveling. This is great because it fits a lot and has a mirror and brush holder.</li>
            <li> a little smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> Good quality but alot smaller in person but it got the job done none he less. The compartments are deep and its very easy to travel with. All in all good price and quality.</li>
            <li> It is very small, not at all what I expected. I can only fit a few things but I guess I will have to work with it.</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I thought it would be.  I do use it for some things and it does come in handy at times.  Would not do over if given the chance.</li>
            <li> I bought this as cute little case to use as a secondary case to put on the plane. Works great and I love it. It is a double layer case and I can even fit my longest brushes in it. I have a large caboodle case now and this little case fit all the makeup I wanted to bring plus had some extra room to bring more home.</li>
            <li> Not as big as it looks.</li>
            <li> I paid only a few dollars so I&#x27;m fine with this which was the perfect size for what I wanted it for, however, the interior lining is so thin you can see into the sewing and construction of the bag. Not the best quality for sure, but it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> It holds more than I&#x27;d expected. I put makeup I use often in the top section, and stuff I use less frequently in the bottom. It holds all the brushes I need. It sits on my dressing table for daily use, and when I travel, I simply toss it into my suitcase instead of repacking my makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also terrified that the thing is covered in lead residue. Arrived in a Chinese Post bag; no surprise as I forgot I even order it as it took so long. I don&#x27;t see anywhere in the product description stating it is mailed direct from China. I would like to know, so that I can make a decision not to purchase things direct from China. I know lots and lots of things are from China, and I shamefully buy my fair share, but I prefer the items already be off-gassed before arriving at my home...seriously. I had to put it in the guest room and open window with fan going. I&#x27;m seriously considering throwing it away, because I have a toddler and she gets into everything. I know she&#x27;ll be drawn to this and I don&#x27;t want her touching it and subsequently putting hands in her mouth,eyes,etc... Other than the potential health hazzard, it&#x27;s pretty cute,  and for my limited make-up stash it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t choose I love it because it is still cheaply make but that was expected.  I paid a small price and knew it would be a small ittem that wasn&#x27;t super high quality but it fills its purpose</li>
            <li> Very cute! Will work perfect for vacations and keeping everything together. Looking forward to using it this next vacation trip</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really really smaller than I thought, I like it, I&#x27;m gonna use it for my locker so it&#x27;s a good size</li>
            <li> This bag is very cute. But if you have a lot of makeup this is not for you. It&#x27;s perfect if you want to travel and only have a few items. There is a place for your brushes separate from everything else, which I like. Just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I think this product is very cute, and chic. Only problem is that its smaller than the picture size so if you have a lot of makeup don&#x27;t buy it !</li>
            <li> Seems durable, and I have put my most often used make-up in this case. I&#x27;m thinking it would be good for traveling; it would fit in a large suitcase if you don&#x27;t over pack the case with items. I like the two separate containers, and also that it can compress. It sits beautifully in my bathroom cabinet - I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I didnot recieve my item</li>
            <li> Just got this today. Pretty much what i expected. ItIt&#x27;s definitely a super cute bag and big enough to fit a great deal of make up, only issue I have is that the thread in the zipper is coming out. Nothing too serious but..?</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. It isn&#x27;t the best built make-up bag around. Mine is already starting to rip on the inside after owning it for a couple months.</li>
            <li> small, cute, holds basic makeup, so I don&#x27;t pack extra things I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> It was I little smaller than I expected. However I am really enjoying the bag. I took it on a travel trip and it worked out very well! Excellent for taking small make-up items and not your whole make up draw!</li>
            <li> This was exactly the size I was looking for. I was using an old shaving bag my husband had after my mom stole my favorite one from me lol I gave it to her .. she didnt actually STEAL it... Much roomier than I expected. It holds all of the makeup I usually wear in the top section and all of the extra stuff I dont use all of the time in the bottom. Very cute and durable. Love it!</li>
            <li> It adapts to the size of whatever you have in it so it&#x27;s perfect and I liked it. Lots of room but not to big. The only thing is that the circles on the top half aren&#x27;t perfect circles they look drawn out ovals? Idk but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Satisfied! It will work well for storage of the items that I need to store in it. Easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what was described. However, there is a distinct smell of cigarette smoke. I&#x27;m going to try to spray it with Febreeze and hope it smells better.</li>
            <li> It took like two months to get to me. Not really worth the wait</li>
            <li> I really needed a cheap makeup bag because I did not want to spend a lot of money, that&#x27;s all. I thought this was cute, it was cheap and affordable. It has 2 compartments, top and bottom. Its a bit small but it can stretch out.</li>
            <li> It is ok...but I had expected the zipper to not get broken after one time using it</li>
            <li> Smaller than i thought but i dont have that much make up anyways so it worked great for me (:</li>
            <li> Perfect size bag with two roomy compartments. I recently started doing home LED gel nails. I keep my polishes and primers in a polish case, but I needed a small bag to keep my new gel manicure tools tidy. The [[ASIN:B00B2CFH44 NEW Kiss Pro LED Gel lamp (Just Lamp) Professional Gel Polish (sold seperately)]] fits perfectly in the bottom, and my files, glitters, pots, etc., up top. Just right size, wish I bought two!</li>
            <li> I like the functionality of this and the two different pouches.  I did think it was about 2 inches too small.  Some things I needed to fit into it for travel couldn&#x27;t go because of the length.  But it&#x27;s otherwise really good for the price.</li>
            <li> good deal for the price</li>
            <li> This bag is not to big and not too small.  Having two compartments helps you to organize better.  This company is from China, which I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered, but I received it faster than some things I ordered in the U.S.</li>
            <li> It is a good travel bag. You will stay very very organized with this bag, and cute.This bag also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> nice small container to store my toiletries in :)</li>
            <li> Its a bit small, but fits everything i need in the, its perfect to keep on top of your vanity table and great to travel with it.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived on time and I love it! It&#x27;s way better than I expected. Great quality, great price!</li>
            <li> I did not liked because is soft</li>
            <li> This little make up bag is amazing!!!!!! It&#x27;s small but a lot fits.&lt;br /&gt;It has two compartments and trust me it has more space than expected.</li>
            <li> The shipping time is horrible. By the time I receive this I had already purchased another one. it is also not as large as pictured and can hold very small Cosmetic items.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and poorly made. I&#x27;ll give it to my niece to carry her little toys</li>
            <li> Nice I like, more than I expected. Great item, I te I recommend any body to buy it. Great buy</li>
            <li> Its smaller than I thought but not a big deal. Great size for traveling. I got the black with white polka dots and it is so cute!</li>
            <li> I recommend, Very NICE</li>
            <li> This is a cheaply made dollar store bag from China. I expect that it will be good for a half dozen uses at most. It cost more to ship from China than the value of the materials. Stop buying items that will fill our landfills. Amazon, quit listing them. I no longer trust the reviews here either. Check out where your products are being manufactured. If it says China, be suspicious.</li>
            <li> I like the bag, although it looked larger on line.  Smaller than I thought, wish it was a little larger.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought. It&#x27;s a good bag and holds a good amount of products. The shipping was super fast as well!</li>
            <li> fits all my make up perfectly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little traveling bag! Not good if you have a lot of makeup though and it doesn&#x27;t fit the bulkier products. Definitely great for the price though!</li>
            <li> So cute!  I love the 2 compartments.  Wish it was a little more sturdy</li>
            <li> It was just what I was looking for. It has a place to hold brushes,etc. I can fit everything I need in it.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for really. Happy with this purchase but expected a little better. Came early tho!</li>
            <li> I am able to put a lot in it. ( which I like ) I like the design and it came pretty quickly for me. I am glad I got this item!! (:</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed to suit my traveling needs.</li>
            <li> This bag is so cute for just a makeup bag for on the go! I got it for my little cousin and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the measurements, it&#x27;s alot smaller than I anticipated.  However, it works, I have some of my cosmetics in this bag, not all.</li>
            <li> Great bag! Its the perfect size to carry the makeup essentials for vacation or a weekend away :) its a silky thick material and can be compressed down when not in use to fit in a drawer or anywhere. Zippers are great quality and so is the stitching:) two zippers on each section just like the picture. The handle is very sturdy and I couldn&#x27;t see it ever breaking. The mirror comes attached and its a great mirror (not distorted). Holds a lot of makeup and some eye shadow quads but Probly not larger palettes:/ the slots for the brushes are perfect sizes for my everyday brushes but my giant powder brush is a tiny bit too tall. I love this makeup bag and look forward to using it when I go on vacay in July ^_^ also shipping was SUPER FAST!! It said it would be here May 20th - June 8th and it arrived around May 15th!! I definitely recommend this!!! ★★★★★</li>
            <li> This little makeup bag is just too cute! It has 2 zippered storage areas for keeping things separate; I keep my brushes separate from the makeup itself. It is a soft plastic polka-dotted design and has a handle. It folds flat for storage.</li>
            <li> The picture makes this product look big, but I was disappointed when it arrived. It&#x27;s barely big enough to hold even a third of my cosmetics, and I don&#x27;t have that many. I will use it, but I have to have 2 more bags to hold the rest of my cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I thought it was small when I got it in but I was wrong I have a lot of makeup in both compartments.  I would definitely recumbent this bag</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this bag.  It is so very small.  Had I known it was so small I would never have bought it.</li>
            <li> Everything was as promised.</li>
            <li> Perfect for when I just need to pack my daily makeup for a weekend at a friends house :) fabric is fine</li>
            <li> I like it but its kinda small.</li>
            <li> This bad is awesome. I thought it was going to be a bit bigger but it isn&#x27;t. Its still fits all my makeup and my hair stuff (aka, clips, bows, flowers, Bobby pins, ponytail, etc.) And it fits my body spray from bath and body works and my deoterent and my classes case and my stay in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great buy !!! Perfect to put gifts inside. And then give a little extra case in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Very cute bigger than expected because the reviews said small with z cute mirror inside the bag awesome for little girl teens or travel bag!!</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> Great price and perfect to store makeup.  I love this because I can tote my makeup wherever I go in a neatly organized bag.  It isn&#x27;t huge, so my makeup doesn&#x27;t get lost, but it still fits quite a bit of makeup inside.  It has brush and pencil storage space as well as a little mirror that I don&#x27;t really use.  It&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> The makeup bag was a little smaller than expected. But it is in perfect condition and I love it!</li>
            <li> This case is small...couldn&#x27;t use for my makeup but will hold on to it for other things.</li>
            <li> It was okay. But I didn&#x27;t like the color</li>
            <li> This is a great bag to store all your make up needs in! I have a spot for everything, and it&#x27;s very nice. It is made of fabric, so it doesn&#x27;t stand up on it&#x27;s own like it does in the picture, which kinda bums me out, because all my stuff moves around way easier than if it was a solid bag, but that&#x27;s not a biggie. It also stains incredibly easy, and I&#x27;m not sure how to get them out. It&#x27;s a good bag otherwise, and I recommend it to anyone! Would be nice if there were more color/pattern options though</li>
            <li> Use it at the gym daily. Holds everything I need and separate pockets are great for organization.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be bigger than what was shipped; however the size doesn&#x27;t really bother me. Perfect for stock stuffer, mini gift bags, etc.</li>
            <li> Good for travel or everyday use, got it for my sister to hold her first makeup set. If you give it to a toddler or use it like a toddler it&#x27;s going to rip, sure, but if you handle it with care, it will do just what it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife to put most of her makeup in. she goes back and forth from our house and her moms and this bag was great for keeping track of things.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something small due to other reviewers, but it was really small when it came! That&#x27;s okay though, it fits a lot. I can fit a face cleaning brush, a bar of soap and the case for the soap, a small tube of sunscreen, and many small products of eyeshadow+an eyelash curler+makeup brushes+foundation in this bag. It&#x27;s very durable and a little shiny, and it&#x27;s very cute. Also you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Cute and compact.  Holds all that I need.</li>
            <li> This case is adorableeeeee.. the only complaint i really have is that in the top compartment the brush holders don&#x27;t hold any of my brushes....they just fall out when i open it... Those are good for thicker lipsticks tho! Doesn&#x27;t fall out as easily at least...</li>
            <li> I love it! It fits all of my makeup and its also very handy for travel. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> SUPER SMALL and smells like a rat died in it it broke within min of me opening it i unzipped it and the zipper itself broke</li>
            <li> A little bit smaller than I thought but I like it</li>
            <li> I really like the set. My make-up and odds and ends fits perfect.</li>
            <li> nice but a lot smaller than expected</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s is perfect for travel it comes with an attached mirror I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have a lot of make up it does have pockets inside for brushes and the bottom part is perfect for blush or bronze containers.</li>
            <li> This bag was a little smaller than I had hoped it would be but was a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be bigger, but still okay size. The zippers on it are cheap. Nothing special but not horrible product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup tote. It is well made and the perfect size. The two different top and bottom compartments make it exactly what I needed to keep things separated.</li>
            <li> This is a great bag to take anywhere! I love it when I&#x27;m traveling or even just at home. It holds all of my makeup and sits upright on my bathroom counter which makes getting ready in the mornings quick and easy! I don&#x27;t have to switch makeup bags when I travel! This bag is&lt;br /&gt;very well made an i recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stylish and very well made. Would highly recommend to any</li>
            <li> I love it lots of room for all my makeup</li>
            <li> I like it but before ordering check the measurements because i expected to be huge in size! but its very small!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable bag for the money.  Easily worth $20, a steal at $5.  Shipping takes a little while, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Too small, I should have read the fine prints</li>
            <li> love how small it is when not in use and how large it becomes when you put your all of your make up in it&lt;br /&gt;there is also enough compartments init to keep things neat and separated from each other  to foundation eyes shadow&lt;br /&gt;ans even your brushes well fit in it&lt;br /&gt;i bought this for my use for i needed one</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS. Perfect for vacations or for whenever. Adorable. Love the material. Perfect size.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a small gift with some goodies inside, it was a big hit!!! Great deal...thank you very much!</li>
            <li> This bag is really cute and has plenty of storage space.  I love the multi-level design.  It&#x27;s great for organization.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this is a mini cosmetic bag.I&#x27;ve seen people complain about the size (though I&#x27;m pretty sure it mentions the sizing) and are let down when they order it.I actually love that it&#x27;s not big.Don&#x27;t be fooled by the sizing though.All of my makeup fits inside and I have a lot of makeup!!!It&#x27;s perfect for traveling too and fits in my purse and/or backpack.I love this bag so much.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasnt packed so tight, it took a while to stretch it out but we love it&lt;br /&gt;bought it at $3 shipped so can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the middle of a polka dot obsession, so I had to get this bag.  It is so cute, has two compartments.  Very useful, the price is so good!</li>
            <li> I love love love LOVE this bag! In the top I can keep all my eyeliner, Foundation, eyebrow pencils, blush, mascara, lipstick, powder, and travel mirror. Then in the bottom, I have brush sets and eyeshadow sets and spare eyeliner and mascara. It holds everything I have, and is still so cute and portable!! Perfectly organized, perfectly sized, and it seems very strong. I love this little bag, so worth the wait!!</li>
            <li> Definitely serves it&#x27;s purpose...small enough to throw in an overnight bag...big enough to fit all my makeup</li>
            <li> very small  but kid doesnt mind</li>
            <li> Great item smaller tha expected</li>
            <li> Took two weeks to get, direct from China. Very small and plastic.</li>
            <li> The top of this was a bit smaller than I had expected but it holds my makeup well.</li>
            <li> i tougth is was going to be bigger but is a cute little bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wont be able to use it what i bought it for but  i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll use for&lt;br /&gt;Something else nice bag</li>
            <li> Very cute &amp; quite roomie.  Perfect for my teen daughter. Came in the mail about 6 weeks after ordering it.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Cheap and very small.</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I expected but was perfect for what I needed. I just wanted something I could put my daily makeup in to keep on my desk or take on the go.</li>
            <li> Very cute bag but I expected it to be much bigger.</li>
            <li> I put my makeup in the top part and all my travel supplies in the bottom. It&#x27;s easy to clean and has a bit of stretch to it when cramming things in it.</li>
            <li> I love how spacious this bag is while still compact. I can put in almost all my necessary makeup items in it but can still manage to put it inside my bag. It&#x27;s very well-designed and well-built! It&#x27;s very affordable as well.</li>
            <li> Pretty small but it works</li>
            <li> qucik ship&lt;br /&gt;the designer of it is good&lt;br /&gt;But, a little bit different than the picture described&lt;br /&gt;it is good for girls</li>
            <li> I bought 5 of these bags from different sellers to get different colors as part of bridesmaids gifts. This one I received quickly and the quality was better than I expected. But it is smaller than the others and smaller than described. It is only 7&amp;#34;x3&amp;#34;x/4&amp;#34;. Overall I still like the bag and for the price I still think it is worth it Also, the one I received has the slots or the brushes in the base of the top section, which is probably a good thing... so the weight of the brushes does not flip it over!.</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I expected as others have stated, but generally I do not have much makeup and it fits everything I have adequately. Good quality, and would definitely recommend. The construction is sturdy, however if it is not full of makeup it does kind of collapse in on itself. This is not really problematic for me.</li>
            <li> I love it, cleared up so much space in my bathroom. Holds my huge collection of make up, surprisingly. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Only lasted a month or so.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than expected but it was actually a good size for me! I can fit all my makeup in there! I would get this bag if you&#x27;re looking for a bag that&#x27;s not too big or small.</li>
            <li> Perfect little bag. I carry some of my nail supplies in here. You can fit quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these cases and I love them. They are very cute and great for storing things other than make up!  I was able to fit all my nail polish and accessories in one, and most of my makeup in the other. Only issue I had was one of the cases had a broken mirror, but no biggie. I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to us and has alot of room in.I like the decided compartments and the nice handle on it.</li>
            <li> Although the bag took a long time to get here, it was still a great bag for the money! When it first arrived in the package,it looked tiny, but it can hold a surprising amount of stuff inside!</li>
            <li> I really like this bag. I use it for my makeup and it&#x27;s held up nicely. It kinda feels cheap though and took like 6 weeks to receive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than i thought but i do like it still! The only thing i dont like is when you open the bottom compartment you need the top to be closed otherwise everything falls out</li>
            <li> I only have the basics: foundation, b lush, eye liner, mascara and a loose powder. This fits those things, and I could really double what I&#x27;ve got in there. It looks tiny but even if you have 2 of each of those items, this is great!!!</li>
            <li> The makeup bag is beautiful! No holes, all color, and the zippers work! I love it, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality makeup bag!</li>
            <li> I like this cosmetic bag.  I put it in my baby girl&#x27;s diaper bag for her items when I go out.  I use the top part of the cosmetic bag to put her brush, sunglasses, and bows.  On the bottom I put her thermometer and mini first aid kit.</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever I forgot I had ordered the thing. Way to small for my make-up needs, lesson learned. You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I received this product. It is MUCHA smaller than the picture and the material feels cheap. I don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> I love this bag! I carry my make up here and great for travel! This bag goes everywhere with me! (I love makeup)</li>
            <li> Too small for a primary / home cosmetic bag.  Need to close one compartment before accessing the other.  Nice bag possibly for an alternate purpose</li>
            <li> I think it worth the money, it was smaller than i expected but for the cost im happy it holds all my small make up as you can see in the picture</li>
            <li> Finally! My girlfriend can keep her makeup organized and our dresser mirror doesn&#x27;t look like a hairstylist&#x27;s station anymore! Works well and keeps her stuff out of sight.</li>
            <li> worked and looked great</li>
            <li> This cosmetic bag came just as advertised and works perfectly for my make up needs!</li>
            <li> I loved this! Great size.</li>
            <li> Love this everything fit inside more than what I expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good makeup bag. There&#x27;s plenty of space in the top and the bottom for all of my makeup; I also like that I can put all of my foundation/base cosmetics in one compartment and have all of my lip and eye stuff in the other. The top compartment also has a little mirror in it, which I took out. It&#x27;s hard to look into it while you are applying anything, as it is on a tether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change is that there is not much support in the sides; the material is very collapsible, so when I have heavy makeup in the top compartment, the bag leans this way or that and will not support itself in an upright position, causing the makeup compacts to spill out. I would have to stuff the bottom compartment completely with tissue to achieve that kind of support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, reinforced sides would be better.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> A little flimsier than expected but it&#x27;s spacious.</li>
            <li> Not as big as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> I love this little pouch. It holds all my makeup in these really nice compartments.</li>
            <li> Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I was expecting it to be bigger. But as a travel bag it perfect.</li>
            <li> I really hoped that the case was bigger by detailing the specifications and definitive but really I am not satisfied</li>
            <li> This plastic make-up bag would get a negative star if it was possible.  This is a cheap made bag, the threads were hanging out where it was sewed together with plastic. It looked like something a 7 year old would sew!  Not as good as a deal as I thought!!</li>
            <li> This bag was a little smaller than I had expected but it is really sturdy and can hold all of an average persons makeup. I am a makeup fanatic and recommend that if you are to you look for a bigger bag or buy two (what I did).</li>
            <li> It looks a little to cheap and small</li>
            <li> Way smaller than expected and it looks really cheap</li>
            <li> This item it perfect for keeping things separate like make-u[ brushes and make-up or nail stuff.  It is the right size, not too big or small. It easily collapses to fit where you need it to go.</li>
            <li> Loved this bag! Delivered quickly as well! Price is awesome !! Everything fits !</li>
            <li> This came a a lot smaller then I expected it to be. I also didn&#x27;t read the size so it&#x27;s most likely my fault.</li>
            <li> I like it not as durable As I thought but good</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> honestly its really cheap quality and just stays smushed down, not like pictured at all. i definitely regret my purchase.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work like the picture at all there is no shape and everything falls out don&#x27;t get this</li>
            <li> Cute and stylish good quality.</li>
            <li> Very nice bag. Two compartments that are large.</li>
            <li> Really cute. Well worth the purchase. Rated 4/5 because shipping took a little while 2-3 weeks</li>
