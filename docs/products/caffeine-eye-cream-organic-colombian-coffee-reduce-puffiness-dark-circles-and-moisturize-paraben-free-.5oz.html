            <li>so great for my eyes smells great.</li>
            <li>and I love this eye cream!!  </li>
            <li>The caffeine eye cream is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products online claiming to be the best, with no results at all.</li>
            <li>you are under 35 and party a lot, or have oily skin, I think this is a good choice for you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good concept, but this product is way to sticky and greasy to wear during the day.</li>
            <li>Feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I apply it 2 times a day and hope to continue getting good results.</li>
            <li>Good luck to all that use it.</li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>It smelled good, and made my eyes seem awake.</li>
            <li>Super happy with the product!!</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I love Passport to Organics!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling sensation - but I&#x27;m sure it is still working!</li>
            <li>Will continue to use their products for sure!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Just wish there was more of it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The cream had a nice feel to it, but it made my eyes water.</li>
            <li>The caffeine cream is so effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, try at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I especially love the pump as you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is somewhat effective for reducing puffiness around the eyes and I may purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for helping me look great!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and am happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li>Now, I decided to give a try to this new caffeine eye cream, and let me tell you, it&#x27;s honestly the best one I have ever had.</li>
            <li>I may have to order another one for her huge eye bags. :P</li>
            <li>It also has a nice refreshing smell.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it smells good, and it works.</li>
            <li>: Very light coffee smell which goes away in about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to dab most of it off.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many eye creams &amp; nothing has given visible results until now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a permanent product for me:)</li>
            <li>It also stings my eyes even though I make sure not to get any in my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many, many eye creams over the years</li>
            <li>It feels really refreshing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can purchase it through Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the product, however I took away one star for the packaging.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great to deal with a company that has high quality products at an affordable price!  </li>
            <li>I think it gives more moisture on my eyes.</li>
            <li>Yea the product is okay- definetely not a miracle in a bottle-</li>
            <li>Also, I put the cream in the refrigerator to harden so that it pumps better as the consistency is more liquid, so</li>
            <li>It does not sit on top the skin like many eye creams do.</li>
            <li>My wife wanted this for christmas and she has enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I woke up with zero puffiness and looked much better on my travels in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>I was able to test this product</li>
            <li>I love passport to organics.</li>
            <li>My eyes look more awake and the skin around my eyes feels tighter.  </li>
            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>and hopefully this is better.</li>
            <li>mostly pissed me off</li>
            <li>but in the morning, my eyes look pretty good from 8 hours of sleep anyway.  </li>
            <li>The smell is quite nice, not too strong but you get the sense that the caffeine is really there and effective.  </li>
            <li>I still use the cream just because I paid for it and it is a good moisturizer, but it certainly did not help my situation.</li>
            <li>I would of liked to think this would work right away-it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>and I received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>But as it was stated is gets leaky very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but the smell dissipates very quickly (if you even notice it at all).  </li>
            <li>but not that strong.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product that does what it is supposed to do--dimishes the appearance of puffiness under the eyes by the action of caffiene--a natural ingredient used in many cellulite products.</li>
            <li>At first, this product was amazing and works.  </li>
            <li>Smell is a bit interesting but not bad.</li>
            <li>The texture is also smooth and it goes on easy.</li>
            <li>and I love that this cream absorbs quickly with no greasy or tacky feeling</li>
            <li>This is completely accurate and the amount that comes out is equivalent to what I would use for face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Great cream, it actually works!  </li>
            <li>I actually look awake all day and it is a great mosturizer as well.</li>
            <li>hi, im not the type of person who enjoy writing reviews..</li>
            <li>this eye cream is rather watery light.</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>and they sent me a free one.</li>
            <li>Thank you passport to organics for making such good and fabulous products!</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s making my skin look good.</li>
            <li>I love to use it right before I put my makeup to give me an awake look for the day.</li>
            <li>The cream is easy to apply and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s always way more cream than I can use, very wasteful!</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that this product uses natural, organic ingredients and is paraben free!</li>
            <li>I have to keep using it for certain effects, however, for now,, it&#x27;s just a okay item.</li>
            <li>Well, I first ordered this item having very, very high expectations, but to be honest, I can not tell if the product is even working or not.</li>
            <li>It also broke out my skin and turned my eyes bright red.  </li>
            <li>More than once it has come out so fast that it ended up on my bathroom wall.</li>
            <li>I am a full time student</li>
            <li>You can definitely feel good about the ingredients.</li>
            <li>This product helps tremendously reduce the discoloration.</li>
            <li>I like the way it quickly absorbs.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and feels moisturized for hours.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely live the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li>I did have to put tension on the pump so that too much cream did not \\&quot;shoot\\&quot; out, but that was easy to figure out.  </li>
            <li>I felt towards the end of the bottle that the effects were not quite as strong, but that was at the very end.  </li>
            <li>In this case, it&#x27;s the first!</li>
            <li>When I apply it, I definitely look more awake!</li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly and does help reduce the darkness and certainly the puffiness.</li>
            <li>This is the second product I&#x27;ve tried from Passport to Organics and with my 2nd purchase, I am even more convinced that the products are a WONDERFUL value - especially with the organic/natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have read that only products that contain caffeine are effective</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have any new breakouts since then, amazing product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I did have some issues getting the right amount to pump; so, I hold the bottle at an angle then pump.  </li>
            <li>and I notice a difference in my appearance right when I use it.</li>
            <li>I am the type of person who spends a lot on skin care products, I had tried everything under the sun from cheap pharmacy products to high end ones.</li>
            <li>I recently placed my second order and it is a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it at night, but most definitely I don&#x27;t recommend it for under make up, unless you want your eye make up to slide right off:/  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping: Super fast, thanks!</li>
            <li>I applied this cream in the morning after a good night&#x27;s sleep, and the dark circles and puffiness went away fast.  </li>
            <li>It might work better with a moisture cream mixed in.  </li>
            <li>I do hope you get the same results or better.</li>
            <li>but I think I need to write a review for future buyers:)  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I really like this eye cream!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, helps with my puffiness and visibly reduces lines almost instantly.</li>
            <li>Too much product comes out each time but with practice, you can get just the right amount of product out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies if you put your finger gently over the nozzle (like instructed) while pumping, just the right amount comes out.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try a bunch of their other products, they look amazing.</li>
            <li>as many of you may know edema or swelling is caused by the lack of proper drainage or too much blood flow to an area.</li>
            <li>As soon as I started using it, my dark circles looked liked they are fading</li>
            <li>It was a pure liquid (like milk)</li>
            <li>I am about to try 100% Pure Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast, I&#x27;ve had it on for about four hours now and have a mild burning and tearing sensation, so I might be sensitive to one of the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And definitely seems to help minimize the appearance of fine lines under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I used a dab, but it went on very greasy &#x3D;&#x3D;</li>
            <li>Pump administers too much at a time and is wasteful.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I really like the bottle as well.    </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have been using this 2x a day for about a week now and really like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use as much under eye concealer.</li>
            <li>I tossed it out after two weeks of really trying to give it a chance.</li>
            <li>It really does seem to reduce puffiness under the eye.  </li>
            <li>It disepenses way way way too much product and there is no way of getting around it.</li>
            <li>Nothing really.  </li>
            <li>so my whole face can benefit from this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I have never had any that really worked until this.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the mornings and sometimes during mid-day if I really need it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really does work</li>
            <li>The free one was very different.  </li>
            <li>Works for me and you do not have to use too much for it to work.  </li>
            <li>Caffein supposedly will constrict the smooth muscle in the arterioles (reduces in-flow) and allows enough time for the fluids to be drained by the lymphatics or venous circulation.</li>
            <li>, I did not notice a real difference when I used it as directed for 3 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not noticed any changes to the dark circles under my eyes, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s a genetic thing that no eye cream would resolve.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells) when I first apply it</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other product (rollers, creams, etc.)</li>
            <li>I had used khiel eyecream for few years and pretty satisfied with that item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only going on my second week and the results just keep getting better for me.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly for the ingredients because I wanted an eye cream with hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>so I was particularly hopeful</li>
            <li>This cream really made the skin around my eyes feel soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have skin that can be both very sensitive and dry, (and I sometimes get eczema breakouts on my face or near my eye areas, so I must be very careful about what kind of eye creams I use), but this cream feels completely gentle and deeply moisturizes while still feeling light and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>definitely not thick.  </li>
            <li>I dont doubt it is a new item</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also signs of aging we don&#x27;t have to live with it, there&#x27;s alwsys surgery...</li>
            <li>OH well....on to something new.</li>
            <li>My skin and eyes are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily to reduce dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how much I like it; it&#x27;s literally an eye-opener skin care line!</li>
            <li>I was a little bothered at first, but it is not that strong and the effects obviously outweigh it.  </li>
            <li>Coffee smell is faint and pleasant.</li>
            <li>The bottle is big enough to last for a long period of time, and I love that these products come with a pump, no bacteria gets inside!</li>
            <li>I try to get just a little dot of lotion and a huge squirt</li>
            <li>Also, it appears to hold more product than is actually does, which I found a little deceptive.  </li>
            <li>Just started using this caffeine eye cream and so far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li>Wow..</li>
            <li>And thanks to the ladies that left there reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>It keeps my under-eye area feeling soft and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>I am no longer as young as I was.</li>
            <li>My skin has been clear, soft and firmer with use of this product.</li>
            <li>The packaging of the product is completely dysfunctional, though.  </li>
            <li>It completely cleared my face</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t hide it, do yourself a favor and get natural product that works.</li>
            <li>I have to take the entire top off the bottle and use a small plastic  manicure tool to get the cream out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>cream has a slight coffee odor, which goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>no matter how long it stayed in the fridge or how much I shook it.</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe the reason why the product doesn&#x27;t work for me is because I&#x27;m anemic (which makes me always tired, and no matter how much sleep I get, my lines never go away), and I most likely have hyper/hypo thyroid issues since it runs in my family.</li>
            <li>My situation is mild with a little puffiness and no dark circles, but the cream did not improve anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very conscious of the ingredients in skincare products, and like that Passport to Organics uses all-natural ingredients that are beneficial to skin&#x27;s overall appearance and health.</li>
            <li>Caffeine eye cream does not due as it says.</li>
            <li>i was surprised that there was no individual box nor sealing for item.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like the results I have seen so far, and will post my update after I use a bit longer.  </li>
            <li>try to use natural products whenever possible</li>
            <li>My under eye area looks worse instead of better...</li>
            <li>One day it comes out thick and its fabulous</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd order and I noticed it has a new silver pump which works very nicely especially if I follow the tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In short period of time, two-three weeks of using this eye cream two times a day, my fine lines disappeared, my dark circles, though not completely gone, are visibly smaller and my eyes do not have this tiered look of someone who spends all day in front of the computer.</li>
            <li>I am usually not the type of person to leave reviews unless the product is really good or bad.</li>
            <li>Also didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my eyes other than the skin was moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it if you can spare the extra change.</li>
            <li>It forces too much cream out, too quickly, and there&#x27;s not really any way to get it to come out slowly.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any change in my dark circles really</li>
            <li>When it comes to products like this that are on the more expensive end for a product, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if they are purposely designed poorly to make more money off you.</li>
            <li>I tried their cleansers, lotions, creams, everything is superior quality and it does work, ladies, without all those scary ingredients like other creams and lotions have.</li>
            <li>It does moisturize and reduce dark circles as well, but my main reason for this product is to reduce the puffiness.  </li>
            <li>After a few uses I was pleasantly surprised by the complete effectiveness of this product!  </li>
            <li>, I can not say that this product is good or bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I was very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great eye cream</li>

            <li> and I love this eye cream!!  </li>
            <li> The caffeine eye cream is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products online claiming to be the best, with no results at all.</li>
            <li> you are under 35 and party a lot, or have oily skin, I think this is a good choice for you.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good concept, but this product is way to sticky and greasy to wear during the day.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I apply it 2 times a day and hope to continue getting good results.</li>
            <li> Good luck to all that use it.</li>
            <li> It smells good too.</li>
            <li> It smelled good, and made my eyes seem awake.</li>
            <li> Super happy with the product!!</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I love Passport to Organics!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling sensation - but I&#x27;m sure it is still working!</li>
            <li> Will continue to use their products for sure!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Just wish there was more of it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> The cream had a nice feel to it, but it made my eyes water.</li>
            <li> The caffeine cream is so effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, try at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I especially love the pump as you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is somewhat effective for reducing puffiness around the eyes and I may purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for helping me look great!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and am happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Now, I decided to give a try to this new caffeine eye cream, and let me tell you, it&#x27;s honestly the best one I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I may have to order another one for her huge eye bags. :P</li>
            <li> It also has a nice refreshing smell.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it smells good, and it works.</li>
            <li> : Very light coffee smell which goes away in about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to dab most of it off.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many eye creams &amp; nothing has given visible results until now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a permanent product for me:)</li>
            <li> It also stings my eyes even though I make sure not to get any in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many, many eye creams over the years</li>
            <li> It feels really refreshing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can purchase it through Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the product, however I took away one star for the packaging.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great to deal with a company that has high quality products at an affordable price!  </li>
            <li> I think it gives more moisture on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Yea the product is okay- definetely not a miracle in a bottle-</li>
            <li> Also, I put the cream in the refrigerator to harden so that it pumps better as the consistency is more liquid, so</li>
            <li> It does not sit on top the skin like many eye creams do.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this for christmas and she has enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I woke up with zero puffiness and looked much better on my travels in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> I was able to test this product</li>
            <li> I love passport to organics.</li>
            <li> My eyes look more awake and the skin around my eyes feels tighter.  </li>
            <li> and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> and hopefully this is better.</li>
            <li> mostly pissed me off</li>
            <li> but in the morning, my eyes look pretty good from 8 hours of sleep anyway.  </li>
            <li> The smell is quite nice, not too strong but you get the sense that the caffeine is really there and effective.  </li>
            <li> I still use the cream just because I paid for it and it is a good moisturizer, but it certainly did not help my situation.</li>
            <li> I would of liked to think this would work right away-it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> and I received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> But as it was stated is gets leaky very quickly.  </li>
            <li> but the smell dissipates very quickly (if you even notice it at all).  </li>
            <li> but not that strong.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product that does what it is supposed to do--dimishes the appearance of puffiness under the eyes by the action of caffiene--a natural ingredient used in many cellulite products.</li>
            <li> At first, this product was amazing and works.  </li>
            <li> Smell is a bit interesting but not bad.</li>
            <li> The texture is also smooth and it goes on easy.</li>
            <li> and I love that this cream absorbs quickly with no greasy or tacky feeling</li>
            <li> This is completely accurate and the amount that comes out is equivalent to what I would use for face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Great cream, it actually works!  </li>
            <li> I actually look awake all day and it is a great mosturizer as well.</li>
            <li> hi, im not the type of person who enjoy writing reviews..</li>
            <li> this eye cream is rather watery light.</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> and they sent me a free one.</li>
            <li> Thank you passport to organics for making such good and fabulous products!</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s making my skin look good.</li>
            <li> I love to use it right before I put my makeup to give me an awake look for the day.</li>
            <li> The cream is easy to apply and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s always way more cream than I can use, very wasteful!</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that this product uses natural, organic ingredients and is paraben free!</li>
            <li> I have to keep using it for certain effects, however, for now,, it&#x27;s just a okay item.</li>
            <li> Well, I first ordered this item having very, very high expectations, but to be honest, I can not tell if the product is even working or not.</li>
            <li> It also broke out my skin and turned my eyes bright red.  </li>
            <li> More than once it has come out so fast that it ended up on my bathroom wall.</li>
            <li> I am a full time student</li>
            <li> You can definitely feel good about the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This product helps tremendously reduce the discoloration.</li>
            <li> I like the way it quickly absorbs.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and feels moisturized for hours.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely live the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I did have to put tension on the pump so that too much cream did not \\&quot;shoot\\&quot; out, but that was easy to figure out.  </li>
            <li> I felt towards the end of the bottle that the effects were not quite as strong, but that was at the very end.  </li>
            <li> In this case, it&#x27;s the first!</li>
            <li> When I apply it, I definitely look more awake!</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and does help reduce the darkness and certainly the puffiness.</li>
            <li> This is the second product I&#x27;ve tried from Passport to Organics and with my 2nd purchase, I am even more convinced that the products are a WONDERFUL value - especially with the organic/natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have read that only products that contain caffeine are effective</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have any new breakouts since then, amazing product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I did have some issues getting the right amount to pump; so, I hold the bottle at an angle then pump.  </li>
            <li> and I notice a difference in my appearance right when I use it.</li>
            <li> I am the type of person who spends a lot on skin care products, I had tried everything under the sun from cheap pharmacy products to high end ones.</li>
            <li> I recently placed my second order and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it at night, but most definitely I don&#x27;t recommend it for under make up, unless you want your eye make up to slide right off:/  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping: Super fast, thanks!</li>
            <li> I applied this cream in the morning after a good night&#x27;s sleep, and the dark circles and puffiness went away fast.  </li>
            <li> It might work better with a moisture cream mixed in.  </li>
            <li> I do hope you get the same results or better.</li>
            <li> but I think I need to write a review for future buyers:)  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, helps with my puffiness and visibly reduces lines almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Too much product comes out each time but with practice, you can get just the right amount of product out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies if you put your finger gently over the nozzle (like instructed) while pumping, just the right amount comes out.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try a bunch of their other products, they look amazing.</li>
            <li> as many of you may know edema or swelling is caused by the lack of proper drainage or too much blood flow to an area.</li>
            <li> As soon as I started using it, my dark circles looked liked they are fading</li>
            <li> It was a pure liquid (like milk)</li>
            <li> I am about to try 100% Pure Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast, I&#x27;ve had it on for about four hours now and have a mild burning and tearing sensation, so I might be sensitive to one of the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And definitely seems to help minimize the appearance of fine lines under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I used a dab, but it went on very greasy &#x3D;&#x3D;</li>
            <li> Pump administers too much at a time and is wasteful.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I really like the bottle as well.    </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this 2x a day for about a week now and really like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use as much under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> I tossed it out after two weeks of really trying to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> It really does seem to reduce puffiness under the eye.  </li>
            <li> It disepenses way way way too much product and there is no way of getting around it.</li>
            <li> Nothing really.  </li>
            <li> so my whole face can benefit from this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have never had any that really worked until this.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the mornings and sometimes during mid-day if I really need it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really does work</li>
            <li> The free one was very different.  </li>
            <li> Works for me and you do not have to use too much for it to work.  </li>
            <li> Caffein supposedly will constrict the smooth muscle in the arterioles (reduces in-flow) and allows enough time for the fluids to be drained by the lymphatics or venous circulation.</li>
            <li> , I did not notice a real difference when I used it as directed for 3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed any changes to the dark circles under my eyes, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s a genetic thing that no eye cream would resolve.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells) when I first apply it</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other product (rollers, creams, etc.)</li>
            <li> I had used khiel eyecream for few years and pretty satisfied with that item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only going on my second week and the results just keep getting better for me.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for the ingredients because I wanted an eye cream with hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> so I was particularly hopeful</li>
            <li> This cream really made the skin around my eyes feel soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have skin that can be both very sensitive and dry, (and I sometimes get eczema breakouts on my face or near my eye areas, so I must be very careful about what kind of eye creams I use), but this cream feels completely gentle and deeply moisturizes while still feeling light and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> definitely not thick.  </li>
            <li> I dont doubt it is a new item</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also signs of aging we don&#x27;t have to live with it, there&#x27;s alwsys surgery...</li>
            <li> OH well....on to something new.</li>
            <li> My skin and eyes are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily to reduce dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how much I like it; it&#x27;s literally an eye-opener skin care line!</li>
            <li> I was a little bothered at first, but it is not that strong and the effects obviously outweigh it.  </li>
            <li> Coffee smell is faint and pleasant.</li>
            <li> The bottle is big enough to last for a long period of time, and I love that these products come with a pump, no bacteria gets inside!</li>
            <li> I try to get just a little dot of lotion and a huge squirt</li>
            <li> Also, it appears to hold more product than is actually does, which I found a little deceptive.  </li>
            <li> Just started using this caffeine eye cream and so far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li> Wow..</li>
            <li> And thanks to the ladies that left there reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> It keeps my under-eye area feeling soft and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> I am no longer as young as I was.</li>
            <li> My skin has been clear, soft and firmer with use of this product.</li>
            <li> The packaging of the product is completely dysfunctional, though.  </li>
            <li> It completely cleared my face</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t hide it, do yourself a favor and get natural product that works.</li>
            <li> I have to take the entire top off the bottle and use a small plastic  manicure tool to get the cream out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> cream has a slight coffee odor, which goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> no matter how long it stayed in the fridge or how much I shook it.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe the reason why the product doesn&#x27;t work for me is because I&#x27;m anemic (which makes me always tired, and no matter how much sleep I get, my lines never go away), and I most likely have hyper/hypo thyroid issues since it runs in my family.</li>
            <li> My situation is mild with a little puffiness and no dark circles, but the cream did not improve anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very conscious of the ingredients in skincare products, and like that Passport to Organics uses all-natural ingredients that are beneficial to skin&#x27;s overall appearance and health.</li>
            <li> Caffeine eye cream does not due as it says.</li>
            <li> i was surprised that there was no individual box nor sealing for item.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the results I have seen so far, and will post my update after I use a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> try to use natural products whenever possible</li>
            <li> My under eye area looks worse instead of better...</li>
            <li> One day it comes out thick and its fabulous</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd order and I noticed it has a new silver pump which works very nicely especially if I follow the tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In short period of time, two-three weeks of using this eye cream two times a day, my fine lines disappeared, my dark circles, though not completely gone, are visibly smaller and my eyes do not have this tiered look of someone who spends all day in front of the computer.</li>
            <li> I am usually not the type of person to leave reviews unless the product is really good or bad.</li>
            <li> Also didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my eyes other than the skin was moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it if you can spare the extra change.</li>
            <li> It forces too much cream out, too quickly, and there&#x27;s not really any way to get it to come out slowly.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any change in my dark circles really</li>
            <li> When it comes to products like this that are on the more expensive end for a product, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if they are purposely designed poorly to make more money off you.</li>
            <li> I tried their cleansers, lotions, creams, everything is superior quality and it does work, ladies, without all those scary ingredients like other creams and lotions have.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize and reduce dark circles as well, but my main reason for this product is to reduce the puffiness.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses I was pleasantly surprised by the complete effectiveness of this product!  </li>
            <li> , I can not say that this product is good or bad</li>
            <li> Other than a slight tingling sensation when you first put it on...</li>
            <li> I look more awake since dark circles tend to make you look tired.</li>
            <li> It probably has very little caffeine if one were to really read the label, if it even state it on the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In just the short time I&#x27;ve owned it, I&#x27;m seeing a big difference in my puffy eyes and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Lasted a long time tho.  </li>
            <li> It works well with other skincare products such as moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have used multiple products to reduce undereye puffiness, due to allergies.  </li>
            <li> I rated this product a 5 because it does something that I have NEVER gotten any other product to do....reduce the allergy related puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen very minimal changes in my upper and lower eyelids.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was hoping for something that would help my puffy, dry eyelids.</li>
            <li> was that the pump is super tricky and it is really hard to get a small amount out, its either none or a lot.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, the cream is thin and absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I only apply a little on both eyes and any leftover I put on the remainder of my face.</li>
            <li> The pump is hard to control and squirts way too much product out, which goes to waste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots of money to reduce this sometimes embrassing look around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Only problem, keep it away from your lash line, my eyeliner has trouble going on and staying on over this.</li>
            <li> there really is no overpowering scent with this product.</li>
            <li> so maybe that makes the product too drying for some of us thin-skinned pale Irish girls.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad acne problem and the first line I tried was a turmeric clear face line.</li>
            <li> My dark lines are still just as bad as before, if not a tad bit better.</li>
            <li> First, the product arrived with a broken pump, the tube inside is missing, and the container appears to have been opened or damaged</li>
            <li> After using this product, my skin became red and very sensitive and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Since I am 61, I was left with a zillion wrinkles and crepey skin, which I can usually disguise with another bargain brand eye cream.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I do NOT THINK IT ABSORBS WELL, not compared to other creams.  </li>
            <li> I have been using their other products for a while.</li>
            <li> I decided to look on Amazon since I was buying some other items for the family.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount</li>
            <li> Listen up people I came to realized that absolutely no product out there can repair puffy eyes!</li>
            <li> I just did not see a difference from any other eye cream I have tried.</li>
            <li> This product just like every other product I have purchased for puffy eyes did not work.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I&#x27;ve been dealing with eye puffiness recently due to all the travel I do.  </li>
            <li> so I can compare it with the other one</li>
            <li> I would say this cream is about average in performance for its price, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from high-end department store French brands, alas, now priced beyond my budget, to drugstore big cosmetic company names.  </li>
            <li> This cream seems to be helping however my puffy eyes are due to age and other factors so the improvement is slight.</li>
            <li> I was not hoping for much, having already tried several other pots of very expensive cream.</li>
            <li> It is , however, a bit hard to control amount and also hard to tell  when you need a new one.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the pump doesn&#x27;t have a tube attached, so there is no way of using the product without removing the cap and shaking it out.  </li>
            <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes since a teenager and as a 50</li>
            <li> I work at McDonalds late at night and when I have only a fraction of the time I used to sleep</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that can help with my dark cirlces and puffiness.</li>
            <li> so maybe I&#x27;m just destined to have dark, puffy under eyes.</li>
            <li> I have dark shadows under my eyes and they look puffy all the time.</li>
            <li> Hands down -</li>
            <li> The eye cream comes in a pump type dispenser bottle, however there is no tube inside the bottle going down inside to access the cream.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before purchasing and yes, it does have a smell - coffee!  </li>
            <li> This makes my eyes feel a little tingly, like it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> I am Asian-American and have very dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I wasted $30 on this product.</li>
            <li> i expected thick creamy texture</li>
            <li> It is messy and the cream is beginning to discolor, probably from being exposed to the air every time I use it.</li>
            <li> and to me it kills me to watch my money and product come out and be wasted like that.</li>
            <li> Using this cream now for a few weeks, and I have had no results.  </li>
            <li> But perhaps that&#x27;s just because I really do have EXTREMELY bad dark lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s underwhelmingly ordinary stuff.  </li>
            <li> I apply it every morning, wait for it to sink in, and then apply all of my eye makeup as usual.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why</li>
            <li> I am so tired of hearing people telling me you look tired, why didn&#x27;t you sleep last night, or did some one punch you under your eye, ....&lt;</li>
            <li> my late 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Not like thicker moisturizers that you need to rub in...great for delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> Base on reviews, I had high expectations of this product and couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it and begging it...</li>
            <li> And for $25 a bottle, ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I am unable to rate this product at this time, because I have been using it for a little over a month, morning and night, and have not seen any results in the reduction of puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Tried the product thinking it would help with my tired eyes and help fight wrinkles with the caffine it contains.  </li>
            <li> and my eyes don&#x27;t feel tired at all!</li>
            <li> oh well, another product useless.</li>
            <li> It smells weird too.</li>
            <li> so my eyes are always so tired and eye cream that contains caffeine which is energy booster of day, caught my eyes!</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I think I am addicted!</li>
            <li> Disappointing because you know this product was tested and</li>
            <li> Always have, probably always will, unfortunately. :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hunt for an eye-depuffer is still on because this product did nothing for me... not even a bit :(  </li>
            <li> It has a very faint smell and</li>
            <li> I can very faintly smell it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells terrible and never comes out of the bottle correctly.  </li>
            <li> and yet I didn&#x27;t listen, the squirter is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First, the product arrived with a broken pump, the tube inside is missing, and the container appears to have been opened or damaged (crusted product inside the cap), so I am returning it for a refund.  But I wanted to see if I would buy it again, so I used a Q tip to scoop some out.  It&#x27;s underwhelmingly ordinary stuff.  Absorbs fast, I&#x27;ve had it on for about four hours now and have a mild burning and tearing sensation, so I might be sensitive to one of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are under 35 and party a lot, or have oily skin, I think this is a good choice for you.  I applied this cream in the morning after a good night&#x27;s sleep, and the dark circles and puffiness went away fast.  Since I am 61, I was left with a zillion wrinkles and crepey skin, which I can usually disguise with another bargain brand eye cream.  So the quality control issues aside, I would not re-purchase.  Caffeine is a diuretic so maybe that makes the product too drying for some of us thin-skinned pale Irish girls.  It might work better with a moisture cream mixed in.  I would say this cream is about average in performance for its price, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from high-end department store French brands, alas, now priced beyond my budget, to drugstore big cosmetic company names.  I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
            <li> I would of liked to think this would work right away-it doesn&#x27;t.  I wake up with puffy, eyes, especially in spring. I put it on and waited a bit -- it didn&#x27;t sink into my skin, just hng there greasy looking. The caffeine idea made sense to me. It evens smells like coffee. I immediately realized, I would be taking it off.  Unlike other reviewers, I do NOT THINK IT ABSORBS WELL, not compared to other creams.  I used a dab, but it went on very greasy &#x3D;&#x3D; I could not imagine putting eye shadow over it.  As for eye liner -- no, it would smear in a flash.  I had to dab most of it off.  I&#x27;ll try it at night, but most definitely I don&#x27;t recommend it for under make up, unless you want your eye make up to slide right off:/  It&#x27;s a good concept, but this product is way to sticky and greasy to wear during the day.</li>
            <li> Got my caffeine eye cream last week! As soon as I started using it, my dark circles looked liked they are fading and my eyes don&#x27;t feel tired at all! Thank you passport to organics for making such good and fabulous products!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many eye creams &amp; nothing has given visible results until now.&lt;br /&gt;Really love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Have used it twice &amp; noticed a difference immediately. Reduced puffiness &amp; lines around eyes by 50%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And,,,,,IT&#x27;S CRUELTY FREE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a permanent product for me:)</li>
            <li> I wasted $30 on this product. My situation is mild with a little puffiness and no dark circles, but the cream did not improve anything. It also stings my eyes even though I make sure not to get any in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many, many eye creams over the years and I love this eye cream!!  I have greasy eyes and I love that this cream absorbs quickly with no greasy or tacky feeling, it is a testament to the purity of the ingredients.  This eye cream packs a punch and delivers what it says without chemicals.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin. Pump administers too much at a time and is wasteful. Been using it for almost a month and do not see any difference in under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> Tried the product thinking it would help with my tired eyes and help fight wrinkles with the caffine it contains.  No luck on either one.  My under eye area looks worse instead of better...oh well, another product useless.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I used each morning.  It is , however, a bit hard to control amount and also hard to tell  when you need a new one.</li>
            <li> I recently placed my second order and it is a great product. I&#x27;m very conscious of the ingredients in skincare products, and like that Passport to Organics uses all-natural ingredients that are beneficial to skin&#x27;s overall appearance and health. I am Asian-American and have very dark circles under my eyes. This product helps tremendously reduce the discoloration. I look more awake since dark circles tend to make you look tired. A little goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly. It works well with other skincare products such as moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Just started using this caffeine eye cream and so far I&#x27;m liking it. It feels really refreshing and so far it&#x27;s making my skin look good. The texture is also smooth and it goes on easy. Smell is a bit interesting but not bad.</li>
            <li> I love Passport to Organics! I have been using their other products for a while. This cream really made the skin around my eyes feel soft and refreshed! I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling sensation - but I&#x27;m sure it is still working! Too much product comes out each time but with practice, you can get just the right amount of product out. Will continue to use their products for sure!</li>
            <li> The caffeine eye cream is amazing! In just the short time I&#x27;ve owned it, I&#x27;m seeing a big difference in my puffy eyes and dark circles. I&#x27;ve spent lots of money to reduce this sometimes embrassing look around my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried many products online claiming to be the best, with no results at all. I decided to look on Amazon since I was buying some other items for the family.  Hence came across this Caffeine Eye Cream product.  Wow..Why not? Caffeine on the eyes! Well I drink it every morning, why not try it on the eyes to wake me up. Needless to say I really love the results I&#x27;m getting with this product. I&#x27;m only going on my second week and the results just keep getting better for me. I apply it 2 times a day and hope to continue getting good results. Love it! And thanks to the ladies that left there reviews on this product. Their comments helped me make my decision to purchase it...with only 2 reviews it sold me. Good luck to all that use it. I do hope you get the same results or better.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd order and I noticed it has a new silver pump which works very nicely especially if I follow the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies if you put your finger gently over the nozzle (like instructed) while pumping, just the right amount comes out.  I use it in the morning to get rid of puffiness &amp; to moisturize before I put on my makeup.  It leaves my eyes looking brighter &amp; younger.  I have tried putting it in the fridge to thicken up, like it said in the description...but I prefer it thinner.  Great cream, it actually works!  I&#x27;m glad I can purchase it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Very light coffee smell which goes away in about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: Super fast, thanks!</li>
            <li> Well, I first ordered this item having very, very high expectations, but to be honest, I can not tell if the product is even working or not. My dark lines are still just as bad as before, if not a tad bit better. But perhaps that&#x27;s just because I really do have EXTREMELY bad dark lines. Always have, probably always will, unfortunately. :( I thought that maybe the reason why the product doesn&#x27;t work for me is because I&#x27;m anemic (which makes me always tired, and no matter how much sleep I get, my lines never go away), and I most likely have hyper/hypo thyroid issues since it runs in my family. Anybody else having the problem I&#x27;m having? Or can anyone recommend a different product that could work for me?</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily to reduce dark circles under my eyes.  I notice no difference after about 2 weeks, however, because it reduces puffiness, I can say that under eye concealer goes on a lot smoother.  It smells good too.</li>
            <li> I love the product, however I took away one star for the packaging. It forces too much cream out, too quickly, and there&#x27;s not really any way to get it to come out slowly. More than once it has come out so fast that it ended up on my bathroom wall. And it&#x27;s always way more cream than I can use, very wasteful! Great eye cream though, does the trick.</li>
            <li> I tested this eye cream and it is very nice!  I like the way it quickly absorbs.  You only need a small amount and I put it below my eye area.  It helped with my puffiness and circles.  I really like the bottle as well.    It has a very faint smell and I like that it is not overpowering.  I bought it mainly for the ingredients because I wanted an eye cream with hyaluronic acid.  I also wanted a great moisturizer.  I highly recommend it and am happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> This product did not work as well as I&#x27;d hoped. Works about the same as Burts Bees undereye cream.  It smells weird too.</li>
            <li> This is the second product I&#x27;ve tried from Passport to Organics and with my 2nd purchase, I am even more convinced that the products are a WONDERFUL value - especially with the organic/natural ingredients.  I like to avoid things like parabens and sulfates so it&#x27;s great to deal with a company that has high quality products at an affordable price!  This eye cream glides on beautifully and just has a very nice &#x27;silky&#x27; feel.  I have skin that can be both very sensitive and dry, (and I sometimes get eczema breakouts on my face or near my eye areas, so I must be very careful about what kind of eye creams I use), but this cream feels completely gentle and deeply moisturizes while still feeling light and luxurious.  It keeps my under-eye area feeling soft and moisturized all day.  And definitely seems to help minimize the appearance of fine lines under the eyes.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am no longer as young as I was. I am over 60-sigh. I bought this because I was hoping for something that would help my puffy, dry eyelids. I was not hoping for much, having already tried several other pots of very expensive cream. However-it WORKS! I actually look awake all day and it is a great mosturizer as well. I apply it every morning, wait for it to sink in, and then apply all of my eye makeup as usual. Sometimes I even remember to use it again before bed. Only problem, keep it away from your lash line, my eyeliner has trouble going on and staying on over this. Coffee smell is faint and pleasant. Buy this, it actually works.</li>
            <li> My skin and eyes are very sensitive. The cream had a nice feel to it, but it made my eyes water. Also didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my eyes other than the skin was moisturized.</li>
            <li> The product is the best. The caffeine cream is so effective. Super happy with the product!! Hands down - I will buy this always!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this 2x a day for about a week now and really like it. I don&#x27;t have to use as much under eye concealer. It seems to take away the puffyness too. I can&#x27;t wait to try a bunch of their other products, they look amazing.</li>
            <li> hi, im not the type of person who enjoy writing reviews.. but I think I need to write a review for future buyers:)  I had used khiel eyecream for few years and pretty satisfied with that item. I am a full time student so my eyes are always so tired and eye cream that contains caffeine which is energy booster of day, caught my eyes! yes!  wrapping- i was surprised that there was no individual box nor sealing for item. I dont doubt it is a new item but why no box? cannot check expiration date.  scent- umm... acceptable. it&#x27;s like a scent of cosmetic that passed expiration date way over. but not that strong.  texture- i expected thick creamy texture cos I think it gives more moisture on my eyes. this eye cream is rather watery light. definitely not thick.  I have to keep using it for certain effects, however, for now,, it&#x27;s just a okay item.</li>
            <li> The eye cream comes in a pump type dispenser bottle, however there is no tube inside the bottle going down inside to access the cream. The pump doesn&#x27;t produce the cream when it is used. I have to take the entire top off the bottle and use a small plastic  manicure tool to get the cream out of the bottle. It is messy and the cream is beginning to discolor, probably from being exposed to the air every time I use it. And for $25 a bottle, ridiculous. Additionally, I have used it for several weeks and I have seen very minimal changes in my upper and lower eyelids. I compare it to Mary Kay products (I am not affiliated with Mary Kay in any way) and Victoria Principal&#x27;s products (again no affiliation) and this cream is not even in the same league. Not sure if I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Base on reviews, I had high expectations of this product and couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it and begging it... Listen up people I came to realized that absolutely no product out there can repair puffy eyes! Ladies I no it&#x27;s all about appearance but it&#x27;s also signs of aging we don&#x27;t have to live with it, there&#x27;s alwsys surgery...because creams not gonna do it. Sorry</li>
            <li> Saw no change in puffiness. Used it as directed and faithfully but noticed no help with the bags under my eyes</li>
            <li> This stuff smells terrible and never comes out of the bottle correctly.  I try to get just a little dot of lotion and a huge squirt comes out that shoots across the bathroom.  I tossed it out after two weeks of really trying to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hunt for an eye-depuffer is still on because this product did nothing for me... not even a bit :(  Very disappointed. I have read that only products that contain caffeine are effective so I was particularly hopeful this time- but just like the products I&#x27;ve tried before it- it did not work, at all. It probably has very little caffeine if one were to really read the label, if it even state it on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So, try at your own risk. Some products work for one and not another. I read reviews on this before I purchased it and it seems it works for some people.</li>
            <li> I have used multiple products to reduce undereye puffiness, due to allergies.  This eye cream works better than anything else i&#x27;ve tried!!!</li>
            <li> I have not seen any change in my dark circles really, I can not say that this product is good or bad porq  truth I do not made ​​any changes</li>
            <li> Used it all and seen no results. Would not order it again. Caffeine eye cream does not due as it says.</li>
            <li> This cream seems to be helping however my puffy eyes are due to age and other factors so the improvement is slight.</li>
            <li> Other than a slight tingling sensation when you first put it on...nothing too impress here.  I just did not see a difference from any other eye cream I have tried. Try the &amp;#34;Equate&amp;#34; brand at Wally World - same results, I think.</li>
            <li> It really does seem to reduce puffiness under the eye.  Doesn&#x27;t interfere with makeup application.  My only complaint is that the pump doesn&#x27;t have a tube attached, so there is no way of using the product without removing the cap and shaking it out.  I just received the Radiant cream which has the tube.</li>
            <li> When it comes to products like this that are on the more expensive end for a product, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if they are purposely designed poorly to make more money off you. Yea the product is okay- definetely not a miracle in a bottle- but just as others said and yet I didn&#x27;t listen, the squirter is horrible. It disepenses way way way too much product and there is no way of getting around it. You cannot open it to get it yourself and you cannot stop it from coming out. So basically you need 1/4 of what comes out- and to me it kills me to watch my money and product come out and be wasted like that. I tried to use the extra but it didnt make a difference so I tried to put the cap back on hoping it would still be there for the next use but it dries up. Disappointing because you know this product was tested and the company knows about this. It&#x27;s about time we get what we freakin pay for these days.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is the worsest I have ever used. After using this product, my skin became red and very sensitive and uncomfortable. I want to return this product and refund my money back.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  Using this cream now for a few weeks, and I have had no results.  OH well....on to something new.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream. I have had no issues with the pump and have noticed a real difference (as apposed to an imagined one) since I started using it a few weeks ago. AND I have already recommended it.</li>
            <li> This product just like every other product I have purchased for puffy eyes did not work. I think if you have them heritary, then you are just stuck with them. If someone knows of a product that actually does work. Please let me know.</li>
            <li> Mid 40s guy with noticible bags under my eyes.  This product did not work at any noticable level for me.  Lasted a long time tho.  Used it daily morning and night.  Nothing really.  Still looking for something that works.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes since a teenager and as a 50+ I now have the puffiness. This product goes on smoothly and does help reduce the darkness and certainly the puffiness. I especially love the pump as you don&#x27;t have to use much. It also has a nice refreshing smell.....just like a jolt of coffee to get you going in the morning.</li>
            <li> I received a test sample about a week ago and have been using twice daily.  Within a week, I notice a reduction in puffiness around the outer ring of my eyes.  Also, under my eye area feels hydrated.  The cream is easy to apply and absorbs quickly.  One pump is all you need for both eyes.  I did have some issues getting the right amount to pump; so, I hold the bottle at an angle then pump.  Also, I put the cream in the refrigerator to harden so that it pumps better as the consistency is more liquid, so this technique helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a slight coffee odor, which goes away quickly. Overall, I like the results I have seen so far, and will post my update after I use a bit longer.  Otherwise, I would say give it a try if you have puffiness around your eyes; it definitely seems to work.</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective. My skin has been clear, soft and firmer with use of this product. It&#x27;s meant for eyes, but I&#x27;ve been blending it with my moisturizer so my whole face can benefit from this product. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it if you can spare the extra change.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is somewhat effective for reducing puffiness around the eyes and I may purchase it again.  The packaging of the product is completely dysfunctional, though.  When the seller has to send a message telling the buyer how to use the pump mechanism, there is going to be a problem.  The pump is hard to control and squirts way too much product out, which goes to waste.  I probably lost 25% of the cream to this defect.  Also, it appears to hold more product than is actually does, which I found a little deceptive.  On the positive side, the cream is thin and absorbs into the skin.  It does not sit on top the skin like many eye creams do. I am on the fence about a second purchase.  &#x3D;^..^&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I have used this product faithfully for close to two weeksand have noticed NO improvement.  I will not be reordering this product.</li>
            <li> This makes my eyes feel a little tingly, like it&#x27;s working.  I feel like it helps but in the morning, my eyes look pretty good from 8 hours of sleep anyway.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this for christmas and she has enjoyed using it. She uses it every day. Just wish there was more of it!</li>
            <li> I am usually not the type of person to leave reviews unless the product is really good or bad. In this case, it&#x27;s the first! I was hooked on passport to organics products about 8 months ago. I had a bad acne problem and the first line I tried was a turmeric clear face line. It completely cleared my face and I don&#x27;t have any new breakouts since then, amazing product and highly recommended. Now, I decided to give a try to this new caffeine eye cream, and let me tell you, it&#x27;s honestly the best one I have ever had. I am the type of person who spends a lot on skin care products, I had tried everything under the sun from cheap pharmacy products to high end ones. Passport to Organics is not only affordable, it delivers the results. In short period of time, two-three weeks of using this eye cream two times a day, my fine lines disappeared, my dark circles, though not completely gone, are visibly smaller and my eyes do not have this tiered look of someone who spends all day in front of the computer. The bottle is big enough to last for a long period of time, and I love that these products come with a pump, no bacteria gets inside! I can&#x27;t say enough how much I like it; it&#x27;s literally an eye-opener skin care line! I recommend these products to everyone I know and I just can&#x27;t get enough myself. I tried their cleansers, lotions, creams, everything is superior quality and it does work, ladies, without all those scary ingredients like other creams and lotions have. It&#x27;s your face after all and you can&#x27;t hide it, do yourself a favor and get natural product that works.</li>
            <li> This stuff really worked for me. I work at McDonalds late at night and when I have only a fraction of the time I used to sleep I started to notice eye bags under my eyes. This stuff did the trick. I let my grandma use it and she loves it too. I may have to order another one for her huge eye bags. :P</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 5 because it does something that I have NEVER gotten any other product to do....reduce the allergy related puffiness under my eyes.  I have tried so many other product (rollers, creams, etc.) and methods ( ice packs, cucumber circles, etc.).  I have never had any that really worked until this.  It does moisturize and reduce dark circles as well, but my main reason for this product is to reduce the puffiness.  I read other reviews before purchasing and yes, it does have a smell - coffee!  I was a little bothered at first, but it is not that strong and the effects obviously outweigh it.  I did have to put tension on the pump so that too much cream did not \\&quot;shoot\\&quot; out, but that was easy to figure out.  I felt towards the end of the bottle that the effects were not quite as strong, but that was at the very end.  I am about to order my 2nd bottle and I hope to be amazed all over again.</li>
            <li> I am posting under my husband and my shared account.  I am in woman my late 50&#x27;s and I use this product every day now. I think I am addicted! I love this stuff. I use it as a moisturizer. It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, helps with my puffiness and visibly reduces lines almost instantly. The scent is very light and pleasant. I only apply a little on both eyes and any leftover I put on the remainder of my face. I use it in the mornings and sometimes during mid-day if I really need it.  My co-workers noticed that I looked \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot; shortly after starting this regimen.  I think this is what&#x27;s doing the trick because I&#x27;m getting the same lack of sleep! ;-) I am a big fan of this line - it is always quality. Thanks for helping me look great!</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. I did not see any results in the 3 months I used it daily and night. Will look for something else. Please let me know if you know of something that works.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I&#x27;ve been dealing with eye puffiness recently due to all the travel I do.  The ordered shipped the same day and I received it very quickly.  After a few uses I was pleasantly surprised by the complete effectiveness of this product!  I woke up with zero puffiness and looked much better on my travels in the mornings.  The smell is quite nice, not too strong but you get the sense that the caffeine is really there and effective.  I would recommend this product to anyone who deals with eye puffiness like I do.  Very happy with my purchase... and good price point too!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I am unable to rate this product at this time, because I have been using it for a little over a month, morning and night, and have not seen any results in the reduction of puffiness under my eyes. I will continue to use it and give another review.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work it is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It&#x27;s light, it smells good, and it works. My eyes are just a bit brighter and my puffiness is gone. I absolutely live the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I was able to test this product and I was very pleased! It smelled good, and made my eyes seem awake. My girlfriend is a fan too, she ended up taking it from me, so I guess that says something. I love passport to organics. You can definitely feel good about the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on Amazon.  It was a pure liquid (like milk) no matter how long it stayed in the fridge or how much I shook it. It also broke out my skin and turned my eyes bright red.  I contacted the company through their website and asked if their product was supposed to do this and they sent me a free one. The free one was very different.  When I asked why they said that they make their products in batches and no 2 batches are the same.  Also heat exposure will alter the product since it is organic.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and feels moisturized for hours.  Not like thicker moisturizers that you need to rub in...great for delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that can help with my dark cirlces and puffiness. I started using this a couple weeks ago and I cannot believe the results.  The consistency is great and I notice a difference in my appearance right when I use it. My eyes look more awake and the skin around my eyes feels tighter.  I love to use it right before I put my makeup to give me an awake look for the day.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that does what it is supposed to do--dimishes the appearance of puffiness under the eyes by the action of caffiene--a natural ingredient used in many cellulite products. This is my 3rd purchase of this product. I love it!</li>
            <li> Works for me and you do not have to use too much for it to work.  It is a LIKE. Thumbs UP</li>
            <li> I cant use a lot of things on my face, this works  so great for my eyes smells great. I would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> When purchasing this, I thoroughly researched many others and was slightly skeptical about the reviews.  Specifically, someone had said that the product can be leaky at times.  At first, this product was amazing and works.  But as it was stated is gets leaky very quickly.  I am not sure why and it&#x27;s not like after awhile it happens.  It&#x27;s sporadic.  One day it comes out thick and its fabulous and I really love it.  The next it comes out like water and it&#x27;s sort of gross.  I&#x27;m disappointed b/c like I said when it comes out like a cream, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s just like putting oil on your eyes.  Also, I believe someone else had mentioned that the mouth of the pump is too big and a lot comes out at once (when it works like an eye cream).  This is completely accurate and the amount that comes out is equivalent to what I would use for face moisturizer.  I am about to try 100% Pure Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream and hopefully this is better.</li>
            <li> This product hasn&#x27;t changed the puffiness or the darkness of the area under my eyes. Nothing seems to work so maybe I&#x27;m just destined to have dark, puffy under eyes. *sigh*</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream! It&#x27;s lightweight but still moisturizing. When I apply it, I definitely look more awake! I&#x27;ve not noticed any changes to the dark circles under my eyes, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s a genetic thing that no eye cream would resolve. It does help to decrease the puffiness when used in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to use natural products whenever possible and I love the fact that this product uses natural, organic ingredients and is paraben free! For those who might be worried about scents- there really is no overpowering scent with this product. I can very faintly smell it (I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells) when I first apply it but the smell dissipates very quickly (if you even notice it at all).  Overall, I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have dark shadows under my eyes and they look puffy all the time. I am so tired of hearing people telling me you look tired, why didn&#x27;t you sleep last night, or did some one punch you under your eye, ....&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try this product. as many of you may know edema or swelling is caused by the lack of proper drainage or too much blood flow to an area. Caffein supposedly will constrict the smooth muscle in the arterioles (reduces in-flow) and allows enough time for the fluids to be drained by the lymphatics or venous circulation. So I decided to try an eye cream with caffeine and I cam across this one.&lt;br /&gt;What mostly pissed me off was that the pump is super tricky and it is really hard to get a small amount out, its either none or a lot. Then I did a controlled trial and put some on only one eye so I can compare it with the other one, I did not notice a real difference when I used it as directed for 3 days. I still use the cream just because I paid for it and it is a good moisturizer, but it certainly did not help my situation.</li>
