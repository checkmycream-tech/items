            <li>Great product - my wife uses it on her feet.  </li>
            <li>Remarkable product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I ended up buying a tin of Savannah and have truly loved it.</li>

            <li>Bought many of these as Christmas gifts!</li>
            <li>Nice scent.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy, absorbs quickly and smells great.  </li>
            <li>It feels more effective than Burt&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>In comparison, I found Savannah&#x27;s salve felt heavier and worked better for me as I didn&#x27;t have to reapply as often throughout the day as I did with Burt&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, I love that Savannah&#x27;s lid is a screw top rather than pull - makes sense when your hand is still slippery from applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love everything I have ever tried from these people.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the Savannah Bee Company products.</li>

            <li>Nothing really works for long--except this product.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!!!</li>
            <li>They have been growing fast and are very strong.  </li>
            <li>I have other Savannah Bee products that I like very much, but this is quite marvelous and helps keep the shine on my buffed fingernails.  </li>
            <li>Love at first use.  </li>
            <li>The product has a unique aromatic presence.  </li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with the whole transaction.</li>
            <li>A bit greasy, but soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>It quickly lost the greasy feel and continued to  coat and protect my hands</li>
            <li>I like being able to have this ib my handbag particularly in winter.  </li>
            <li>When you apply it it feels greasy,but in a very short time it&#x27;s absorbed into your hands and nails and makes your hands feel really good.  </li>
            <li>I use it before I go to bed everyday and my nails look great.</li>
            <li>now Working Hands is amazing and only 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li>I gave this nail salve to my daughter because no products she has tried have kept her cuticles soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Great product, reasonable price, everything we expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s greasy at first, but soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because my nails were so soft and broke easily.  </li>
            <li>Glad to get it in a larger tin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it locally any more, so I get it here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve turned other nurse friends onto this amazing</li>
            <li>It also has helped my daughter combat her super sensitive, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>but I would say is just a temporary band aid,  or washes off easily and had to be constantly reapplied, after using it for over a week straight,  they&#x27;re is no difference in the dryness of my hands. ..</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>It feels very silky.</li>
            <li>however I think their previous formula worked better for me.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly, heals dry cracked skin and soothes hand arthritis too.</li>
            <li>It has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Savannah Bee reps were in our local Whole Foods demo&#x27;ing their products.</li>
            <li>this new packaging is smaller quantity and something changed.  </li>

            <li> Nice scent.  A bit greasy, but soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an RN and have chronically dry hands from constant hand foaming and washing. Nothing really works for long--except this product.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!!! It&#x27;s greasy at first, but soaks in quickly. The smell is nice and refreshing and my hands look and feel GREAT after using--soft and moisturized. I&#x27;ve turned other nurse friends onto this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little but goes a long way--so the tin lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is not greasy, absorbs quickly and smells great.  It has all natural ingredients.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product and works well.  however I think their previous formula worked better for me.  this new packaging is smaller quantity and something changed.  If it worked like the way it was, I&#x27;d give 5 stars for this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It really does work. I use it before I go to bed everyday and my nails look great. Try not to rub this stuff in your eye by accident...it irritates the eyes like crazy. &#x3D;&#x27;)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!!  LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my nails were so soft and broke easily.  It has a soothing smell of mint.  One swipe across the tips of my fingers on the nails daily, and now I have to use a clipper to cut them!  They have been growing fast and are very strong.  Savannah Beeswax is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  Glad to get it in a larger tin. Love the smell. Am giving this for Christmas presents this coming Christmas Do not tell!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this hand cream! It feels a little greasy initially but rubs in well. Keeps hands moisturized.</li>
            <li> Savannah Bee reps were in our local Whole Foods demo&#x27;ing their products. I am always in search of the solution to wintertime dry cracking skin on my poor dishpan hands. I tried this salve and finished my shopping. It quickly lost the greasy feel and continued to  coat and protect my hands and I thought I found a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying, I wanted to compare it to the sample tin of Burt&#x27;s hand balm I already had at home.  In comparison, I found Savannah&#x27;s salve felt heavier and worked better for me as I didn&#x27;t have to reapply as often throughout the day as I did with Burt&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a tin of Savannah and have truly loved it. It feels more effective than Burt&#x27;s.  Plus, I love that Savannah&#x27;s lid is a screw top rather than pull - makes sense when your hand is still slippery from applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet had broken, dry or cracked skin this winter and today it&#x27;s in the 20&#x27;s and our heat has been cranking for a couple months  now. I am hopeful that this is gonna save me!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for just a few days and can see the difference in my hands and face.  A friend told me&lt;br /&gt;about it after she received hers and I tried it.  Love at first use.  She gave me her second can of it until my&lt;br /&gt;order is received.  I was stung by mosquitoes when she was showing it to me and the next day the itch became&lt;br /&gt;unbearable.  I used the Savannah Beeswax and the itching went away.  Remarkable product.</li>
            <li> This salve has saved my hands.  It also has helped my daughter combat her super sensitive, itchy skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like being able to have this ib my handbag particularly in winter.  It is a soothing salve that soaks in and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I gave this nail salve to my daughter because no products she has tried have kept her cuticles soft and healthy.  She loves the salve and says it is already working wonders on her hands and nails.  Great product, was sent immediately and in time for Christmas!!</li>
            <li> Love everything I have ever tried from these people. Can&#x27;t find it locally any more, so I get it here.</li>
            <li> Great product, reasonable price, everything we expected.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Bought many of these as Christmas gifts! Keep one in my handbag all the time. Try it!</li>
            <li> this is not a hand cream this is a salve, a little goes a long way. I have given this product to 4 people and recommended to others and everyone loves it. The one who was not thrilled, used to much. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have other Savannah Bee products that I like very much, but this is quite marvelous and helps keep the shine on my buffed fingernails.  When you apply it it feels greasy,but in a very short time it&#x27;s absorbed into your hands and nails and makes your hands feel really good.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it as much as I do.  It feels very silky.</li>
            <li> Great product - my wife uses it on her feet.  The product has a unique aromatic presence.  The product matches the descriptive blurb, and arrived promptly.  Completely satisfied with the whole transaction.</li>
            <li> Love the Savannah Bee Company products.</li>
            <li> I put this on at night and then wear cotton gloves overnight since it&#x27;s greasy.  It soaks in quickly, heals dry cracked skin and soothes hand arthritis too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK,  it absorbs quickly but I would say is just a temporary band aid,  or washes off easily and had to be constantly reapplied, after using it for over a week straight,  they&#x27;re is no difference in the dryness of my hands. .. now Working Hands is amazing and only 1/3 the price.</li>
