            <li>Love this scent, it is not to strong.  </li>

            <li>Avon Black Suede is a very good cologne and leaves you smelling like a man.  </li>
            <li>i love this spray so much but the only thing about it when i bought it, i did not use it myself, i gave it as a gift to my pastor and he told me it was good</li>

            <li>This is what he always wore when we first met.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that it would have more of a leathery odor, but overall it is wearable.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, every since Avon stopped selling it, he&#x27;s had to buy other brands, and none of them smelled as great as the original Black leather.</li>
            <li>I mean, it does smell good, but I know of better ones for less.</li>
            <li>And Black Leather was something completly different,that you can&#x27;t get any more.</li>

            <li>I have a bottle of Black Suede Leather and would easily reorder another one.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I saw this here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>although I still enjoy the scent of Black Suede, I think I enjoy the Black Suede Leather a little more.</li>
            <li>Because the fragrance is masculine and smoothe.  </li>
            <li>and I recommeded for all young men.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast, but the scent of the cologne does not last long at all.</li>
            <li>Better than the other Black Suede Colognes.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the same as the original Black Leather.</li>
            <li>Since then I checked back to see what was new and noticed that they had discontinued it already.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try Black Suede Leather after being familiar with the regular Black Suede scent (which my father has worn for years).  </li>

            <li> I would describe it as a delicate earthy male smell, and because of that, I would strong recommend Black Suede Leather.</li>
            <li> IT DOESNT LAST VERY LONG.  </li>
            <li> I have a tiny bit of the Black Leather that I don&#x27;t use because it is the last.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t confuse it with Avon&#x27;s Black Suede, a similar name but different fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just missing that slight real leather smell.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the regular &amp;#34;black suede&amp;#34;, that scent seems to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> He used to wear the Black Leather by Avon back when they sold it, without the Suede in the name.</li>
            <li> I had bought this cologne back in the late 90’s when AVON introduced it.  </li>
            <li> There is a Black Suede you can still get from Avon.</li>
            <li> This Black Suede Leather dosen&#x27;t have the leather smell like the original,closer to Suede.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight name change, but after reading the reviews, thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> There was another Black Suede version but not this one.  </li>
            <li> It goes limp after once hour.</li>
            <li> It’s too bad that AVON doesn’t give them a longer trial period for people to try it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find!!!!!</li>

            <li> I have a bottle of Black Suede Leather and would easily reorder another one.  It has an earthy muskiness that is not too overpowering.  What I like about it is that its earthy scent doesn&#x27;t reach out and grab you.  It&#x27;s there and there&#x27;s a muskiness about it that smells like a man but it doesn&#x27;t smell like you poured it all over yourself after you just took a shower.  I would describe it as a delicate earthy male smell, and because of that, I would strong recommend Black Suede Leather.</li>
            <li> Because the fragrance is masculine and smoothe.  Not overpowering.  Better than the other Black Suede Colognes. They/Avon, shouldnt have stopped selling it!</li>
            <li> Great scent but needs a lot more staying power. It goes limp after once hour.</li>
            <li> Hard to find!!!!! Great scent...</li>
            <li> Have purchased this for my husband several times and is my favorite!  I have to add eight more words-what a bother.</li>
            <li> There is a Black Suede you can still get from Avon.And Black Leather was something completly different,that you can&#x27;t get any more. I have a tiny bit of the Black Leather that I don&#x27;t use because it is the last. This Black Suede Leather dosen&#x27;t have the leather smell like the original,closer to Suede. But I like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He used to wear the Black Leather by Avon back when they sold it, without the Suede in the name. This is what he always wore when we first met. I have to say, this smell is what drew me to him. LOL. Anyhow, every since Avon stopped selling it, he&#x27;s had to buy other brands, and none of them smelled as great as the original Black leather. I was very surprised when I saw this here on Amazon. I noticed a slight name change, but after reading the reviews, thought I&#x27;d give it a try. And that&#x27;s where my three stars come in at. This is NOT the same as the original Black Leather. Does it smell good?  Yes, yes it does.  It&#x27;s just missing that slight real leather smell. Would I buy it again...right now, no. Only because as I&#x27;m writing this review, the price went up from that I paid for it...right now it&#x27;s selling for 25 plus 8 for S&amp;H. I mean, it does smell good, but I know of better ones for less. I&#x27;m going to be keeping an eye on Amazon though and if the price drops, then I&#x27;d get more.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast, but the scent of the cologne does not last long at all. I would recommend the regular &amp;#34;black suede&amp;#34;, that scent seems to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> The avon black suede lether waoo, My son love this perfume. This  is great product and I recommeded for all young men.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Black Suede Leather after being familiar with the regular Black Suede scent (which my father has worn for years).  I have to say, although I still enjoy the scent of Black Suede, I think I enjoy the Black Suede Leather a little more.</li>
            <li> WEAR IT DAILY AS A BODY SPRAY.  AS A COLOGNE IT DOESNT LAST VERY LONG.  SMELLS SO GOOD THOUGH, I EVEN SPRAY MY BED WITH IT</li>
            <li> Great colonge great price , last long on the skin and you get tons of compliments , add it to your shopping cart you cant go wrong ,great evening fragrance but you can pull it off in the day as well.</li>
            <li> I had bought this cologne back in the late 90’s when AVON introduced it.  It was a short run product back then and looks to be the same this time around as well.  The one in the 90’s was a harsher version to this one.  It still smelled good, but was stronger.  This one has a pleasant smell to it and lasts quite a while.  When I saw that AVON was re-introducing it I immediately bought one.  Since then I checked back to see what was new and noticed that they had discontinued it already.  It was nowhere on their site.  There was another Black Suede version but not this one.  So I went to Amazon and found someone on here that was selling it.  Found it at a great price and now have an extra bottle to last for a while.  It’s too bad that AVON doesn’t give them a longer trial period for people to try it.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of this cologne I have gotten for my husband.  It smells absolutely wonderful on him.  I have been tempted to order multiple bottles just in case they stop making it.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, it is not to strong.  Don&#x27;t confuse it with Avon&#x27;s Black Suede, a similar name but different fragrance. I</li>
            <li> i love this spray so much but the only thing about it when i bought it, i did not use it myself, i gave it as a gift to my pastor and he told me it was good</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, light, not overpowering. Worth the price</li>
            <li> I have always used this</li>
            <li> This is an old favorite of mine..Had to get it on AMAZON, because my avon rep no longer has it !!..WOMEN ALWAYS COMPLIMENT ME ON THIS FRAGRANCE !!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, somewhat strong scent that is somewhat sexy. I was hoping that it would have more of a leathery odor, but overall it is wearable.</li>
            <li> Avon Black Suede is a very good cologne and leaves you smelling like a man.  I highly recommend this cologne</li>
