    <ol>
            <li>It is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the best.  </li>
            <li>Excellent deal for this product.  </li>
            <li>Bravo just an excellent product-</li>
            <li>Excellent item as it greatly helped reduce razor burn.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>Bottom line:  a great shaving lubricant.</li>
            <li>Use as directed it will give you a great shave.</li>
            <li>Helps me get a great shave.</li>
            <li>You can use it with water or (remarkably, for shaving products) by itself.  </li>
            <li>If you have never used an oil, beware that you must wash your face with a good face cleaner after you shave to remove the residual oils, I use Kiehls, it works great for me.  </li>
            <li>Good product, great for using whilst travelling.</li>
            <li>I use more than recommended, and then follow with some astringent or Bump Patrol, a really great product after-shave liquid that worked great for me.</li>
            <li>have some good smell to it though - Menthol.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>amazing how it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third: It smells kind of like rancid olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also handy for travel.</li>
            <li>Shaving in the shower is absolutely the best if you can do it.  </li>
            <li>I wish King of Shaves had decent distribution in the US, because all their products are superb -- but the shave oil is my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product quick ship</li>
            <li>, this is the best shave oil I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>King of Shaves shaving oil is the best product I have yet found for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It used to be available at Bed and Bath, but not anymore, so he was delighted to be able to stock up on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It comes from England and has oils in thed preparation that stop cuts and make a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe more people haven&#x27;t discovered this oil.  </li>
            <li>Way more than a can of Barbasol or Edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>MUCH better than $7 individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff… been using it for years</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Was surprised at the great price.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I find it better to use a wash cloth to remove all but light moisture before applying the oil.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously, you&#x27;ll get the smoothest shave in the shower and in combination with a fresh blade and a nice gel or cream.  </li>
            <li>Makes for easy shaves, no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I have tried them all, gels, creams, and other oils from the best available.  </li>
            <li>But this is clearly and without doubt the best product on the market for me: highly recommended.</li>
            <li>smooth, easy, comfortable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light oil that works well and doesn&#x27;t feel like you just smeared motor oil all over your face.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I keep coming back to KOS, its really the best available.  </li>
            <li>It just takes 4 or 5 drops rubbed into the skin for each shave, and results in a relatively smooth and comfortable shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>Very economical way to purchase these.</li>
            <li>The original Burma Shave was before my time, but I think most of the jingles could be applied to this product ;)</li>
            <li>while this is true</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, especially if you are using a safety or straight razor.</li>
            <li>It is smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much better experiences shaving with just plain soap, to be honest.</li>
            <li>Very TSA friendly.</li>
            <li>you might see KOS offers a bit larger bottle of a hybrid type oil, I have not had nearly as good of success with the hybrid.</li>
            <li>I first found this product while traveling in OZ 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>Sure wish I had only bought one instead of the 6 pack.  </li>
            <li>Regular soap provides a much better lubricant/shave than this.</li>
            <li>Absolutely protects against razor burn-- period!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars just because I always hope for something even better to come along in future</li>
            <li>I was truly happy to find this somewhat expensive oil that makes shaving so easy.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it comes in these tiny bottles makes it easy to pack, and don&#x27;t be fooled:  you get a lot of shaves from each bottle.  </li>
            <li>Works really well for me as a pre-shave oil.</li>
            <li>I receive a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Was expecting a better version of &amp;#34;shave secret&amp;#34;, but this product is extremely inferior.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s so small is a nice bonus for travel.</li>
            <li>I got 6 bottles for a little more than $20.  </li>
            <li>-- I have very sensitive skin and even after 30 years of shaving it can still get irritated sometimes.  </li>
            <li>Shaving different directions, electric razor, straight razor, brush, shaving in the shower, etc.  </li>
            <li>The oil makes your beard whiskers stand up for a closer shave, along with the sensitive skin formula to minimize burns and allergic skin reactions.</li>
            <li>I pulled the blades out and they were completely clogged.</li>
            <li>The bottles were smaller than I thought and the product seemed thinner than other shaving oils, requiring more product use for similar results.</li>
            <li>Also they recommend you to wet your face first...</li>
            <li>I normally apply it prior to foam shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Previously my husband burst the first one trying to squeeze contents out of a hole that didn&#x27;t exist!</li>
            <li>Unfortunate, good product but will take our business elsewhere next time..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth: There&#x27;s barely any menthol in it.</li>
            <li>But for travel, the oil does a decent job all by itself, on a wet face at the motel sink.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I first came across this product 10 years ago and it was then, and has remained, the one that causes me least skin irritation or problems.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying it on Amazon as long as it&#x27;s around.  </li>
            <li> After using the product, I find that it is not any better than the less expensive oils I have used.</li>
            <li> One bottle goes a long way and you don&#x27;t have to worry about aerosoles!  </li>
            <li> I was using shave secret for quite some time, while it worked very well with or without shaving cream it always seemed to clog up my Feather de razor.</li>
            <li> Your going to think just a few drops cannot possibly be enough, trust the directions, its plenty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the process of trying to make it work, I wasted an entire bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a wide variety of shaving gels, foams and oils over the years  </li>
            <li> Guys with thick beards and sensitive and/or contoured skin.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the oil - he needs very little oil for his entire face, so the six pack lasts him well over a year...</li>
            <li> the small tube claims to last for 100 shaves</li>
            <li> He tried then to inform them they had a problem with manufacturing, basically they were not interested.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy who cuts or gets, bumps or has to a thick beard on a daily basis, try this oil.  </li>
            <li> One little bottle lasts for months.  </li>
            <li> I noticed after few shaves I was not being shaved at all.</li>
            <li> No more nicks of scrapes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the hype is all about.</li>
            <li> As with a previous review, I was unable to get any oil from the package due to a faulty tip.</li>
            <li> scrub your face, rub in 4 drops of KOS, let chill for about a minute, apply gel (or what ever), shave, splash on a little water for another pass, rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to Shave Secret and this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thin and smells funky when used with an electric.</li>
            <li> product is received was really bad quality, there is no viscosity in the oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fifth: Terribly insufficient for shaving anything longer than a 5&#x27;o clock shadow.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping. It&#x27;s a light oil that works well and doesn&#x27;t feel like you just smeared motor oil all over your face. helps reduce cuts and makes for an easier shave!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I first found this product while traveling in OZ 4 years ago. It is FANTASTIC!&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding for travel- the small tube claims to last for 100 shaves and I have no reason to argue. Now on my third bottle, use it for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how it works.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the oil - he needs very little oil for his entire face, so the six pack lasts him well over a year...</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to Shave Secret and this isn&#x27;t it.  It&#x27;s too thin and smells funky when used with an electric.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for a couple years and loves it. It used to be available at Bed and Bath, but not anymore, so he was delighted to be able to stock up on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Was surprised at the great price. Excellent item as it greatly helped reduce razor burn. If you have sensitive skin this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe more people haven&#x27;t discovered this oil.  It is wonderful.  I like the menthol but wish I could get the regular also.</li>
            <li> Guys with thick beards and sensitive and/or contoured skin. this product is a must-try.  I tried every method I could think of.  Shaving different directions, electric razor, straight razor, brush, shaving in the shower, etc.  All wound up with similar results.  Finally discovered this stuff at a local pharmacy which stopped carrying it.  I&#x27;ll be buying it on Amazon as long as it&#x27;s around.  If you&#x27;re a guy who cuts or gets, bumps or has to a thick beard on a daily basis, try this oil.  I use more than recommended, and then follow with some astringent or Bump Patrol, a really great product after-shave liquid that worked great for me.</li>
            <li> For starters, one of my bottles had a tiny hole in it, and it leaked oil everywhere in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: the stuff is blue, and it stains. Be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third: It smells kind of like rancid olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth: There&#x27;s barely any menthol in it. Almost no cooling sensation, and definitely no aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth: Terribly insufficient for shaving anything longer than a 5&#x27;o clock shadow. I&#x27;ve had much better experiences shaving with just plain soap, to be honest.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  I wish King of Shaves had decent distribution in the US, because all their products are superb -- but the shave oil is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this stuff alone or as a &amp;#34;first layer&amp;#34; under shaving gel.  You can use it with water or (remarkably, for shaving products) by itself.  And no matter how you use it, the stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, you&#x27;ll get the smoothest shave in the shower and in combination with a fresh blade and a nice gel or cream.  But for travel, the oil does a decent job all by itself, on a wet face at the motel sink.  Some people even use it when camping in the woods. The fact that it comes in these tiny bottles makes it easy to pack, and don&#x27;t be fooled:  you get a lot of shaves from each bottle.  Way more than a can of Barbasol or Edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rambling.  Bottom line:  a great shaving lubricant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m regular user of Dermalogica Close shave oil.&lt;br /&gt;For a change, I decided to switch to King of Shaves.&lt;br /&gt;The product is received was really bad quality, there is no viscosity in the oil. It runs like water.&lt;br /&gt;Does have some good smell to it though - Menthol.&lt;br /&gt;But if you are like me, and shave only wiht oil and no cream, then this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;You would end up with nicks and cuts regularly.&lt;br /&gt;I will find out if there is an option to return</li>
            <li> If you do not use shave oil in your routine, you should.  Shaves are smoother and closer with almost no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I was using shave secret for quite some time, while it worked very well with or without shaving cream it always seemed to clog up my Feather de razor. This product is a bit thinner but does just as well of a job without clogging up the razor. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using King of Shaves for years.  No more nicks of scrapes.  Leaves my skin smooth and refreshed. Also handy for travel.</li>
            <li> Excellent deal for this product.  I got 6 bottles for a little more than $20.  MUCH better than $7 individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, this is the best shave oil I&#x27;ve tried so far.  Works really well for me as a pre-shave oil.</li>
            <li> Sure wish I had only bought one instead of the 6 pack.  Was expecting a better version of &amp;#34;shave secret&amp;#34;, but this product is extremely inferior.  Regular soap provides a much better lubricant/shave than this.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all, gels, creams, and other oils from the best available.  I keep coming back to KOS, its really the best available.  If you have never used an oil, beware that you must wash your face with a good face cleaner after you shave to remove the residual oils, I use Kiehls, it works great for me.  Also they recommend you to wet your face first... while this is true I find it better to use a wash cloth to remove all but light moisture before applying the oil.  Shaving in the shower is absolutely the best if you can do it.  Your going to think just a few drops cannot possibly be enough, trust the directions, its plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also you might see KOS offers a bit larger bottle of a hybrid type oil, I have not had nearly as good of success with the hybrid.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, especially if you are using a safety or straight razor. I normally apply it prior to foam shaving cream. The original Burma Shave was before my time, but I think most of the jingles could be applied to this product ;)</li>
            <li> I was truly happy to find this somewhat expensive oil that makes shaving so easy.  I have been using it for years and was on my last bottle.  It comes from England and has oils in thed preparation that stop cuts and make a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> As with a previous review, I was unable to get any oil from the package due to a faulty tip. In the process of trying to make it work, I wasted an entire bottle. After using the product, I find that it is not any better than the less expensive oils I have used. I&#x27;m not sure what the hype is all about.</li>
            <li> Absolutely protects against razor burn-- period!</li>
            <li> Bravo just an excellent product- I have given up shaving cream. Use as directed it will give you a great shave.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff… been using it for years and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever cut myself shaving while using the oil. The fact that it&#x27;s so small is a nice bonus for travel.</li>
            <li> Helps me get a great shave.</li>
            <li> scrub your face, rub in 4 drops of KOS, let chill for about a minute, apply gel (or what ever), shave, splash on a little water for another pass, rinse with cold water. smooth, easy, comfortable</li>
            <li> I was looking for the shaving serum, not the oil but I thought I&#x27;d try the oil instead. The bottles were smaller than I thought and the product seemed thinner than other shaving oils, requiring more product use for similar results. I will not be reordering this product.</li>
            <li> Great product quick ship</li>
            <li> No opening in the bottle! Previously my husband burst the first one trying to squeeze contents out of a hole that didn&#x27;t exist! He tried then to inform them they had a problem with manufacturing, basically they were not interested. Obviously problem still has not been resolved. Unfortunate, good product but will take our business elsewhere next time..</li>
            <li> Having shaving oil in your dopp kit when traveling saves room in your TSA 1 quart bag! One bottle goes a long way and you don&#x27;t have to worry about aerosoles!  The oil makes your beard whiskers stand up for a closer shave, along with the sensitive skin formula to minimize burns and allergic skin reactions.</li>
            <li> I love the product. I receive a very close shave. It is smells fresh. The biggest problem is that it gums up the razor. I noticed after few shaves I was not being shaved at all. I pulled the blades out and they were completely clogged.</li>
            <li> Makes for easy shaves, no irritation.  One little bottle lasts for months.  3 drops per shave does it.  Very TSA friendly.</li>
            <li> King of Shaves shaving oil is the best product I have yet found for my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve tried a wide variety of shaving gels, foams and oils over the years  I first came across this product 10 years ago and it was then, and has remained, the one that causes me least skin irritation or problems.  It just takes 4 or 5 drops rubbed into the skin for each shave, and results in a relatively smooth and comfortable shaving experience.  I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars just because I always hope for something even better to come along in future -- I have very sensitive skin and even after 30 years of shaving it can still get irritated sometimes.  But this is clearly and without doubt the best product on the market for me: highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Using this pre-shave eases the shaving and gives a smooth shave without unnecessary nicks</li>
            <li> Good product, great for using whilst travelling.</li>
            <li> Very economical way to purchase these.</li>
