            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve received the product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen great result on the firming side because I haven&#x27;t tested for long, but hoping it will reduce the fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the serum is very gel like, and spreads very easily.</li>
            <li>It is super gentle and makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this serum 5 times now, it has no scent, dries quickly and helps to plump fine lines immediately.</li>
            <li>I use a gentle sent free lotion after it dries ( a cheap one :) ) and it leaves my skin super smooth .</li>
            <li>and  it  absorbed  easily  </li>
            <li>It is super light.</li>

            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling like some serums do .</li>
            <li>it does have some hyaluronate in it like many other popular products at the moment.</li>
            <li>Considering its light consistency, it is a pretty moisturizing serum.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and Not Heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>My face is normally very dry and now my face and neck feel better and has more of a glow.</li>
            <li>and  my face really felt smooth .after</li>
            <li>I look all fresh all day without worrying of putting powder  to avoid shining face .1st</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with it .</li>
            <li>so I think it is worth trying it out .</li>
            <li>The opinions above are my own..</li>
            <li>I also love it because it is made of 98% natural ingredients out of 100%.</li>
            <li>&amp; i got this for free, &amp; will definitely using it more.</li>
            <li>So silky smooth, it&#x27;s  lightly firming, non-greasy, clear formula.  </li>
            <li>she donâ€™t use toner she only apply Art Naturals after warm wash of her face</li>
            <li>This facial moisturizing serum is very light weight</li>
            <li>I did exactly as said</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any difference in the line, but I&#x27;m just happy it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and break me out.</li>
            <li>And to my surprise after one week of using it I can really see the improvement on my skin!</li>
            <li>One pump gives you more than enough if you will put it on your face.</li>
            <li>First  </li>
            <li>so I am spot testing this first.</li>
            <li>i guess it is because her face need to absorb it first.</li>
            <li>This cute little bottle arrived packaged securely on my doorstep today.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soon to &amp;#34;tell&amp;#34; a major difference, but it feels good going on, my skin feels more hydrated, but not oily and a little bit seems to go a long way.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for opportunity to try your product</li>
            <li>My skin is usually very picky about what I can use to moisturize it.</li>
            <li>Product was very Well wrapped and packaged..</li>
            <li>i applied it very sparingly on my Face.</li>
            <li>really like it</li>
            <li>practically came to life,and after day 5 my face looks so much better,younger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m recommending this product to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy this product and add it to my collection of beauty products that I use every day because this serum really works well,that&#x27;s a fact.</li>
            <li>/&gt;very make up ready...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t itch as much</li>
            <li>I tried it and really like it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but it did feel liks it tighten skin really fast too and with moisturizing.</li>
            <li>tried it the first day it came in the mail,my face is very dry and with fine lines,so when I smoothed on the serum</li>
            <li>I usually apply in my face at night &amp; when i woke up in the morning the result was amazing feeling my skin glow.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already starting to see some mild changes or improvements.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Happy I got this item at discounted price.</li>
            <li>I massage it a little to let it absorb more.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about the lack of &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; on the bottle, but you would be able to tell if it had ever been used or messed with.</li>
            <li>So far, it really is leaving my arm feeling softer, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 1 Hour (and No negative effects on my Skin)</li>
            <li>The smell was just OK in my opinion, a Little old ladyish..</li>
            <li>The packaging was simple, yet inviting in the sense that it holds purely organic materials which upholds it&#x27;s promotion of natural, clean ingredients to the highest standard.</li>
            <li>I totally got this item for free and it actually works....</li>
            <li>I have this super dry part and itchy too on my calf.</li>
            <li>or else I would have a super dry and flaky patch on my leg.</li>
            <li>This serum is not very thick like some other facial serums, it is easy to apply and blend in very well.</li>
            <li>I like that it is made from natural and organic ingredients .</li>
            <li>I am a fan of ArtNaturals because of the organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have noticed if I stick with organic and natural ingredients my face doesn&#x27;t get as irritated.</li>
            <li>So far my face seems smoother.</li>
            <li>The product is made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I apply both morning and night and it leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>My hand is so soft where I put it on.</li>
            <li>I am 35 years old, combination skin,&lt;br /&gt;medium</li>
            <li>skin will feel so soft and&lt;br</li>
            <li>This serum  is natural  (98%) and  </li>
            <li>No cracking or peeling action.  </li>
            <li>So far, can&#x27;t detect any change in how my skin feels or looks.</li>
            <li>am quite sensitive to lotions</li>
            <li>My skin over all feels lovely and after only few days</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said I truly think this product is worth the price and even though I received a discount on this item to review it, I would purchase and use it again once this tube is empty.</li>
            <li>I decided to test it on one hand to see the difference, and instantly I can tell a difference without my everyday lotion on top as it suggests to do.</li>
            <li>, my oily T zone looks less oily and the dry area looks more glowy.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at the high quality of these items at such an affordable rate.  </li>
            <li>I love that this serum comes in a pump, it helps to keep the active ingredients active and not oxidized into nothingness.</li>
            <li>It sinks into the skin quickly and &#x27;plumps&#x27; instantly.</li>
            <li>she has a bit of sensitive skin and has never used face moisturizer on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I love that the consistency is thin.</li>
            <li>Organic natural ingredients will help skin to improve over the long run.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get the pump working the first time, and when I did, it squirted out a heavy amount</li>
            <li>This is just a small bottle but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>we live in California where the air is very dry.  </li>
            <li>It is a pretty thin clear serum with an unoffensive citrusy natural type smell.</li>

            <li> So far I am pleased with it .</li>

            <li> The opinions above are my own..</li>
            <li> I also love it because it is made of 98% natural ingredients out of 100%.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any difference in the line, but I&#x27;m just happy it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and break me out.</li>
            <li> And to my surprise after one week of using it I can really see the improvement on my skin!</li>
            <li> One pump gives you more than enough if you will put it on your face.</li>
            <li> First  </li>
            <li> so I am spot testing this first.</li>
            <li> i guess it is because her face need to absorb it first.</li>
            <li> This cute little bottle arrived packaged securely on my doorstep today.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to &amp;#34;tell&amp;#34; a major difference, but it feels good going on, my skin feels more hydrated, but not oily and a little bit seems to go a long way.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for opportunity to try your product</li>
            <li> My skin is usually very picky about what I can use to moisturize it.</li>
            <li> Product was very Well wrapped and packaged..</li>
            <li> i applied it very sparingly on my Face.</li>

            <li> I usually apply in my face at night &amp; when i woke up in the morning the result was amazing feeling my skin glow.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already starting to see some mild changes or improvements.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Happy I got this item at discounted price.</li>
            <li> I massage it a little to let it absorb more.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about the lack of &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; on the bottle, but you would be able to tell if it had ever been used or messed with.</li>
            <li> So far, it really is leaving my arm feeling softer, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 1 Hour (and No negative effects on my Skin)</li>
            <li> The smell was just OK in my opinion, a Little old ladyish..</li>
            <li> The packaging was simple, yet inviting in the sense that it holds purely organic materials which upholds it&#x27;s promotion of natural, clean ingredients to the highest standard.</li>
            <li> I totally got this item for free and it actually works....</li>
            <li> I have this super dry part and itchy too on my calf.</li>
            <li> or else I would have a super dry and flaky patch on my leg.</li>
            <li> This serum is not very thick like some other facial serums, it is easy to apply and blend in very well.</li>
            <li> I like that it is made from natural and organic ingredients .</li>
            <li> I am a fan of ArtNaturals because of the organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have noticed if I stick with organic and natural ingredients my face doesn&#x27;t get as irritated.</li>
            <li> So far my face seems smoother.</li>
            <li> The product is made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I apply both morning and night and it leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> My hand is so soft where I put it on.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old, combination skin,&lt;br /&gt;medium</li>
            <li> skin will feel so soft and&lt;br</li>
            <li> This serum  is natural  (98%) and  </li>
            <li> No cracking or peeling action.  </li>
            <li> So far, can&#x27;t detect any change in how my skin feels or looks.</li>
            <li> am quite sensitive to lotions</li>
            <li> My skin over all feels lovely and after only few days</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said I truly think this product is worth the price and even though I received a discount on this item to review it, I would purchase and use it again once this tube is empty.</li>
            <li> I decided to test it on one hand to see the difference, and instantly I can tell a difference without my everyday lotion on top as it suggests to do.</li>
            <li> , my oily T zone looks less oily and the dry area looks more glowy.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the high quality of these items at such an affordable rate.  </li>
            <li> I love that this serum comes in a pump, it helps to keep the active ingredients active and not oxidized into nothingness.</li>
            <li> It sinks into the skin quickly and &#x27;plumps&#x27; instantly.</li>
            <li> she has a bit of sensitive skin and has never used face moisturizer on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I love that the consistency is thin.</li>
            <li> Organic natural ingredients will help skin to improve over the long run.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the pump working the first time, and when I did, it squirted out a heavy amount</li>
            <li> This is just a small bottle but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> we live in California where the air is very dry.  </li>
            <li> It is a pretty thin clear serum with an unoffensive citrusy natural type smell.</li>
            <li> a itty bitty Tiny amount goes a Long way.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t want to pick up a product and see all of these long chemical names I can&#x27;t read.</li>
            <li> the bottle is small but you really only need a pump or two for your entire face so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> and when I use it my skin easy absurd the serum and didn&#x27;t have a sticky feeling unlike other serum I&#x27;d used before.</li>
            <li> I use it for my dry skin for my feet.</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally dry</li>
            <li> It does not make my skin dry because it does not contain alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> Her skin is dry that makes it flaky overtime and because sheâ€™s no longer teenager</li>
            <li> then her SPF, she let it dry for a bit before applying SPF since it is kinds sticky</li>
            <li> but afterwards it is dry</li>
            <li> It worked well on the dry areas of my face.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and doesnt feel tacky, smooths out small dry spots on the skin, it has a therapeutic effect on application; at least for me it did.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this serum, I would just use a moisturizer and within an hour or so, my face would feel tight and dry again -</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Anyways, it felt very moist and thin and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> I can see this as a gift for a few friends for birthdays and other holidays, its a bit too feminine for a male to use in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bothered me about this product is that it is so small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly I do that with all my serums,&lt;br /&gt;stretch marks and other areas of the body...</li>
            <li> I use my other artnaturals products at this time as well</li>
            <li> This what Im looking for that I dont found in my previous moisturizer I tried.</li>
            <li> It smells slightly of citrus.  </li>
            <li> This product did have a odd smell</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my skin look firmer and lines look less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My skin no longer feels tight.  </li>
            <li> Con: received the package with cracks on lid and a little spill.</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy on the skin .</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy or too tacky after application.</li>
            <li> it smells like a green tea with a touch of something.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t like heavy creams on my face</li>
            <li> The direction says use after shower,apply a thin layer over the desired area ,allow to dry and then apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Although this serum is usually used on our faces, I decided to use this on my leg.</li>
            <li> If you are not satisfied with it they will give you a  100% refund.</li>
            <li> The product is very thin and a bit runny, but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> My only qualm was that I was totally shocked by how small the bottle was.  </li>
            <li> This serum moisturizes my skin without irritating it or causing any acne.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am a fan of ArtNaturals because of the organic and natural ingredients. I have to be careful of what I use on my skin because it is so sensitive. I have noticed if I stick with organic and natural ingredients my face doesn&#x27;t get as irritated. I just started using this product and the first thing I noticed was the pleasant smell. I stated using it on my fine lines, but I read a review where someone used it on their spider veins. I going to actually give that a try and I&#x27;ll post an update if it works. So far my face seems smoother. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any difference in the line, but I&#x27;m just happy it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and break me out.</li>
            <li> This product I have fallen in love with.  My skin over all feels lovely and after only few days I my self  feel like my skin has rewinded to age 24.  The good ol days.  Thanks for opportunity to try your product</li>
            <li> I love that this serum comes in a pump, it helps to keep the active ingredients active and not oxidized into nothingness. I&#x27;ve used this serum 5 times now, it has no scent, dries quickly and helps to plump fine lines immediately. This is one of those products that you need to use it for 6-8 weeks to see true results but I am pretty happy with what I have seen going on with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said I truly think this product is worth the price and even though I received a discount on this item to review it, I would purchase and use it again once this tube is empty.</li>
            <li> I have many products by ArtNaturals and this one is reliably great like the others!  I am surprised at the high quality of these items at such an affordable rate.  It&#x27;s too soon to &amp;#34;tell&amp;#34; a major difference, but it feels good going on, my skin feels more hydrated, but not oily and a little bit seems to go a long way.  Overall, I say its a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I read about Hyaluronic Acid and how it can help the skin. I got to try this product out at a reduced cost for my unbiased opinion. The product is made with all natural ingredients. This is the thing I like the most. i don&#x27;t want to pick up a product and see all of these long chemical names I can&#x27;t read. This product goes on light and makes your skin feel softer.  My skin would be considered oily but this did not make it any more oily and that&#x27;s a good thing. I&#x27;ll see what results I get over the coming weeks.</li>
            <li> Great item with smooth texture! My skin feels tighter and wrinkles are diminishing Works for me, no break outs, Not a miracle cure, but it does seem to improve the texture of my skin. Con: received the package with cracks on lid and a little spill. (perhaps it&#x27;s smashed or damaged during transit)</li>
            <li> This product has a strong geranium scent, you must love geraniums! It dries quickly and doesnt feel tacky, smooths out small dry spots on the skin, it has a therapeutic effect on application; at least for me it did. I can see this as a gift for a few friends for birthdays and other holidays, its a bit too feminine for a male to use in my opinion. I&#x27;ll continue use of the product to see if the results can be layered getting better with each application. As a product reviewer and getting products as a discount, I maintain honest feedback about the items. The product doesnt feel or present itself as luxurious,however,  it does have some hyaluronate in it like many other popular products at the moment. 3 stars is my fair assessment.</li>
            <li> My skin is usually very picky about what I can use to moisturize it. This serum moisturizes my skin without irritating it or causing any acne. Considering its light consistency, it is a pretty moisturizing serum. I apply both morning and night and it leaves my skin soft and supple. I&#x27;m also noticing the great affects of the vitamin E start to even out my skin tone!</li>
            <li> I ordered yesterday and it got here this Morning! Lightning fast!&lt;br /&gt;The Product was very Well wrapped and packaged..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened it and Applied a TINY amount to the back of my Hand, before applying it to my Face. I just started to pamper my Skin, i am 30+ and Not getting any Younger... Anyways, it felt very moist and thin and not at all greasy. The smell was just OK in my opinion, a Little old ladyish..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 Hour (and No negative effects on my Skin) i applied it very sparingly on my Face. a itty bitty Tiny amount goes a Long way. It is very smooth and Not Heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;i really like it and Even My husband Said that i Look refreshed like after a Visit from the SPA, HAH ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: i received this Product for a Discount in Exchange of my honest and unbiased Review</li>
            <li> I love how this product feels on my skin. It is super gentle and makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> The main thing I love about this product is the smell. It has this really nice citrusy smell which I completely love. I decided to test it on one hand to see the difference, and instantly I can tell a difference without my everyday lotion on top as it suggests to do. With my lotion, it is even better! My hand is so soft where I put it on. So far, I am really loving it! On the bottle, it says that it can be applied under my make up which I am looking forward to seeing how well it works.</li>
            <li> Nice product, it feels good on my face and I&#x27;m already starting to see some mild changes or improvements.  My skin feels nice and I&#x27;m noticing some of the blemishes lighten and I&#x27;m hoping it will remove some of them.  I don&#x27;t have a ton, but I&#x27;m starting to notice them, so it&#x27;s time to start doing something about them.  My only qualm was that I was totally shocked by how small the bottle was.  I guess I should have paid more attention to that in the listing, however I&#x27;m happy with the product and was glad that I could get it as part of on of their product launch promotions.</li>
            <li> I am going to give this item 4 stars because in my honest opinion the serum is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it the first day it came in the mail,my face is very dry and with fine lines,so when I smoothed on the serum and I put my favorite moisturizer on my face practically came to life,and after day 5 my face looks so much better,younger.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m recommending this product to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy this product and add it to my collection of beauty products that I use every day because this serum really works well,that&#x27;s a fact.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe how amazing this serum is... I use it after showering and it does wonders. My skin is naturally dry and once I use this my skin feels fresh and silky smooth. It also feels smooth.  The only thing that bothered me about this product is that it is so small. This serum does not burn your skin or anything. I have used it on my face, neck, and upper and lower extremities. I definitely recommend this. I am so glad i came across this product on my reviewers list, so I got a good discount.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old, combination skin,&lt;br /&gt;medium tone, with sunspots, slight&lt;br /&gt;melisma, and some scarring....&lt;br /&gt;I want to say that since I have been&lt;br /&gt;using hyaluronic acid and vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;serums, my skin has gotten so much&lt;br /&gt;better!!! If you are not using these type&lt;br /&gt;of serums, please start...they are&lt;br /&gt;so beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;This one by Artnaturals, does not disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;I love the way that the package says&lt;br /&gt;you can apply it any where...&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I do that with all my serums,&lt;br /&gt;stretch marks and other areas of the body...&lt;br /&gt;This serum goes on easily&lt;br /&gt;and soaks into the skin well.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will feel so soft and&lt;br /&gt;hydrated after one use.... I don&#x27;t even use&lt;br /&gt;primers anymore, this makes your skin&lt;br /&gt;very make up ready...&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this item, for testing&lt;br /&gt;purposes...The opinions above are my own..</li>
            <li> Although this serum is usually used on our faces, I decided to use this on my leg. I have this super dry part and itchy too on my calf. It says on the bottle that I received that you can apply it over the desired area. I applied it every after shower so that would be in the morning and before I go to bed. I massage it a little to let it absorb more. And to my surprise after one week of using it I can really see the improvement on my skin! It doesn&#x27;t itch as much and it&#x27;s not flaky anymore. I used to have to put lotion on it every 3 hours or else I would have a super dry and flaky patch on my leg. I will continue to use it there until it&#x27;s healed hopefully soon. I love that the consistency is thin. It makes it easy to spread and massaged for better absorption. It kind of smell like glue. One pump gives you more than enough if you will put it on your face. Perfect for face and neck. I was lucky to be able to purchase it for a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizing serum is very light weight and it work great for summer! I tried it and really like it. This serum is not very thick like some other facial serums, it is easy to apply and blend in very well. It does not feel heavy or too tacky after application. I use it before daliy lotion and after I apply facial toner. It does not make my skin dry because it does not contain alcohol in it. I also love it because it is made of 98% natural ingredients out of 100%. 72% is organic. Organic natural ingredients will help skin to improve over the long run. I feel that my skin is hydrated after using it, my oily T zone looks less oily and the dry area looks more glowy. I haven&#x27;t seen great result on the firming side because I haven&#x27;t tested for long, but hoping it will reduce the fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> i gave my mother this as a gift recently.  she has a bit of sensitive skin and has never used face moisturizer on a daily basis. she loves the fact that it is not greasy and can use it every day without reacting to it.</li>
            <li> This serum  is natural  (98%) and  Organic  (72%).  First  of  all  this  serum  is light  and  it  absorbed  easily  and  quickly.  This  is  important  to me because I wear makeup  over it and it lays well. I also prefer  pumps  over  droppers  so that  is a plus. The scent  is  okay  just  okay. But in terms  of my  skin it looks fresh and bright and I have  decided  to continue  using  this  product  to see what happens. I received  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review.</li>
            <li> The item itself is VERY tiny, similar to the size of travel bottles. The packaging was simple, yet inviting in the sense that it holds purely organic materials which upholds it&#x27;s promotion of natural, clean ingredients to the highest standard. I couldn&#x27;t get the pump working the first time, and when I did, it squirted out a heavy amount and I had to wipe the leftover with a towel. The consistency of the serum is very gel like, and spreads very easily. However, after a couple seconds you will begin feeling the serum turn into a sticky film on your face, which is why they probably recommend topping it off with your personal moisturizer. It was a sticky feel for 5-7 minutes, but as soon as it dries, your face is VERY smooth. I am pleased with the results but not the smell.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it helps my skin moisturize. I usually apply in my face at night &amp; when i woke up in the morning the result was amazing feeling my skin glow. &amp; i got this for free, &amp; will definitely using it more.</li>
            <li> At a sample deal price I tested this hyaluronic serum and wow, I&#x27;m impressed.  So silky smooth, it&#x27;s  lightly firming, non-greasy, clear formula.  I put it on last night and this morning my skin feels  moisturized still.  No cracking or peeling action.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Received item free via promotion. Have used it for a week. So far, can&#x27;t detect any change in how my skin feels or looks. Rating is 1 for now, will update if this changes.</li>
            <li> This serum is really nice . It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling like some serums do . I use a gentle sent free lotion after it dries ( a cheap one :) ) and it leaves my skin super smooth . I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! My face feels so healthy and moisterized! Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and while I do not notice a difference in my wrinkles, I do feel a difference in the dryness of my face.  Prior to using this serum, I would just use a moisturizer and within an hour or so, my face would feel tight and dry again - we live in California where the air is very dry.  I started using this item prior to applying my moisturizer and it makes all the difference.  My skin no longer feels tight.  The product is very thin and a bit runny, but a little goes a long way so I expect the bottle will last quite some time.  Once applied - my skin feels softer and the moisturizer appears to absorb at a much better rate.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:a9f316c44b3f4685badb5b8db97e4b99]]++ Great smelling, easily absorbed product that comes with a nice-sized bottle ++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that this is the kind of product that I&#x27;ll have to use for a week or so to figure out if it&#x27;s working, so I&#x27;ll give you my impressions of the product.  It&#x27;s a gel-like product that is probably the consistency of Eucerin.  It spreads on quite easily and pleasantly.  It smells slightly of citrus.  So far, it really is leaving my arm feeling softer, so I hope THAT keeps going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more details, please see my attached video&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this serum, allowing me to offer my honest and unbiased opinion.  I hope it helped!</li>
            <li> This cute little bottle arrived packaged securely on my doorstep today. I was a little nervous about the lack of &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; on the bottle, but you would be able to tell if it had ever been used or messed with. I like this type of pump bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I am quite sensitive to lotions so I am spot testing this first. It is a pretty thin clear serum with an unoffensive citrusy natural type smell. It sinks into the skin quickly and &#x27;plumps&#x27; instantly. I was in the market for a hydrating moisturizer so I am looking forward to using this.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing: the bottle is small but you really only need a pump or two for your entire face so it should last a long time. You can&#x27;t beat the price point, too.</li>
            <li> I got Art naturals moisturizer serum on a discount price in exchange of my unbiased and honest opinion after test review. My sister is using Art Naturals for a week now. Her skin is dry that makes it flaky overtime and because sheâ€™s no longer teenager she needs a moisturizer that could accommodates her needs. she donâ€™t use toner she only apply Art Naturals after warm wash of her face then her SPF, she let it dry for a bit before applying SPF since it is kinds sticky but afterwards it is dry i guess it is because her face need to absorb it first. She love the moisturizer but she didnâ€™t like the smell. it smells like a green tea with a touch of something. but it is a good product her face stays moisture all day.</li>
            <li> This product did have a odd smell but it did feel liks it tighten skin really fast too and with moisturizing. It is super light. It comes in a nice bottle with good pump. Disclaimer i did receive this product free for review but that had no effect on my review.</li>
            <li> works great! received it quickly!</li>
            <li> I received this moisturizer for free as part of a promotion. It worked well on the dry areas of my face. Great to apply under make up.</li>
            <li> Got my art naturals hyaluronic acid and use it... I like that it doesn&#x27;t have chemical in it and when I use it my skin easy absurd the serum and didn&#x27;t have a sticky feeling unlike other serum I&#x27;d used before. I used it on my face and my skin feel so smooth when I use this. It&#x27;s really good products I&#x27;ll recommend it to my friends ..</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this heals it. I jump out of the show and while I&#x27;m moisturizing my body I throw some pro moisturizing serum on my face I use my other artnaturals products at this time as well then I do my makeup if wanted. The ingredients are easy to know and the smell is not annoying like some ive tried before.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve received the product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Will order again and again.  Feels amazing and wonderful results</li>
            <li> This is just a small bottle but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin type. So I don&#x27;t like heavy creams on my face but this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to worry about having breakouts. The serum is non greasy easy to absorb by the skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> This formula is rich and feels great as it goes on. It helps fight the signs of stress and fine lines. Which I can see it working daily.It&#x27;s good for all skin types. If you are not satisfied with it they will give you a  100% refund.I like how it makes my skin look firmer and lines look less noticeable.My face is normally very dry and now my face and neck feel better and has more of a glow.I DID RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
