            <li>They make really good products</li>
            <li>Good for travel though as not too bulky.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Kind of reminds me of the shampoos we use to get in the &#x27;olden days&#x27; that stripped off any product you had put in your hair like cream rinse - ha!  :-)</li>
            <li>This smells really nice</li>
            <li>Perfect cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have used Yes to Carrots facial and body products and was pleased (but not the best I ever used)</li>
            <li>Love the scent -  </li>
            <li>A smooth an d nice daycream who not irreteted my skin.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>but itÂ´s give the skin a healthy look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also, love</li>
            <li>I will use this product until I find a better one.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel very clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent does not linger, though I think it would be nice to have the fresh cucumber fragrance around for a while.</li>
            <li>It only takes a tiny amount to get a great silky lather with a wonderful light cucumber</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gel, I guess I didn&#x27;t read the fine print.</li>
            <li>First off, this is a very light and clean smelling product which is why I really love it.</li>
            <li>I can already tell a huge difference in my face</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;The fresh scent of cucumbers, with the ability to remove my makeup, including waterproof mascara, has won my heart.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling so smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light</li>
            <li>I also like the light cucumber scent which doesn&#x27;t linger and doesn&#x27;t make me smell perfumed.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It is kind of slimy and doesn&#x27;t really foam up or anything.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, keeps my skin clear, and is free of harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>This cucumber cleanser is nice, and does an especially wonderful job of removing my eye makeup, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it regularly, since it leaves my skin feeling a bit dry.</li>
            <li>I love that because it is a very gentle soothing smell , just a hint</li>
            <li>I have skin that is both acne-prone and very sensitive, so most acne products just irritate my skin more.</li>
            <li>It gets your face really clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean or make my skin feel as refreshed and cleanses as well as the cream cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser because of how gentle it is.</li>
            <li>so being able to enjoy this lovely, natural smelling cucumber fragrance was a real bonus - and the product cleans well</li>
            <li>why, but this cleanser miraculously cleared my mild acne in days.</li>
            <li>I only wish it were more widely available in stores!</li>
            <li>When I think of cucumber cleansers I expect them to feel really fresh and cool.  </li>
            <li>The younger set would probably love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>But I guess it&#x27;s more natural and has no lauryl sulfate in it.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is not labeled for acne-prone skin, but I love it because it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates or parabens, or any of the other chemicals that most cleansers have that irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>the face wash was shipped pretty quickly and in a well secured box, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle but leaves my skin with a fresh, clean feeling, without overdrying it.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t use salicylic acid products right now).</li>
            <li>I will enjoy using the one tube I purchased but won&#x27;t buy it again as I feel it has a &#x27;stripping&#x27; effect on my particular skin.  </li>
            <li>It seems gentle and made my face feel clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to say it is worth it if you want a very natural, light yet cleansing face wash.  </li>
            <li>It lathers nicely when used, but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin overly dry like a lot of lathers do.</li>
            <li>Yes To... products are always great because they don&#x27;t have any parabens, but they are a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural, cruelty free ...</li>
            <li>I love this facial wash.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, but subtle.</li>
            <li>then it goes away;  My skin feels really clean and soft  without feeling \\&quot;stipped\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s a rare find to find something I&#x27;m not allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference after only a week.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have to say that I really like it.  </li>
            <li>What a gentle cleanser .</li>
            <li>Skin feels clean, not dry.</li>
            <li>The cucumber and aloe are very soothing</li>
            <li>, I BROKE out it took me, benadryl,a couple of months,ambi gentle cleanser and drinking a lot of water to make it go away.</li>
            <li>It is soft to my skin, it seems to help calm my rosacea, and it&#x27;s not loaded with chemicals like others can be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and he doesn&#x27;t need to use a moisturizer, which is just another step he doesn&#x27;t  want to have to remember.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really leave my face feeling cleansed and it doesn&#x27;t really lather up like I would like it to.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and most products leave me red and itchy.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really lather or scrub, but so far it seems to be cleaning my face pretty well.</li>
            <li>My husband has pretty sensitive skin and loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>this is such a refreshing simple wash.</li>
            <li>price is right, and, after using many types of cleaners, I can say that this one works at least as well as the high-end cleansers I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is also affordable for those who don&#x27;t have 30-50 dollars a pop to buy the high level line beauty products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>To Cucumbers face wipes, this mild foaming cleanser is gentle on my sensitive, redness-prone skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes (I close my eyes and massage it over my entire face).</li>
            <li>Lovely daily facial cleanser, it does not give your skin that parched pulled feeling because it does not have strong chemicals like other facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>I usually have to buy unscented products since most scented things give me allergy symptoms</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely an underrated product, I like it loads better than Cetaphil and other &amp;#34;gentle&#x27;&#x27; drugstore cleansers.</li>
            <li>Largely recommend to anyone looking to clear up any acne or have younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>I try to use natural products on my body (and in my home).  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t redden or break out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The friend who recommended it to me uses it for her extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>This cleanser contains alcohol, which is baffling, considering that this is intended for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a similar product that I like as much, and this Yes</li>
            <li>it leaves skin soft and replenished.</li>
            <li>but it did not have that fresh feeling I expected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;+Unlike other cleansers intended for sensitive skin, my face actually feels clean after washing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this cleanser because my normal night cleanser (the Yes to Carrots one) is too big to travel with.</li>
            <li>My skin is normally very oily, but this makes my face feel uncomfortably dry and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was attracted to this cleanser because it contained green tea like my previous favorite, [[ASIN:B003JT4F3C</li>
            <li>Most natural beauty products are obscenely expensive.  </li>
            <li>, it cleans a little TOO well for my older, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have several different prescription products for my acne, but I only have a 100% clear face when this cleanser is part of my routine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes just a small amount to get the job done (on &#x27;heavy&#x27; makeup days I might wash my face with this twice in a row to be sure all traces are gone, but I think once would be enough, actually).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other gentle products that I&#x27;ve liked, but they were very expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried this product off a review from another &amp; I have to say that I really like it.  It is gentle to the skin, a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s great travel size.  I would continue to use this product &amp; recommend it as well.  It is also affordable for those who don&#x27;t have 30-50 dollars a pop to buy the high level line beauty products.  This does just as well.</li>
            <li> I have used Yes to Carrots facial and body products and was pleased (but not the best I ever used) so I wanted to try the cucumbers products. After a few days my skin breaks out in these little weird bumps. I was also using the towelettes and it stings my face and makes it feel irritated. I stopped using both products and kept it, thinking it could have been another product. About 8 months later I found the cleanser and wanted to try again since I like the ingrediants labeled. Afetr using it for 2 weeks I broke out in little bumps again. I will contact the company for a refund, if not it will go in the trash. FYI- I am not allergic to any of the known products</li>
            <li> What a gentle cleanser . It only takes a tiny amount to get a great silky lather with a wonderful light cucumber smell.&lt;br /&gt; I love that because it is a very gentle soothing smell , just a hint then it goes away;  My skin feels really clean and soft  without feeling \\&quot;stipped\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt; Since it takes such a small amount I use it my on my neck , chest ,ears, lol, and shoulders .  Yummy great product!</li>
            <li> Unlike the Yes To Cucumbers face wipes, this mild foaming cleanser is gentle on my sensitive, redness-prone skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes (I close my eyes and massage it over my entire face). I don&#x27;t use it to remove makeup, though - I use it in the morning to help prep my skin for the day. Skin feels clean, not dry.</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;The fresh scent of cucumbers, with the ability to remove my makeup, including waterproof mascara, has won my heart.&lt;br /&gt;It takes just a small amount to get the job done (on &#x27;heavy&#x27; makeup days I might wash my face with this twice in a row to be sure all traces are gone, but I think once would be enough, actually).&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin, and this does make my face feel &#x27;tight&#x27; immediately afterwards, but not dry. I use an oil-free moisturizer (Neutrogena) in very small amounts and that takes care of it immediately, leaving my skin super-clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;For those with dry skin, I believe this would work, as long as a moisturizer is used afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;The scent does not linger, though I think it would be nice to have the fresh cucumber fragrance around for a while. That&#x27;s just me though...you may feel differently.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right, and, after using many types of cleaners, I can say that this one works at least as well as the high-end cleansers I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on Amazon, but the prices at the local stores/chains are just as reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;This is my go-to cleanser now, and I would imagine will be until it is discontinued (which I hope is never).&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely try other Yes To products as well, bead on my experience with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Three cheers for this great cleanser! Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  It leaves my face feeling so smooth.  I suffer from a lot of allergies and acne, and this product has given me great results without any irritation.</li>
            <li> Buy this cleanser. It is so smooth and silky. It gets your face really clean. They make really good products</li>
            <li> I can already tell a huge difference in my face and I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days. Largely recommend to anyone looking to clear up any acne or have younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I try to use natural products on my body (and in my home).  Most natural beauty products are obscenely expensive.  Not this one.  It&#x27;s a light, gel cleanser that doesn&#x27;t make a big lather. (Note that you shouldn&#x27;t actually have a heavy lather on your skin else you dry your skin out.)  I also like the light cucumber scent which doesn&#x27;t linger and doesn&#x27;t make me smell perfumed.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser because of how gentle it is. I have skin that is both acne-prone and very sensitive, so most acne products just irritate my skin more. This cleanser is not labeled for acne-prone skin, but I love it because it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates or parabens, or any of the other chemicals that most cleansers have that irritate my skin. The cucumber and aloe are very soothing and I&#x27;ve noticed actually help to diminish inflammation and redness. And it&#x27;s affordable. I&#x27;ve used other gentle products that I&#x27;ve liked, but they were very expensive. I think this product is wonderful and a great value.</li>
            <li> I saw the ingredients on this cleanser and it has wonderful things in it; however, it made me break out horribly all over my face. Returning it.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and have a hard time finding a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t aggravate the condition. This cleanser is GREAT! I can tell a huge difference after only a week. Not only have my breakouts cleared up, but my face is not irritated after washing it. This is a life saver for me!</li>
            <li> Love the scent -  I usually have to buy unscented products since most scented things give me allergy symptoms so being able to enjoy this lovely, natural smelling cucumber fragrance was a real bonus - and the product cleans well - HOWEVER, it cleans a little TOO well for my older, sensitive skin.  I find this cleanser just a bit drying for me and that&#x27;s saying a lot since I have skin on the oily side.  I will enjoy using the one tube I purchased but won&#x27;t buy it again as I feel it has a &#x27;stripping&#x27; effect on my particular skin.  The younger set would probably love this stuff!  Kind of reminds me of the shampoos we use to get in the &#x27;olden days&#x27; that stripped off any product you had put in your hair like cream rinse - ha!  :-)</li>
            <li> This smells really nice but it&#x27;s a bit tricky to open and a bit expensive for what it is. Good for travel though as not too bulky.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleanser. The smell is great, but subtle. It lathers nicely when used, but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin overly dry like a lot of lathers do. It doesn&#x27;t redden or break out my sensitive skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A smooth an d nice daycream who not irreteted my skin. Smells good. I have fat skin and this make my skin a Little bit shiny but itÂ´s ok but itÂ´s give the skin a healthy look.</li>
            <li> Lovely daily facial cleanser, it does not give your skin that parched pulled feeling because it does not have strong chemicals like other facial cleansers. Also, because it does not strip your skin of natural oils, your face will get less oily if you use this.</li>
            <li> First off, this is a very light and clean smelling product which is why I really love it. It doesn&#x27;t really lather or scrub, but so far it seems to be cleaning my face pretty well. Yes To... products are always great because they don&#x27;t have any parabens, but they are a bit more expensive. I&#x27;d have to say it is worth it if you want a very natural, light yet cleansing face wash.  Sometimes I wonder if I need a stronger face wash, but this one is always so calming and helps with red spots. I bought the daily lotion to go with it. All in all, I say yes to cucumbers! the face wash was shipped pretty quickly and in a well secured box, too.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why, but this cleanser miraculously cleared my mild acne in days. I kid you not. I have several different prescription products for my acne, but I only have a 100% clear face when this cleanser is part of my routine. The friend who recommended it to me uses it for her extremely sensitive skin. It&#x27;s definitely an underrated product, I like it loads better than Cetaphil and other &amp;#34;gentle&#x27;&#x27; drugstore cleansers. I only wish it were more widely available in stores! I can never find this product anywhere but Wallgreen&#x27;s and there isn&#x27;t one in my neighborhood.</li>
            <li> But I guess it&#x27;s more natural and has no lauryl sulfate in it. Other than that, I like it. Makes my face feel very clean.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s a rare find to find something I&#x27;m not allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s all natural, cruelty free ... no animal testing.</li>
            <li> If I could give it a zero I would. I have sensitive skin and when I mean I broke out, I BROKE out it took me, benadryl,a couple of months,ambi gentle cleanser and drinking a lot of water to make it go away. I seriously had a terrible allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Great smell and works wonderfully with the sponges I bought</li>
            <li> Perfect cleanser for sensitive skin. It being organic is another plus!</li>
            <li> I love this facial wash. It is soft to my skin, it seems to help calm my rosacea, and it&#x27;s not loaded with chemicals like others can be. Add a little baking soda and it exfoliates the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells good, keeps my skin clear, and is free of harmful chemicals.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and most products leave me red and itchy.  Not this cleanser.  It&#x27;s so gentle but leaves my skin with a fresh, clean feeling, without overdrying it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now and my skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> When I think of cucumber cleansers I expect them to feel really fresh and cool.  This cleanser is neither.  It seems gentle and made my face feel clean but it did not have that fresh feeling I expected.  It is kind of slimy and doesn&#x27;t really foam up or anything.  I will use it and after it is gone it is not something that I plan on buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally in love, but this will do for now. For me, this is not the best of the Yes To brand, I find this cleanser a little too thin, and the smell not as refreshing as the other cucumber products. I also wish they made a cucumber face wash with some grit in it for some exfoliating (they do have a Yes To Tomatoes facial scrub but I can&#x27;t use salicylic acid products right now). I will use this product until I find a better one.</li>
            <li> The best cleanser ever.</li>
            <li> My husband has pretty sensitive skin and loves this stuff. It&#x27;s gentle and he doesn&#x27;t need to use a moisturizer, which is just another step he doesn&#x27;t  want to have to remember.</li>
            <li> Ingredients in every box, no matter what labeled whether it be cucumbers, tomatoes, etc, they are all the same!!!!! Yes to consumer awareness!!</li>
            <li> It is not gentle enough for my sensitive skin. Made my dry skin worse- red, irritated and sensitive.  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gel, I guess I didn&#x27;t read the fine print. I prefer the soy, cream cleanser by Yes to Cucumbers. It doesn&#x27;t clean or make my skin feel as refreshed and cleanses as well as the cream cleanser.</li>
            <li> I got this cleanser because my normal night cleanser (the Yes to Carrots one) is too big to travel with. This cucumber cleanser is nice, and does an especially wonderful job of removing my eye makeup, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it regularly, since it leaves my skin feeling a bit dry.</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed on this page do not match the ingredients on the bottle itself. This cleanser contains alcohol, which is baffling, considering that this is intended for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days, and my skin is already red and irritated. My skin is normally very oily, but this makes my face feel uncomfortably dry and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was attracted to this cleanser because it contained green tea like my previous favorite, [[ASIN:B003JT4F3C Naturally Clear Green Tea Cleanser for Unisex By St.Ives, 6.75 Ounce]]. I can no longer use the St. Ives because of the salicylic acid, which my skin began to react to after a few years of use. I have yet to find a similar product that I like as much, and this Yes To product was yet another disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;+Unlike other cleansers intended for sensitive skin, my face actually feels clean after washing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Contains alcohol, a known skin irritant that dries and irritates skin&lt;br /&gt;-Definitely not good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about this product. It doesn&#x27;t really leave my face feeling cleansed and it doesn&#x27;t really lather up like I would like it to.</li>
            <li> this is such a refreshing simple wash. it leaves skin soft and replenished. there&#x27;s something about cucumber and this have the trick to it.</li>
