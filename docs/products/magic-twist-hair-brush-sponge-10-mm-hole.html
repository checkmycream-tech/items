            <li>Bought the Magic Twist Brush Sponge for my son&#x27;s &amp;#34;Frohawk&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It really did a great job on my son&#x27;s head</li>

            <li>easy to use .</li>
            <li>and it still works and looks fine, no falling apart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good, I got what I expected from my hair and the sponge.</li>
            <li>a light gel/ grease/ or cream for a curly pattern.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I love this brush all I do is brush my hair in a circular motion and my hair twist right up</li>
            <li>Love this sponge did exactly what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>The Magic Twist does exactly what it is advertised to do and for that it deserves a 5.  </li>
            <li>Works very well no broken pieces in my hair like others i have seen and certainly good price</li>
            <li>Natural curly hair, walah magic!</li>
            <li>Good, but should have one with bigger holes.</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied, the brush gave me curls instantly.</li>
            <li>Works really well!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;We went ahead and gave him a bath and while his hair was damp we gave it a good minute of so of rubbing the sponge on his hair and it twisted and looks very handsome on him.</li>
            <li>better if you put a little styling lotion on the top of your hair before you spin the brush.</li>
            <li>It done exactly what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li>he has thick curly hair and it makes his curls pop more!!</li>
            <li>Laid down nicely.</li>
            <li>I have tough Nigerian hair and this still curls it well, great for adding texture.</li>
            <li>It doesnt really curl it twist your hair ....</li>
            <li>My hair wet turns into a curly fro but the front part of my hair stays wavy, which is why I bought the Magic Twist.</li>
            <li>And I really wasn&#x27;t in the mood to do finger coils.</li>
            <li>It works fine as long as you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>At night, I tie down my hair and in the am, the twists look better.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li>I ordered this same twist sponge beforw and was much softer but this one is firm and does not perform anywhere near as good as the softer sponge</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same sponge his barber uses on his customers.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my 11 year old son.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and he was surprised it was softer than the one his barber uses</li>
            <li>Being that my hair is naturally curl the &amp;</li>
            <li>My son loves it so far....</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try out this product, as I have recently done the big chop and wanted to have low maintenance twists.</li>
            <li>Tried a few other ones but this creates better curls faster.</li>

            <li> Tried a few other ones but this creates better curls faster.</li>
            <li> Works well with medium to medium long hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend buying if you don&#x27;t want to waste $20 on a different  one.</li>
            <li> I tried it wet and dry</li>
            <li> Use different products for a tighter curl/twist pattern!&lt;br /&gt;Use a lock gel for a really tight twist</li>
            <li> My hair is medium length and the brush does not do what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> My son loves this sponge, but he&#x27;s only had it a few weeks</li>
            <li> It matted my hair down and it didn&#x27;t curl or add any texture.</li>
            <li> It still works but the curls aren&#x27;t as tight as I want them.</li>
            <li> He has a tightly coiled hair texture and it was either comb it and deal with his tears or try to find another solution to manage his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was not able to review the product correctly, due to receiving damaged product.</li>
            <li> Just add a little gel or styling product and follow the circular motion (see directions on package).  </li>
            <li> The sponge was very firm.  </li>
            <li> They usually take me at least 2 hours to do by myself.</li>
            <li> I have thick 4c hair.</li>
            <li> Sponge was very hard!</li>
            <li> i hate how he rips the black stuff</li>
            <li> Sponge was separated in corner from the base where you hold the brush sponge, tried to use it was unable to because of issue.</li>
            <li> I hated it!</li>

            <li> Works as advertised! I will purchase the next size as well for larger twists.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly.  I was really pleased with the outcome.  After a hair cut, I applied moisturizer to my son&#x27;s head and used the brush.  It worked great.  The more we rubbed over his head the tighter the curls.  Really pleased!</li>

            <li> works best for hair with bigger curls.</li>

            <li> awesome, awesome and awesome whom ever thought of this item was very created......</li>
            <li> Great price and gets the job done. I am a fan of sponge twists for my hair and I use this sponge daily. It has held up well.</li>

            <li> Twist with your hands and save money. It&#x27;s basically a car wash  sponge with holes in it.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I want another just to have one.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Works so much better than my homemade sponge.</li>
            <li> Great product but mine came not all the way glued, had to super glue it in order to use it.</li>
            <li> Great, I used to make my own sponges. This is way better! Use different products for a tighter curl/twist pattern!&lt;br /&gt;Use a lock gel for a really tight twist&lt;br /&gt;Use a light gel/ grease/ or cream for a curly pattern.</li>
            <li> This item is great. I definitely recommend buying if you don&#x27;t want to waste $20 on a different  one. It works fine as long as you follow the instructions. (It doesn&#x27;t brake easliy)</li>
            <li> Great product and stands by its quality. I will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, the brush gave me curls instantly. Product works just as advertised!</li>
            <li> It doesnt really curl it twist your hair ....</li>
            <li> My hair is medium length and the brush does not do what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> My son loves this sponge, but he&#x27;s only had it a few weeks and it&#x27;s coming Unglued.</li>
            <li> I hated it! It did not work for my hair. I tried it wet and dry and it did not curl my hair at ALL! My hair wet turns into a curly fro but the front part of my hair stays wavy, which is why I bought the Magic Twist. It matted my hair down and it didn&#x27;t curl or add any texture. I would not recommend this product to anyone with longer hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he was surprised it was softer than the one his barber uses but once he got used to it, it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Works better if you put a little styling lotion on the top of your hair before you spin the brush.</li>
            <li> Good, but should have one with bigger holes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sponge for when I wear my hair 1 1/2 &amp;#34; or longer. It give me a nice more defined curly effect. I have since gone shorter with the same cut, temp fade w/ tapered back. It still works but the curls aren&#x27;t as tight as I want them. I am using the 7mm now to achieve that look.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sponge for my son. He has a tightly coiled hair texture and it was either comb it and deal with his tears or try to find another solution to manage his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went ahead and gave him a bath and while his hair was damp we gave it a good minute of so of rubbing the sponge on his hair and it twisted and looks very handsome on him. The parts in his hair are near perfect and the twist are well-porportioned. I don&#x27;t know what kind of magic sponge this is but I wish this was out when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge did exactly what I wanted it to. Tried a few other ones but this creates better curls faster.</li>
            <li> My purchase was for my son, He&#x27;s very pleased with the Magic Twist Brush Sponge ! !!👍👍</li>
            <li> Did not work. Sponge was very hard! The seller asked me too remove my feedback</li>
            <li> Did the job. Hair looks great!</li>
            <li> The Magic Twist does exactly what it is advertised to do and for that it deserves a 5.  However, after almost a month of use (3-4 days a week), I can already see it beginning to fray at the sides.  But for the price, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. Being that my hair is naturally curl the &amp;#34;Magic Twist Hair brush Sponge&amp;#34; brings out my curls even more. With the help of a product called &amp;#34;Hawaiian Silky.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great product . used it for my boys hair. easy to use .</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son, he loves it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alot of twists sponges but this one is The best one I had so far</li>
            <li> Works very well no broken pieces in my hair like others i have seen and certainly good price</li>
            <li> Great price, does what it says it will do; and i love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought the Magic Twist Brush Sponge for my son&#x27;s &amp;#34;Frohawk&amp;#34;.  Just add a little gel or styling product and follow the circular motion (see directions on package).  His hair came out awesome!  It took a couple tries to figure out the technique, but we got it now and he has the perfectly textured look!</li>
            <li> good!! gives nice curly twisty look..</li>
            <li> Works really well!! Immediate results in my son&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.....our son is very pleased with the finished look.</li>
            <li> Love it. It really did a great job on my son&#x27;s head</li>
            <li> Works well with medium to medium long hair. Apply whatever type of moisturizer you use into your hair after a shower or dampening your hair and then twist and brush. Natural curly hair, walah magic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good, I got what I expected from my hair and the sponge.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair great curls.</li>
            <li> My son loves it so far....he has thick curly hair and it makes his curls pop more!!</li>
            <li> Like It... Holes Are A Lil Too Big For My Hair Length</li>
            <li> I love this brush all I do is brush my hair in a circular motion and my hair twist right up highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li> My son loves this brush!!</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly after my first use! About to buy another as a backup.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try out this product, as I have recently done the big chop and wanted to have low maintenance twists. I followed all of the instructions on the package, but the sponge didn&#x27;t work. Maybe it&#x27;s meant for a different type of hair. I have thick 4c hair. Guess I&#x27;ll have to keep trying different products.</li>
            <li> Works like it&#x27;s suppose to. I use &amp;#34;Gold&amp;#34; brand curling activator with it to add extra curl to it. Everyone I know loves what it does to my hair so that&#x27;s always good lol.</li>
            <li> I have a TWA after my recent chop. And I really wasn&#x27;t in the mood to do finger coils. They usually take me at least 2 hours to do by myself. I did some research online and found a popular product to get twists in a minute. But it looked overpriced in my opinion. After digging around on the net, I found this product. As soon as it arrived, I used it on my damp hair with some gel and it worked perfectly. At night, I tie down my hair and in the am, the twists look better. Laid down nicely. Hope this product lasts me for awhile.</li>
