            <li>great smell and very fresh and aromatic with good spices to deepen the scent    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing thank you...</li>
            <li>THEY LIKED IT.</li>
            <li>I knew I liked it.</li>
            <li>Nice scent that is not overbearing.</li>
            <li>A very good choice for someone on a budget but who also wants a great cologne that does not smell cheap.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a graduation gift years back for my best friend and he loved it.</li>
            <li>Also I am sure I will buy again this kind of products.  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I have been looking everywhere for this for some time, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon had it.</li>
            <li>It it is okay.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s his favorite</li>
            <li>My husband and I love it and he always gets compliments.</li>
            <li>Love the scent on my man.</li>
            <li>Once I discovered this wonderful cologne, I never looked back.</li>
            <li>I think it has a great smell and an even better price for a fourteen year old!</li>
            <li>Great memory of the past and great memory NOW.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had for a couple years that are still have full!    </li>
            <li>I am sure like most people when you pick up a bottle to smell the scent you can get a hint right away.</li>
            <li>Fabulous scent-the one that started the MJ cologne line.</li>
            <li>and then stays very close to the skin for the rest of the time, while the scent is excellent for daily wear    </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny a nice fragrance for men not too overpowering that it makes you gag just right will be purchasing this again</li>
            <li>With certain colognes a lot of people smell you (in a good way) without having to have their nose at your neck, but with this I have yet to receive a compliment for smelling good, which I would get often wearing other colognes.  </li>
            <li>I like the clean scent myself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool how the distinctive bottle and cardboard it comes in has never changed.</li>
            <li>Overall, good smell</li>
            <li>I was out doing some quick errands at TJ&#x27;s and WalMart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite cologne of his, but it&#x27;s decent smelling and inexpensive and he loves it.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip and spray when ready to use.</li>
            <li>Since the first time I caught a whiff of The original Michael Jordan cologne</li>
            <li>This cologne was the balm meaning it was everything that I was anticipating, it had a soft scent that were not over bearing to the nose and received many compliments.</li>
            <li>That was in middle school and now as an adult I make sure to keep a steady supply of it handy for work.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a sample size previously and friends had commented to my husband that he smelled good when he had it on.  </li>
            <li>I really like it&#x27;s mild smell</li>
            <li>Even though I initially bought this cologne when it first came out for no other reason than I liked Michael Jordan, it actually smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an afficianado, just like this product very much.</li>
            <li>The scent is great and does last a long time.</li>
            <li>This cologne spray for men is great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my boyfriend wanted and shipping was fast got it within 2 days and is the right size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have a spray than a bottle with an open top where too much pours out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough not to offend people with sensitive noses and doesn&#x27;t last too long which is great for my line of work (healthcare).</li>
            <li>Fast forward to tonight.</li>
            <li>My DH has been using this product for a year now and really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but just doesn&#x27;t seem to have much kick.</li>
            <li>My grandson really likes this cologne.</li>
            <li>Putting too much of it on makes it smell like straight alcohol, so don&#x27;t drench yourself in</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and product recieved as advertised.</li>
            <li>A very fine and lasting product at a very low price.</li>
            <li>Btw I am a Jordan fan but not with this particular cologne.</li>
            <li>shopping for a cheaper cologne to use everyday, I would say that it&#x27;s a safe bet to go with this one.</li>
            <li>Michael Jordan cologne, to me at least, is pretty comparable to Drakkar Nois but about 1/3 as strong in scent.</li>
            <li>only thing is that this does not have as much X factor like many other scents like le male, issey miyake, burberry brit, armani code, hermes</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there are two different versions of this same cologne, so check reviews on both before purchasing because I can&#x27;t remember if one was better than the other.</li>
            <li>I would have expected over a hundred as most other fragrances have and this also being a pop culture product to some extent since it has MJ&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li>In fact, the only person who has ever noticed it is my girlfriend and only when she is really close to me.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have much to say about this product other than It brought back memories of my jr high days.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s creepy but nice combinations of fragrances</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to hang around too long or be strong enough to really matter.      </li>
            <li>I loved the smell but only wore it maybe 3x tops because I was afraid of using it up.</li>

            <li> I loved the smell but only wore it maybe 3x tops because I was afraid of using it up.</li>
            <li> The scent is actually quite subtle and fresh.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really describe the scent in any other way other than pleasing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cologne if you&#x27;re not sure which scent to get the man in your life.</li>
            <li> There is not much more to say other than when I put it on, she likes to be near.  </li>
            <li> I wore it for about a year back then, but then wore Hugo up until a few weeks ago when I bought Jordan again.  </li>
            <li> I use it as my daily cologne and it lasts me a few months.</li>
            <li> Had trouble finding it in our local stores, so ordered through this company.</li>
            <li> the only down side to this cologne is it lasts just a few hrs , so you have to reapply after 3 or 4 hrs</li>
            <li> I switch off colognes and have other 05 oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve accidentally bought the other one before</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste it so it never got used and sat in a drawer for about 10 years.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> The black on the small version I bought it not rubber (think basketball), but hard plastic.</li>
            <li> They had a small \\&quot;trial\\&quot; section where they sell .05 oz.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem at all retro or something of the past.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we are unable to find it locally on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> yeah, if nothing else you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling bad, but at the same time you could do that without wearing cologne at all.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I was shocked to come on here and see only 8 reviews!</li>
            <li> Even till this day I remember how awful the smell of this cologne was.</li>
            <li> This cologne to me is completely terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was bought for myself and would buy again. I like it!</li>
            <li> I had this back in elementry school the year it released, 1996. It was a Christmas gift, 3.4 oz. I loved the smell but only wore it maybe 3x tops because I was afraid of using it up. It seemed like the price a relative paid for it, between $30-40 at the time was so extravegant to me I didn&#x27;t want to waste it so it never got used and sat in a drawer for about 10 years.     Fast forward to tonight. I was out doing some quick errands at TJ&#x27;s and WalMart. I has to pick up some lip balm and the aisle the lip balm was on was opposite the fragrances. They had a small \\&quot;trial\\&quot; section where they sell .05 oz. for $6 each. I found this Michael Jordan cologne there. It was the only one on the rack. I had to get it to re-live elementry and I remembered it smelling oh so good!     The black on the small version I bought it not rubber (think basketball), but hard plastic. It is a spray though which is very nice. I&#x27;d rather have a spray than a bottle with an open top where too much pours out. The scent is great and does last a long time. It doesn&#x27;t seem at all retro or something of the past. It&#x27;s still should be considered a current scent. A very good choice for someone on a budget but who also wants a great cologne that does not smell cheap. Michael Jordan cologne, to me at least, is pretty comparable to Drakkar Nois but about 1/3 as strong in scent. The .05 oz. is all I will need. I switch off colognes and have other 05 oz. I&#x27;ve had for a couple years that are still have full!    Glad this is still in production. Great memory of the past and great memory NOW. Gotta give MJ 5 stars. A very fine and lasting product at a very low price. It&#x27;s cool how the distinctive bottle and cardboard it comes in has never changed. I have to admit I was shocked to come on here and see only 8 reviews! I would have expected over a hundred as most other fragrances have and this also being a pop culture product to some extent since it has MJ&#x27;s name. I remember there was a lot of buzz about this cologne when it came out in 1996 which is how I ended up with it at the time. You had to buy it in a department store.    Sorry I didn&#x27;t review the scent more. I&#x27;m not an afficianado, just like this product very much.</li>
            <li> great smell and very fresh and aromatic with good spices to deepen the scent    this scent will have noticable sillage for up to an hour and then stays very close to the skin for the rest of the time, while the scent is excellent for daily wear    only thing is that this does not have as much X factor like many other scents like le male, issey miyake, burberry brit, armani code, hermes</li>
            <li> Exactly what my boyfriend wanted and shipping was fast got it within 2 days and is the right size. PERFECT</li>
            <li> GIFT FOR Christmas.  THEY LIKED IT.</li>
            <li> I had to write this after seeing all of the reviews. I am a cologne guru. I have worn dozens of colognes and smelled hundreds. Even till this day I remember how awful the smell of this cologne was. I am sure like most people when you pick up a bottle to smell the scent you can get a hint right away. I tried to give this a shot by smelling it more than once to make sure I was smelling one of the worst colognes ever made and that is no exaggeration. This cologne to me is completely terrible. Btw I am a Jordan fan but not with this particular cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this cologne for years.  I like the clean scent myself.  It&#x27;s not my favorite cologne of his, but it&#x27;s decent smelling and inexpensive and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Loved this Cologne, smell very nice</li>
            <li> My DH has been using this product for a year now and really likes it.  Unfortunately we are unable to find it locally on a regular basis.  It was great to find it through a search on Amazon.com and to order and receive it timely.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this cologne.  There is not much more to say other than when I put it on, she likes to be near.  Isn&#x27;t that the entire purpose of cologne?  I have been looking everywhere for this for some time, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon had it.</li>
            <li> I think it was a good deal because I received what I was waiting for.  Also I am sure I will buy again this kind of products.  Thanks</li>
            <li> It it is okay.  I probably will not get it again.</li>
            <li> Even though I initially bought this cologne when it first came out for no other reason than I liked Michael Jordan, it actually smells pretty good.  I wore it for about a year back then, but then wore Hugo up until a few weeks ago when I bought Jordan again.  My only complaint is that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to hang around too long or be strong enough to really matter.      With certain colognes a lot of people smell you (in a good way) without having to have their nose at your neck, but with this I have yet to receive a compliment for smelling good, which I would get often wearing other colognes.  In fact, the only person who has ever noticed it is my girlfriend and only when she is really close to me.  So yeah, if nothing else you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling bad, but at the same time you could do that without wearing cologne at all.  Overall, good smell but just doesn&#x27;t seem to have much kick.</li>
            <li> Since the first time I caught a whiff of The original Michael Jordan cologne I knew I liked it. That was in middle school and now as an adult I make sure to keep a steady supply of it handy for work. It&#x27;s light enough not to offend people with sensitive noses and doesn&#x27;t last too long which is great for my line of work (healthcare). I can&#x27;t really describe the scent in any other way other than pleasing. Buy a bottle and see if you feel the same.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have much to say about this product other than It brought back memories of my jr high days.  Another sweet/peppery smell to it.  Great cologne staple.</li>
            <li> This cologne was the balm meaning it was everything that I was anticipating, it had a soft scent that were not over bearing to the nose and received many compliments. Wonderful Item.</li>
            <li> My son loves this cologne.  I think it has a great smell and an even better price for a fourteen year old!</li>
            <li> My dad has loved this cologne for years so its a great go to birthday gift which makes me very happy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a graduation gift years back for my best friend and he loved it. The scent is actually quite subtle and fresh. I highly recommend this cologne if you&#x27;re not sure which scent to get the man in your life.</li>
            <li> My grandson really likes this cologne. I put it in his stocking.</li>
            <li> ANTOTHER LIKELY SUPRISE...WOW...We Gave to my Grandson who loves this cologne for Christmas...and for his birthday and Easter...etc..it&#x27;s his favorite</li>
            <li> This cologne spray for men is great and last a long time. Easy to grip and spray when ready to use.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because my wife loves it. Once again timely delivery and hey I can&#x27;t play like Mike but I can smell like Mike I know it&#x27;s creepy but nice combinations of fragrances Its a definite buy !!!</li>
            <li> I wore this when I was a teenage and the scent hasn&#x27;t changed...It smells really good , the only down side to this cologne is it lasts just a few hrs , so you have to reapply after 3 or 4 hrs</li>
            <li> If you need a cheap cologne that smells great, then this is perfect. I use it as my daily cologne and it lasts me a few months. Putting too much of it on makes it smell like straight alcohol, so don&#x27;t drench yourself in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there are two different versions of this same cologne, so check reviews on both before purchasing because I can&#x27;t remember if one was better than the other. I&#x27;ve accidentally bought the other one before and I can&#x27;t remember if it smelled the same as this one. It was definitely packaged differently and the bottle was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When shopping for a cheaper cologne to use everyday, I would say that it&#x27;s a safe bet to go with this one. Try it out. I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Nice scent that is not overbearing. Smells great on my husband.  I had purchased a sample size previously and friends had commented to my husband that he smelled good when he had it on.  I wanted a larger bottle. Had trouble finding it in our local stores, so ordered through this company.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing thank you...</li>
            <li> Fabulous scent-the one that started the MJ cologne line. My husband and I love it and he always gets compliments.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny a nice fragrance for men not too overpowering that it makes you gag just right will be purchasing this again</li>
            <li> I really like it&#x27;s mild smell</li>
            <li> Love the scent on my man. I reordered countless times. Fast delivery and product recieved as advertised.</li>
            <li> Once I discovered this wonderful cologne, I never looked back. A cologne has to be inline with a man&#x27;s skin type, and Jordan fits mine to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;. It is one of the best colognes I have ever worn.</li>
