            <li>Lemisol has been around for many years.</li>
            <li>I have been using Lemisol for many years.</li>
            <li>was introduced to this by a friend and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I have never been so pleased.</li>
            <li>but so far so good!</li>
            <li>so I will start buying it there from now on, but this is a great product and if you can&#x27;t find it in stores, a decent price too</li>

            <li>I am so happy to find this back really makes you feel nice and clean!</li>
            <li>The smell was so embarrassing that I couldn&#x27;t even be intimate with my husband without showering first which didn&#x27;t make for a very spontaneous sex life.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought it by the case!!</li>
            <li>- feels so fresh :)</li>
            <li>and I love the fresh feel.</li>
            <li>I love this, you feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>but this is worth it!</li>
            <li>Its great especially during the hot summer months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s make you feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m even fine after INTENSE work outs!</li>
            <li>By far the best gentle daily feminine wash I have EVER used.</li>
            <li>I was using this product for many years because it was sold in my home city of New York.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is just amazing the tingling took a second to get use too</li>
            <li>Nothing makes me feel as fresh as this.  </li>
            <li>I like the fresh tingling feeling and the tea tree scent.</li>
            <li>It worth the $$.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using feminine wash from Europe when I visited about 10 years ago, and I&#x27;ve been looking for something new I can easily get that is cheaper.</li>
            <li>Grew up using it and now glad im able to use it as an adult and have my daughters do the same.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to find this product locally.</li>
            <li>Way better than American feminine wash products.</li>
            <li>so fresh feeling,&amp;#34; even after my intense workout sessions in this Florida heat.</li>
            <li>the fresh feeling down there can be overwhelming.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really dont used anything else beside this to take care of my vaginal area.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be a lifelong user for sure.</li>
            <li>and I am all clear!!!</li>
            <li>When I first used it I was simply AMAZED.</li>
            <li>I love this product not able to buy in the store.  </li>
            <li>I usually never write reviews...</li>
            <li>its not as main stream as \\&quot;eve\\&quot;.it More common in the hispanic community</li>
            <li>Oh wow, that is some tingly feeling</li>
            <li>Cannot be used by anyone that is sensitive below.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nastily cheap and has this funky green color.</li>
            <li>This has COMPLETELY ELIMINATED the issue</li>
            <li>As a woman who has been pregnant during the summer this product cools &amp; cleanses efficiently without harsh side effects.</li>
            <li>The minty feeling was so refreshing but not over powering or irritating.</li>
            <li>it contains ALCOHOL AND SODIUM LAUREL ETHER SULFATE, so it totally dries you out and therefore messes with your pH, which defies the whole point- that is to keep your pH down there in balance.</li>

            <li> My husband uses it all over his body, I have to hide it from him because if not, it won&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> The bottle was bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I did find it in my local grocery store for about $5 less</li>
            <li> the powders and other washes never fixed it.</li>
            <li> I will never use anything other than Lemisol.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find unless you go to a spanish beauty supply store or order it online.</li>
            <li> /burn down there.</li>
            <li> I buy alot because they dont sell it down south.  </li>
            <li> You have to take just a little bit otherwise</li>
            <li> Wish i had found this a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Ever since using Lemisol, no more yeast problems</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this product.</li>
            <li> the past year, the odor got worse!</li>
            <li> First of all, the ingredients are HORRIBLE...</li>
            <li> The menthol isn&#x27;t irritating to me.</li>
            <li> i must say im still a bit eerie about it because i dont know just how \\&quot;safe\\&quot; it is.</li>
            <li> and I was desperate to find something that wouldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> have struggled with sweating &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; and the odor would get annoying and  I would be self-conscience -  </li>
            <li> What a waste of $$$$$ !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Omg this stuff is so awful.</li>

            <li> Perfect for everyday use, This product is great for all women, It leaves you feeling clean and fresh. highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Oh wow, that is some tingly feeling but i like it - feels so fresh :) You have to take just a little bit otherwise the fresh feeling down there can be overwhelming. Sometimes i use it on my husband when we take showers together and he doesn&#x27;t mind. I gave only 4stars for now because i don&#x27;t know yet how it affects my ph and the overall microflora there, i hope i don&#x27;t get any yeast infections but so far so good!</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever! Excellent for intimate hygiene, makes you feel fresh and clean almost the whole day!</li>
            <li> This stuff is just the best!!! I was struggling with BV for about a year I now use this wash and the Rephresh Brilliant ph balance tampons.. and I am all clear!!! this stuff is just amazing the tingling took a second to get use too but now I love it. I definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with feminine odor problems for many years. I&#x27;ve tried all of the feminine wash brands you can get at the drugstore, and none of them worked for me. I tried wipes sprays, powders...you name it, but I still smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past year, the odor got worse! I had to start carrying washcloths, soap and extra panties with me all the time. The smell was so embarrassing that I couldn&#x27;t even be intimate with my husband without showering first which didn&#x27;t make for a very spontaneous sex life. I came across this product on Amazon and bought it based on the reviews and hoped that this product would be the answer to my prayers. Since I started using Lemisol I&#x27;ve had no odor. I use it at night when I shower and after I go to the gym. The wash is non-drying but I can definitely feel the menthol. The menthol isn&#x27;t irritating to me. It is actually refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never write reviews but I deccided to write this in the hopes that it will help someone else decide to take a chance on this product. I know not everything works for everybody, but I hope this works for you. I feel so much more confident and don&#x27;t have to worry if I smell. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I heard alot about this from my Dominican friends and decided to give it a try. It is really hard to find unless you go to a spanish beauty supply store or order it online. When I first used it I was simply AMAZED. It was like a party in my cooter lol. The minty feeling was so refreshing but not over powering or irritating. It felt great. My only issue with this product is that over time you end up not feeling that WOW feeling down there anymore and its just a regular wash. I would like to have to \\&quot;party in my cooter\\&quot; experience every time I use Lemisol. I definitely suggest this product to every woman!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it keeps you fresh all day!!! Grew up using it and now glad im able to use it as an adult and have my daughters do the same.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t able to find this product locally. I was ecstatic when I found it here. It&#x27;s make you feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> My grandma used to bring this from the Dominican Republic and called it &amp;#34;el secreto&amp;#34; aka &amp;#34;the secret&amp;#34;. I love this, you feel clean and fresh. I did find it in my local grocery store for about $5 less so I will start buying it there from now on, but this is a great product and if you can&#x27;t find it in stores, a decent price too</li>
            <li> My mom introduce this product, to me.  Now I can&#x27;t shower without it!!!!!  Cannot be used by anyone that is sensitive below.</li>
            <li> Regular soaps give me yeast infections and I was desperate to find something that wouldn&#x27;t.  Ever since using Lemisol, no more yeast problems and I love the fresh feel. Excellent product and I&#x27;m happy to buy it from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> amazing product and very refreshing</li>
            <li> I love this product not able to buy in the store.  This product is not offered in my current state.  I was using this product for many years because it was sold in my home city of New York.  Nothing makes me feel as fresh as this.  Vaginal confidence is an amazing feeling!</li>
            <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> After moving away from NY I had a hard time finding this product. I&#x27;m grateful that I can order it online. Its the only one i&#x27;ll use. You feel cleaner and refreshed after using it. Way better than American feminine wash products.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh tingling feeling and the tea tree scent. Doesn&#x27;t have it in there though.... It took awhile for me to receive it. That was the only downside.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find this back really makes you feel nice and clean! My husband just loves the nice clean smell .</li>
            <li> First of all, the ingredients are HORRIBLE...it contains ALCOHOL AND SODIUM LAUREL ETHER SULFATE, so it totally dries you out and therefore messes with your pH, which defies the whole point- that is to keep your pH down there in balance. It&#x27;s so nastily cheap and has this funky green color. It also has TONS of menthol which makes you tingle/burn down there. I&#x27;ve been using feminine wash from Europe when I visited about 10 years ago, and I&#x27;ve been looking for something new I can easily get that is cheaper. NEVER MIND! I didn&#x27;t have any issues until I used this garbage. Omg this stuff is so awful. What a waste of $$$$$ !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is incredible. So happy with it. I definetely recommend</li>
            <li> thats the best way i cant explain it. Ive heard of lemisol from soo many ppl,i had to try it for myself. I loveee the minty feeling. i thought it was going to be overwhelming and maybe burn? but not at all!! the strength of it is perfect i love it! i must say im still a bit eerie about it because i dont know just how \\&quot;safe\\&quot; it is. its not as main stream as \\&quot;eve\\&quot;.it More common in the hispanic community and ive tried my research and i dont seem to find anything specifically on it but i do of its ingredients but it doesnt seem to have anything most products dont already have anyways.</li>
            <li> This product is Awesome. The bottle was bigger than I expected. Thank God. This is definitely my go-to feminine wash. Love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 5 years. I love the way it makes you feel. It keeps you fresh all day!!! When Im in my hometown in NY I buy alot because they dont sell it down south.  If I know I close to running out and not going back home for awhile, I always order from Amazon. I love it and recommend it to many women.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying using this product for about four years. Its great especially during the hot summer months. As a woman who has been pregnant during the summer this product cools &amp; cleanses efficiently without harsh side effects.</li>
            <li> This provided me the most confident feeling! I usually never write reviews...but this is worth it! I no longer have that &amp;#34;not so fresh feeling,&amp;#34; even after my intense workout sessions in this Florida heat. I will never use anything other than Lemisol. This is a staple in my shower! If I had to sum it up in one word, I&#x27;d say CONFIDENT!!</li>
            <li> Lemisol has been around for many years. My entire family (females) use it.  I have also referred this product to friends and extended family members.</li>
            <li> The only stuff that works!!!!!!!!!! I love it so much I bought it by the case!! is is awesome ~This is the second post for this.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lemisol for many years. I love how clean and refreshing I feel after using it. My husband uses it all over his body, I have to hide it from him because if not, it won&#x27;t last that long. I always order 2 bottles at a time. Don&#x27;t buy the ones sold at the mega stores like Vagisil or whatever they are called. Once you try Lemisol you won&#x27;t want to wash with anything else.</li>
            <li> was introduced to this by a friend and fell in love with it. Give you a Very refreshing feeling when used. I really dont used anything else beside this to take care of my vaginal area. It delivers the same results every time it is used. Wish i had found this a few years ago. It worth the $$.</li>
            <li> By far the best gentle daily feminine wash I have EVER used. I have never been so pleased. Leaves a tingling but I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s what makes it work...have struggled with sweating &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; and the odor would get annoying and  I would be self-conscience -  the powders and other washes never fixed it. I use this and I&#x27;m even fine after INTENSE work outs! This has COMPLETELY ELIMINATED the issue and I&#x27;ll be a lifelong user for sure. I have a renewed confidence so happy :)</li>
