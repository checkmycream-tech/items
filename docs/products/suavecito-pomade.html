            <li>This stuff is great at holding your hair in place, and does about as good of a job as one can expect at duplicating the look of a nice greasy pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Don&#x27;t need a lot to achieve a good hold.  </li>
            <li>the smell Is good.</li>
            <li>.it&#x27;s also a boost that it smells good at work</li>
            <li>Feels good, doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Crew pomade...</li>
            <li>The hold is also really good</li>
            <li>Good hold</li>
            <li>it  works really good</li>
            <li>It works great,its just not as good as when the barber used it on me....</li>
            <li>Works good</li>
            <li>kind of makes my hair feel oily though otherwise its great</li>
            <li>For people who like gel, this is a good hybrid of pomade and gel.</li>
            <li>you are getting a good bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>good hold</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s all good.</li>

            <li>B000142NMI Murray&#x27;s Superior Hair Dressing Pomade]] - A joke.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>but i definitely loved how it held my hair in place, even on airy days.</li>
            <li>It does smell good, but it&#x27;s just not for me.  </li>
            <li>Good product... been using for some time and depending on the amount, you get the desired control/hold.  </li>
            <li>Great hold and shines nice.</li>
            <li>good thing is its a mellow smell that goes away after about 2hrs.</li>
            <li>Good Pomade.</li>
            <li>the smell of this product is sooo good.</li>
            <li>Good for styling your hair anyway</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li>good holding</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still good.  </li>
            <li>Im in school for a good 10 hrs</li>
            <li>and I loved that product but this</li>
            <li>It is scented, but it smells good.</li>
            <li>Ive always loved this pomade.</li>
            <li>Holds great and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>good stuff</li>
            <li>This gives me hold and a good shine to go with it.</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because for the price it is really good.</li>
            <li>It smells good but doesn&#x27;t hold the beat</li>
            <li>It has great hold and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I had heard good things about Suavecito</li>
            <li>This stuff smells so good</li>
            <li>REALLY GOOD</li>
            <li>so if I want a really good hold, I have to use a lot of it-</li>
            <li>well nothing a napkin can&#x27;t fix good stuff</li>
            <li>Good scent.</li>
            <li>It has a good hold</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>Good...</li>
            <li>Good riddance,</li>
            <li>Good gel.</li>
            <li>Good smell.</li>
            <li>This pomade will help you achieve superior styles.</li>
            <li>then a good rain can be disasterous for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I also think Tres Flores&#x27; hold is almost as good as Suaveceto Firme&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>good product but not for my hair</li>
            <li>I done a lot of research before buying, i have read some good reviews so decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>i loved the smell, it smelt like a cologne of some sort.</li>
            <li>good stuff at a good price.</li>
            <li>Could see myself using this for the rest of my life, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>BUT surprisingly its NOTHING like hair spray or hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extras: This company has sent me two jars that come in with the pomade on a 45 degree angle.</li>
            <li>Holds your hair perfectly all day, has great re-comb value through out the day, just the right amount of shine.</li>
            <li>Very nice product and a nice smell as well.</li>
            <li>I use the original formula and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It also has a great hold and is very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>This works for me great, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works great, smells great, washes out easy.</li>
            <li>I can tell you with full assurance that Suavecito works THE BEST for MY hair.</li>
            <li>Very good product and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Very good and washes out easy</li>
            <li>Suavecito is easy to wash out and has a very good hold.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product that offers excellent hold, mild scent, and is a  water soluble pomade which is awesome~</li>
            <li>The best quality for me is that it is water soluble, I love being able to wash it out when i not longer need it.</li>
            <li>Good product and love the smell!</li>
            <li>The hold is great, I just personally don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and a great price</li>
            <li>It smells great but the consistancy is more like a gel than a balm.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes me look better...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t radiate out, which is great because I love wearing cologne</li>
            <li>The smell is very very appealing.</li>
            <li>It ll reactivate too when your hands get damp (or comb) and u wanna reposition hair or fix your self up on the fly (which i love, between meetings).</li>
            <li>Good for the guy who doesn&#x27;t wear cologne but also prefers to smell nice.</li>
            <li>The Suavecita works just as good and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Good smell, great hold, and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>sure glad I did!!</li>
            <li>Good hold and very easy to wash out after</li>
            <li>I love the hold and style i get from this product!</li>

            <li>Smells great, washes out easily.</li>
            <li>After trying it for a couple of days I must say this is an excellent product as it provides a strong hold that will fit any hair type and style and wash off</li>
            <li>I had my amazing wife do a variant of the undercut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That said the hold is amazing and the 3~4$ can lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is also amazing.</li>
            <li>Suavecito is just amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff and</li>
            <li>This pomade does a fantastic job of holding my hair in place with no issues as well as preforms some sort of straightening effect which is great.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, holds all day.</li>
            <li>This pomade is amazing</li>
            <li>pomade would be amazing without the smell.</li>
            <li>This product works amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, makes me think of a cologne for you hair but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.  </li>
            <li>it has a nice cologne smell.</li>
            <li>I happen to know people who own a barber shop.  </li>
            <li>I bought this with a 1oz sample of Layrite Deluxe.</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on waxy, mixes nicely into damp hair and dries a bit like gel.</li>
            <li>Many kept raving about how this product works really good despite being a water soluble pomade.</li>
            <li>whatever shine smell is overwhelming  but smells good its a lil pricey though</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;This should give you an idea of what kind of texture and hair</li>
            <li>Nice shine though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly had never tried pomade</li>
            <li>It does smell nice and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works with every kind of hair</li>
            <li>I wish I could comment on the hold and shine of this product but to be honest, once it was in my hair, I washed it out.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a stronger hold, and this pomade works nicely for that</li>
            <li>and it has a good shine without being over the top wannabe-greaser.</li>
            <li>If you like a strong, squeaky clean smell with perfect hair-this is your product.</li>
            <li>this is the absolute best product for that job!</li>
            <li>Best of all it ain&#x27;t greasy, it is easy to clean off.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the kind of guy who uses hair gel or hair spray to keep that hair in its place, consider switching to a pomade instead.</li>
            <li>Comparable to uppercut deluxe and layrite.</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, nice product.  </li>
            <li>It also smells nice which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s kind of a hobby of mine).</li>
            <li>Has a nice barber-like smell to it as well that my wife loves.</li>
            <li>I very much love how good this smells.</li>
            <li>which is kind of a downer.</li>
            <li>hold is alright, but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>Great hold, perfect shine, nice body, combs I. Easy, washes out clean, and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>The scent is also really nice as well.</li>
            <li>It holds really well and gives my hair the perfect amount of shine I like.</li>
            <li>Nice shine.</li>
            <li>But honestly once I run out of this tub</li>
            <li>Its just a nice thing to do for customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its just a nice thing to do for customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Package was wrap very nicely with free sticker included.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and holds good washes out very easy</li>
            <li>oh the smell its just way too strong and isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant, but strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Works great at cool to middling temperatures.  </li>
            <li>Suavecito smells good, doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel and washes off your hands and out of your hair really easy with just water.</li>

            <li>Rinces out very easily with just water.</li>
            <li>It washes out with shampoo very easily unlike some oil based pomades.</li>
            <li>This makes it VERY easy for me to keep my hair styled without making it feel like I used a bottle of Elmers glue in my hair.</li>
            <li>Washes out very easily.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it&#x27;s my favorite!  </li>
            <li>Also it smells pretty good and isn&#x27;t too greasy!</li>
            <li>Works good on fine hair too.  </li>
            <li>washes out easily, styles easily and looks and smells great.</li>

            <li>The best water based pomade I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of others.</li>
            <li>The light smell is good anyway</li>
            <li>Started using this and smelled good and holds on pretty good.</li>
            <li>Its Great product and price is right.</li>
            <li>when I do it like this my hair is easily formable throughout the day!</li>
            <li>So strong that I&#x27;m knocking off 2 stars!  </li>
            <li>Very good texture and was able to style my hair with no problem, the hold is great and lasts very long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many pomades over the years, but this one stands out as the most effective in your hair, not just from appearance, but from function, smell, and application.  </li>
            <li>This is a great pomade that adds an excellent shine and firm hold to hair.  </li>
            <li>He has tried many products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Pretty happy with this stuff.</li>
            <li>In reality that doesn&#x27;t make the product good, but I felt cool having it in my Bathroom</li>
            <li>I say it’s a good deal considering it has strong hold and washes easily.</li>
            <li>But that is awesome, because it washes out very easily and doesn&#x27;t make you feel gross.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and awesome hold all day long.</li>
            <li>Nice that it is washes out with water and washes off your hands easy.</li>
            <li>It lets you comb your hair with easy but still holds nicely.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, though and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>has a nice sent to it that isnt overly strong.</li>
            <li>Holds everything in place nicely and is easy to work with</li>

            <li>Works better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I will not be adventuring anywhere else as I&#x27;m completely satisfied with Suavecito.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li>This stuff is smooth and has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Many compliments since the switch.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>Smells like that fresh smell you get when you walk out of a barber shop or a really good cologne</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I still find that much more preferable than the greasy, never-fully-washed-out feeling of wax-based pomades.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>and maybe sometime I may need a product more like a gel</li>
            <li>but I think I will be sticking with the Magic most days.</li>
            <li>i love it, it could have better hold but works as well as layrite.</li>
            <li>Wax will do the job for sure, but how likes having to wash your hair about 9 times in a row?  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for when you&#x27;ve fully combed your hair and want to make sure your hair doesn&#x27;t shift later on.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My favorite pomade.</li>
            <li>if you want  more greasy look ( this one is like a 4/10 on shine scale)</li>
            <li>Love the smell and holds well</li>
            <li>You can always add more if you need it as I found out when I let my hair grow a bit.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact it&#x27;s water-soluble</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a more stronger hold try their Firme hold which is supposed to have a stronger hold.</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s much better than most hair products I find in box stores.  </li>
            <li>and I happen to love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair is longer on top and in order to get it to hold still need to use hairspray.</li>
            <li>stuff looks okay,</li>
            <li>Also love the scent</li>
            <li>Sticks well and love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love Suavecito, its all I use.</li>
            <li>I too love it on him.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Feels more like hair gel than pomade</li>
            <li>I love it, as soon as I run out</li>
            <li>cuz both are outstanding products...</li>
            <li>love the scent, holds just as promised.</li>
            <li>His hair is awesome now even though it is still red!</li>
            <li>Gel works so much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works more like a gel then a pomade.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>When I run out, I will be ordering some more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>This works much better.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a bunch of similar producted and found this to provide the best hold with the greasy look.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>love that it is water soluble.  </li>
            <li>Suavecito is okay, it does not hold as well as Layrite.</li>
            <li>Better than gel for a side part (incorrectly referred to as a comb over.</li>
            <li>Most dressing just require a dab, this product required considerably more.  </li>
            <li>, suavecito, I consider to be better.</li>
            <li>Love this...bought it for my son ...</li>
            <li>This is definitely a good product for the price, it is worth checking out.</li>
            <li>I was much more &amp;#34;suave&amp;#34; after using this</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So I came running to Amazon to get some more Suavecito.</li>
            <li>holds great, smells better and washes out very easily!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it holds your hair more like a gel then Pomade</li>
            <li>My go to pomade and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Priced for the working man I can always afford to buy it and buy more; which I do.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and washes out like magic with just water.</li>
            <li>it has a musky odor, like my favorite cologne ( don&#x27;t ask what it is, my wife buys it, it&#x27;s in a brown-topped sprayer</li>
            <li>Most pomades leave my customers greasy and sticky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is better than all of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came fast and works great.</li>
            <li>Good hold, works into hair easily, washes out cleanly.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll echo what others have said: the smell coming from this product is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell of this pomade because it is more of a manly/formal/serious smell.</li>
            <li>Holy snap, you can feel the greatness of this product as you dip the tip of yoru gracious fingers and then give shape to some of the slickest, sexiest and most good-looking hair you&#x27;ll ever want.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 will buy again.</li>
            <li>and it also doesn&#x27;t make hair crusty like many hair gels do.</li>
            <li>Does what it says, but i have had better pomade.</li>
            <li>but the hold is ok.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better pomades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful; my wife loves it, but it definitely stays within your hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT....</li>
            <li>Suavecito was recommended to me by a barber, and I&#x27;m glad he did it.</li>
            <li>I love the container and artwork.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on the scent.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>anyhow, suavecito, in my opinion is better.</li>
            <li>suavecito washes out better than lay rite.</li>
            <li>suavecito is also much more easier to run through your hair because it doesn&#x27;t have that waxy feel.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used it on many occasions.</li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>The stuff is really fantastic, get some today!</li>
            <li>but I wish it had more.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more for them.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot better than Layrite.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product reading many reviews.</li>
            <li>Upon opening Suavecito, the smell was slightly overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I just wish I got more for the price.</li>
            <li>I use Suavecito when my hair is shorter, but when I let the top grow out to about 4 inches, I have to use something stronger.</li>
            <li>This Pomade is one of the better ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I style up and over the top like this: http://style.gq.com.au//media/images/6/5/8/2/0/658263-1_lp.jpg?155543</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairdresser and have given him many products to try .</li>
            <li>but, you&#x27;ve guessed it, more hair-pulls in the process.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m required to type more words than I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and it&#x27;s the best pomade I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I love the hold and look of the petroleum based, but getting it out is a PAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying lots of water based pomades, Suavecito is know the one I buy over and over again.  </li>
            <li>I love it and have already recommended it to a friend.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this pomade.</li>
            <li>It would easily be my favorite if the hold was a bit stronger.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to find the perfect essential for my hair.</li>
            <li>This was everything I wanted it to be and more</li>
            <li>Love this as an alternative to Hawleywood&#x27;s layrite.</li>
            <li>both he and I are in love with this.</li>
            <li>and once it dries just run your fingers thru for a more matted look while the shape still holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;think</li>
            <li>17 more words</li>
            <li>required17 more words</li>

            <li>Great product, will definitely be purchasing again.</li>

            <li>We were so happy to find it here to buy extra!</li>
            <li>It has a fantastic scent to it.</li>

            <li>Worked exactly as it said it would love it.</li>
            <li>: If you love shaving with a badger / boar hair brush and a straight edge or double-edge razor, you owe it to yourself to check this out!</li>
            <li>Enter this one that I originally borrowed from my brother.</li>
            <li>and i just stick with the original stuff rather than</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I tried this one first.</li>
            <li>Ordered 2 more after my first one ran out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best part, after work I can come home and spray a little water in and re-style before heading out for the night looking as fresh as I did to start the day.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the others, it is 100% water based, leaving your hair feeling clean and not greasy.</li>

            <li>Washes out clean.</li>
            <li>but it is super light</li>
            <li>Also, Suavecito doesn&#x27;t wash out as clean like Layrite</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different hair &amp;#34;glues&amp;#34;, and I think I like this one the best so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many positive reviews about this product on YouTube and here on Amazon too.  </li>
            <li>But it has a very cheap cologne smell that is very pungent.</li>
            <li>It has a manly smell, has just the right hold for my taste, and washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>its not too strong to a point where you need to comb your hair right away.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re down with strong smelling pomade, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>For me, I have fine curly/wavy hair ( no crazy fancy hair)</li>
            <li>Awsome pomade smells good and is better then other name brand products</li>
            <li>It lasted me close to two months using it everyday so the price is very fair.</li>
            <li>a quick note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suavecito has two pomades; the strong/firme hold and this one (original).</li>
            <li>Smells great arrived faster then expected.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but can be a bit overwhelming after a long day.  </li>
            <li>Save your $$$ I really wanted to love it</li>
            <li>The can is cool looking.</li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t get a full matte look.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice masculine smell and holds all day.</li>
            <li>This probably works alot better on straight hair but when I am done with this jar, I will be moving on to wax.</li>
            <li>really wanted it to work and smells ok too.</li>
            <li>I have a big beard and if I use a good amount it keeps it in place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had much luck with many gels or waxes.</li>
            <li>and it would probably take a truck full of cement to hold it, but</li>
            <li>I confess to having very difficult-to-manage hair, so hopefully others will have better luck.</li>
            <li>Overall good product and shipping was on time.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the product was more like wax, but when applied to damp hair, it was very workable.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t as good as pyrite or similar products.</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;ve said, it&#x27;s a sweet rum smell.</li>
            <li>He really likes it but would love it if it had stronger hold.</li>
            <li>smells like a barber shop- not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>There is no bad odor</li>
            <li>: im not a fan of the smell, its not a bad smell.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>Works into the hair very smoothly and holds nicely all day without ever dropping a single flake.</li>
            <li>By far the best product I have used in a long time!</li>
            <li>Came quick and smells good, just was a bit smaller of a container than i thought</li>
            <li>Smells pretty strong not a bad smell though.</li>
            <li>Another plus is this pomade is cheaper than most of the others out there who are way more expensive and just aren&#x27;t as good!</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit sweet and somehow old-fashioned, but isn&#x27;t overpowering and tends to fade fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Sorta reminds me of Irish Spring soap or just a good ole fresh shower clean smell...</li>
            <li>and if I put it in while my hair is wet it gives a very nice pliable effect where your hair keeps its place but will still move around.</li>
            <li>The subtle sweet smell and the none greasiness are wonderful.</li>
            <li>but I have found that it is strong at first but dissipates fairly quickly after application.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and is easier to use than the other non-water soluable products</li>
            <li>Great product, a co-worker of mine introduced it to me a while back, great for lazy people like me who doesn&#x27;t have time to comb their hair every morning</li>
            <li>well it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Drys too quickly for this reason I rated a one star.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to achieve more shine from this product I would suggest using another product as a top coat for further shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It drys quickly and that sticky feel goes away.</li>
            <li>But, even after applying and combing through my hair, my hair quickly becomes unruly looking.</li>
            <li>that super hold both of them make.</li>
            <li>PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;IT CAME QUICK IN THE MAIL.</li>
            <li>It melts in and smears better into my hand, and only a dime size is needed as i have an undercut hair cut with maybe 4-5 inches of hair up top for now.</li>
            <li>I personally find Tres Flores water-based moulding pomade to be a better choice all the way around; it has a pleasant fragrance, is easy to style, keeps your hair soft, and is much, much cheaper than Suaveceto  Firme.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is very overwhelming for me and actually caused me to have headaches and dizziness.</li>
            <li>Really great hold with a slight shine, but the smell</li>
            <li>I bought this for my thick hair and it holds great, and washes out super easy.</li>
            <li>Once i got my hair styled like i wanted, i let it dry and loved the smell of it through out the day.</li>
            <li>, the smell is not to over powering very easy to apply to your hair only thing is I wish there was more in a bottle of it haha.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my 1 year old son!</li>
            <li>very recommended!!</li>
            <li>We will come back for sure!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>The smell is great, the hold is great and it&#x27;s a little easier for me to apply after my hair is slightly</li>
            <li>B001JTGO7Y WAVE BUILDER Seamless Du-Rag BLACK]]) for 10-15 minutes, will come out looking perfectly molded and waved out.  </li>
            <li>I get best results whenever I apply on just a bit dryer than damp hair, and rub it in my hair and blow dry it on low.</li>
            <li>I open it and it has a super nice smell and a caramel coke color.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It does provide a medium to strong hold for a few hours, which isn&#x27;t good</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, the smell is nice and it works well on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>Great Hold with just a little product.</li>
            <li>This stuff took me a bit of trial and error as I haven&#x27;t really used a product like this before, but once I got used to it, I&#x27;ll certainly be buying more.</li>
            <li>Good hold - though the firme hold is even better - without getting a hard shell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but holds well, washes out very easily, smells great, and requires only a small amount so lasts forever.</li>
            <li>The water solubility is great for washing out at the end of the day, but if you accidentally get your hair wet or sweat too much, your hair will start to lose hold.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, almost imperceptible scent, lasts all day and washes out well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice touch, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it simply for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And now they look fresh as ever.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot here, so this will last me through 2 or 3 tubs of the kind you would buy at the grocery.</li>
            <li>It will not hold up in warm weather nor will it last all day.</li>
            <li>Suavecito pomade is a really nice durable pomade I would buy different ones to try them out</li>
            <li>This stuff is sticky like glue and smells like success.</li>
            <li>I have wavy thick hair and it takes more than the recommended amount for a good hold.</li>
            <li>the old formula was better.</li>
            <li>and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Looks way more natural.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and are sensitive to many of the lab created (i.e. antibacterial hand soap) smells</li>
            <li>They like the hold and the fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Suavecito has more of an Old Spice scent.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool pomade.</li>
            <li>this pomade is great... holds well without being stiff &amp; best of all, you can actually easilly wash it off your hands, unlike may other thicker pomades..</li>
            <li>I have tried other more &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34; pomades before and they all got the job done for the most part but nothing like Sauvecito.</li>
            <li>First, (after reading alot of the reviews on here) I have to say that the smell goes away as quickly.</li>
            <li>version since I dont need to used as much as the Original hold</li>
            <li>It washes right out with one rinse.</li>
            <li>Washes right out.  </li>
            <li>and if so I&#x27;d get some if the price was right.</li>
            <li>but just right.</li>
            <li>It holds and washes right out....</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the right type of Pomade to put in my hair.</li>
            <li>then this stuff comes right off.  </li>
            <li>Washes right out with just water.</li>
            <li>My hair is about 9 inches long on top and the sides are tapered and I use 2.5 finger tip scoops of it and hair seams to still be pliable and free.</li>
            <li>And full day of lounging in the sun, and the pomade still held my hair, which was the &#x27;longest&#x27; it had been in some time (but still short by most standards) in place...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not bother by these smells then by all means get it, it does hold the your hair nicely without the crunch and is easily restyled with a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will last all day and is very easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>and I put it on when my hair is not too wet nor too dry to get the best control and shine!</li>
            <li>This is a great pomaid, with a suddle not overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>I have tried a bunch of different pomades on the market, I want to smell good and look good because in my line of work (male exotic dancer) you want the fellas to know that you and your moves are slick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products that were good, but suavecito set the bar higher.  </li>
            <li>The best hair gel, I have ever used, wet or dry!</li>
            <li>For the sophisticated suave look, I will use a little more product and apply when my hair is damp.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with this pomade is the scent; it is strong and never seems to fade, even after two days!</li>
            <li>This product works great to hold my hair down and back all day, and then washed out easily at night.</li>
            <li>Works great and you only need a tiny amount to do the job.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone looking for product that provides a strong hold that lasts all day and washes off easily at a fairly reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The bottom line, a good hair product should be easy to go into your hair, style, and then come right out the next day with minimal hair loss/pulls.  </li>
            <li>I can slick the hair back like most would do with pomade but the great thing with this stuff</li>
            <li>The smell is great, and it has enough hold to last, but if you need to refresh it just add a little water to your hair and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>Tried out American Crew and was pretty happy, but once I came up on some Suavecito, I never turned back.</li>
            <li>For a water-based pomade Suavicito is better than the rest, and at only $10 you get a superior product for less.</li>
            <li>In dry hair it gives excellent hold, but less shine.</li>
            <li>Smells very nice and does a decent job, but I wish it was just a little stronger in hold.</li>
            <li>Good product, holds my hair down and won&#x27;t crust two thumbs up!</li>
            <li>Great for my super thick hair!</li>
            <li>Water soluble; you only need a dime sized dollop for a full head of hair; can be reactivated/restyled if wetted during the course of the day; I love it; doesn&#x27;t flake and doesn&#x27;t make your hands greasy like Murray&#x27;s; highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The hold is amazing even when it is still wet</li>
            <li>This is my first pomade by suggestion from a buddy of mine.  </li>
            <li>* Great long lasting hold for the way I style my hair</li>
            <li>* Great for my curly thick hair</li>
            <li>I think i&#x27;d be interested in a 10oz container</li>
            <li>can looks pretty bicthin on the counter though</li>
            <li>I have tried many different hair products to get the look I am going for.  </li>
            <li>Expect to use more (obviously).</li>
            <li>On a hot day (&amp;#62;85F), has a tendency to get kinda goopy.</li>
            <li>The extra water won&#x27;t move your hair out of place and will lock in the hold of the pomade more.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone that is interested in buying it.</li>
            <li>Helps keep the hair exactly how you want it styled.  </li>
            <li>Just bought it for the first time and man</li>
            <li>It does when you&#x27;re first applying it.  </li>
            <li>I def will be purchasing this more in the future</li>
            <li>Light masculine fragrance.  </li>
            <li>like most gels, no white residue</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a water-based pomade as an alternative to using petroleum-based stuff, Suavecito works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very suave!</li>
            <li>I alternate between this and AXE pomade, but I like this better for the scent.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Ive purchased this multiple times and am satisfied every time,</li>
            <li>This is the second water based pomade that I&#x27;ve tried and I love it.</li>
            <li>the first pomade that works for my hair type.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny when you tell them it&#x27;s your hair product and not cologne.  </li>
            <li>My son really likes this hair product!</li>
            <li>White, skinny guy, brown hair, about 4 inches on top, faded on the sides.</li>
            <li>Been using for about 3 months now and would recommend, although this is my first pomade</li>
            <li>Also, it holds up well riding with the top back and even on my motorcycle.</li>
            <li>This is the first time using a pomade and man</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun to see it straight some times</li>
            <li>First off, I did not purchase this stuff from amazon</li>
            <li>The first time I got this</li>
            <li>works well, and does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Can style many different hairstyles</li>
            <li>Overall pretty pleased</li>
            <li>Does wash out nicely and can be adjusted by running a wet comb through it to rejuvenate it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty put off by the smell.  </li>
            <li>First time user and the smell is enchanting.</li>
            <li>Top class seller and will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>The pomade is more of a gel than, well, actual pomade.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever had to give up on a product before a week&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>I never had to use morethan one comb to style my hair into place; this is another first.  </li>
            <li>Its long lasting and smells great.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair much more pliable than simply wetting it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of pomades on my hair and Suavecito is my second favorite pomade.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I read was about the smell.</li>
            <li>I like this pomade more than most more expensive options.  </li>
            <li>First opening it</li>
            <li>Packaging is actually appealing so if left out, it doesnt look like some dated hair care product my mom use to use in the 80s</li>
            <li>this for me has exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>First time user of pomade...</li>
            <li>All i&#x27;d ask for is more shine with this product, It turns matte after an hour, The scent will last till you wash it out</li>
            <li>First, the product does indeed look like a brown Jello like on reviewer said.  </li>
            <li>As the name suggest it smooth to put into the hair keeping it down for the day with a pleasent smell not over the top.</li>
            <li>I have tried many pomades both old and new.</li>
            <li>The Suavecito looks very dense but goes on light and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and the pomade looks nice, clean and fresh cut when i first put it on but to hold up my pompadour, it takes at least 3 or 4 finger scoops to do so.</li>
            <li>Having fine hair makes a little more of a challenge.  </li>
            <li>After seeing and reading so many positive reviews about Suavecito, I finally decided to give it try.</li>
            <li>It smells decent and is worth a month or more of use with a short cut</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got super wavy hair that defies any product, now for someone with normal hair</li>
            <li>The original has the same look and smell as the strong, and holds quite nicely just not as firmly.  </li>
            <li>Little bit goes a long way for this product and has a good hold for sure deffinitly reccomended.</li>
            <li>Other classic pomades such as Murray&#x27;s Superior or Dax are simply a pain to wash off despite providing a good hold.</li>
            <li>In the last 2 weeks I&#x27;ve ordered about half a dozen hair gel/clay products that are double or more the price of this product and this by far has been the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The shine is decent, just barely a shade better than Murray&#x27;s pomade.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky when I do his hair like the other stuff did.</li>
            <li>Meh....smells great however it gets hard like LayRite and is really matte finish not for me.</li>
            <li>Regardless this is a great buy no need to spent $50+ for another pomade that works the same.</li>
            <li>A clean, masculine scent with hints of spice and lime that radiates off of you.</li>
            <li>Currently I am using Magic Sporting Waves which I really like.</li>
            <li>I had an extremely long (and pretty darn respectable)</li>
            <li>Since you&#x27;re obviously interested in pomades, just go ahead and take your man card back with the easy purchase of Suavecito Pomade.</li>
            <li>You might need to apply more of the product than I do for a &amp;#34;wet-look&amp;#34;, but even a fingertip of this stuff ensures your hair will style and stay all day long.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much hair gel.</li>
            <li>Pretty much an all day hold.</li>
            <li>I really tried to like this product I really did, now I come from using American Crew Fiber and wanted a more gel/wax substance because of Fiber having a tendency to clump up.</li>
            <li>Once you apply some the scent is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>Suavecito has a deliciously sweet smell, while still remaining subtly masculine.</li>
            <li>I really wish I would have spent more money and got my money&#x27;s worth 4 Oz</li>
            <li>I have tried many products for a pompadour, but the only ones that really work are American Crew&#x27;s Fiber and Murray&#x27;s Light Pomade.  </li>
            <li>Only for \\&quot;true original\\&quot; men!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oily-ness quickly dissipates, leaving hair that just feels like it&#x27;s naturally grown itself to your style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to brush later in the day and maintains the shape and hold you would want.</li>
            <li>The hold is strong and has a deep shine, and washes out with ease.</li>
            <li>When you open it you can smell it and it smells strong</li>
            <li>To my pleasant surprise, the consistency of this pomade was way easier to work into my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend Bead Head for men Pure texture molding paste if you want a strong hold without the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This pomade offers an excellent hold, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I never had so many problems with a single hair product in my life until I came across,</li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying this going forward.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only thing is a travel size needs to be created, I always carry on my bag for business travel and this size is to large.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a large amount of hair-pulls just putting it in.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t appreciate the large amount frizz</li>
            <li>Smells ok not too strong like others suggested to me its hardly even scented.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The sheen of this product really depends on me on how dry my hair is when I apply it (more dry &#x3D; more matte).</li>
            <li>Great hold, style, and works with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>Suavecito has a strong hold and it will last you the whole day.</li>
            <li>If you have been searching for the right pomade or you&#x27;re new to the world of pomades give Suavecito a try.</li>
            <li>and it has a pretty decent shine.  </li>
            <li>persue the classic !</li>
            <li>Nice smell and hold but a little too waxy/hard for my taste.</li>
            <li>Smells like cologne, masculine scent which smells beautiful and is also subtle which won&#x27;t mask or clash with whatever cologne or scent you have on.</li>
            <li>Looks better applied in my hair with a large wide gapped tooth comb&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good water-soluble pomades are hard to find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly strong if you like a perfumed product, but I&#x27;d rather have a much more subtle</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,good product for the price</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>Very manageable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really unsure how to use this stuff</li>
            <li>Really like the texture it hold hair with.  </li>
            <li>Holds very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very manageable, even in damp hair.</li>
            <li>The Sporting Waves washes out so much easier than the Murrays and yet retains the reworkability that I like in pomades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I received it really fast</li>
            <li>really likes it for her hair</li>
            <li>I really like the scent on this.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li>I was a Murray&#x27;s guy for a while and that stuff is straight up grease</li>
            <li>maybe Im expecting too much.</li>
            <li>The produce is similar to steadfast, in both texture and hold however my hair(thick</li>
            <li>but this ranks high on my list!</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and it is pain trying to style it from time to time and finding a product that will hold my hair in place the whole day.</li>
            <li>and then bam ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like using Suavecito pomade.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do edges very well.  </li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t get much in each container.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>It rinses out much easier to.  </li>
            <li>Very musky and gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>Every morning when I get ready, it&#x27;s like a routine to smell it before I put it in my hair.</li>
            <li>He absolutely LOVES this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff holds really well</li>
            <li>i style my hair to the side(comb over) and after applying this product everything holds in place very well.</li>
            <li>Neither work very well.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable and product delivers to its expectations.</li>
            <li>I like that Suavecito forms the shape of my hair very well..</li>
            <li>I really dig this pomade.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>And can I say that I appreciate that this pomade has a reasonable price?</li>
            <li>However, the cologne scent is too much for me.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>really works with my wavy hair</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a much softer look/feel.</li>
            <li>It also works for the modern man!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It also made my forehead very greasy.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I should have gone straight to this.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my longish straight hair when it&#x27;s damp in the morning.  </li>
            <li>You also cant beat the price; his barber charges twice as much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a gel, it&#x27;s not even really even pomade -</li>
            <li>It has semi wet look which I love.</li>
            <li>Shine isn&#x27;t really my thing</li>
            <li>Makes your hear bee very manageable, if you got curly of waive hair depends on the amount you put on it makes it go</li>
            <li>straight hear</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I really like the consistency, fragrance and price.</li>
            <li>Smells too much like Worcestershire sauce for me</li>
            <li>is you sweat too much though.</li>
            <li>but i do my hair at night so getting ready for work in the morning goes quicker.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use as much of this pomade to fix your hair compared to others.  </li>
            <li>This pomade works very well.</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t matter how much I use.</li>
            <li>Wish it was cheaper and available locally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Murray&#x27;s before and dislike the viscosity, makes it harder to apply and rinse out, although I appreciate the hold a lot more.  </li>
            <li>Works well, but not as much hold as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well</li>
            <li>people might really like it</li>
            <li>I like this stuff just as much as Layrite, but it is cheaper.</li>
            <li>and he wants to reorder.</li>
            <li>And I was really self-conscious about it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very tacky to style into place.</li>
            <li>Who has time to do this much experimenting with a hair product?</li>
            <li>I really have nothing else</li>
            <li>I purchased that pomade because I figured pomade is pomade, and there couldn&#x27;t be much difference in how they work with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had much luck re-style my hair with water based pomades, so</li>
            <li>Nothing much else to say.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suavecito Pomade made a difference the very moment I opened it.</li>
            <li>And it really was.</li>
            <li>Really, she asked me out.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast shipping</li>
            <li>Holds much better if your hair is not too wet, as it is WATER-BASED.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tries every pomade known to man most of them hold, but are a bitch to wash out of your hair.</li>
            <li>it hardens  up to much</li>
            <li>I have normal/thin hair and this product works really well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone really.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>VERY MUCH.&lt;br /&gt;IT</li>
            <li>Suavecito was my very 1st pomade i have ever used.</li>
            <li>Depending on your hair type (mine is straight)</li>
            <li>Pretty slick in the hair I like it, it smells nice too.</li>
            <li>If you want a nice pompadour or vintage hairstyle with your hair parted back like my husband styles his, this product probably won&#x27;t be enough to hold the style.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice firm hold on my head</li>
            <li>i added tres flores for a good shone and a solid wet look.</li>
            <li>So I went with the &amp;#34;Firme/Strong hold.&amp;#34; It was good but way too thick for my liking.</li>
            <li>The smell is extremely strong all day long and after a while it made me feel nauseous.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many other pomades, this one does not run onto your skin.</li>
            <li>It is much better than any other brand names that I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li>so claims, I will trying Shiners Gold next, thats what I originally wanted to buy</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheaper than most other things that are what this is.  </li>
            <li>Its not greasy like most other pomade products</li>
            <li>Definitely will purchase again, long lasting and works great</li>
            <li>You can apply to wet hair for more of a hardened look or dry hair for a more natural feel.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, combs thru without tugging, and it doesn&#x27;t dry or flake.  </li>
            <li>decent price shipper shipped fast</li>
            <li>It had great hold with only a small dab needed at a time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good smell, but you can smell it over a subtle cologne, which is not desirable.</li>
            <li>The hold is pretty good as I have thin hairs.</li>
            <li>great for slick clean look or messy as well</li>
            <li>I only need about half to a three quarters of a fingertip to get a good hold.</li>
            <li>If you want more control get the next step up from this stuff- it holds and controls more, but at the cost of drying hard.</li>
            <li>I think it smells better than any other pomade I&#x27;ve used, but all pomades seems to lose their scent quickly, making that factor take a back seat to hold.</li>
            <li>Put it in dry and my hair will be fine all day and if I need to readjust just add some water and recomb.</li>
            <li>Nice aroma, with a small amount do the job.</li>
            <li>And finally, I didn&#x27;t appreciate the sweet bay-rum smell that had me craving alcohol all day.</li>
            <li>Normally by the end of the day, (I work in a very relaxed office setting)</li>
            <li>Not only is it a great pomade, but you would be hard pressed to find a better company to order from, not only are they fast and efficient they always throw in special little goodies and thank yous in their orders.</li>
            <li>My new go-to hair product!</li>
            <li>In damp hair it gives more shine but less hold.</li>
            <li>typically wear a pompador most days.</li>
            <li>Wet your hair a bit and you can restyle easily.</li>
            <li>definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that when I went back to my barber to buy more, they were out.</li>
            <li>Some dudes on here need help with hair and not be so quick to give products low ratings.</li>
            <li>bit more expensive than most pomades</li>
            <li>and I will definitely order more when I get low.</li>
            <li>particular pomade has a woodsy cologne scent to it, which adds to its value.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a mild soapy smell that I actually kinda dig (and so does my girlfriend).</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>It goes on like a gel and holds decently throughout the day.</li>
            <li>the pomade doesn&#x27;t keep my hair in place and the hairs curl back quickly.</li>
            <li>Works for a classic sculpted look.</li>
            <li>Decent hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments from girls when laying next to them or being close enough.</li>
            <li>Second favorite product and smell Next to layrite</li>
            <li>The hold of the pomade is decent, but it is still inferior to Layrite.  </li>
            <li>The color looks like root beer, the smell is like coke &amp; tea tree, The hold on this pomade is almost the same as the Layrite super hold.</li>
            <li>Could be I&#x27;m not using enough, but it&#x27;s a bit hard to work though my hair when it&#x27;s mostly dry (which is what it recommends for best hold).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for pomping, may want to mix it with some murray&#x27;s super-light to keep it re-workable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this pomade.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Every time I try another water based pomade I just end up dissapointed because it just does not stack up to the high bar that Suavecito has set.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>-- Maybe I am just more sensitive to the smell than other users.</li>
            <li>A little scoop works for me, when I put more it just flattens my hair.</li>
            <li>can get a little overwhelming throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Washes out with little effort and nothing more then just water</li>
            <li>I switch to axe pomade, holds a little better</li>
            <li>Plus, you can go for a more solid slicked look if you put it in while your hair is wet, or you can do the more natural look by putting it on dry hair.</li>
            <li>Our hair styles are a little less demanding of the hold, and my kids ONLY want suavecito because they love the smell and their friends and teachers have told them they love it!</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products before, like Bed Hair wax, Axe Clean Cut Look Pomade, other brands of Gel, you name it.</li>
            <li>sent on the other hand is too strong and perfumed.  </li>
            <li>Feels kind of like a fancy gel but doesn&#x27;t get rock hard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I still more or less agree with the above, it isn&#x27;t as strong of a hold, BUT this has become our only hair product these days!</li>
            <li>if you have a particular style you are new to like me</li>
            <li>if you have a particular style you are new to like me</li>
            <li>It has a great scent and isn&#x27;t difficult to wash out.</li>
            <li>Fiber and normal murrays pomade don&#x27;t do this</li>
            <li>The first week, I was in Southern California during a heat wave (90+ degree weather for 5 straight days).  </li>
            <li>I have recently been trying to look more adult with my hair, and I saw this product in my local barbershop.  </li>
            <li>only stuff that keeps the style pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>Although I prefer the firm hold better, this product rocks.  </li>
            <li>However the product smell is unappealing and long-lasting, the pomade is not as good as I assumed it to be.</li>
            <li>Good product for thin hair,not mine.</li>
            <li>you are tired of ruining the collars of your shirts, and all your pillow cases, this is a good way to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feels kind of thick but not waxy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that is new to pomades or is trying to avoid petroleum pomades.</li>
            <li>Light, but holds well without giving your hair that super glue / hard feel.</li>
            <li>It has a a medium firmness once it dries up but not hard or crunchy</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and stiff.</li>
            <li>The hold is moderate but it gets you there if you apply the right amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll run to the restroom, dampen my hands and work my hair again, and it comes right back to the hold it had in the morning.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it was not worth the cheaper price because of the weaker hold, strong odor, and greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>I guess it all comes down to smell sensitivity, but for me it&#x27;s just too strong.</li>
            <li>Recommend if you are on the fence and wanna try a new pomade.</li>
            <li>I would have never known about Sauvecito unless it was for my new barber.</li>
            <li>so I am still new to the pomade product lines.</li>
            <li>hello to the new age of hair products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively new (about a month in) to a haircut that requires the use of pomade to style.</li>
            <li>Also, the fragrance is nowhere near as strong as other pomades I&#x27;ve used (Layrite, for example).</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, after giving Suavecito a month of use, I have gone back to Murray&#x27;s Super Light (much lighter than Murray&#x27;s original).</li>
            <li>you want easy rinse out and less</li>
            <li>You only need to apply it with medium pressure with your hands, then as it starts to get harder to slide your hands, add more pressure.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have the pomade to style it properly, I can finally appreciate the fantastic haircut I was given.</li>
            <li>It holds all day and can easily be combed again if I mess it up.</li>
            <li>It still gives me a strong hold that will lasts all day and even until the next time you shower as long as you add water.</li>
            <li>Lasted a long time, worth the $$.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried plenty other regular and water soluble pomades and admit this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this gel, but I starting to like it</li>
            <li>most pomades come in 2oz jars but this is a 4oz jar for only about $12 and it will last a while too since you will only need about a nickle size dab of this stuff to comb your hair</li>
            <li>But other pomades I have tried don&#x27;t actually hold my hair in place for more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other pomades and was a bit unsure about this one, but I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was first exposed to the product in my local barber shop.</li>
            <li>Only downside if you&#x27;re somewhere hot</li>
            <li>I wondered, \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li>but the scent is a little strong</li>
            <li>Helpful hint: if you have a spray bottle and want a strong hold after you&#x27;ve applied this to your hair then give your hair a little spritz with the bottle before leaving anywhere.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son who has curly hair and uses pomade to smooth it down.</li>
            <li>Sua Vecito has a clean smell, and is not greasy like other pomades.</li>
            <li>keeps my hair in place and makes it look more natural than any other big name brand pomade.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a clear and rather pretty deep amber.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and is a really firm hold, can adjust your hair during the day if needed.</li>
            <li>This pomade came in quickly, on its expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>Too thick for my straight hair and scent is too strong.</li>
            <li>Easily moldable and does not leave your hair feeling stiff.</li>
            <li>The original hold pomade, holds my really thick, curly hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>Not stiff or sticky and leaves no yucky residue in hair.</li>
            <li>but it keeps my hair flowing and not stiff.</li>
            <li>He has very thick hair and this stuff combs nicely through the hair.  </li>
            <li>Works as well if not better than the larger name brand hair products and washes out very easily.  </li>
            <li>for the price this is crazy great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Firm hold but light texture (if that makes sense), and clearly high-quality stuff.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, not too thick and smells great.</li>
            <li>After the very first time I used suavecito I am hooked, wont buy any other pomade.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, greasy, smelly.</li>
            <li>Your hair feels natural again after an hour.</li>
            <li>Letting my hair grow out from a buzz cut and it takes a while until I have enough length so my hair doesn&#x27;t stick straight out in all directions.</li>
            <li>then Murray&#x27;s though with as much hold as Layrite only a bit easier on the pocketbook.</li>
            <li>This works and is reasonably priced, but it won&#x27;t last all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as hair hold, I cant complain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was considerably cheaper on Amazon, so I figured I would pick some up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair stays soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I imagine a 4 oz container can last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin though</li>
            <li>Our 23 year old son loves this product.</li>
            <li>It arrived early and in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Not heavy.  </li>
            <li>It has that old barbershop smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this for three days so far and the smell is giving me a headache.</li>
            <li>you always wanted to but were too much of a pussy to actually ever do.</li>
            <li>But the big issue for me is that it is very sticky and &amp;#34;waxy-like&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m ready for the next one.</li>
            <li>I bought this and Imperial Pomade Gel at the same time to try them both, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of pomades without finding something I really like.</li>
            <li>I used to use murray&#x27;s a long time ago, which is pretty hardcore stuff</li>
            <li>I prefer NON musky smells, sort of like old spice redzone deoderant (Swagger) or Axe Anarchy body wash.</li>
            <li>This stuff is far superior to any of the common big brand junk at your local supermarket.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that it seems that the company that I purchased from (not Suavecito) placed their own label on the jar and it covered the instructions.</li>
            <li>Of all the brands I have tried American Crew and Redken seemed to work the good - just not great.  </li>
            <li>But for everyday no running, heavy lifting work this pomade is really good.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a good price point comparing with those expensive ones out there</li>
            <li>It seems like more of a medium weight hold, but maybe because of my hair type (thick wavy).</li>
            <li>Good product just not perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li>Second, the smell is very overwhelming, and it&#x27;s not a pleasant one either.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different products, this stuff is a step above all the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel stiff, like cheap hair gels with tons of alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used A LOT of different types of pomade and hair products- Brylcreem, Groom &amp; Clean, American Crew Pomade, American Crew Grooming Cream, Hawleywood&#x27;s Lay Rite to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Putting it through my hair was also a surprise, after it was in, my hands were pretty much dry and non sticky.</li>
            <li>What sucks is when i have those little hair pop up when im out and about and try to use water to slick it back down, it only just comes up more since it is water based; Overall great product i love it.</li>
            <li>Plus I really like saying &amp;#34;suavecito!&amp;#34; Sometimes I blurt it out for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li>I originally started with American Crew but due to is medium hold, my curly hair started to go to its natural shape</li>
            <li>It will dry a little on the crispy side, though just run a wet comb to reactivate the pomade and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I hadn&#x27;t feel so confident in months.</li>
            <li>got the super hold and it holds but not super.</li>
            <li>its pretty flexiable, i can actually pick up a couple strands of my hair and it will fall back into place when i let go.</li>
            <li>The second week, I was In Hawaii and this go around, it was the most humid that I recall in the past 4 years.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is the smell can be a little too strong.</li>
            <li>only thing that softens it up is high temperature like being under the sun for 2-3 hours at a time.</li>
            <li>Never going back to murrays or high life after using this stuff.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a pomade or similar to style their hair.</li>
            <li>It lays very heavy on your head all day just as heavy as Murrays Superior.</li>
            <li>Hair looks smooth and slick, but its not the strongest stuff out there.</li>
            <li>Blowdry your hair into the style you want it (get it wet first of course).</li>
            <li>If you want am orthodox water based pomade, get some Cool Grease.</li>
            <li>It kind of works in like a butch wax, but less stiff and it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue on your hands afterwards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend trying this product if you are on the fence or just looking for a new pomade to try.</li>
            <li>the advice i got was invaluable... and my wifey LOVESSS the new look after 12 yrs the same look with her.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the advice i got was invaluable... and my wifey LOVESSS the new look after 12 yrs the same look with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me put it like this, When I shower and get out and towel dry my hair it stands straight</li>
            <li>Is it easy to rub into the hands and hair at least?  </li>
            <li>I am sure it will take me at least 3 months to go through the entire jar.</li>
            <li>All it takes is water to completely wash out, just be careful not to add too much water during the day when reworking it.</li>
            <li>Seems promising ; the hold is a bit weird ; love the smell</li>
            <li>With thick hair, it has been much more convenient to keep it short and not have to deal with the day-to-day maintenance.  </li>
            <li>It has a subtle and pleasant smell, not overpowering or harsh at all.</li>
            <li>I would probably recommend the strong hold Suavacito for those with thick hair though.</li>
            <li>Later I find out from my cousin that they pretty much just try to copy everything layrite makes and does it a little cheaper</li>
            <li>Smell is fine - hardly there.  </li>
            <li>The hold could be better, but I cant really complain since I have extremely dark thick hair</li>
            <li>For a more matte look, I will wait for my hair to get fully dry and then apply a small dab of it onto my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried black &amp; white, Voodoo brew, Dax, Layrite, Layrite super hold, AND J.s Sloane...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff the only problem that I have with it is that as the day goes on I tend to get a greasy face due to the product running down my forehead</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, it has a firm hold, and it washes out very easily.</li>
            <li>but.... I want more shine.&lt;br /&gt;It looks shiny initially, but after it dries it dulls a little.</li>
            <li>I got this product because of all the positive reviews, but it&#x27;s just like all the other hair gels.  </li>
            <li>No need to get complicated, this pomade does what I need it to do and the shipping is always amazing, always receive it within 2 days of ordering.</li>
            <li>My husband has short straight hair and our son has long curly hair.  </li>
            <li>it works really well especially with people with long hair.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets in this purchase</li>
            <li>which was this product coming out of my hair when i barely sweat.</li>
            <li>The hold is nowhere near as solid as Layrite though not as greasy or petroleum like Murray&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>i would say its a cross between old spice and axe body spray.</li>
            <li>It will leave your hands and head smelling like musk or some sort of old spice the entire day.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this for my 6 year old son.</li>
            <li>This pomade is really not THAT much cheaper than Layrite, if you have Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li>Upon receiving it and opening the lid, two things are readily apparent.  </li>
            <li>Suavecito tends to act as a straightener in my hair (I&#x27;m Caucasian with relatively thick, pretty straight hair).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff for close to if not a year and finally got around to purchasing a whole crap load after moving and being 20 miles from the nearest great barbershop.</li>
            <li>Love the product however the container was broken when it arrived</li>
            <li>Ordered this on kind of a random whim not knowing if I would like it or not, when i got it turns out</li>
            <li>hair type at the time of this product&#x27;s usage: thick, coarse Asian hair that is medium length at the top with bald fade at the sides and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I comb it and want it every time with ease, no overwhelming scent (no real scent I can detect), when I re-comb using a wet comb it allows me to re-comb easily and stays in place like my first application.</li>
            <li>I can deal with the mediocre hold, but I really can&#x27;&#x27;t stand the strong smell of this pomade</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the scent of this gel is crazy strong!!  </li>
            <li>I have tried other products, but this is my absolute go to.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really recommend this.</li>
            <li>and I would have like Suavecito to not dry like it did.</li>
            <li>It applies easily to dry hair, holds like a champ and washes out completely with water!</li>
            <li>Apply dry for a stiff hold or apply while your hair is damp for a nice hold that isn&#x27;t stiff.  </li>
            <li>used this product for the first time a few days ago.</li>
            <li>A chunk of my pomade was missing when i opened my lid for the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve literally spent 45 minutes just trying to pull off a decent pompadour with three different combs.</li>
            <li>No problem, just wet your comb and run it through your hair, and &amp;#34;Suavecito&amp;#34; your do is like new again.</li>
            <li>you have to do is wet and comb, and it&#x27;s just like new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suavecito doesn’t provide a high shine compared to other products.</li>
            <li>In less than a minute, I had my hair ready to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ended up being a non waste of money since my husband uses it on his long golden locks of Thor</li>
            <li>This product really comes down to personal preference.</li>
            <li>But my boys have very thick hair, and this isn&#x27;t quite strong enough.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Murray&#x27;s and my hair is a little more harder than that and less pliable (using about the same amount).</li>
            <li>Plus it lasts all day, you can even restyle it with a little bit of water (too much and it will wash out).</li>
            <li>The only down side of going with the water based pomade for me is that if you live in a rainy climate (like I do!)</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> Suavecito has produced an excellent product here as this is the best pomade I have used thus far.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great at holding your hair in place, and does about as good of a job as one can expect at duplicating the look of a nice greasy pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a good hold and arrived within the delivery period.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need a lot to achieve a good hold.  </li>
            <li> the smell Is good.</li>
            <li> .it&#x27;s also a boost that it smells good at work</li>

            <li> Good hold</li>
            <li> it  works really good</li>
            <li> It works great,its just not as good as when the barber used it on me....</li>
            <li> Works good</li>
            <li> kind of makes my hair feel oily though otherwise its great</li>
            <li> For people who like gel, this is a good hybrid of pomade and gel.</li>
            <li> you are getting a good bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  </li>
            <li> good hold</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> I learned this from a good friend of mine.</li>
            <li> B000142NMI Murray&#x27;s Superior Hair Dressing Pomade]] - A joke.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> but i definitely loved how it held my hair in place, even on airy days.</li>
            <li> It does smell good, but it&#x27;s just not for me.  </li>
            <li> Good product... been using for some time and depending on the amount, you get the desired control/hold.  </li>
            <li> Great hold and shines nice.</li>
            <li> good thing is its a mellow smell that goes away after about 2hrs.</li>
            <li> Good Pomade.</li>
            <li> the smell of this product is sooo good.</li>
            <li> Good for styling your hair anyway</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li> good holding</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still good.  </li>
            <li> Im in school for a good 10 hrs</li>
            <li> and I loved that product but this</li>
            <li> It is scented, but it smells good.</li>
            <li> Ive always loved this pomade.</li>
            <li> Holds great and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> good stuff</li>
            <li> This gives me hold and a good shine to go with it.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because for the price it is really good.</li>
            <li> It smells good but doesn&#x27;t hold the beat</li>
            <li> It has great hold and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> I had heard good things about Suavecito</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good</li>
            <li> REALLY GOOD</li>
            <li> so if I want a really good hold, I have to use a lot of it-</li>
            <li> well nothing a napkin can&#x27;t fix good stuff</li>
            <li> Good scent.</li>
            <li> It has a good hold</li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> Good...</li>
            <li> Good riddance,</li>
            <li> Good gel.</li>
            <li> Good smell.</li>
            <li> This pomade will help you achieve superior styles.</li>
            <li> then a good rain can be disasterous for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I also think Tres Flores&#x27; hold is almost as good as Suaveceto Firme&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> good product but not for my hair</li>
            <li> I done a lot of research before buying, i have read some good reviews so decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> i loved the smell, it smelt like a cologne of some sort.</li>
            <li> good stuff at a good price.</li>
            <li> Could see myself using this for the rest of my life, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> BUT surprisingly its NOTHING like hair spray or hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extras: This company has sent me two jars that come in with the pomade on a 45 degree angle.</li>
            <li> Holds your hair perfectly all day, has great re-comb value through out the day, just the right amount of shine.</li>
            <li> Very nice product and a nice smell as well.</li>
            <li> I use the original formula and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It also has a great hold and is very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> This works for me great, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great, washes out easy.</li>
            <li> I can tell you with full assurance that Suavecito works THE BEST for MY hair.</li>
            <li> Very good product and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Very good and washes out easy</li>
            <li> Suavecito is easy to wash out and has a very good hold.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product that offers excellent hold, mild scent, and is a  water soluble pomade which is awesome~</li>
            <li> The best quality for me is that it is water soluble, I love being able to wash it out when i not longer need it.</li>
            <li> Good product and love the smell!</li>
            <li> The hold is great, I just personally don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and a great price</li>
            <li> It smells great but the consistancy is more like a gel than a balm.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes me look better...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t radiate out, which is great because I love wearing cologne</li>
            <li> The smell is very very appealing.</li>
            <li> It ll reactivate too when your hands get damp (or comb) and u wanna reposition hair or fix your self up on the fly (which i love, between meetings).</li>
            <li> Good for the guy who doesn&#x27;t wear cologne but also prefers to smell nice.</li>
            <li> The Suavecita works just as good and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Good smell, great hold, and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> sure glad I did!!</li>
            <li> Good hold and very easy to wash out after</li>
            <li> I love the hold and style i get from this product!</li>

            <li> Smells great, washes out easily.</li>
            <li> After trying it for a couple of days I must say this is an excellent product as it provides a strong hold that will fit any hair type and style and wash off</li>
            <li> I had my amazing wife do a variant of the undercut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That said the hold is amazing and the 3~4$ can lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is also amazing.</li>
            <li> Suavecito is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff and</li>
            <li> This pomade does a fantastic job of holding my hair in place with no issues as well as preforms some sort of straightening effect which is great.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, holds all day.</li>
            <li> This pomade is amazing</li>
            <li> pomade would be amazing without the smell.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, makes me think of a cologne for you hair but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.  </li>
            <li> it has a nice cologne smell.</li>
            <li> I happen to know people who own a barber shop.  </li>
            <li> I bought this with a 1oz sample of Layrite Deluxe.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on waxy, mixes nicely into damp hair and dries a bit like gel.</li>
            <li> Many kept raving about how this product works really good despite being a water soluble pomade.</li>
            <li> whatever shine smell is overwhelming  but smells good its a lil pricey though</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;This should give you an idea of what kind of texture and hair</li>
            <li> Nice shine though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly had never tried pomade</li>
            <li> It does smell nice and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works with every kind of hair</li>
            <li> I wish I could comment on the hold and shine of this product but to be honest, once it was in my hair, I washed it out.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a stronger hold, and this pomade works nicely for that</li>
            <li> and it has a good shine without being over the top wannabe-greaser.</li>
            <li> If you like a strong, squeaky clean smell with perfect hair-this is your product.</li>
            <li> this is the absolute best product for that job!</li>
            <li> Best of all it ain&#x27;t greasy, it is easy to clean off.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the kind of guy who uses hair gel or hair spray to keep that hair in its place, consider switching to a pomade instead.</li>
            <li> Comparable to uppercut deluxe and layrite.</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, nice product.  </li>
            <li> It also smells nice which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s kind of a hobby of mine).</li>
            <li> Has a nice barber-like smell to it as well that my wife loves.</li>
            <li> I very much love how good this smells.</li>
            <li> which is kind of a downer.</li>
            <li> hold is alright, but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> Great hold, perfect shine, nice body, combs I. Easy, washes out clean, and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> The scent is also really nice as well.</li>
            <li> It holds really well and gives my hair the perfect amount of shine I like.</li>
            <li> Nice shine.</li>
            <li> But honestly once I run out of this tub</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many pomades over the years, but this one stands out as the most effective in your hair, not just from appearance, but from function, smell, and application.  </li>
            <li> This is a great pomade that adds an excellent shine and firm hold to hair.  </li>
            <li> He has tried many products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Pretty happy with this stuff.</li>
            <li> In reality that doesn&#x27;t make the product good, but I felt cool having it in my Bathroom</li>

            <li> But that is awesome, because it washes out very easily and doesn&#x27;t make you feel gross.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and awesome hold all day long.</li>

            <li> I will not be adventuring anywhere else as I&#x27;m completely satisfied with Suavecito.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> This stuff is smooth and has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Many compliments since the switch.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied.</li>
            <li> Smells like that fresh smell you get when you walk out of a barber shop or a really good cologne</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I still find that much more preferable than the greasy, never-fully-washed-out feeling of wax-based pomades.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> and maybe sometime I may need a product more like a gel</li>
            <li> but I think I will be sticking with the Magic most days.</li>
            <li> i love it, it could have better hold but works as well as layrite.</li>
            <li> Wax will do the job for sure, but how likes having to wash your hair about 9 times in a row?  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for when you&#x27;ve fully combed your hair and want to make sure your hair doesn&#x27;t shift later on.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My favorite pomade.</li>
            <li> if you want  more greasy look ( this one is like a 4/10 on shine scale)</li>
            <li> Love the smell and holds well</li>
            <li> You can always add more if you need it as I found out when I let my hair grow a bit.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact it&#x27;s water-soluble</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a more stronger hold try their Firme hold which is supposed to have a stronger hold.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s much better than most hair products I find in box stores.  </li>
            <li> and I happen to love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair is longer on top and in order to get it to hold still need to use hairspray.</li>
            <li> stuff looks okay,</li>
            <li> Also love the scent</li>
            <li> Sticks well and love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love Suavecito, its all I use.</li>
            <li> I too love it on him.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Feels more like hair gel than pomade</li>
            <li> I love it, as soon as I run out</li>
            <li> cuz both are outstanding products...</li>
            <li> love the scent, holds just as promised.</li>
            <li> His hair is awesome now even though it is still red!</li>
            <li> Gel works so much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works more like a gel then a pomade.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> When I run out, I will be ordering some more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> This works much better.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of similar producted and found this to provide the best hold with the greasy look.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> love that it is water soluble.  </li>
            <li> Suavecito is okay, it does not hold as well as Layrite.</li>
            <li> Better than gel for a side part (incorrectly referred to as a comb over.</li>
            <li> Most dressing just require a dab, this product required considerably more.  </li>
            <li> , suavecito, I consider to be better.</li>
            <li> Love this...bought it for my son ...</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good product for the price, it is worth checking out.</li>
            <li> I was much more &amp;#34;suave&amp;#34; after using this</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So I came running to Amazon to get some more Suavecito.</li>
            <li> holds great, smells better and washes out very easily!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it holds your hair more like a gel then Pomade</li>
            <li> My go to pomade and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Priced for the working man I can always afford to buy it and buy more; which I do.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and washes out like magic with just water.</li>
            <li> it has a musky odor, like my favorite cologne ( don&#x27;t ask what it is, my wife buys it, it&#x27;s in a brown-topped sprayer</li>
            <li> Most pomades leave my customers greasy and sticky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is better than all of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came fast and works great.</li>
            <li> Good hold, works into hair easily, washes out cleanly.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll echo what others have said: the smell coming from this product is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell of this pomade because it is more of a manly/formal/serious smell.</li>
            <li> Holy snap, you can feel the greatness of this product as you dip the tip of yoru gracious fingers and then give shape to some of the slickest, sexiest and most good-looking hair you&#x27;ll ever want.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 will buy again.</li>
            <li> and it also doesn&#x27;t make hair crusty like many hair gels do.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, but i have had better pomade.</li>
            <li> but the hold is ok.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better pomades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful; my wife loves it, but it definitely stays within your hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT....</li>
            <li> Suavecito was recommended to me by a barber, and I&#x27;m glad he did it.</li>
            <li> I love the container and artwork.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on the scent.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> anyhow, suavecito, in my opinion is better.</li>
            <li> suavecito washes out better than lay rite.</li>
            <li> suavecito is also much more easier to run through your hair because it doesn&#x27;t have that waxy feel.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used it on many occasions.</li>
            <li> It was okay</li>
            <li> The stuff is really fantastic, get some today!</li>
            <li> but I wish it had more.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more for them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot better than Layrite.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product reading many reviews.</li>
            <li> Upon opening Suavecito, the smell was slightly overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I just wish I got more for the price.</li>
            <li> I use Suavecito when my hair is shorter, but when I let the top grow out to about 4 inches, I have to use something stronger.</li>
            <li> This Pomade is one of the better ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I style up and over the top like this: http://style.gq.com.au//media/images/6/5/8/2/0/658263-1_lp.jpg?155543</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and have given him many products to try .</li>
            <li> but, you&#x27;ve guessed it, more hair-pulls in the process.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m required to type more words than I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and it&#x27;s the best pomade I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love the hold and look of the petroleum based, but getting it out is a PAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying lots of water based pomades, Suavecito is know the one I buy over and over again.  </li>
            <li> I love it and have already recommended it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this pomade.</li>
            <li> It would easily be my favorite if the hold was a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to find the perfect essential for my hair.</li>
            <li> This was everything I wanted it to be and more</li>
            <li> Love this as an alternative to Hawleywood&#x27;s layrite.</li>
            <li> both he and I are in love with this.</li>
            <li> and once it dries just run your fingers thru for a more matted look while the shape still holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;think</li>
            <li> 17 more words</li>
            <li> required17 more words</li>
            <li> required17 more words required17</li>
            <li> more words required.</li>

            <li> you will fall in love with it.</li>

            <li> When I got my shipment from Prime, I immediately opened it and noticed a rather strong scent.  </li>
            <li> The scent is strong and it does not hold well at all.  </li>
            <li> The smell is to strong for me and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the strong odor part that a lot of reviews are referencing.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his hair because of the strong hold.</li>
            <li> Holds strong.</li>
            <li> One thing I have to say about the product that bothers me is the strong strong smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong hold can be used to create anything, from gravity defining fauxhawks to the smoothest pompadours.</li>
            <li> It has a strong hold but is not too shiny, which is what I want.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, super easy to wash out, super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing product.</li>
            <li> Not only does it apply perfectly and with no need to brush afterward, the container is nicely sized, and you get a very smooth, controlled hair style that, when coupled with a proper durag (I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Also love the fact that it washes out super easy unlike those greasy pomades.</li>
            <li> and i love the fact it comes out super easy in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is the best pomade I have ever used hands down.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine gel.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a product that was light, washed out easy and held all day.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s easily washable, and the scent is light.</li>
            <li> First off I have to say I&#x27;m fond of the smell, this worked great for me and was for a reasonable price so no complaints on my end.</li>
            <li> first time buyer and overall im impressed with the hold the product leaves.</li>
            <li> Smells fine to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Once it sets, it isn&#x27;t easy to re-style, unless you&#x27;re out in the humidity, or mix in something light.</li>
            <li> The hair can be easily restyled after you use it and has a fantastic smell.</li>
            <li> this works fine.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and curly</li>
            <li> It is light while providing plenty of hold, and it washes out easily as well.</li>
            <li> For my hair style, I find that adding it to my slightly damp hair and then styling works best for me and gives me the sheen I like.  </li>
            <li> Holds my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and somewhat of a masculine musky feel to it.</li>
            <li> The pomade dries quickly and even once it dries, I can still style my hair, giving it more volume and smoothing out all the parts that clump together.</li>
            <li> Suavecito leaves my customers hands clean and smelling nice, which I like because when they smack my butt after a good lap dance, I don&#x27;t want it to be all greasy for the next guy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My gf also comments that it makes my hair, &amp;#34;feel weird&amp;#34; and not small good.  </li>
            <li> Murray&#x27;s super light does better after wearing a bike helmet on my commute to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pros - Excellent creamy texture making application easy, firm but not rigid</li>
            <li> The smell is great, it&#x27;s a very masculine scent and is just fresh.</li>
            <li> This pomade has made a HUGE difference in how my hair looks when it&#x27;s styled.</li>
            <li> I have allergy to fragrances like perfumes and flowers, and this product smell like a mixture of axe and cheap perfumes.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t sweat this is a great alternative to traditional pomades.</li>
            <li> Also preferred the smell of Suavecito over the light washed out vanilla smell of Layrite.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, holds well, and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> Smells like cheap cologne</li>
            <li> I would say its a light to medium shine.</li>
            <li> Smells like cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> B002VA4FUS AXE Shine Pomade, Smooth Look, 2.64 Ounce (</li>
            <li> it is like a $2 cheap cologne.  </li>
            <li> Suavecito goes in silky smooth and makes combing your hair a BREEZE.</li>
            <li> you have to rubs it into your palms to smooth it out before you apply it to the hair.</li>
            <li> adding a pic of my hair after 7hrs of having this stuff in my hair and it still looks really fresh :)</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, holds my hair in place for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband because he heard great things about it, but he ended up just going back to his trusty Murphy&#x27;s wax.</li>
            <li> The product seemed to best work after a towel dried hair (with just the slightest of dampness).  </li>
            <li> Great product, will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> But I ran out of Suavecito and picked up some cheap stuff from the grocery store that looks and feels like bacon grease</li>
            <li> Has a fantastic scent and texture.</li>
            <li> Great present for my boyfriend!</li>
            <li> Overall, if you want a pomade that has a great hold but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy and is water soluble(easy to wash out)</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like cheap cologne -1</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging looks cheap -1</li>
            <li> yeh its dope and cheap....</li>
            <li> It smell like colon, cheap colon.</li>
            <li> however I want and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> so this holds it nicely and doesn&#x27;t add too much weight</li>
            <li> and it really has a nice hold.</li>
            <li> Water based washes out clean and easy.</li>
            <li> This stuff cost cheaper than Steadfast and Layrite.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Gives a great hold and lasts all day, only thing is that it dries out your hair a bit.</li>
            <li> I came to Amazon, saw that it was relatively cheaply priced, and decided to give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We were so happy to find it here to buy extra!</li>
            <li> It has a fantastic scent to it.</li>
            <li> Being so cheap, it would be a crime for you not to try it.</li>
            <li> wife also uses it to smooth out her curl sets and avoid frizz</li>
            <li> Suavecito pomade fit the bill so the purchase was made.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it just as much as I do :)</li>
            <li> To be clear, it does a good job, I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars and continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> The hold of suavecito is good at best, i have thick straight hair</li>
            <li> Right after using it my forehead became increasingly more shinny and greasy</li>
            <li> I bought this pomade due to reviews and couldn&#x27;t be more happy.  </li>
            <li> Works great like other pomades I&#x27;ve had, but washes out with much more ease.  </li>
            <li> Super strong.  </li>
            <li> Easy to work with, doesn&#x27;t try super hold, and holds all day.</li>
            <li> Comes out super easy..</li>
            <li> It holds throughout the day without any issues and is super easy to style.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your hair super greasy, and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I found my new favorite hair product!</li>
            <li> Great packaging including 2 towelettes and 15% off Luxury Barber, came really fast, brand new, and the dryer the hair</li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t hold super strong, clean hair doesn&#x27;t get the greasy look at all with this pomade.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to continue to buy this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Totally Worth the Money!</li>
            <li> that grooming spray is great after a long night of whatever</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as it said it would love it.</li>
            <li> : If you love shaving with a badger / boar hair brush and a straight edge or double-edge razor, you owe it to yourself to check this out!</li>
            <li> Enter this one that I originally borrowed from my brother.</li>
            <li> and i just stick with the original stuff rather than</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I tried this one first.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 more after my first one ran out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best part, after work I can come home and spray a little water in and re-style before heading out for the night looking as fresh as I did to start the day.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the others, it is 100% water based, leaving your hair feeling clean and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Overall love the clean look, nice cologne like barber smell, but the hold is just not there for me.</li>
            <li> Nice clean look and shine, I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Washes out clean.</li>
            <li> but it is super light</li>
            <li> Also, Suavecito doesn&#x27;t wash out as clean like Layrite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different hair &amp;#34;glues&amp;#34;, and I think I like this one the best so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many positive reviews about this product on YouTube and here on Amazon too.  </li>
            <li> But it has a very cheap cologne smell that is very pungent.</li>
            <li> It has a manly smell, has just the right hold for my taste, and washes out easily.  </li>
            <li> its not too strong to a point where you need to comb your hair right away.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re down with strong smelling pomade, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> For me, I have fine curly/wavy hair ( no crazy fancy hair)</li>
            <li> Awsome pomade smells good and is better then other name brand products</li>
            <li> It lasted me close to two months using it everyday so the price is very fair.</li>
            <li> a quick note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suavecito has two pomades; the strong/firme hold and this one (original).</li>
            <li> Smells great arrived faster then expected.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but can be a bit overwhelming after a long day.  </li>
            <li> Save your $$$ I really wanted to love it</li>
            <li> The can is cool looking.</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t get a full matte look.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice masculine smell and holds all day.</li>
            <li> This probably works alot better on straight hair but when I am done with this jar, I will be moving on to wax.</li>
            <li> really wanted it to work and smells ok too.</li>
            <li> I have a big beard and if I use a good amount it keeps it in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had much luck with many gels or waxes.</li>
            <li> and it would probably take a truck full of cement to hold it, but</li>
            <li> I confess to having very difficult-to-manage hair, so hopefully others will have better luck.</li>
            <li> Overall good product and shipping was on time.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the product was more like wax, but when applied to damp hair, it was very workable.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as good as pyrite or similar products.</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve said, it&#x27;s a sweet rum smell.</li>
            <li> He really likes it but would love it if it had stronger hold.</li>
            <li> smells like a barber shop- not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> There is no bad odor</li>
            <li> : im not a fan of the smell, its not a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> Works into the hair very smoothly and holds nicely all day without ever dropping a single flake.</li>
            <li> By far the best product I have used in a long time!</li>
            <li> Came quick and smells good, just was a bit smaller of a container than i thought</li>
            <li> Smells pretty strong not a bad smell though.</li>
            <li> Another plus is this pomade is cheaper than most of the others out there who are way more expensive and just aren&#x27;t as good!</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit sweet and somehow old-fashioned, but isn&#x27;t overpowering and tends to fade fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Sorta reminds me of Irish Spring soap or just a good ole fresh shower clean smell...</li>
            <li> and if I put it in while my hair is wet it gives a very nice pliable effect where your hair keeps its place but will still move around.</li>
            <li> The subtle sweet smell and the none greasiness are wonderful.</li>
            <li> but I have found that it is strong at first but dissipates fairly quickly after application.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and is easier to use than the other non-water soluable products</li>
            <li> Great product, a co-worker of mine introduced it to me a while back, great for lazy people like me who doesn&#x27;t have time to comb their hair every morning</li>
            <li> well it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Drys too quickly for this reason I rated a one star.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to achieve more shine from this product I would suggest using another product as a top coat for further shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It drys quickly and that sticky feel goes away.</li>
            <li> But, even after applying and combing through my hair, my hair quickly becomes unruly looking.</li>
            <li> that super hold both of them make.</li>
            <li> PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;IT CAME QUICK IN THE MAIL.</li>
            <li> It melts in and smears better into my hand, and only a dime size is needed as i have an undercut hair cut with maybe 4-5 inches of hair up top for now.</li>
            <li> I personally find Tres Flores water-based moulding pomade to be a better choice all the way around; it has a pleasant fragrance, is easy to style, keeps your hair soft, and is much, much cheaper than Suaveceto  Firme.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is very overwhelming for me and actually caused me to have headaches and dizziness.</li>
            <li> Really great hold with a slight shine, but the smell</li>
            <li> I bought this for my thick hair and it holds great, and washes out super easy.</li>
            <li> Once i got my hair styled like i wanted, i let it dry and loved the smell of it through out the day.</li>
            <li> , the smell is not to over powering very easy to apply to your hair only thing is I wish there was more in a bottle of it haha.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my 1 year old son!</li>
            <li> very recommended!!</li>
            <li> We will come back for sure!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> The smell is great, the hold is great and it&#x27;s a little easier for me to apply after my hair is slightly</li>
            <li> B001JTGO7Y WAVE BUILDER Seamless Du-Rag BLACK]]) for 10-15 minutes, will come out looking perfectly molded and waved out.  </li>
            <li> I get best results whenever I apply on just a bit dryer than damp hair, and rub it in my hair and blow dry it on low.</li>
            <li> I open it and it has a super nice smell and a caramel coke color.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It does provide a medium to strong hold for a few hours, which isn&#x27;t good</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, the smell is nice and it works well on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Great Hold with just a little product.</li>
            <li> This stuff took me a bit of trial and error as I haven&#x27;t really used a product like this before, but once I got used to it, I&#x27;ll certainly be buying more.</li>
            <li> Good hold - though the firme hold is even better - without getting a hard shell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but holds well, washes out very easily, smells great, and requires only a small amount so lasts forever.</li>
            <li> The water solubility is great for washing out at the end of the day, but if you accidentally get your hair wet or sweat too much, your hair will start to lose hold.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, almost imperceptible scent, lasts all day and washes out well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice touch, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it simply for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And now they look fresh as ever.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot here, so this will last me through 2 or 3 tubs of the kind you would buy at the grocery.</li>
            <li> It will not hold up in warm weather nor will it last all day.</li>
            <li> Suavecito pomade is a really nice durable pomade I would buy different ones to try them out</li>
            <li> This stuff is sticky like glue and smells like success.</li>
            <li> I have wavy thick hair and it takes more than the recommended amount for a good hold.</li>
            <li> the old formula was better.</li>
            <li> and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Looks way more natural.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and are sensitive to many of the lab created (i.e. antibacterial hand soap) smells</li>
            <li> They like the hold and the fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Suavecito has more of an Old Spice scent.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool pomade.</li>
            <li> this pomade is great... holds well without being stiff &amp; best of all, you can actually easilly wash it off your hands, unlike may other thicker pomades..</li>
            <li> I have tried other more &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34; pomades before and they all got the job done for the most part but nothing like Sauvecito.</li>
            <li> First, (after reading alot of the reviews on here) I have to say that the smell goes away as quickly.</li>
            <li> version since I dont need to used as much as the Original hold</li>
            <li> It washes right out with one rinse.</li>
            <li> Washes right out.  </li>
            <li> and if so I&#x27;d get some if the price was right.</li>
            <li> but just right.</li>
            <li> It holds and washes right out....</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the right type of Pomade to put in my hair.</li>
            <li> then this stuff comes right off.  </li>
            <li> Washes right out with just water.</li>
            <li> My hair is about 9 inches long on top and the sides are tapered and I use 2.5 finger tip scoops of it and hair seams to still be pliable and free.</li>
            <li> And full day of lounging in the sun, and the pomade still held my hair, which was the &#x27;longest&#x27; it had been in some time (but still short by most standards) in place...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not bother by these smells then by all means get it, it does hold the your hair nicely without the crunch and is easily restyled with a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will last all day and is very easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> and I put it on when my hair is not too wet nor too dry to get the best control and shine!</li>
            <li> This is a great pomaid, with a suddle not overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of different pomades on the market, I want to smell good and look good because in my line of work (male exotic dancer) you want the fellas to know that you and your moves are slick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that were good, but suavecito set the bar higher.  </li>
            <li> The best hair gel, I have ever used, wet or dry!</li>
            <li> For the sophisticated suave look, I will use a little more product and apply when my hair is damp.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with this pomade is the scent; it is strong and never seems to fade, even after two days!</li>
            <li> This product works great to hold my hair down and back all day, and then washed out easily at night.</li>
            <li> Works great and you only need a tiny amount to do the job.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone looking for product that provides a strong hold that lasts all day and washes off easily at a fairly reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The bottom line, a good hair product should be easy to go into your hair, style, and then come right out the next day with minimal hair loss/pulls.  </li>
            <li> I can slick the hair back like most would do with pomade but the great thing with this stuff</li>
            <li> The smell is great, and it has enough hold to last, but if you need to refresh it just add a little water to your hair and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Tried out American Crew and was pretty happy, but once I came up on some Suavecito, I never turned back.</li>
            <li> For a water-based pomade Suavicito is better than the rest, and at only $10 you get a superior product for less.</li>
            <li> In dry hair it gives excellent hold, but less shine.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice and does a decent job, but I wish it was just a little stronger in hold.</li>
            <li> Good product, holds my hair down and won&#x27;t crust two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great for my super thick hair!</li>
            <li> Water soluble; you only need a dime sized dollop for a full head of hair; can be reactivated/restyled if wetted during the course of the day; I love it; doesn&#x27;t flake and doesn&#x27;t make your hands greasy like Murray&#x27;s; highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The hold is amazing even when it is still wet</li>
            <li> This is my first pomade by suggestion from a buddy of mine.  </li>
            <li> * Great long lasting hold for the way I style my hair</li>
            <li> * Great for my curly thick hair</li>
            <li> I think i&#x27;d be interested in a 10oz container</li>
            <li> can looks pretty bicthin on the counter though</li>
            <li> I have tried many different hair products to get the look I am going for.  </li>
            <li> Expect to use more (obviously).</li>
            <li> On a hot day (&amp;#62;85F), has a tendency to get kinda goopy.</li>
            <li> The extra water won&#x27;t move your hair out of place and will lock in the hold of the pomade more.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone that is interested in buying it.</li>
            <li> Helps keep the hair exactly how you want it styled.  </li>
            <li> Just bought it for the first time and man</li>
            <li> It does when you&#x27;re first applying it.  </li>
            <li> I def will be purchasing this more in the future</li>
            <li> Light masculine fragrance.  </li>
            <li> like most gels, no white residue</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a water-based pomade as an alternative to using petroleum-based stuff, Suavecito works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very suave!</li>
            <li> I alternate between this and AXE pomade, but I like this better for the scent.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Ive purchased this multiple times and am satisfied every time,</li>
            <li> This is the second water based pomade that I&#x27;ve tried and I love it.</li>
            <li> the first pomade that works for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny when you tell them it&#x27;s your hair product and not cologne.  </li>
            <li> My son really likes this hair product!</li>
            <li> White, skinny guy, brown hair, about 4 inches on top, faded on the sides.</li>
            <li> Been using for about 3 months now and would recommend, although this is my first pomade</li>
            <li> Also, it holds up well riding with the top back and even on my motorcycle.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using a pomade and man</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fun to see it straight some times</li>
            <li> First off, I did not purchase this stuff from amazon</li>
            <li> The first time I got this</li>
            <li> works well, and does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Can style many different hairstyles</li>
            <li> Overall pretty pleased</li>
            <li> Does wash out nicely and can be adjusted by running a wet comb through it to rejuvenate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty put off by the smell.  </li>
            <li> First time user and the smell is enchanting.</li>
            <li> Top class seller and will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> The pomade is more of a gel than, well, actual pomade.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever had to give up on a product before a week&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> I never had to use morethan one comb to style my hair into place; this is another first.  </li>
            <li> Its long lasting and smells great.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair much more pliable than simply wetting it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of pomades on my hair and Suavecito is my second favorite pomade.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I read was about the smell.</li>
            <li> I like this pomade more than most more expensive options.  </li>
            <li> First opening it</li>
            <li> Packaging is actually appealing so if left out, it doesnt look like some dated hair care product my mom use to use in the 80s</li>
            <li> this for me has exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> First time user of pomade...</li>
            <li> All i&#x27;d ask for is more shine with this product, It turns matte after an hour, The scent will last till you wash it out</li>
            <li> First, the product does indeed look like a brown Jello like on reviewer said.  </li>
            <li> As the name suggest it smooth to put into the hair keeping it down for the day with a pleasent smell not over the top.</li>
            <li> I have tried many pomades both old and new.</li>
            <li> The Suavecito looks very dense but goes on light and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and the pomade looks nice, clean and fresh cut when i first put it on but to hold up my pompadour, it takes at least 3 or 4 finger scoops to do so.</li>
            <li> Having fine hair makes a little more of a challenge.  </li>
            <li> After seeing and reading so many positive reviews about Suavecito, I finally decided to give it try.</li>
            <li> It smells decent and is worth a month or more of use with a short cut</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got super wavy hair that defies any product, now for someone with normal hair</li>
            <li> The original has the same look and smell as the strong, and holds quite nicely just not as firmly.  </li>
            <li> Little bit goes a long way for this product and has a good hold for sure deffinitly reccomended.</li>
            <li> Other classic pomades such as Murray&#x27;s Superior or Dax are simply a pain to wash off despite providing a good hold.</li>
            <li> In the last 2 weeks I&#x27;ve ordered about half a dozen hair gel/clay products that are double or more the price of this product and this by far has been the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The shine is decent, just barely a shade better than Murray&#x27;s pomade.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky when I do his hair like the other stuff did.</li>
            <li> Meh....smells great however it gets hard like LayRite and is really matte finish not for me.</li>
            <li> Regardless this is a great buy no need to spent $50+ for another pomade that works the same.</li>
            <li> A clean, masculine scent with hints of spice and lime that radiates off of you.</li>
            <li> Currently I am using Magic Sporting Waves which I really like.</li>
            <li> I had an extremely long (and pretty darn respectable)</li>
            <li> Since you&#x27;re obviously interested in pomades, just go ahead and take your man card back with the easy purchase of Suavecito Pomade.</li>
            <li> You might need to apply more of the product than I do for a &amp;#34;wet-look&amp;#34;, but even a fingertip of this stuff ensures your hair will style and stay all day long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much hair gel.</li>
            <li> Pretty much an all day hold.</li>
            <li> I really tried to like this product I really did, now I come from using American Crew Fiber and wanted a more gel/wax substance because of Fiber having a tendency to clump up.</li>
            <li> Once you apply some the scent is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> Suavecito has a deliciously sweet smell, while still remaining subtly masculine.</li>
            <li> I really wish I would have spent more money and got my money&#x27;s worth 4 Oz</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for a pompadour, but the only ones that really work are American Crew&#x27;s Fiber and Murray&#x27;s Light Pomade.  </li>
            <li> Only for \\&quot;true original\\&quot; men!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily-ness quickly dissipates, leaving hair that just feels like it&#x27;s naturally grown itself to your style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to brush later in the day and maintains the shape and hold you would want.</li>
            <li> The hold is strong and has a deep shine, and washes out with ease.</li>
            <li> When you open it you can smell it and it smells strong</li>
            <li> To my pleasant surprise, the consistency of this pomade was way easier to work into my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend Bead Head for men Pure texture molding paste if you want a strong hold without the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This pomade offers an excellent hold, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I never had so many problems with a single hair product in my life until I came across,</li>
            <li> I will certainly be buying this going forward.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only thing is a travel size needs to be created, I always carry on my bag for business travel and this size is to large.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a large amount of hair-pulls just putting it in.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t appreciate the large amount frizz</li>
            <li> Smells ok not too strong like others suggested to me its hardly even scented.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The sheen of this product really depends on me on how dry my hair is when I apply it (more dry &#x3D; more matte).</li>
            <li> Great hold, style, and works with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Suavecito has a strong hold and it will last you the whole day.</li>
            <li> If you have been searching for the right pomade or you&#x27;re new to the world of pomades give Suavecito a try.</li>
            <li> and it has a pretty decent shine.  </li>
            <li> persue the classic !</li>
            <li> Nice smell and hold but a little too waxy/hard for my taste.</li>
            <li> Smells like cologne, masculine scent which smells beautiful and is also subtle which won&#x27;t mask or clash with whatever cologne or scent you have on.</li>
            <li> Looks better applied in my hair with a large wide gapped tooth comb&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good water-soluble pomades are hard to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly strong if you like a perfumed product, but I&#x27;d rather have a much more subtle</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,good product for the price</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> Very manageable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really unsure how to use this stuff</li>
            <li> Really like the texture it hold hair with.  </li>
            <li> Holds very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very manageable, even in damp hair.</li>
            <li> The Sporting Waves washes out so much easier than the Murrays and yet retains the reworkability that I like in pomades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I received it really fast</li>
            <li> really likes it for her hair</li>
            <li> I really like the scent on this.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li> I was a Murray&#x27;s guy for a while and that stuff is straight up grease</li>
            <li> maybe Im expecting too much.</li>
            <li> The produce is similar to steadfast, in both texture and hold however my hair(thick</li>
            <li> but this ranks high on my list!</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and it is pain trying to style it from time to time and finding a product that will hold my hair in place the whole day.</li>
            <li> and then bam ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like using Suavecito pomade.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t do edges very well.  </li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t get much in each container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this one.</li>
            <li> It rinses out much easier to.  </li>
            <li> Very musky and gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> Every morning when I get ready, it&#x27;s like a routine to smell it before I put it in my hair.</li>
            <li> He absolutely LOVES this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff holds really well</li>
            <li> i style my hair to the side(comb over) and after applying this product everything holds in place very well.</li>
            <li> Neither work very well.</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable and product delivers to its expectations.</li>
            <li> I like that Suavecito forms the shape of my hair very well..</li>
            <li> I really dig this pomade.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> really like this product</li>
            <li> And can I say that I appreciate that this pomade has a reasonable price?</li>
            <li> However, the cologne scent is too much for me.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> really works with my wavy hair</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a much softer look/feel.</li>
            <li> It also works for the modern man!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It also made my forehead very greasy.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I should have gone straight to this.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my longish straight hair when it&#x27;s damp in the morning.  </li>
            <li> You also cant beat the price; his barber charges twice as much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a gel, it&#x27;s not even really even pomade -</li>
            <li> It has semi wet look which I love.</li>
            <li> Shine isn&#x27;t really my thing</li>
            <li> Makes your hear bee very manageable, if you got curly of waive hair depends on the amount you put on it makes it go</li>
            <li> straight hear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because I really like the consistency, fragrance and price.</li>
            <li> Smells too much like Worcestershire sauce for me</li>
            <li> is you sweat too much though.</li>
            <li> but i do my hair at night so getting ready for work in the morning goes quicker.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use as much of this pomade to fix your hair compared to others.  </li>
            <li> This pomade works very well.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t matter how much I use.</li>
            <li> Wish it was cheaper and available locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Murray&#x27;s before and dislike the viscosity, makes it harder to apply and rinse out, although I appreciate the hold a lot more.  </li>
            <li> Works well, but not as much hold as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well</li>
            <li> people might really like it</li>
            <li> I like this stuff just as much as Layrite, but it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> and he wants to reorder.</li>
            <li> And I was really self-conscious about it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very tacky to style into place.</li>
            <li> Who has time to do this much experimenting with a hair product?</li>
            <li> I really have nothing else</li>
            <li> I purchased that pomade because I figured pomade is pomade, and there couldn&#x27;t be much difference in how they work with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had much luck re-style my hair with water based pomades, so</li>
            <li> Nothing much else to say.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suavecito Pomade made a difference the very moment I opened it.</li>
            <li> And it really was.</li>
            <li> Really, she asked me out.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast shipping</li>
            <li> Holds much better if your hair is not too wet, as it is WATER-BASED.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tries every pomade known to man most of them hold, but are a bitch to wash out of your hair.</li>
            <li> it hardens  up to much</li>
            <li> I have normal/thin hair and this product works really well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone really.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> VERY MUCH.&lt;br /&gt;IT</li>
            <li> Suavecito was my very 1st pomade i have ever used.</li>
            <li> Depending on your hair type (mine is straight)</li>
            <li> Pretty slick in the hair I like it, it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> If you want a nice pompadour or vintage hairstyle with your hair parted back like my husband styles his, this product probably won&#x27;t be enough to hold the style.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice firm hold on my head</li>
            <li> i added tres flores for a good shone and a solid wet look.</li>
            <li> So I went with the &amp;#34;Firme/Strong hold.&amp;#34; It was good but way too thick for my liking.</li>
            <li> The smell is extremely strong all day long and after a while it made me feel nauseous.  </li>
            <li> Unlike many other pomades, this one does not run onto your skin.</li>
            <li> It is much better than any other brand names that I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li> so claims, I will trying Shiners Gold next, thats what I originally wanted to buy</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheaper than most other things that are what this is.  </li>
            <li> Its not greasy like most other pomade products</li>
            <li> Definitely will purchase again, long lasting and works great</li>
            <li> You can apply to wet hair for more of a hardened look or dry hair for a more natural feel.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, combs thru without tugging, and it doesn&#x27;t dry or flake.  </li>
            <li> decent price shipper shipped fast</li>
            <li> It had great hold with only a small dab needed at a time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good smell, but you can smell it over a subtle cologne, which is not desirable.</li>
            <li> The hold is pretty good as I have thin hairs.</li>
            <li> great for slick clean look or messy as well</li>
            <li> I only need about half to a three quarters of a fingertip to get a good hold.</li>
            <li> If you want more control get the next step up from this stuff- it holds and controls more, but at the cost of drying hard.</li>
            <li> I think it smells better than any other pomade I&#x27;ve used, but all pomades seems to lose their scent quickly, making that factor take a back seat to hold.</li>
            <li> Put it in dry and my hair will be fine all day and if I need to readjust just add some water and recomb.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma, with a small amount do the job.</li>
            <li> And finally, I didn&#x27;t appreciate the sweet bay-rum smell that had me craving alcohol all day.</li>
            <li> Normally by the end of the day, (I work in a very relaxed office setting)</li>
            <li> Not only is it a great pomade, but you would be hard pressed to find a better company to order from, not only are they fast and efficient they always throw in special little goodies and thank yous in their orders.</li>
            <li> My new go-to hair product!</li>
            <li> In damp hair it gives more shine but less hold.</li>
            <li> typically wear a pompador most days.</li>
            <li> Wet your hair a bit and you can restyle easily.</li>
            <li> definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that when I went back to my barber to buy more, they were out.</li>
            <li> Some dudes on here need help with hair and not be so quick to give products low ratings.</li>
            <li> bit more expensive than most pomades</li>
            <li> and I will definitely order more when I get low.</li>
            <li> particular pomade has a woodsy cologne scent to it, which adds to its value.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a mild soapy smell that I actually kinda dig (and so does my girlfriend).</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> It goes on like a gel and holds decently throughout the day.</li>
            <li> the pomade doesn&#x27;t keep my hair in place and the hairs curl back quickly.</li>
            <li> Works for a classic sculpted look.</li>
            <li> Decent hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many compliments from girls when laying next to them or being close enough.</li>
            <li> Second favorite product and smell Next to layrite</li>
            <li> The hold of the pomade is decent, but it is still inferior to Layrite.  </li>
            <li> The color looks like root beer, the smell is like coke &amp; tea tree, The hold on this pomade is almost the same as the Layrite super hold.</li>
            <li> Could be I&#x27;m not using enough, but it&#x27;s a bit hard to work though my hair when it&#x27;s mostly dry (which is what it recommends for best hold).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for pomping, may want to mix it with some murray&#x27;s super-light to keep it re-workable.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this pomade.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Every time I try another water based pomade I just end up dissapointed because it just does not stack up to the high bar that Suavecito has set.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> -- Maybe I am just more sensitive to the smell than other users.</li>
            <li> A little scoop works for me, when I put more it just flattens my hair.</li>
            <li> can get a little overwhelming throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Washes out with little effort and nothing more then just water</li>
            <li> I switch to axe pomade, holds a little better</li>
            <li> Plus, you can go for a more solid slicked look if you put it in while your hair is wet, or you can do the more natural look by putting it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Our hair styles are a little less demanding of the hold, and my kids ONLY want suavecito because they love the smell and their friends and teachers have told them they love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products before, like Bed Hair wax, Axe Clean Cut Look Pomade, other brands of Gel, you name it.</li>
            <li> sent on the other hand is too strong and perfumed.  </li>
            <li> Feels kind of like a fancy gel but doesn&#x27;t get rock hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I still more or less agree with the above, it isn&#x27;t as strong of a hold, BUT this has become our only hair product these days!</li>
            <li> if you have a particular style you are new to like me</li>
            <li> if you have a particular style you are new to like me</li>
            <li> It has a great scent and isn&#x27;t difficult to wash out.</li>
            <li> Fiber and normal murrays pomade don&#x27;t do this</li>
            <li> The first week, I was in Southern California during a heat wave (90+ degree weather for 5 straight days).  </li>
            <li> I have recently been trying to look more adult with my hair, and I saw this product in my local barbershop.  </li>
            <li> only stuff that keeps the style pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> Although I prefer the firm hold better, this product rocks.  </li>
            <li> However the product smell is unappealing and long-lasting, the pomade is not as good as I assumed it to be.</li>
            <li> Good product for thin hair,not mine.</li>
            <li> you are tired of ruining the collars of your shirts, and all your pillow cases, this is a good way to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels kind of thick but not waxy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that is new to pomades or is trying to avoid petroleum pomades.</li>
            <li> Light, but holds well without giving your hair that super glue / hard feel.</li>
            <li> It has a a medium firmness once it dries up but not hard or crunchy</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and stiff.</li>
            <li> The hold is moderate but it gets you there if you apply the right amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll run to the restroom, dampen my hands and work my hair again, and it comes right back to the hold it had in the morning.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it was not worth the cheaper price because of the weaker hold, strong odor, and greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> I guess it all comes down to smell sensitivity, but for me it&#x27;s just too strong.</li>
            <li> Recommend if you are on the fence and wanna try a new pomade.</li>
            <li> I would have never known about Sauvecito unless it was for my new barber.</li>
            <li> so I am still new to the pomade product lines.</li>
            <li> hello to the new age of hair products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new (about a month in) to a haircut that requires the use of pomade to style.</li>
            <li> Also, the fragrance is nowhere near as strong as other pomades I&#x27;ve used (Layrite, for example).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after giving Suavecito a month of use, I have gone back to Murray&#x27;s Super Light (much lighter than Murray&#x27;s original).</li>
            <li> you want easy rinse out and less</li>
            <li> You only need to apply it with medium pressure with your hands, then as it starts to get harder to slide your hands, add more pressure.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have the pomade to style it properly, I can finally appreciate the fantastic haircut I was given.</li>
            <li> It holds all day and can easily be combed again if I mess it up.</li>
            <li> It still gives me a strong hold that will lasts all day and even until the next time you shower as long as you add water.</li>
            <li> Lasted a long time, worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty other regular and water soluble pomades and admit this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this gel, but I starting to like it</li>
            <li> most pomades come in 2oz jars but this is a 4oz jar for only about $12 and it will last a while too since you will only need about a nickle size dab of this stuff to comb your hair</li>
            <li> But other pomades I have tried don&#x27;t actually hold my hair in place for more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other pomades and was a bit unsure about this one, but I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was first exposed to the product in my local barber shop.</li>
            <li> Only downside if you&#x27;re somewhere hot</li>
            <li> I wondered, \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li> but the scent is a little strong</li>
            <li> Helpful hint: if you have a spray bottle and want a strong hold after you&#x27;ve applied this to your hair then give your hair a little spritz with the bottle before leaving anywhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has curly hair and uses pomade to smooth it down.</li>
            <li> Sua Vecito has a clean smell, and is not greasy like other pomades.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair in place and makes it look more natural than any other big name brand pomade.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a clear and rather pretty deep amber.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and is a really firm hold, can adjust your hair during the day if needed.</li>
            <li> This pomade came in quickly, on its expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Too thick for my straight hair and scent is too strong.</li>
            <li> Easily moldable and does not leave your hair feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> The original hold pomade, holds my really thick, curly hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> Not stiff or sticky and leaves no yucky residue in hair.</li>
            <li> but it keeps my hair flowing and not stiff.</li>
            <li> He has very thick hair and this stuff combs nicely through the hair.  </li>
            <li> Works as well if not better than the larger name brand hair products and washes out very easily.  </li>
            <li> for the price this is crazy great stuff.  </li>
            <li> Firm hold but light texture (if that makes sense), and clearly high-quality stuff.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, not too thick and smells great.</li>
            <li> After the very first time I used suavecito I am hooked, wont buy any other pomade.</li>
            <li> Not heavy, greasy, smelly.</li>
            <li> Your hair feels natural again after an hour.</li>
            <li> Letting my hair grow out from a buzz cut and it takes a while until I have enough length so my hair doesn&#x27;t stick straight out in all directions.</li>
            <li> then Murray&#x27;s though with as much hold as Layrite only a bit easier on the pocketbook.</li>
            <li> This works and is reasonably priced, but it won&#x27;t last all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as hair hold, I cant complain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was considerably cheaper on Amazon, so I figured I would pick some up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair stays soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I imagine a 4 oz container can last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin though</li>
            <li> Our 23 year old son loves this product.</li>
            <li> It arrived early and in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Not heavy.  </li>
            <li> It has that old barbershop smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for three days so far and the smell is giving me a headache.</li>
            <li> you always wanted to but were too much of a pussy to actually ever do.</li>
            <li> But the big issue for me is that it is very sticky and &amp;#34;waxy-like&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m ready for the next one.</li>
            <li> I bought this and Imperial Pomade Gel at the same time to try them both, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of pomades without finding something I really like.</li>
            <li> I used to use murray&#x27;s a long time ago, which is pretty hardcore stuff</li>
            <li> I prefer NON musky smells, sort of like old spice redzone deoderant (Swagger) or Axe Anarchy body wash.</li>
            <li> This stuff is far superior to any of the common big brand junk at your local supermarket.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it seems that the company that I purchased from (not Suavecito) placed their own label on the jar and it covered the instructions.</li>
            <li> Of all the brands I have tried American Crew and Redken seemed to work the good - just not great.  </li>
            <li> But for everyday no running, heavy lifting work this pomade is really good.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a good price point comparing with those expensive ones out there</li>
            <li> It seems like more of a medium weight hold, but maybe because of my hair type (thick wavy).</li>
            <li> Good product just not perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li> Second, the smell is very overwhelming, and it&#x27;s not a pleasant one either.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different products, this stuff is a step above all the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel stiff, like cheap hair gels with tons of alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used A LOT of different types of pomade and hair products- Brylcreem, Groom &amp; Clean, American Crew Pomade, American Crew Grooming Cream, Hawleywood&#x27;s Lay Rite to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Putting it through my hair was also a surprise, after it was in, my hands were pretty much dry and non sticky.</li>
            <li> What sucks is when i have those little hair pop up when im out and about and try to use water to slick it back down, it only just comes up more since it is water based; Overall great product i love it.</li>
            <li> Plus I really like saying &amp;#34;suavecito!&amp;#34; Sometimes I blurt it out for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> I originally started with American Crew but due to is medium hold, my curly hair started to go to its natural shape</li>
            <li> It will dry a little on the crispy side, though just run a wet comb to reactivate the pomade and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I hadn&#x27;t feel so confident in months.</li>
            <li> got the super hold and it holds but not super.</li>
            <li> its pretty flexiable, i can actually pick up a couple strands of my hair and it will fall back into place when i let go.</li>
            <li> The second week, I was In Hawaii and this go around, it was the most humid that I recall in the past 4 years.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is the smell can be a little too strong.</li>
            <li> only thing that softens it up is high temperature like being under the sun for 2-3 hours at a time.</li>
            <li> Never going back to murrays or high life after using this stuff.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a pomade or similar to style their hair.</li>
            <li> It lays very heavy on your head all day just as heavy as Murrays Superior.</li>
            <li> Hair looks smooth and slick, but its not the strongest stuff out there.</li>
            <li> Blowdry your hair into the style you want it (get it wet first of course).</li>
            <li> If you want am orthodox water based pomade, get some Cool Grease.</li>
            <li> It kind of works in like a butch wax, but less stiff and it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue on your hands afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely recommend trying this product if you are on the fence or just looking for a new pomade to try.</li>
            <li> the advice i got was invaluable... and my wifey LOVESSS the new look after 12 yrs the same look with her.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the advice i got was invaluable... and my wifey LOVESSS the new look after 12 yrs the same look with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me put it like this, When I shower and get out and towel dry my hair it stands straight</li>
            <li> Is it easy to rub into the hands and hair at least?  </li>
            <li> I am sure it will take me at least 3 months to go through the entire jar.</li>
            <li> All it takes is water to completely wash out, just be careful not to add too much water during the day when reworking it.</li>
            <li> Seems promising ; the hold is a bit weird ; love the smell</li>
            <li> With thick hair, it has been much more convenient to keep it short and not have to deal with the day-to-day maintenance.  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle and pleasant smell, not overpowering or harsh at all.</li>
            <li> I would probably recommend the strong hold Suavacito for those with thick hair though.</li>
            <li> Later I find out from my cousin that they pretty much just try to copy everything layrite makes and does it a little cheaper</li>
            <li> Smell is fine - hardly there.  </li>
            <li> The hold could be better, but I cant really complain since I have extremely dark thick hair</li>
            <li> For a more matte look, I will wait for my hair to get fully dry and then apply a small dab of it onto my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried black &amp; white, Voodoo brew, Dax, Layrite, Layrite super hold, AND J.s Sloane...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff the only problem that I have with it is that as the day goes on I tend to get a greasy face due to the product running down my forehead</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, it has a firm hold, and it washes out very easily.</li>
            <li> but.... I want more shine.&lt;br /&gt;It looks shiny initially, but after it dries it dulls a little.</li>
            <li> I got this product because of all the positive reviews, but it&#x27;s just like all the other hair gels.  </li>
            <li> No need to get complicated, this pomade does what I need it to do and the shipping is always amazing, always receive it within 2 days of ordering.</li>
            <li> My husband has short straight hair and our son has long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> it works really well especially with people with long hair.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets in this purchase</li>
            <li> which was this product coming out of my hair when i barely sweat.</li>
            <li> The hold is nowhere near as solid as Layrite though not as greasy or petroleum like Murray&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> i would say its a cross between old spice and axe body spray.</li>
            <li> It will leave your hands and head smelling like musk or some sort of old spice the entire day.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this for my 6 year old son.</li>
            <li> This pomade is really not THAT much cheaper than Layrite, if you have Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> Upon receiving it and opening the lid, two things are readily apparent.  </li>
            <li> Suavecito tends to act as a straightener in my hair (I&#x27;m Caucasian with relatively thick, pretty straight hair).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for close to if not a year and finally got around to purchasing a whole crap load after moving and being 20 miles from the nearest great barbershop.</li>
            <li> Love the product however the container was broken when it arrived</li>
            <li> Ordered this on kind of a random whim not knowing if I would like it or not, when i got it turns out</li>
            <li> hair type at the time of this product&#x27;s usage: thick, coarse Asian hair that is medium length at the top with bald fade at the sides and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I comb it and want it every time with ease, no overwhelming scent (no real scent I can detect), when I re-comb using a wet comb it allows me to re-comb easily and stays in place like my first application.</li>
            <li> I can deal with the mediocre hold, but I really can&#x27;&#x27;t stand the strong smell of this pomade</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the scent of this gel is crazy strong!!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products, but this is my absolute go to.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> and I would have like Suavecito to not dry like it did.</li>
            <li> It applies easily to dry hair, holds like a champ and washes out completely with water!</li>
            <li> Apply dry for a stiff hold or apply while your hair is damp for a nice hold that isn&#x27;t stiff.  </li>
            <li> used this product for the first time a few days ago.</li>
            <li> A chunk of my pomade was missing when i opened my lid for the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally spent 45 minutes just trying to pull off a decent pompadour with three different combs.</li>
            <li> No problem, just wet your comb and run it through your hair, and &amp;#34;Suavecito&amp;#34; your do is like new again.</li>
            <li> you have to do is wet and comb, and it&#x27;s just like new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suavecito doesn’t provide a high shine compared to other products.</li>
            <li> In less than a minute, I had my hair ready to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ended up being a non waste of money since my husband uses it on his long golden locks of Thor</li>
            <li> This product really comes down to personal preference.</li>
            <li> But my boys have very thick hair, and this isn&#x27;t quite strong enough.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Murray&#x27;s and my hair is a little more harder than that and less pliable (using about the same amount).</li>
            <li> Plus it lasts all day, you can even restyle it with a little bit of water (too much and it will wash out).</li>
            <li> The only down side of going with the water based pomade for me is that if you live in a rainy climate (like I do!)</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have thick, straight, hair that I like to push back for work, because I work in a professional environment and deal with clients.</li>
            <li> Good for thin and thick hair.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty strongly, but not in a bad way.  </li>
            <li> Like all water-based pomades, too much will tend to clump up; it just takes a pea-sized amount to tame my unruly, short hair.  </li>
            <li> Also in general I wish it did not dry so hard on your hair and left it with more of a &#x27;slick&#x27; and wet look.</li>
            <li> Very reworkable as long as you use a little water and comb it through.</li>
            <li> The feeling in your hair is not greasy by any means and depending on if you apply it to dry it wet hair it will harden very slightly(with wet hair).</li>
            <li> The hold is medium depending on how much you use, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I personally dont really like the slick look that it gives, so</li>
            <li> but when i went to the barber for a quick touch up, unfortunately they messed up my hair and cut it far too short...</li>
            <li> First off, I am Mexican and I believe the creators of Suavecito made this for thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong enough to tame my thick hair without feeling greasy or crunchy.</li>
            <li> If you are a recovering alcoholic, this smell could very well cause a relapse.</li>
            <li> and ive used it with short hair and with long hair</li>
            <li> Around mid-day I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair looks grease and somewhat flat.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive, and last long time.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this gets such high reviews.  </li>
            <li> This pomade gives a great hold and shine without making your hair feel too hard and artificial.</li>
            <li> this one is far less pliable.</li>
            <li> I have, Even when dry its like a big poof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to dry my hair and run some pomade in it and run it back and let it look natural and slightly messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Barbershops can also get it cheap wholesale and sell it expensive to make some massive profit from it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I must mention is that the product says to either apply to damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Monkey Brains Grease Monkey pomade, then they stopped making that, so this was the next thing I tried.</li>
            <li> , it reminds me of toilet deodorizer.  </li>
            <li> Keeps his thick hair straight back and in place</li>
            <li> For a small $14 container, I&#x27;ve expected a positive outcome from the product.</li>
            <li> I usually run a comb through it for a classic or a brush for a James Dean look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little surprised at the size of the container</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t appreciate the high price and small container ratio.</li>
            <li> We took him to a barber this past weekend and they highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> in all this is highly recommended though (at least for short wave styles like mine).</li>
            <li> I have medium to long hair</li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t hold long.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> The next day, just wet your hair</li>
            <li> doesnt make hair look too greasy and even with medium to long hair</li>
            <li> Given the price point and the quality I&#x27;ll be buying this brand of pomade for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> Really no need to go into much further.</li>
            <li> I do not frequently use hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I do like how it feels in my hair, I have thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> For thick hair users:  This will hold your hair reasonably well but perhaps go with the stronger variant.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick straight hair this will work.</li>
            <li> This product is a thin gel not a heavy wax like normal pomades.</li>
            <li> It does a great job parting my hair, holding a pomp, and laying down those annoying strands of hair that stick up.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and curly Caucasian hair and after having my head shaved for the last 10 years I decided to go with a new haircut.  </li>
            <li> The scent isn’t bad by any means but for those who have a sensitive nose it might be a problem because it can a bit strong.</li>
            <li> I would really only dock this product a half star because of the scent (personal preference), otherwise would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for 10 so no use in returning if i only get half money back.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try out Suavecito because a ton of other people on Amazon seem to really like it, there are even reviews that say it is comparable to Layrite pomade (which is what I usually used).  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other pomade from now on, especially at this price!</li>
            <li> not enough I Have to apply numerous amounts into my hair to get it to stay slick back</li>
            <li> This product can be used in damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> What I do is let it dry into its hold and recomb or run my fingers thru my hair.  </li>
            <li> Suavecito leaves my hair dry and frizzy, would recommend another pomade.</li>
            <li> It does dry similiar to gel not grease or wax..</li>
            <li> Plus, the hair products I used would always leave my hair feeling dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> : As the directions indicate, it does offer a stronger hold if you put it in when your hair is fairly dry.</li>
            <li> I put it in with dry hair, and it thickens up</li>
            <li> I am just looking for a dry look.</li>
            <li> it let it dry for about 10 mins</li>
            <li> once it dries it looks dry.</li>
            <li> Also, it tends to dry like a gel.</li>
            <li> it tends to dry out your hair if you don&#x27;t keep water in it througout the day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 3 months ago and its only half empty with daily use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few pomades (american crew, layrite, murphys just to name the big ones) and this blows everything out of the water.</li>
            <li> The ONLY product that will take my husbands unruly cow licks and not look greasy.</li>
            <li> Depending on your hair but for me since is semi thin....not to thick or not too thin I have to wait for my hair to be semi-dry in order to get the most of this hair product...</li>
            <li> hair is thick and I highly recommend this product for anyone with hair like mine its also a breeze to wash off a must buy for any man.</li>
            <li> I suggest you rinse your hair before you go to sleep when you have this product on, because if you don&#x27;t your hair is going to be really stiff and possible flakes next morning.</li>
            <li> smell is overwhelming and unpleasant</li>
            <li> star&lt;br /&gt;Color of pomade is a dark brown, which looks gross -1</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking &amp;#34;DRY&amp;#34; before it had the wet look all day long.</li>
            <li> My hair will fall down all day if I don&#x27;t keep it up constantly.</li>
            <li> I can smell my hair all day long, and it makes me feel a little like a middle school locker</li>
            <li> Furthermore, considering you receive 4oz while others only contain 3oz or less</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for help with there pomp-adore or just looking to slick there hair back.</li>
            <li> I have tried various products in the past such as Murray&#x27;s pomade, In the Zone sculpting clay/pomade, etc.</li>
            <li> I usually use American Crew Forming Cream and was looking for something similar, and came across this product.</li>
            <li> For starters, unlike the aforementioned products, a pomade will not only hold all day, but can be rejuvenated at will with just a small amount of water if you need to touch up.</li>
            <li> Weather I use it wet or dry</li>
            <li> Ill stick my hair, hands BARELY damp, straight up in the air and with that dime amount smeared out just go to town and ensure all hair is coated well than go to styling how i want.</li>
            <li> does -- leaves a slightly greasy residue in my hair and the scent of the pomade remains in your hair even after several shampoo washes.  </li>
            <li> I have tired this with both short and long hair and the hold is simply too good compared to other expensive water solubles such as American Crew or Redken that simply fail to hold my hair in place.</li>
            <li> I have very pretty curly and wavy hair that is a bit difficult to style and manage.</li>
            <li> my problem is this, my hair is long enough to slick back and this slightly does the job&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> only problem is I wish it was a little stronger</li>
            <li> By day&#x27;s end, a simple swipe of the comb with a little water helped maintain the look.  </li>
            <li> Its a little different</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn rock hard and can be fixed with a wet comb...</li>
            <li> been using it for long time!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, there is not better water based pomade on the market right now.</li>
            <li> You are paying more money for a bad product.</li>
            <li> it is not really what I would consider</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;ll clog sinks too.)</li>
            <li> and so it should last you a while unless you have a heavy duty pomp.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much shine to it</li>
            <li> This pomade holds in place well, you can also fix/make adjustments with a wet comb.</li>
            <li> It has a firm hold and last for hours.</li>
            <li> Not much shine with this product</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT A REAL POMADE, all it is is gel.</li>
            <li> I was using the &#x27;Garnier Fructis Survivor Rough</li>
            <li> The product or gel is fairly thin, works into to hair really well.</li>
            <li> It gives all day hold with minimal shine.</li>
            <li> The regular is plenty firm for me</li>
            <li> It does messy, its does spikey, it does slicked back, fingers or comb.</li>
            <li> Mine stayed all day with minimal sweating.</li>
            <li> Simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply to towel dried hair and you&#x27;ll have lasting hold all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just enough hold without being too firm.</li>
            <li> I can not get it to work with out looking like a wet dog.</li>
            <li> However, Suavecito provided my hair with too much of a wet look which I was not going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using it for a few months, this stuff is very versatile for my thick and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give Suavecito 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not really a huge fan of the scent.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend this because its not strong enough like it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear any other fragrant product or cologne, so I could distinctly remember the faint smell by day&#x27;s end.  </li>
            <li> Even when it rains, it&#x27;ll just soften up a little, but you won&#x27;t entirely lose your hold if you slick your hair up or back.</li>
            <li> Also, If my hair get’s a bit ruined due to taking off a shirt or whatever I simply wet my comb and run it through my hair to re-style</li>
            <li> very little goes a long long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell, in my opinion it&#x27;s far from subtle.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little doesn&#x27;t go a long way as it&#x27;s intended.</li>
            <li> According to my barber, the person responsible for developing Suavecito Pomade was a former employer for Layrite and while I&#x27;m not entirely sure as to the accuracy of his dramatic re-telling, I do know this:</li>
            <li> It dries a bit hard like gel, but I&#x27;ve found that it softens up enough to run fingers through after a few hours while still keeping my hair up and back.</li>
            <li> With other products, I&#x27;ve often felt it on my skin/scalp hours after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Axe (blue) pomade in the past, but this is thicker.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to test out other pomaids</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first since I have tried various products that failed to hold my unruly wavy hair such as but American Crew Pomade, Fiber, and Forming Cream, and Redken Pomade.</li>
            <li> Other water soluble pomades range from 16-25 depending the brand you choose with a lackluster hold.</li>
            <li> I have a lion&#x27;s mane for hair and was looking for a pomade that would slick my hair back without turning it into steel wool.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I always get compliments and other guys ask me what I use because it lasts ALL DAY and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy as other products are.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It does not have the oily residue after washing, but it is extremely workable before it dries.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t plan on shopping around for any other pomades.</li>
            <li> It is not cheap but one jar lasts a long time for medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I no longer have greasy hair from using Paul Mitchell hair cream, or any other hair</li>
            <li> It does wash out with just water which is a plus compared to other products</li>
            <li> It also smells like extremely condensed hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually keep both the regular and firme on hand.  </li>
            <li> Try this and save money over the other over priced Pomades out there.</li>
            <li> This is just like any other water-based pomade in that it dries just like hair gel.</li>
            <li> Other than the smell</li>
            <li> The bottle was small, 4oz, which is roughly the size of my Voodoo Brew pomade, and that one only cost half the price.</li>
            <li> The fragrance becomes annoying very quickly, as it is strong, and because it is so close to your nose you literally smell it all day!</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell but its not to bad.</li>
            <li> only took 2 day for me to get this in the mail,and i blind bought this without regret because it smells great,sutle scent but masculine unlike alot of pomades.</li>
            <li> Mine was half empty..</li>
            <li> It gets a little crunchy, while other (water salable) pomades I have tried stay wet.</li>
            <li> Other products that I have used either leave my hair feeling like a hard, crispy helmet or they last for 3-4 hours before yielding to the strength of my manly locks (not to mention that these products are still a pain to wash out of my hair at the end of the day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has thick hair and the only product I&#x27;ve found that works on his hair was Gorilla Snot from Walmart, although that stuff is extremely sticky....</li>
            <li> One needs to wet their hair a little in order</li>
            <li> Unless, the other water based pomades cut their prices in half I&#x27;ll be sticking with Suavecito.</li>
            <li> Ive taken off my shirt and hit my hair - it didnt realy mess up at all, where the other ones will.</li>
            <li> Your either going to love the smell or hate.</li>
            <li> I was on a mission to find a pomade to help keep my thick Asian hair in place for an all-day hold without crunchiness.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair (both volume and the hair strands themselves) and this product just can&#x27;t provide enough hold.</li>
            <li> Instead, I&#x27;ve found this product too tacky or thick to apply properly in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stays put all day long with a firm stiff hold.</li>
            <li> It was a let down</li>
            <li> But if you sweat this stuff runs down all over your forehead and face.</li>
            <li> Italian)seems to hold down longer with this product.</li>
            <li> Can you guys dial it down a notch with the smell?</li>
            <li> My hair kept falling down over and over.  </li>
            <li> Will run down your face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used J. Crew, Murrays, and a couple other things, but this blows everything out of the water!</li>
            <li> But women like it and know your not like other guys!</li>
            <li> The only caveat is that it is a little hard to get it to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> I only use a very small amount but still blah results.  </li>
            <li> But not a very strong hold.</li>
            <li> I typically use this product with damp hair.</li>
            <li> I typically pick up my pomade at my barbershop for $10.</li>
            <li> I like the way it goes in just slightly sticky and tames some curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds like a wax and feels like wax until water hits your head, then it&#x27;s gone in less than 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the people complaining that it hardens like gel, I&#x27;m not a scientist but maybe use less?</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and the smell is subtle enough to where you can smell it, but it&#x27;s not overbearing.</li>
            <li> It just feels slightly softer to touch.</li>
            <li> This is actually performs like a gel- hard, stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> With the others they either couldn&#x27;t tame my wave, made my hair hard to comb through, or they simply didn&#x27;t hold...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what these guys are doing with their pomade, I really am not.  </li>
            <li> this is a gel, not a true pomade.  </li>
            <li> Despite the brutal cowlick in the front of my head, it holds true, has a normal/neutral smell, isn&#x27;t too shiny, doesn&#x27;t look goopy, and lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something less messy or greasy</li>
            <li> I decided to grab me a little tub as an add on to an order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult to completely wash out and leaves your hair sticky when it&#x27;s cold and greasey when it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, the product is made to have a little sheen</li>
            <li> A little dab</li>
            <li> I use it with a little bit of water in my hair,</li>
            <li> i like to add a little water to make it smoothier</li>
            <li> A little shine but nothing like a grease head</li>
            <li> A little dab  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I bought being</li>
            <li> You can use just a little or alot.</li>
            <li> I keep getting like little blisters on my head or something.</li>
            <li> so i need something a little heavie</li>
            <li> and you get a little sweaty</li>
            <li> , I was a little put off by it.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the cologne scent</li>
            <li> It fades away a little after a while like I hoped.</li>
            <li> It has a slight cologne smell to it, not strong, but it is there.  </li>
            <li> I decided to narrow my search to the least expensive one that still had hundreds of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not into the wet, pompadour, side part type look, although that&#x27;s the style my hair is cut in (without the hard part).</li>
            <li> Maybe the firm version will fix that.</li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li> i use everyday .</li>
            <li> but these time get the firm hold and try that out:</li>
            <li> This product was honestly not as great as I thought it would be personally</li>
            <li> I prefer the Firm Hold version.</li>
            <li> I have been using Suavecito for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Your hair Will feel totally dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few months after a barber recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> You can run your hands through it or wear a hat with out too much trouble.</li>
            <li> My husband was introduced to this a few months ago while in Vegas for a guy&#x27;s trip</li>
            <li> Run your fingers through your hair once it&#x27;s dried and it&#x27;s almost as if you never put anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to leave the lid off the container for a few days and see if that helps.</li>
            <li> So I just started getting into pomade a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely used worse stuff.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money, and I lost hair in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will look dried out as all hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday for 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> picture is what the pomade looks like, the one shown has been used a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of heavy odors and just prefer the product to serve its purpose without making me unintentionally smell.  </li>
            <li> Suavecito will actually keep my thick hair in it&#x27;s place from morning to late evening, even in Missouri humidity.</li>
            <li> Black, shiney, slick....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products that failed in this simple task</li>
            <li> but it dries really stiff, almost like gel.</li>
            <li> also the product is really stiff</li>
            <li> My hair is stiff.</li>
            <li> This pomade made my hair somewhat stiff.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look tight and slick.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find here in Toronto</li>
            <li> I bought this product despite the reviews that complained about the slight scent, thinking I could handle it.</li>
            <li> I end up having to  use some water to mold it into a pompadour, which then make my hair a little wavy again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to get used to off the bat if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with pomades.</li>
            <li> I decide I would put this into a little travel bottle I bought, but its so thick</li>
            <li> polmade- not sure if this is it.</li>
            <li> Then take a small amount of product and work it through with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I have to take some out and put in a small container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear the ole contour look and Suavecito whips it up without 5+ minutes of excessive combing...</li>
            <li> looks small but lasts for months when used as suggested.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not light by any means!</li>
            <li> Combing this into my dried hair means some of my hair will break off!</li>
            <li> A small dollop does it for me.</li>
            <li> only pomade ill use</li>
            <li> Smell is awful and OVERWHELMING.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would give me a slick, greaser retro look.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re going to smell like a shepards pie if you use this not a sexy scent at all.</li>
            <li> I am looking to try the firm hold though, just to see how it compares!</li>
            <li> In fact, I have small bald spots on my hair line now because of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t appreciate the thickness, styling problems, amount of time wasted, and experimentation I was forced to conduct just to make this product work, for me.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> Its not overwhelming at all and just adds to &amp;#34;my scent&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As someone that has very thin and wispy hair, I glob a ton of this on and slick it back just so my hair doesn&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li> side note: If you plan on sweating, this stuff burns your eyes worse than any other hair product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I hate altering my daily morning routine because the TSE won&#x27;t let me take anything larger than a mouthful of liquid on a plane.  </li>
            <li> It just takes the slick hard look, but still keeps the hold and style i was going for.</li>
            <li> However he does apply a very small amount of get for those annoying flyaway hairs that stick out right on the hairline.</li>
            <li> 2) Using it on dried hair is really hard!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 10+ pomades and this is easily one of the worst.  </li>
            <li> I chose this over Layrite as I was reading reviews that it dries hard</li>
            <li> Having a hard time styling hair.</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t hard to wash off your hair or hands.</li>
            <li> He told me that they have a hard time keeping it in stock.</li>
            <li> or else its a really hard tug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also prefer hard finish.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hard or flake.  </li>
            <li> it is it has hardly any hold.</li>
            <li> Water based Pomade will get slightly hard after wetting.</li>
            <li> Even wax based pomades have a hard time with my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very...unnatural chemical smell that is hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that I have always had a hard time taming.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick and hard to manage hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, somewhat wavy hair and it has been extremely hard finding a hair product that holds my thick hair in place.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What is really important is that this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell horrible at all.  </li>
            <li> Arrived late (bought from BioBeauty&amp;Essentials Store).  </li>
            <li> Unlike waxy pomades, Suavecito has a thick, gel-like consistency which makes it easier to work through hair.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It leaves my thick hair feeling greasy -1</li>
            <li> have thick hair, and have kept my eyes peeled for products that won&#x27;t add volume to my head.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hairs I probably buy the firme hold.</li>
            <li> This was a recommendation from my son&#x27;s hair stylist, my son is 16 with thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, almost curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, stubborn natural-curly hair by the way.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, it held my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I believe all the reviews that made me buy this pomade!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smells awful and the Unique Salon Customer Service Team will harass you.</li>
            <li> Just because you aren&#x27;t hip, doesn&#x27;t mean you hair has to give you away.</li>
            <li> It is thick, heavy, and complicated to use.</li>
            <li> This works, but is prohibitively expensive for what little you get.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but there definitely is a frangrancy smell in it and after using it, your head will smell that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still like it but a bit expensive to use everyday.</li>
            <li> a few friends told me about this product and they werent wrong.</li>
            <li> he doesn&#x27;t like how hard the gel gets and he likes it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not a pleasant smell, IMO.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hardly hold, frizz like mad, and messy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, for those not looking for that definitely give this product a try you won’t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get past the weird smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also just as difficult to comb through your hair as a very heavy petrolatum-based pomade.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and have been looking for a product that I manipulate my hair the way I want to.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and semi-wavy hair which is quite unruly at times.</li>
            <li> For wavy hair it will not hold for thin hair it will clump your hair and leave exposed scalp which will make it look like you are balding.</li>
            <li> Poor pomade.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it worked poorly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nicely forgettable, and I mean that as a compliment.</li>
            <li> other bad things about this pomade or gel is that it doesn&#x27;t hold up well in heat, and if your hair is too damp or watered-down</li>
            <li> As for you guys with crazy thick hair like mine, perhaps the Strong/Firme hold do.</li>
            <li> Seriously cannot get rid of the smell when you use it, very difficult to wash out of hair as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheesy name deter you.</li>
            <li> Though please do correct me if I am wrong.</li>
            <li> Only lasted about two hours before it started to make my hair frizz up and look disgusting and gummy.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for a product that lasted me 2 weeks..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall...&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t appreciate the hair-loss or the fact that this product dried the crap out of my hair when I washed it out.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult to find a pomade that will hold well without a lot of elbow grease.</li>
            <li> I must be doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> but my hair is so difficult to deal with.</li>
            <li> It holds your hair in place without the nasty feeling you get from gel, spray, or other products.</li>
            <li> This can leave you feeling dirty, and begging for a shower to wash it off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work out to well with my hair, I have curly thick hair and the smell is horrible in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was using Axe &amp;#34;Clean Cut&amp;#34; pomade which isn&#x27;t a bad one, but didn&#x27;t give me the hold I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of bad deodorant.</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> smells like cologne too which isnt a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad tub or something</li>
            <li> The smell is really bad.</li>
            <li> Bad...</li>
            <li> The smell triggers craving and that is a bad thing even for a causal</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a bad smell</li>
            <li> was so dissatisfied with that pomade--and the sloppy, terrible styling that resulted from it</li>
            <li> but it was fairly annoying.</li>
            <li> I really hate describing it that way</li>
            <li> but hate the greasy residue they all leave.  </li>
            <li> My hair kept sliding to the side and in my face and that gets annoying after a while.</li>
            <li> Your hair wont get crispy and there wont be any flakes because it&#x27;s water base.</li>
            <li> and she hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> one of the worst hair products i ever put on my hair.</li>
            <li> but the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> If you hate having a a deodorant that overpowers your cologne, then this is not for you!</li>
            <li> Absolutely  terrible product.</li>
            <li> but the smell is horrible, even gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t terrible by any means, but I would prefer a &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; scent.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great hold without greasy look. Water soluble so it&#x27;s easy to fix, then re-fix</li>
            <li> After the very first time I used suavecito I am hooked, wont buy any other pomade.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, I particularly like that it washes out with water alone. Unfortunately, after giving Suavecito a month of use, I have gone back to Murray&#x27;s Super Light (much lighter than Murray&#x27;s original). Suavecito tends to act as a straightener in my hair (I&#x27;m Caucasian with relatively thick, pretty straight hair). Murray&#x27;s super light does better after wearing a bike helmet on my commute to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want easy rinse out and less greasiness, Suavecito is a great choice.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,good product for the price only problem is I wish it was a little stronger I have really curly hair,I guess next time I will try the firme hold</li>
            <li> i dont like the smell at all, smells like a strong cologne</li>
            <li> WAAAY cheaper that another leading brand. Works better.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Not heavy, greasy, smelly. Doesn&#x27;t take a power washer to wash out. Very manageable.</li>
            <li> SWITCHED FROM LAYRITE .... SAVING $4 A TUB AND THIS STUFF IS BETTER !!! WILL NEVER GO BACK</li>
            <li> In the last 2 weeks I&#x27;ve ordered about half a dozen hair gel/clay products that are double or more the price of this product and this by far has been the best I&#x27;ve used. I can go ahead and throw the rest of them out.</li>
            <li> It has a good hold and arrived within the delivery period. However the product smell is unappealing and long-lasting, the pomade is not as good as I assumed it to be. It was a let down and I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be buying any hair products from overseas again. Seriously cannot get rid of the smell when you use it, very difficult to wash out of hair as well.</li>
            <li> The pomade I was looking for. I was using Axe &amp;#34;Clean Cut&amp;#34; pomade which isn&#x27;t a bad one, but didn&#x27;t give me the hold I was looking for. So I went with the &amp;#34;Firme/Strong hold.&amp;#34; It was good but way too thick for my liking. I ordered this by mistake thinking was getting the Firme hold. To my pleasant surprise, the consistency of this pomade was way easier to work into my thick hair. It still gives me a strong hold that will lasts all day and even until the next time you shower as long as you add water. It will still maintain a strong hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that softens it up is high temperature like being under the sun for 2-3 hours at a time. But once it cools off it&#x27;ll harden up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> My husband found this at a bike show and was very happy when we found it here on Amazon.  It keeps hair perfectly in place but then washes out wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  This is my first pomade by suggestion from a buddy of mine.  I have extremely thick and curly Caucasian hair and after having my head shaved for the last 10 years I decided to go with a new haircut.  I had my amazing wife do a variant of the undercut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to style my hair with a leave in gel and hairspray but it was too think and really only lasts one day.  I also can&#x27;t put over the head, headphones on which is a big deal for me because I listen to music all day during work and on my commute to work (1 1/2 hours each way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really unsure how to use this stuff and i&#x27;ve been very proficient after a few uses.  The smell is great, the hold is great and it&#x27;s a little easier for me to apply after my hair is slightly damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can keep this in my hair for two day&#x27;s with a solid hold for a side swept combed hair.  Without the pomade, my hair would look like a poofy mushroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little surprised at the size of the container but I am very happy with the product and for the price this is crazy great stuff.  I will not be adventuring anywhere else as I&#x27;m completely satisfied with Suavecito.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;* Great long lasting hold for the way I style my hair&lt;br /&gt;* Great for my curly thick hair&lt;br /&gt;* Smells like awesome&lt;br /&gt;* Looks better applied in my hair with a large wide gapped tooth comb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;* I think i&#x27;d be interested in a 10oz container</li>
            <li> Used to use Gatsby.  This stuff is smooth and has a nice smell to it.  Really like the texture it hold hair with.  Many compliments since the switch.  Recommend if you are on the fence and wanna try a new pomade.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve yet to use</li>
            <li> Works alright but it dries really stiff, almost like gel.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, does the job, and washes out completely.</li>
            <li> This is a great pomade! Easy to apply and is a really firm hold, can adjust your hair during the day if needed. Your hair feels natural again after an hour. Holds all day!</li>
            <li> Dat hold. Dat smell. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.  Don&#x27;t need a lot to achieve a good hold.  Satisfied.</li>
            <li> Holds very well. The color does not affect your hair color at all and the smell Is good. It&#x27;s not like a barbershop smell or perfumey it has a nice cologne smell. Little bit goes a long way for this product and has a good hold for sure deffinitly reccomended.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just great. Works as it is supose to washes easily and smells great!! Smells like that fresh smell you get when you walk out of a barber shop or a really good cologne but. Very unique smell I love it.</li>
            <li> only took 2 day for me to get this in the mail,and i blind bought this without regret because it smells great,sutle scent but masculine unlike alot of pomades.It works excellent love the product.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved it! Smells great.</li>
            <li> Meh....smells great however it gets hard like LayRite and is really matte finish not for me. Separates the hair on big chunks too makes my hair look thinner than it is. Save your $$$ I really wanted to love it Im all about made in Merika.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best pomades ever.I swore to axe pomade and then I tried suavecito and I&#x27;m hooked .it&#x27;s also a boost that it smells good at work I&#x27;m constantly wearing a cover and with suavecito it stays in place .my hair is thick and I highly recommend this product for anyone with hair like mine its also a breeze to wash off a must buy for any man.</li>
            <li> Probably the best pomade I have used. Definitely will be using it again. Holds well and washes out easy with just shampoo. Holds my hair all day.</li>
            <li> best pomade Ive ever used. Period.</li>
            <li> Best Pom I have Used!</li>
            <li> Awesome smell, easily washes out of hair and hands without any residue.</li>
            <li> Suavecito provides great hold for styles that need a lot of rigidity like pompadours and slicked-back styles. Unlike waxy pomades, Suavecito has a thick, gel-like consistency which makes it easier to work through hair. It dries a bit hard like gel, but I&#x27;ve found that it softens up enough to run fingers through after a few hours while still keeping my hair up and back. The water solubility is great for washing out at the end of the day, but if you accidentally get your hair wet or sweat too much, your hair will start to lose hold. I still find that much more preferable than the greasy, never-fully-washed-out feeling of wax-based pomades.</li>
            <li> smells great, hold great, what else do i need?</li>
            <li> First, (after reading alot of the reviews on here) I have to say that the smell goes away as quickly. It&#x27;s a nice touch, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it simply for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is still the best pomade I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s very manageable, even in damp hair. It&#x27;s oily-ness quickly dissipates, leaving hair that just feels like it&#x27;s naturally grown itself to your style. You might need to apply more of the product than I do for a &amp;#34;wet-look&amp;#34;, but even a fingertip of this stuff ensures your hair will style and stay all day long. Unlike many other pomades, this one does not run onto your skin. With other products, I&#x27;ve often felt it on my skin/scalp hours after use. This can leave you feeling dirty, and begging for a shower to wash it off. With this one, I don&#x27;t even think about it, once it&#x27;s been applied.​</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Its a WATER SOLUBLE pomade, which means its easy to wash out of your hair and hands. I have medium to long hair and I find pomades to work best for my style and length of hair. This product can be used in damp or dry hair. In damp hair it gives more shine but less hold. In dry hair it gives excellent hold, but less shine. I typically use this product with damp hair. It does a great job parting my hair, holding a pomp, and laying down those annoying strands of hair that stick up. I purchased this product about 3 months ago and its only half empty with daily use. I will definitely purchase again once I run out in another 3 months!</li>
            <li> The hold is great, I just personally don&#x27;t love the smell. It reminds me of bad deodorant. I&#x27;m going to try some Lay-Rite next.</li>
            <li> This stuff took me a bit of trial and error as I haven&#x27;t really used a product like this before, but once I got used to it, I&#x27;ll certainly be buying more.</li>
            <li> I decided to grab me a little tub as an add on to an order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically wear a pompador most days. Black, shiney, slick.... or I try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Murrys orange can for years which I like enough but it&#x27;s difficult to completely wash out and leaves your hair sticky when it&#x27;s cold and greasey when it&#x27;s hot. That said the hold is amazing and the 3~4$ can lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always pn the look out for alternatives. Currently I am using Magic Sporting Waves which I really like. The Sporting Waves washes out so much easier than the Murrays and yet retains the reworkability that I like in pomades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the Suavectito.... well it arrived quickly. The can is cool looking. I open it up and it&#x27;s a clear and rather pretty deep amber. Smell is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah... it&#x27;s pretty much hair gel. It works well, just like a gel and hardens like a gel. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a pomade to me though. I&#x27;m not digging that it hardens like a gel. That said for gel it&#x27;s fine gel. Not flakey, holds well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is not really what I would consider a pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can looks pretty bicthin on the counter though and maybe sometime I may need a product more like a gel but I think I will be sticking with the Magic most days.</li>
            <li> holds my hair well and it can be moved and it&#x27;ll spring back into place.</li>
            <li> This product gives great hold but it didn&#x27;t give me the shine that I was looking for and I received it really fast also I&#x27;d like to add my wife really likes it for her hair I have no regrets in this purchase</li>
            <li> Like it but the scent is a little strong</li>
            <li> I have allergy to fragrances like perfumes and flowers, and this product smell like a mixture of axe and cheap perfumes. Even if I didn&#x27;t have allergy I would stay away cause of the fragrance. But I do like how it feels in my hair, I have thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent and isn&#x27;t difficult to wash out.</li>
            <li> Good product, holds my hair down and won&#x27;t crust two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great product smells Amazing</li>
            <li> i love it, it could have better hold but works as well as layrite. the smell and skeleton are awesome</li>
            <li> I have tried many different hair products to get the look I am going for.  Of all the brands I have tried American Crew and Redken seemed to work the good - just not great.  Until Suavecito.  I have always wanted a product that was light, washed out easy and held all day.  Guys, this is it! I happen to know people who own a barber shop.  I will be suggesting they carry this product, I believe in it!</li>
            <li> I like it. Good hold and shine, smells great too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Smell isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> Lasted a long time, worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I recently switched from using gel to this stuff and I&#x27;ll never go back. Feels good, doesn&#x27;t flake off. Smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> Best pomade!!! I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and stiff. It has a great smell to.</li>
            <li> Having fine hair makes a little more of a challenge.  Wax will do the job for sure, but how likes having to wash your hair about 9 times in a row?  Most important, girls don&#x27;t like to touch grease.  Suavecito holds like a wax but it washes out in one rinse.  Suavecito stays set when it dries.  What I do is let it dry into its hold and recomb or run my fingers thru my hair.  Don&#x27;t have the feeling you hair is frozen and the shape holds.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Crew pomade...this one is far less pliable. It goes in like a sticker pomade, and sets like a gel, and I want my hair to be moveable.</li>
            <li> I love the hold and style i get from this product! But if you sweat this stuff runs down all over your forehead and face. Right after using it my forehead became increasingly more shinny and greasy which was this product coming out of my hair when i barely sweat. Now my fore head is breaking out because the product is clogging pores on my fore head. If it didn&#x27;t come out when you sweat I&#x27;d give it 5 stars now I need to find something that won&#x27;t make my forehead a damn mirror. Fiber and normal murrays pomade don&#x27;t do this</li>
            <li> I really like the scent on this.  The hold is also really good and it has a pretty decent shine.  I don&#x27;t like water solubles though, so I don&#x27;t use it very often.  If you don&#x27;t sweat this is a great alternative to traditional pomades.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It is by far the best pomade I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> For thick hair users:  This will hold your hair reasonably well but perhaps go with the stronger variant.  Also in general I wish it did not dry so hard on your hair and left it with more of a &#x27;slick&#x27; and wet look.</li>
            <li> I was a Murray&#x27;s guy for a while and that stuff is straight up grease (it&#x27;ll clog sinks too.) Anyway I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suavecito was recommended to me and I do have to say aside from the Axe like scent, this will be my go to for pomade. It will dry a little on the crispy side, though just run a wet comb to reactivate the pomade and you&#x27;ll be good to go. A little bit goes a long way and so it should last you a while unless you have a heavy duty pomp. Expect to use more (obviously). Don&#x27;t let the cheesy name deter you. I chose this over Layrite as I was reading reviews that it dries hard and that&#x27;s not what I was looking for. Though please do correct me if I am wrong. Perhaps I should give Layrite a try for contrast. Happy pomping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Axe (blue) pomade in the past, but this is thicker.  Smell is fine - hardly there.  If it was face moisturizer, I probably wouldn&#x27;t like the smell, but it&#x27;s in my hair - you can&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> Works great at cool to middling temperatures.  On a hot day (&amp;#62;85F), has a tendency to get kinda goopy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through about 7 tubs of this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried plenty other regular and water soluble pomades and admit this one is my favorite. It washes right out with one rinse. The smell I&#x27;ve been complimented on a number of times. I have found the hold to vary depending on the situation. For a more matte look, I will wait for my hair to get fully dry and then apply a small dab of it onto my hair. For the sophisticated suave look, I will use a little more product and apply when my hair is damp. The sheen of this product really depends on me on how dry my hair is when I apply it (more dry &#x3D; more matte). Keep in mind, the product is made to have a little sheen so you won&#x27;t get a full matte look. Helpful hint: if you have a spray bottle and want a strong hold after you&#x27;ve applied this to your hair then give your hair a little spritz with the bottle before leaving anywhere. The extra water won&#x27;t move your hair out of place and will lock in the hold of the pomade more. Perfect for when you&#x27;ve fully combed your hair and want to make sure your hair doesn&#x27;t shift later on.</li>
            <li> As someone that has very thin and wispy hair, I glob a ton of this on and slick it back just so my hair doesn&#x27;t move. This will last all day and is very easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My new go-to hair product! Great consistency, spreads out well in your hands, great shine, girlfriend loves how it smells. Rinces out very easily with just water.</li>
            <li> Your hair ain&#x27;t moving with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Good hold</li>
            <li> Great Hold with just a little product. Has a cologne like smell.</li>
            <li> Letting my hair grow out from a buzz cut and it takes a while until I have enough length so my hair doesn&#x27;t stick straight out in all directions. This stuff is great. A little dab and I can brush my hair and it stays in place all day. I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products that failed in this simple task but Suavecito works every time.</li>
            <li> This is the best pomade I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s a great price. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is far superior to any of the common big brand junk at your local supermarket. Unlike the others, it is 100% water based, leaving your hair feeling clean and not greasy. The smell is also amazing.</li>
            <li> my oldest son loves this stuff. he said it is made locally here in Orange County. he says it last 2 to 3 days even if he washes his hair.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this hair pomade called Sauvecito it  works really good it&#x27;s one of my new favorite hair products because it keeps a smooth and good hold &amp; it&#x27;s not too greasy. I recommend it to anyone that is interested in buying it. The seller was good on getting it to me on time I received it before its expected arrival time which I loved a lot because I  got it in a couple of  . With that being said buy &amp; try this product I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it just as much as I do :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product</li>
            <li> One of my favorite water based pomade and it smells great too! will be a Suavecito customer for years to come.</li>
            <li> My favorite pomade. I would have never known about Sauvecito unless it was for my new barber. Their entire shop uses it and swears by it. I have tried other more &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34; pomades before and they all got the job done for the most part but nothing like Sauvecito. Despite the brutal cowlick in the front of my head, it holds true, has a normal/neutral smell, isn&#x27;t too shiny, doesn&#x27;t look goopy, and lasts the entire day. I won&#x27;t use any other pomade from now on, especially at this price!</li>
            <li> One of the best pomades I have used. I would probably recommend the strong hold Suavacito for those with thick hair though.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s my favorite!  It is much better than any other brand names that I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  The subtle sweet smell and the none greasiness are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great product! Not as strong as murrays but doesnt hurt to comb or a hastle to wash, prefer this over hollister pomade too. The hold is moderate but it gets you there if you apply the right amount.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff. I&#x27;ve used J. Crew, Murrays, and a couple other things, but this blows everything out of the water! Great stuff for an even better price!</li>
            <li> smells like a barber shop- not a bad thing.  Isn&#x27;t sticky like the Imperial stuff.  Washes right out.  Light, but holds well without giving your hair that super glue / hard feel. If you want more control get the next step up from this stuff- it holds and controls more, but at the cost of drying hard.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and have been looking for a product that I manipulate my hair the way I want to. This, is it. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My Favorite Pomade! I love this stuff! I use it with a little bit of water in my hair, when I do it like this my hair is easily formable throughout the day! A little scoop works for me, when I put more it just flattens my hair.</li>
            <li> Great! Water soluble, so it washes out easy and reactivates with water. My hair is about 9 inches long on top and the sides are tapered and I use 2.5 finger tip scoops of it and hair seams to still be pliable and free. It will harden after 4 or so minutes but will still be pliable. Maybe the firm version will fix that. I used to use Murray&#x27;s and my hair is a little more harder than that and less pliable (using about the same amount). I like it, and it smells great. It works great,its just not as good as when the barber used it on me....maybe Im expecting too much. if you want  more greasy look ( this one is like a 4/10 on shine scale) go for royal crown.</li>
            <li> Never going back to murrays or high life after using this stuff. Washes out a million times easier.</li>
            <li> one of the worst hair products i ever put on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great packaging including 2 towelettes and 15% off Luxury Barber, came really fast, brand new, and the dryer the hair the stronger the hold. Smells like cologne, masculine scent which smells beautiful and is also subtle which won&#x27;t mask or clash with whatever cologne or scent you have on. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Works good i like it alot 😄</li>
            <li> Love the smell and holds well</li>
            <li> Super strong.  Looking for an alternative to crew polmade- not sure if this is it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product; great price! Love that it&#x27;s water based: easy on the scalp, and easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> This has become my go-to pomade. It goes on easily, combs thru without tugging, and it doesn&#x27;t dry or flake.  Like all water-based pomades, too much will tend to clump up; it just takes a pea-sized amount to tame my unruly, short hair.  You can always add more if you need it as I found out when I let my hair grow a bit.  It re-styles easily with a damp comb, and washes out with any shampoo.  The scent is a bit sweet and somehow old-fashioned, but isn&#x27;t overpowering and tends to fade fairly quickly.  Although I have a rotation of about 12 different pomades, this is the one I know will perform every time.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a 1oz sample of Layrite Deluxe. Both hold up well throughout the day, but found Suavecito easier/smoother to apply. Also preferred the smell of Suavecito over the light washed out vanilla smell of Layrite.</li>
            <li> Just this year I started to comb my hair back so I am still new to the pomade product lines. This stuff goes on waxy, mixes nicely into damp hair and dries a bit like gel. There&#x27;s not much shine to it once it&#x27;s dried. My hair stays put all day long with a firm stiff hold.</li>
            <li> Love it makes my hair look great and smell great as well</li>
            <li> kind of makes my hair feel oily though otherwise its great</li>
            <li> Suavecito is one of the best water-based pomades on the market. I typically pick up my pomade at my barbershop for $10. The hold is strong and has a deep shine, and washes out with ease. I highly recommend this product to anyone that is new to pomades or is trying to avoid petroleum pomades. There are many more water-based pomades on the market: Layrite, Imperial, Sweet Georgia Brown, and Grants. For a water-based pomade Suavicito is better than the rest, and at only $10 you get a superior product for less. Unless, the other water based pomades cut their prices in half I&#x27;ll be sticking with Suavecito.</li>
            <li> For people who like gel, this is a good hybrid of pomade and gel. I prefer wax or cream so this didn&#x27;t quite work for me. It did the job though.</li>
            <li> Smells great arrived faster then expected. Great stuff</li>
            <li> Drys as soon it come in contact with hair. Having a hard time styling hair. Drys too quickly for this reason I rated a one star.</li>
            <li> Great product, water base without alcohol. Nice aroma, with a small amount do the job.</li>
            <li> This is a great pomaid, with a suddle not overwhelming scent. The produce is similar to steadfast, in both texture and hold however my hair(thick Italian)seems to hold down longer with this product. I love the fact it&#x27;s water-soluble so it isn&#x27;t hard to wash off your hair or hands. All in all, a good product at a reasonable price. Will continue to test out other pomaids but this ranks high on my list!</li>
            <li> I tried this after my barber recommended it. It goes on smooth, holds well, and doesn&#x27;t flake. I have tried other products, but this is my absolute go to. The only problem is that when I went back to my barber to buy more, they were out. He told me that they have a hard time keeping it in stock. Thank god that I found this on Amazon, so I can keep my Suavecito addiction going.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something less messy or greasy then Murray&#x27;s though with as much hold as Layrite only a bit easier on the pocketbook. Found this. The hold is nowhere near as solid as Layrite though not as greasy or petroleum like Murray&#x27;s. Overall love the clean look, nice cologne like barber smell, but the hold is just not there for me.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son.....he loves this product!</li>
            <li> Smells like cheap cologne</li>
            <li> But not a very strong hold.</li>
            <li> After seeing and reading so many positive reviews about Suavecito, I finally decided to give it try. Many kept raving about how this product works really good despite being a water soluble pomade. I was skeptical at first since I have tried various products that failed to hold my unruly wavy hair such as but American Crew Pomade, Fiber, and Forming Cream, and Redken Pomade. Other classic pomades such as Murray&#x27;s Superior or Dax are simply a pain to wash off despite providing a good hold. I know there are some guys who like that but for me I like wash my hair in one go and be done. After trying it for a couple of days I must say this is an excellent product as it provides a strong hold that will fit any hair type and style and wash off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to hold I must say this product does an awesome job. I have wavy hair and it is pain trying to style it from time to time and finding a product that will hold my hair in place the whole day. However, with this product my hair stays in place no problems. I have tired this with both short and long hair and the hold is simply too good compared to other expensive water solubles such as American Crew or Redken that simply fail to hold my hair in place. Also, If my hair get’s a bit ruined due to taking off a shirt or whatever I simply wet my comb and run it through my hair to re-style and then bam ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suavecito doesn’t provide a high shine compared to other products. I would say its a light to medium shine. If you are looking to achieve more shine from this product I would suggest using another product as a top coat for further shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the scent it reminds me of a musky male deodorant at times. The scent isn’t bad by any means but for those who have a sensitive nose it might be a problem because it can a bit strong. It’s not overbearing but definitely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a $10 pomade that comes in a4oz container I say it’s a good deal considering it has strong hold and washes easily. Other water soluble pomades range from 16-25 depending the brand you choose with a lackluster hold. Furthermore, considering you receive 4oz while others only contain 3oz or less you are getting a good bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for product that provides a strong hold that lasts all day and washes off easily at a fairly reasonable price. If you are looking for a more stronger hold try their Firme hold which is supposed to have a stronger hold. However, for those not looking for that definitely give this product a try you won’t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The best hair gel, I have ever used, wet or dry!</li>
            <li> My husband has short straight hair and our son has long curly hair.  This works great on both types of hair.  Helps keep the hair exactly how you want it styled.  They love it!!</li>
            <li> I really like using Suavecito pomade.  It has a manly smell, has just the right hold for my taste, and washes out easily.  This is a good product.  To me, it&#x27;s much better than most hair products I find in box stores.  Can&#x27;t beat the cost either.</li>
            <li> This pomade holds in place well, you can also fix/make adjustments with a wet comb. It washes out with shampoo very easily unlike some oil based pomades. It also has a nice clean scent. doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals or plastics.</li>
            <li> good hold whatever shine smell is overwhelming  but smells good its a lil pricey though</li>
            <li> Put this pomade in my hair and had to immediately wash it out. It just SMELLS WAY WAY WAY TOO STRONG. Smells like cheap cologne. Just keep this in mind.</li>
            <li> Came quick and smells good, just was a bit smaller of a container than i thought</li>
            <li> its a combination of hair gel and wax. it works really well especially with people with long hair.</li>
            <li> The pomade itself is awesome. Simple to apply and make corrections. Washes off of hands with only water and leaves no residue. The scent is pleasant and somewhat of a masculine musky feel to it. The hold is amazing even when it is still wet but once it dries, your hair is locked in and I happen to love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it seems that the company that I purchased from (not Suavecito) placed their own label on the jar and it covered the instructions. Not that it is a big deal but it was fairly annoying.</li>
            <li> I have no hair, but my kids do (for now).  And now they look fresh as ever.  There is no bad odor and it works without water.  Say goodbye to saliva lathered palms and hello to the new age of hair products.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to work with, doesn&#x27;t try super hold, and holds all day. I&#x27;d recommend to anyone styling longer hair especially.</li>
            <li> This makes it VERY easy for me to keep my hair styled without making it feel like I used a bottle of Elmers glue in my hair. It is also malleable with water and smells GREAT.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Great product</li>
            <li> got the super hold and it holds but not super. Hair is longer on top and in order to get it to hold still need to use hairspray. Nice that it is washes out with water and washes off your hands easy.</li>
            <li> Let me put it like this, When I shower and get out and towel dry my hair it stands straight up.&lt;br /&gt;This should give you an idea of what kind of texture and hair I have, Even when dry its like a big poof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff looks okay, Smells ok not too strong like others suggested to me its hardly even scented.&lt;br /&gt;But my problem is this, my hair is long enough to slick back and this slightly does the job&lt;br /&gt;but not enough I Have to apply numerous amounts into my hair to get it to stay slick back&lt;br /&gt;even than its not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this because its not strong enough like it so claims, I will trying Shiners Gold next, thats what I originally wanted to buy but amazon never had it, But You can buy SHINERSGOLD from their website for 13.00 bucks, works even better!</li>
            <li> Just bought it for the first time and man it is great. It has a firm hold and last for hours. Let&#x27;s you comb it through out the day while it&#x27;s still on. Smells pretty strong not a bad smell though. Not much shine with this product but it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Some dudes on here need help with hair and not be so quick to give products low ratings. I learned this from a good friend of mine. Blowdry your hair into the style you want it (get it wet first of course). Then take a small amount of product and work it through with your fingers. After you used the desired amount of product just comb it through. That simple. This stuff is one of the best bang for your buck pomades out there and I currently use it every day.</li>
            <li> graet ! i use everyday . persue the classic ! everday morning i use this pomade and wear the suit.</li>
            <li> Suavecito has a deliciously sweet smell, while still remaining subtly masculine. Works into the hair very smoothly and holds nicely all day without ever dropping a single flake. Every now and then if I need a touch up I&#x27;ll run to the restroom, dampen my hands and work my hair again, and it comes right back to the hold it had in the morning. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves the way this stuff makes my hair smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what these guys are doing with their pomade, I really am not.  I&#x27;ve tried many pomades over the years, but this one stands out as the most effective in your hair, not just from appearance, but from function, smell, and application.  I would point out that I&#x27;m African American, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it would work with spike or flare styles of hair.  Short waves here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I&#x27;ve tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B000X2DMEG American Crew Hair Stlying Pomade, 3 Ounce]] - This works, but is prohibitively expensive for what little you get.  It also does not fully last throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B000142NMI Murray&#x27;s Superior Hair Dressing Pomade]] - A joke.  Didn&#x27;t hardly hold, frizz like mad, and messy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B001FSK8SA Axe Refined Clean-cut Look Pomade, 2.64-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)]] - This works and is reasonably priced, but it won&#x27;t last all day.&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B002VA4FUS AXE Shine Pomade, Smooth Look, 2.64 Ounce (Pack of 3)]] - Same as above.  Works, but won&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B000ZBW44Y Redken Men Polish Up Defining Pomade, 3.4-ounce]] - Didn&#x27;t work well.  Nice shine though.&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B004DPDSHU Suave Professionals, Men&#x27;s Styling Pomade, 1.75-Ounce (Pack of 4)]] - Great value, great shine and worked well.  But it didn&#x27;t last and it didn&#x27;t do edges very well.  You also don&#x27;t get much in each container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I come to the Suavecito pomade which had been in my wishlist for months.  And what a difference.  Not only does it apply perfectly and with no need to brush afterward, the container is nicely sized, and you get a very smooth, controlled hair style that, when coupled with a proper durag (I use [[ASIN:B001JTGO7Y WAVE BUILDER Seamless Du-Rag BLACK]]) for 10-15 minutes, will come out looking perfectly molded and waved out.  WITHOUT a brush.  You only need to apply it with medium pressure with your hands, then as it starts to get harder to slide your hands, add more pressure.  Then mold the edges downand trim to style.  Keep the durag on for 10-15, and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked one star off for one reason that is personal to me and may not apply to you: It does not have any shine that I can tell after it&#x27;s set.  It does when you&#x27;re first applying it.  It would have been preferable to have the shine last throughout the day as that&#x27;s one thing i like a lot about the AXE and Suave brands - you get a glossy look that isn&#x27;t greasy but stands out tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is highly recommended though (at least for short wave styles like mine).</li>
            <li> Best pomade on the planet! Smells ridiculously good and makes my hair feel great! I can&#x27;t keep the ladies away! Ok, I was kidding about the ladies, but this stuff rocks!</li>
            <li> This stuff works awesome just like Layrite but cheaper!! Has a diff smell but still really good! I def will be purchasing this more in the future</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this gel, but I starting to like it</li>
            <li> I used a lot of different products and out of all of them I really like this one. It has a really nice masculine smell and holds all day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, the smell is nice and it works well on both wet and dry hair. Plus I really like saying &amp;#34;suavecito!&amp;#34; Sometimes I blurt it out for no apparent reason. It also washes out easily. No complaints here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUAVECITO!!!! (See?)</li>
            <li> This pomade works great. The only downside is the smell can be a little too strong. It&#x27;s a good smell, but you can smell it over a subtle cologne, which is not desirable. The scent only hangs around for about an hour tops.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s got a nice smell to it and the hold is excellent. My buddy that owns the salon I go to was using it so I figured I would see if it was on Amazon and if so I&#x27;d get some if the price was right. For the price I paid I&#x27;d say this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have used hair gel for years.  A friend referred this to me.  I now cannot stand gel anymore.  This holds my hair in place just as well as gel but without the crunch.  It rinses out much easier to.  Glad i found it and amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> I have flirted with a number of hair products in my time. I have used creams, gels, pomades and waxes so I would like to think I am a moderately informed user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for the first time a few days ago. The first thing I noticed is that a little goes a long way. I am sure it will take me at least 3 months to go through the entire jar. At the end of each day my hair is in the same place I put it at the beginning of the day. Great hold without having to put a ton of stuff in my hair. I will certainly be buying this going forward. Really great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints to report. It does want it is intended to do. I also like the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> My barbershop uses this and I thought I&#x27;d try it at home. It kind of works in like a butch wax, but less stiff and it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue on your hands afterwards. There&#x27;s a lot here, so this will last me through 2 or 3 tubs of the kind you would buy at the grocery. Good product.</li>
            <li> I honestly had never tried pomade but i definitely loved how it held my hair in place, even on airy days. Also love the scent it&#x27;s not to strong to annoy or bug me but just right. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for help with there pomp-adore or just looking to slick there hair back.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold up my hair that well</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Great Product. Love this stuff and a great price</li>
            <li> As the name suggest it smooth to put into the hair keeping it down for the day with a pleasent smell not over the top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good pomade for a decent hold. Very reworkable as long as you use a little water and comb it through. The best part is that it is water soluble. All it takes is water to completely wash out, just be careful not to add too much water during the day when reworking it. Overall very satisfied. I want to purchase the same brand next but these time get the firm hold and try that out:</li>
            <li> I got this product because of all the positive reviews, but it&#x27;s just like all the other hair gels.  It makes my hair feel stiff, like cheap hair gels with tons of alcohol.  It does smell good, but it&#x27;s just not for me.  I have a lion&#x27;s mane for hair and was looking for a pomade that would slick my hair back without turning it into steel wool.  I guess the term &amp;#34;Pomade&amp;#34; threw me off because pomade is supposed to be waxy and greasy, not gel like.</li>
            <li> This is great for keeping a beard with a lot of stragglers in check. I like that it&#x27;s easily washable, and the scent is light.</li>
            <li> A little doesn&#x27;t go a long way as it&#x27;s intended. It does smell nice and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> great for the pompadour look</li>
            <li> Quality is great.  My barber recommends this product.  Love the name!  As far as hair hold, I cant complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the scent of this gel is crazy strong!!  So strong that I&#x27;m knocking off 2 stars!  The only way I can describe it is like a $2 cheap cologne.  I really hate describing it that way but i have no choice.  Your either going to love the smell or hate.</li>
            <li> Good product... been using for some time and depending on the amount, you get the desired control/hold.  Does not flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was prompt to ship which I received with no issues</li>
            <li> Light masculine fragrance.  Keeps hair smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing and is the best for the price range</li>
            <li> This is a great pomade. Easily moldable and does not leave your hair feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my 1 year old son! And my daughter too lol I don&#x27;t care if it smells like &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; this stuff is the best. Smells wonderful and works amazing.</li>
            <li> Excellent hold and shine but the smell is horrible. Very musky and gave me a headache. This product really comes down to personal preference.</li>
            <li> one of the best pomade I ever had!! very recommended!!</li>
            <li> Great hold and shines nice.</li>
            <li> this pomade is great... holds well without being stiff &amp; best of all, you can actually easilly wash it off your hands, unlike may other thicker pomades..&lt;br /&gt;  If you have not tried Suavecito yet, give it a shot!!</li>
            <li> The hold is not quite as good as Tres Flores, and the smell is much stronger.</li>
            <li> It had been recommended by my barber.... It holds and washes right out.... It doesn&#x27;t turn rock hard and can be fixed with a wet comb... It smells decent and is worth a month or more of use with a short cut</li>
            <li> Works as advertised! Sticks well and love the fragrance. Easy to wash off too. Will get it again. Recommended seller</li>
            <li> This product was honestly not as great as I thought it would be personally but it does work, just not as great for wavy hair (I&#x27;m guessing) I have wavy hair and the pomade looks nice, clean and fresh cut when i first put it on but to hold up my pompadour, it takes at least 3 or 4 finger scoops to do so. This probably works alot better on straight hair but when I am done with this jar, I will be moving on to wax. But despite those things, this product is great, and it smells AMAZING. Every morning when I get ready, it&#x27;s like a routine to smell it before I put it in my hair. Lol</li>
            <li> Pretty slick in the hair I like it, it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> This is the one of the best Pomades I have used. It smells great, works really well, and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> First off, I am Mexican and I believe the creators of Suavecito made this for thick wavy hair. I&#x27;ve tried black &amp; white, Voodoo brew, Dax, Layrite, Layrite super hold, AND J.s Sloane... I can tell you with full assurance that Suavecito works THE BEST for MY hair. With the others they either couldn&#x27;t tame my wave, made my hair hard to comb through, or they simply didn&#x27;t hold...Suavecito goes in silky smooth and makes combing your hair a BREEZE. It has a cologne scent and trust me your lady will love it! This pomade does harden up which for me is great because I dont want to worry about my hair getting messed up if I bump into something. Comes out super easy..I loved the stuff so much I bought the 32 oz Jug! Another plus is this pomade is cheaper than most of the others out there who are way more expensive and just aren&#x27;t as good! I don&#x27;t know if it works with every kind of hair but if it works with mine I don&#x27;t see why it wouldnt! GET THIS POMADE..</li>
            <li> If you have thick straight hair this will work. For wavy hair it will not hold for thin hair it will clump your hair and leave exposed scalp which will make it look like you are balding. It will not hold up in warm weather nor will it last all day. It smells pretty good but otherwise I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great pomade that adds an excellent shine and firm hold to hair.  Apply dry for a stiff hold or apply while your hair is damp for a nice hold that isn&#x27;t stiff.  To reactivate just run a damp comb through your hair and reset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is a travel size needs to be created, I always carry on my bag for business travel and this size is to large.  I have to take some out and put in a small container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to friends and even my stylist.</li>
            <li> I love Suavecito, its all I use. It smells great, works great, looks great.&lt;br /&gt;Thats basically all there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments and other guys ask me what I use because it lasts ALL DAY and then some</li>
            <li> This is a very good product that offers excellent hold, mild scent, and is a  water soluble pomade which is awesome~</li>
            <li> I did not buy them through my account, but my husband bought this through his account. He absolutely LOVES this product. It is water soluble and smells great. He has tried many products and this is by far the best. I too love it on him.  He has very thick hair and this stuff combs nicely through the hair.  It&#x27;s not greasy as other products are. He&#x27;s a greaser with tattoos.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice and does a decent job, but I wish it was just a little stronger in hold. Even though it doesn&#x27;t hold super strong, clean hair doesn&#x27;t get the greasy look at all with this pomade.</li>
            <li> 10 mins later this is what my hair looks like 😩 Hair won&#x27;t hold in place even after using hair drier &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted it to work and smells ok too. You can ew adjust or rebrush your hair again through the day without adding anymore pomade but it won&#x27;t hold long. I was aiming for backwards or even settling for sideways but it won&#x27;t hold into place.</li>
            <li> Pros: This stuff holds really well, i have medium length hair ( my bangs touch my eyebrows) i style my hair to the side(comb over) and after applying this product everything holds in place very well. It has a a medium firmness once it dries up but not hard or crunchy like most gels, no white residue either. its pretty flexiable, i can actually pick up a couple strands of my hair and it will fall back into place when i let go. it last all day too. for the price, its unbeatable. most pomades come in 2oz jars but this is a 4oz jar for only about $12 and it will last a while too since you will only need about a nickle size dab of this stuff to comb your hair with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: im not a fan of the smell, its not a bad smell. i would say its a cross between old spice and axe body spray. good thing is its a mellow smell that goes away after about 2hrs. also the product is really stiff you have to rubs it into your palms to smooth it out before you apply it to the hair. i notice after i rub it to my palms i like to add a little water to make it smoothier so it goes into my hair easier or else its a really hard tug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m adding a pic of my hair after 7hrs of having this stuff in my hair and it still looks really fresh :)</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff. Makes my hair look tight and slick.</li>
            <li> The best pomade I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried many.  I prefer the Firm Hold version.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, holds my hair in place for the entire day. I have wavy/curly hair which gets relaxed often. They helps maintain the style I like until another relaxing is needed.The pomade dries quickly and even once it dries, I can still style my hair, giving it more volume and smoothing out all the parts that clump together. I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell, in my opinion it&#x27;s far from subtle. I&#x27;ve had people complain my &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; is too strong. I&#x27;d agree if it wasn&#x27;t a hair product, and having that smell just above my nose can get a little overwhelming throughout the day. I guess it all comes down to smell sensitivity, but for me it&#x27;s just too strong.</li>
            <li> This pomade changed me from a dud to a stud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t go on greasy and last all day, and washes out without any issues</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a water-based pomade as an alternative to using petroleum-based stuff, Suavecito works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Washes out Easily&lt;br /&gt;Holds well&lt;br /&gt;Firms up as it dries- doesn&#x27;t need constant re-styling throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Awesome logo and style&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Feels more like hair gel than pomade&lt;br /&gt;No shine&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to work through hair&lt;br /&gt;A bit more expensive than most pomades</li>
            <li> Perfect! I love it, as soon as I run out guess who&#x27;s getting more!&lt;br /&gt;Me of course xD</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Very good texture and was able to style my hair with no problem, the hold is great and lasts very long. I have tried various products in the past such as Murray&#x27;s pomade, In the Zone sculpting clay/pomade, etc. I have very pretty curly and wavy hair that is a bit difficult to style and manage. I give this product 10/10 Definitely will order again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; P.S. This pomade has a great scent that isn&#x27;t over powering!</li>
            <li> Suavecito pomade is a really nice durable pomade I would buy different ones to try them out but this was the last one I bought recommend to buy</li>
            <li> If you want a nice pompadour or vintage hairstyle with your hair parted back like my husband styles his, this product probably won&#x27;t be enough to hold the style. It smells great but the consistancy is more like a gel than a balm. I bought it for my husband because he heard great things about it, but he ended up just going back to his trusty Murphy&#x27;s wax.</li>
            <li> At salons they charge an arm and a leg for this! This product was greatly priced!</li>
            <li> Suavecito leaves my hair dry and frizzy, would recommend another pomade.</li>
            <li> I have regular and firme hold.  Neither work very well. Hold is for about 30 minutes.  2 stars because they market themselves well.</li>
            <li> I will order again in the future. Price is reasonable and product delivers to its expectations. Thank you! We will come back for sure!</li>
            <li> Has great hold and flexability!!! I switch back and forth between this and Uppercut cuz both are outstanding products...I like that Suavecito forms the shape of my hair very well.. I wear the ole contour look and Suavecito whips it up without 5+ minutes of excessive combing...it washes out easy and smells great...Sorta reminds me of Irish Spring soap or just a good ole fresh shower clean smell...It does dry similiar to gel not grease or wax..I would recommend this to anyone who digs a pomp or contour...</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty awesome!! The 4oz. looks small but lasts for months when used as suggested.</li>
            <li> love the scent, holds just as promised. great product will buy again</li>
            <li> I really dig this pomade. It smells awesome and it holds all day and beyond! Recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I believe all the reviews that made me buy this pomade! 1) the fragrance! It&#x27;s not light by any means! Its more like a sweet men&#x27;s cologne! If you hate having a a deodorant that overpowers your cologne, then this is not for you! The fragrance becomes annoying very quickly, as it is strong, and because it is so close to your nose you literally smell it all day! Can you guys dial it down a notch with the smell? 2) Using it on dried hair is really hard! Combing this into my dried hair means some of my hair will break off! I end up having to  use some water to mold it into a pompadour, which then make my hair a little wavy again! 3) although it is water soluble, you will need to actually shampoo your hair to get it 100% off - and to get the fragrance off. 4) once you apply it to your hair, you need to WASH you hands, unless you want that fragrance to linger in your hands all day.</li>
            <li> First off I have to say I&#x27;m fond of the smell, this worked great for me and was for a reasonable price so no complaints on my end.</li>
            <li> I was on a mission to find a pomade to help keep my thick Asian hair in place for an all-day hold without crunchiness.  This is a great value for the amount of pomade you get.  When I got my shipment from Prime, I immediately opened it and noticed a rather strong scent.  Smells nice but can be a bit overwhelming after a long day.  With regard to the hold, this pomade worked wonderfully.  The first week, I was in Southern California during a heat wave (90+ degree weather for 5 straight days).  By day&#x27;s end, a simple swipe of the comb with a little water helped maintain the look.  A little shine but nothing like a grease head (as would be indicated on the packaging). The second week, I was In Hawaii and this go around, it was the most humid that I recall in the past 4 years.  And full day of lounging in the sun, and the pomade still held my hair, which was the &#x27;longest&#x27; it had been in some time (but still short by most standards) in place... Even the scent.  I don&#x27;t wear any other fragrant product or cologne, so I could distinctly remember the faint smell by day&#x27;s end.  The product seemed to best work after a towel dried hair (with just the slightest of dampness).  Takes advantage of some of that moisture, apply pomade through hair and comb through to style. I would really only dock this product a half star because of the scent (personal preference), otherwise would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I wish I could comment on the hold and shine of this product but to be honest, once it was in my hair, I washed it out.  The scent is just too overpowering for me.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I expected I really wish I would have spent more money and got my money&#x27;s worth 4 Oz will last me a week.</li>
            <li> Good Pomade. Hair looks smooth and slick, but its not the strongest stuff out there. But I am happy that it doesn&#x27;t flake!</li>
            <li> I have recently grown my hair out after over a decade of shaving.  With thick hair, it has been much more convenient to keep it short and not have to deal with the day-to-day maintenance.  Plus, the hair products I used would always leave my hair feeling dry and flaky.  Well, now my hair has grown to the point of needing product so I did some reviews and came across this gem.  Its extremely easy to use and offers a great hold with no crusty flaky hair.  It only takes a small amount and lasts all day.  The best part, after work I can come home and spray a little water in and re-style before heading out for the night looking as fresh as I did to start the day.  Great product, will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a ginger haired friend! His hair is awesome now even though it is still red! It is very suave!</li>
            <li> great man-ientence product :P</li>
            <li> Gel works so much better. Not for me. Only lasted about two hours before it started to make my hair frizz up and look disgusting and gummy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell!! However, this did not work as well as I had hoped. To be clear, it does a good job, I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars and continue to buy it. But my boys have very thick hair, and this isn&#x27;t quite strong enough.  I would definitely recommend Bead Head for men Pure texture molding paste if you want a strong hold without the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I still more or less agree with the above, it isn&#x27;t as strong of a hold, BUT this has become our only hair product these days! Our hair styles are a little less demanding of the hold, and my kids ONLY want suavecito because they love the smell and their friends and teachers have told them they love it! Haha</li>
            <li> This stuff not only holds well, it smells HEAVENLY. I will never use another type of pomade again!</li>
            <li> I have recently been trying to look more adult with my hair, and I saw this product in my local barbershop.  It was considerably cheaper on Amazon, so I figured I would pick some up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works more like a gel then a pomade.  It does not have the oily residue after washing, but it is extremely workable before it dries.  I have never had it flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and I think I have made a permanent switch to it.</li>
            <li> Depending on your hair but for me since is semi thin....not to thick or not too thin I have to wait for my hair to be semi-dry in order to get the most of this hair product...it is water-based and is soo easy to wash off in the shower....instantly comes off...the smell of this product is sooo good. I love it.</li>
            <li> Good for styling your hair anyway you want and still having it not feel like a plastic helmet.</li>
            <li> I have been using Suavecito for a few weeks now and here&#x27;s what I have observed: As the directions indicate, it does offer a stronger hold if you put it in when your hair is fairly dry. It gets a little crunchy, while other (water salable) pomades I have tried stay wet. But other pomades I have tried don&#x27;t actually hold my hair in place for more than a couple hours. Suavecito will actually keep my thick hair in it&#x27;s place from morning to late evening, even in Missouri humidity. It has a subtle and pleasant smell, not overpowering or harsh at all. It&#x27;s nicely forgettable, and I mean that as a compliment. And can I say that I appreciate that this pomade has a reasonable price? So thank you, Suavecito, for realizing that pomade shouldn&#x27;t cost $20 for 2 oz of goop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s the best stuff I have used so far and I don&#x27;t plan on shopping around for any other pomades. When I run out, I will be ordering some more.</li>
            <li> Similar hold/shine to Layrite, (which I also purchased) but with a stronger cologne scent. My wife digs it, as do I. I&#x27;ll keep this one at home, and the Layrite in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using Imperial Matte Pomade Paste for about a year. I was looking for a stronger hold, and this pomade works nicely for that and it has a good shine without being over the top wannabe-greaser. So that&#x27;s great. However, the cologne scent is too much for me. I can smell my hair all day long, and it makes me feel a little like a middle school locker room.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re down with strong smelling pomade, it&#x27;s a great deal. If not, then opt for something scentless. You&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li> This stuff is sticky like glue and smells like success. It&#x27;s a little hard to get used to off the bat if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with pomades. Just keep styling and you&#x27;ll find how to make it work. I&#x27;d say about 70% of the time it works every time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very esay handling to make style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And good holding power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product in a passing reference in LA Weekly &amp;#34;Ask a Mexican&amp;#34; column.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  A little dab  worked in holds hair in place all day.  The next day, just wet your hair and it&#x27;s still good.  I had been using gel.  This works much better.  Hair stays soft and shiny.  Bueno.  I</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have tried a bunch of similar producted and found this to provide the best hold with the greasy look.</li>
            <li> best smelling hair product for men!!  Hold is good, and consistancy of pomade is great!!</li>
            <li> Good smell, great hold, and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> really works with my wavy hair</li>
            <li> This is great for beards.  I love this stuff.  I use it with beard oil daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is water soluble.  That way I don&#x27;t get gunky build up in my beard and it is easy to get off of my hands.  A small dollop does it for me.</li>
            <li> My friends use it, I just don&#x27;t like the way is holds my hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely  terrible product. WAAAAYY too over rated. IT&#x27;S NOT A REAL POMADE, all it is is gel. You are paying more money for a bad product. Totally dries out your hair. Your hair Will feel totally dead. If you want am orthodox water based pomade, get some Cool Grease.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great, washes out easy.</li>
            <li> AMAZING ! Works Great Smells Great! Totally Worth the Money!</li>
            <li> I tried Layrite, Suavecito, and Shiner gold pomade.  Suavecito is okay, it does not hold as well as Layrite.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I alternate between this and AXE pomade, but I like this better for the scent. Better than gel for a side part (incorrectly referred to as a comb over. Comb overs are for bald people)</li>
            <li> Works well but you need a lot.  Most dressing just require a dab, this product required considerably more.  I still like it but a bit expensive to use everyday.</li>
            <li> It is what it says it is and it&#x27;s cheaper than most other things that are what this is.  Word.</li>
            <li> Maybe its just me. My hair is stiff. this is product doesn&#x27;t hold my hair quite well. I also prefer hard finish.</li>
            <li> a few friends told me about this product and they werent wrong. Suavecito lets you comb your hair with your hands, its not too strong to a point where you need to comb your hair right away. It lets you comb your hair with easy but still holds nicely. It doesnt flake like gel. Im in school for a good 10 hrs and when I get home I still have my hair combed; even after sleeping. You can basically do another hair do middle of the day and this will still let you maneuver your hair, but it wont have the equal hold, for obvious reasons. I was using the &#x27;Garnier Fructis Survivor Rough It Putty&#x27; and I loved that product but this, suavecito, I consider to be better.</li>
            <li> loved the results I got with this product!!</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there!</li>
            <li> Love this...bought it for my son ...only stuff that keeps the style pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> The hold is great!&lt;br /&gt;The sent on the other hand is too strong and perfumed.  Makes my head hurt after breathing it for too long.&lt;br /&gt;LOL but my hair looks great!</li>
            <li> Suavecito is just amazing.</li>
            <li> This pomade offers an excellent hold, and a little goes a long way.Got caught in a wind tunnel? No problem, just wet your comb and run it through your hair, and &amp;#34;Suavecito&amp;#34; your do is like new again. The only issue I have with this pomade is the scent; it is strong and never seems to fade, even after two days! If you like a strong, squeaky clean smell with perfect hair-this is your product.</li>
            <li> really great stuff - i tend to switch up my pomades often but this one is a regular in my routine</li>
            <li> Not sure how this gets such high reviews.  I&#x27;ve tried 10+ pomades and this is easily one of the worst.  The scent is strong and it does not hold well at all.  My hair kept falling down over and over.  If you try to put more in to hold better, it makes your hair look disgusting.  I definitely do not recommend this product.  I would recommend Imperial, Baxter of California, or Kevin Murphy over this brand.</li>
            <li> nice product still use too this day baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This Pomade is the perfect blend. It holds your hair in place without the nasty feeling you get from gel, spray, or other products. It also does not have a smell to it. Very clean and easy. It is exactly what I was looking for and I will definitely order more when I get low.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I usually use American Crew Forming Cream and was looking for something similar, and came across this product. I&#x27;ve tried other pomades and was a bit unsure about this one, but I was not disappointed. This product is a thin gel not a heavy wax like normal pomades. The product or gel is fairly thin, works into to hair really well. It gives all day hold with minimal shine. The only drawback for me is the over bearing spicy/musky smell. It will grow on you I guess.  This is definitely a good product for the price, it is worth checking out.</li>
            <li> I was much more &amp;#34;suave&amp;#34; after using this</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My barber sells it and I thought I was getting ripped off for the price. But I ran out of Suavecito and picked up some cheap stuff from the grocery store that looks and feels like bacon grease and I still needed to use hairspray with that stuff to get my hair to do what I wanted. Then it felt like I couldn&#x27;t wash the residue off my hands. So I came running to Amazon to get some more Suavecito. Suavecito smells good, doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel and washes off your hands and out of your hair really easy with just water. With my style I can still run my fingers through my hair later in the day and it the pomade will still hold.</li>
            <li> great smell!  hold is real good.  One of my favorites.  Works good on fine hair too.  Not too greasy (water based).  Easy to use</li>
            <li> It smells great, keeps my hair looking good all day, isn&#x27;t all sticky.  I have tried many different products, this stuff is a step above all the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have been a Gel guy forever. This is my firs pomade and I really like it. Gives my hair a much softer look/feel. It is scented, but it smells good. Washes out easy with water. I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Works well as a water based pomade.</li>
            <li> This is actually performs like a gel- hard, stiff and sticky. I was hoping for something closer to Brylcreem. Smells nice, though and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> A great product that I have come to rely on! It holds all day and can easily be combed again if I mess it up. I was first exposed to the product in my local barber shop. They use it exclusively and now I do too!</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves hair looking good!</li>
            <li> holds great, smells better and washes out very easily!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone and buy it again myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few pomades (american crew, layrite, murphys just to name the big ones) and this blows everything out of the water. Has a fantastic scent and texture. You can apply to wet hair for more of a hardened look or dry hair for a more natural feel. Plus it lasts all day, you can even restyle it with a little bit of water (too much and it will wash out). Also love the fact that it washes out super easy unlike those greasy pomades.</li>
            <li> Works Great! very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Ive always loved this pomade. Holds great and has a nice smell. only pomade ill use and ive used it with short hair and with long hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for close to if not a year and finally got around to purchasing a whole crap load after moving and being 20 miles from the nearest great barbershop. I went from Lay Rite back to Suavecito. Amazing stuff and that grooming spray is great after a long night of whatever and you need to freshen your look up. FIVE STARS!</li>
            <li> Not bad but it holds your hair more like a gel then Pomade</li>
            <li> Loved it! Great present for my boyfriend! Smells great and keeps his hair in place! He is now constiently purchasing them!</li>
            <li> washes out easily, styles easily and looks and smells great. first time buyer and overall im impressed with the hold the product leaves. Pretty much an all day hold.</li>
            <li> Its Great product and price is right. Since I started using it don&#x27;t think I would go back to gel.</li>
            <li> been using it for long time!!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the right type of Pomade to put in my hair. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brands and noticed the others left my hair flaky after 2-3 hrs. Started using this and smelled good and holds on pretty good.</li>
            <li> doesnt make hair look too greasy and even with medium to long hair you dont need much.. provides good hold. Ive purchased this multiple times and am satisfied every time,</li>
            <li> Suavecito Pomade is amazing! If you&#x27;re looking for something to hold your hair together all day then this is the stuff! I use the original formula and it&#x27;s great! Gives your hair a good shine and it smells really good!</li>
            <li> seriously awesome pomade. don&#x27;t even think twice!</li>
            <li> Works as a good pomade can&#x27;t really stand the smell but that&#x27;s my personal preference. Put it in dry and my hair will be fine all day and if I need to readjust just add some water and recomb.</li>
            <li> Pretty dope, I use this with my awesome undercut</li>
            <li> It does have a strong hold, very good for the slicked back look and spiky hair as well.  I would recommend people to use it.</li>
            <li> Water soluble; you only need a dime sized dollop for a full head of hair; can be reactivated/restyled if wetted during the course of the day; I love it; doesn&#x27;t flake and doesn&#x27;t make your hands greasy like Murray&#x27;s; highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Suavecito has produced an excellent product here as this is the best pomade I have used thus far. I have used various pomades, those water soluble and petroleum based. I have very thick and semi-wavy hair which is quite unruly at times. This pomade does a fantastic job of holding my hair in place with no issues as well as preforms some sort of straightening effect which is great. This pomade is water soluble which means it will wash out with ease and will not require any sort of degreasing agents to remove from your hair. Often times when you go with a water soluble pomade you sacrifice hold; however, this is not the case with this incredible pomade! The feeling in your hair is not greasy by any means and depending on if you apply it to dry it wet hair it will harden very slightly(with wet hair). The smell is great, it&#x27;s a very masculine scent and is just fresh. I only ever smell it when applying, I wouldn&#x27;t expect the smell to stick around all day. Overall, if you want a pomade that has a great hold but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy and is water soluble(easy to wash out) this is the absolute best product for that job!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like cheap cologne -1 star&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my thick hair feeling greasy -1 star&lt;br /&gt;Packaging looks cheap -1 star&lt;br /&gt;Color of pomade is a dark brown, which looks gross -1 star&lt;br /&gt;It does provide a medium to strong hold for a few hours, which isn&#x27;t good so I guess that gives this 1 star</li>
            <li> Pretty happy with this stuff. I have a big beard and if I use a good amount it keeps it in place. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Holds well for an entire day.</li>
            <li> Easily the best hair product I have used in 31 years. Smells great and makes me look better...whenever the wife gives me a complement I tell her &amp;#34;Suavecito baby&amp;#34;.  I can slick the hair back like most would do with pomade but the great thing with this stuff is that I can actually spike my hair or do just about anything else and it holds.  Heck i even put this stuff in my three year olds hair and he looks awesome. suavecito is water soluble so it&#x27;s really easy to wash out.  Do yourself a favor and buy this.</li>
            <li> My go to pomade and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as it said it would love it.</li>
            <li> yeh its dope and cheap....good stuff</li>
            <li> Smells great and loves how it washes out very easily, so i know if i over do it a bit a few dabs of water helps smooth it out, great product, just wish there was a bit more shine to it</li>
            <li> I have tried many pomades both old and new. Suavecito is now the one I use, and will be continuing to use. It holds great, shines like a traditional pomade, and I love the smell. The smell is like a woodsy musk, which is great if you like smelling like a man, as you should. Plus it&#x27;s water soluble, so it washes out with no effort.  If you have been searching for the right pomade or you&#x27;re new to the world of pomades give Suavecito a try.</li>
            <li> This pomade is awesome, it holds the hair great and has a great smell. Best of all it ain&#x27;t greasy, it is easy to clean off. Hair looks shiny and great.</li>
            <li> In combination with a good brush technique and some real good hair spray it controls frizz (this is not what I intended to use it for). It smell like colon, cheap colon. It&#x27;s ended up being a non waste of money since my husband uses it on his long golden locks of Thor</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the kind of guy who uses hair gel or hair spray to keep that hair in its place, consider switching to a pomade instead. Why? For starters, unlike the aforementioned products, a pomade will not only hold all day, but can be rejuvenated at will with just a small amount of water if you need to touch up. Basically, your hair stays in place, but is still pliable. Pomade is a traditional men&#x27;s grooming product that has in recent years made a comeback. When you use it, you may be reminded of a time when men went to the barber shop for a shave and haircut (two bits), or when men donned their hats when heading out of the house. And if you&#x27;re not a traditionalist, no big deal. It also works for the modern man!&lt;br /&gt;This particular pomade has a woodsy cologne scent to it, which adds to its value. It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I imagine a 4 oz container can last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: If you love shaving with a badger / boar hair brush and a straight edge or double-edge razor, you owe it to yourself to check this out!</li>
            <li> This is the second water based pomade that I&#x27;ve tried and I love it. It holds throughout the day without any issues and is super easy to style.</li>
            <li> Suavecito is my favorite hair product/pomade, the best for my use and my hair. Weather I use it wet or dry it does the job I want done perfectly every time. Keeps my hair in the style I comb it and want it every time with ease, no overwhelming scent (no real scent I can detect), when I re-comb using a wet comb it allows me to re-comb easily and stays in place like my first application. Like the product ad says it goes on and feels like a wax and washes out like a gel. Priced for the working man I can always afford to buy it and buy more; which I do. The regular is plenty firm for me but I also buy the Firme Hold too.&lt;br /&gt;Give Suavecito a try! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> the first pomade that works for my hair type.  keeps my hair in place and makes it look more natural than any other big name brand pomade.  has a nice sent to it that isnt overly strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few months after a barber recommended it to me. I was a little worried when I bought being it was a gel. I&#x27;ve not had much luck with many gels or waxes. After using it for a few months, this stuff is very versatile for my thick and wavy hair. I like the way it goes in just slightly sticky and tames some curls. It drys quickly and that sticky feel goes away. I like the way it wears/holds during the day. You can run your hands through it or wear a hat with out too much trouble. It does messy, its does spikey, it does slicked back, fingers or comb. You can use just a little or alot. It great stuff.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m allergic to it. I keep getting like little blisters on my head or something. I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin though so I just buzzed my dome and moved on with my life. While I used it for a couple weeks it worked great without it my hair just poofs up. No ones getting laid with a jew-fro, so I had to go back to short hair. Maybe I&#x27;ll try it again once my hair grows back out.</li>
            <li> Holds well, great consistency.  The smell is probably the best part though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve had 4 people compliment on my cologne after I started using this on a daily basis.  It&#x27;s funny when you tell them it&#x27;s your hair product and not cologne.  It smells pretty strongly, but not in a bad way.  Has a manly smell.  I&#x27;m manly so it fits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had to travel and I hate altering my daily morning routine because the TSE won&#x27;t let me take anything larger than a mouthful of liquid on a plane.  I decide I would put this into a little travel bottle I bought, but its so thick I didn&#x27;t think I would ever get it out.  I then added about a capful of water and let it sit a day and while the consistency changed I can&#x27;t say the overall results did.  Hair still looked great and the smell was still there!</li>
            <li> It looks great smells great and works great if you use it the right way should last awhile but love it thanks a lot ........</li>
            <li> great hold, washes out easily</li>
            <li> Good product and love the smell! I prefer the &amp;#34;Firme Hold&amp;#34; version since I dont need to used as much as the Original hold</li>
            <li> Great stuff, keeps your hair perfect for ever.</li>
            <li> My son really likes this hair product!</li>
            <li> One of the best pomades I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Good product for thin hair,not mine. I have wavy thick hair and it takes more than the recommended amount for a good hold. The smell is to strong for me and it lasts all day. If you don&#x27;t wash it out all day your definitely going to leave a mark on the couch,pillow and everywhere else you lay your head. It also made my forehead very greasy. Too expensive for a product that lasted me 2 weeks..Hey if it works for you great but didn&#x27;t do anything for me.Thanks</li>
            <li> it is a very good product that has a fine hold and a great scent</li>
            <li> My husband was introduced to this a few months ago while in Vegas for a guy&#x27;s trip and he loves it.  If it didn&#x27;t smell so manly, I&#x27;d try it too.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff at my barber&#x27;s recommendation. I have thick, wavy hair that I have always had a hard time taming. Other products that I have used either leave my hair feeling like a hard, crispy helmet or they last for 3-4 hours before yielding to the strength of my manly locks (not to mention that these products are still a pain to wash out of my hair at the end of the day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Suavecito. This stuff is strong enough to tame my thick hair without feeling greasy or crunchy. It lasts all day and washes out like magic with just water. I like to apply it when my hair is completely dry for best results. The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming. Suavecito, where have you been all my life?</li>
            <li> White, skinny guy, brown hair, about 4 inches on top, faded on the sides. You get the drift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not into the wet, pompadour, side part type look, although that&#x27;s the style my hair is cut in (without the hard part). I like to dry my hair and run some pomade in it and run it back and let it look natural and slightly messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through about 10 different pomades and this is the one I&#x27;m stuck on now. It&#x27;s the perfect one. I put it in with dry hair, and it thickens up and I can brush it however I want and it looks fantastic. I don&#x27;t get the strong odor part that a lot of reviews are referencing. Smells fine to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash out too. I never even notice it. Run your fingers through your hair once it&#x27;s dried and it&#x27;s almost as if you never put anything.</li>
            <li> This is some absolutely awesome stuff! I used to use the Monkey Brains Grease Monkey pomade, then they stopped making that, so this was the next thing I tried. I should have gone straight to this. The hold is about the same stiffness as lay-rite, maybe a touch thicker. Once it sets, it isn&#x27;t easy to re-style, unless you&#x27;re out in the humidity, or mix in something light. it has a musky odor, like my favorite cologne ( don&#x27;t ask what it is, my wife buys it, it&#x27;s in a brown-topped sprayer and I have no clue what it&#x27;s actually called). I highly recommend this product for pomping, may want to mix it with some murray&#x27;s super-light to keep it re-workable.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of different pomades on the market, I want to smell good and look good because in my line of work (male exotic dancer) you want the fellas to know that you and your moves are slick. Most pomades leave my customers greasy and sticky. Suavecito leaves my customers hands clean and smelling nice, which I like because when they smack my butt after a good lap dance, I don&#x27;t want it to be all greasy for the next guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Suavecito!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used A LOT of different types of pomade and hair products- Brylcreem, Groom &amp; Clean, American Crew Pomade, American Crew Grooming Cream, Hawleywood&#x27;s Lay Rite to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is better than all of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds like a wax and feels like wax until water hits your head, then it&#x27;s gone in less than 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great smell too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be doing a recurring order.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend And he loves it. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of weeks and was replacing generic pomade that I was buying at the drug store.  I apply it to my longish straight hair when it&#x27;s damp in the morning.  Around mid-day I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair looks grease and somewhat flat.  I only use a very small amount but still blah results.  My gf also comments that it makes my hair, &amp;#34;feel weird&amp;#34; and not small good.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> the old formula was better. It leaves my hair looking &amp;#34;DRY&amp;#34; before it had the wet look all day long.</li>
            <li> Came fast and works great. smells like cologne too which isnt a bad thing. great for slick clean look or messy as well</li>
            <li> Very good hold for the amount of product you use. Also smells very nice.</li>
            <li> I really tried to like this product I really did, now I come from using American Crew Fiber and wanted a more gel/wax substance because of Fiber having a tendency to clump up. Really great hold with a slight shine, but the smell oh the smell its just way too strong and isn&#x27;t pleasant. I gotta say it makes you smell like a freshman that overdid the axe spray after gym class. Maybe I got a bad tub or something but the smell is horrible, even gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> Great product, it had a wonderful smell and held up family well. I will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Good hold, works into hair easily, washes out cleanly. Doesn&#x27;t seem to damage hair. Been using for about 3 months now and would recommend, although this is my first pomade so I&#x27;m just comparing to wax.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this pomade. Used American Crew Pomade before but didn&#x27;t give me any hold. This gives me hold and a good shine to go with it. I like it</li>
            <li> Smell is awful and OVERWHELMING.  It will leave your hands and head smelling like musk or some sort of old spice the entire day.  I guess if thats what youre going for, then this is for you.  It holds and works as descrbied but I would not open the jar a second time.</li>
            <li> Mine was half empty..can someone explain ..?!</li>
            <li> Very nice product and a nice smell as well. This pomade is great for a re-stylable pomade ,yet will harden like a wax. Washes out with little effort and nothing more then just water</li>
            <li> Firm hold but light texture (if that makes sense), and clearly high-quality stuff. Good smell, washes out easily, can be &amp;#34;re-activated&amp;#34; with some water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair, and have kept my eyes peeled for products that won&#x27;t add volume to my head. This is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll echo what others have said: the smell coming from this product is overwhelming.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not a pleasant smell, IMO.  I&#x27;m going to leave the lid off the container for a few days and see if that helps.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because for the price it is really good. Comparable to uppercut deluxe and layrite. I like the smell of this pomade because it is more of a manly/formal/serious smell. The hold is pretty good as I have thin hairs. If you have thick hairs I probably buy the firme hold. Mine stayed all day with minimal sweating. If you sweat a lot (like gym/running sweat), the pomade may come off. But for everyday no running, heavy lifting work this pomade is really good. Would buy the bigger one in the future.</li>
            <li> Holy snap, you can feel the greatness of this product as you dip the tip of yoru gracious fingers and then give shape to some of the slickest, sexiest and most good-looking hair you&#x27;ll ever want.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 will buy again.</li>
            <li> Best hair product.  I will never use anything else</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his hair because of the strong hold. It leaves a shine. It smells nice. You also cant beat the price; his barber charges twice as much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hands-down awesome! It&#x27;s not a gel, it&#x27;s not even really even pomade - it&#x27;s not oil based as it washes right out with warm water and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue at all. Even when it rains, it&#x27;ll just soften up a little, but you won&#x27;t entirely lose your hold if you slick your hair up or back. Also, it holds up well riding with the top back and even on my motorcycle. How? That&#x27;s my question too. Really a great product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best pomades I&#x27;ve used. Not too heavy, not too thick and smells great. Let&#x27;s you manipulate your hair and doesnt leave residue. Also, it has a good price point comparing with those expensive ones out there</li>
            <li> excellent looks good smells good holds great! decent price shipper shipped fast</li>
            <li> It smells good but doesn&#x27;t hold the beat I use Murray&#x27;s now and thinking about trying layrite but I have the thicks hair every</li>
            <li> The hold of suavecito is good at best, i have thick straight hair so i need something a little heavie but with enough of this product it eventully worked! has a good, light smell to it.</li>
            <li> This was a recommendation from my son&#x27;s hair stylist, my son is 16 with thick, wavy hair. The Suavecito looks very dense but goes on light and looks very natural. No sticky hair or waves that look frozen! Great stuff, almost imperceptible scent, lasts all day and washes out well. We will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Its a great step up from using gel or wax on your hair, it doesn&#x27;t clump or leave glops of product in your hair at all. The hair can be easily restyled after you use it and has a fantastic smell. The hold could be better, but I cant really complain since I have extremely dark thick hair and it would probably take a truck full of cement to hold it, but this works fine. Nice clean look and shine, I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I have thick, straight, hair that I like to push back for work, because I work in a professional environment and deal with clients. This product works great to hold my hair down and back all day, and then washed out easily at night. Also, the fragrance is nowhere near as strong as other pomades I&#x27;ve used (Layrite, for example). It&#x27;s just a mild soapy smell that I actually kinda dig (and so does my girlfriend). Highly recommend this pomade.</li>
            <li> This is an Awesome Pomade.  It has great hold and smells nice.  This pomade was easy to wash off. Product delivered on it&#x27;s promise.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using a pomade and man I love this stuff! The best quality for me is that it is water soluble, I love being able to wash it out when i not longer need it. The smell is great, and it has enough hold to last, but if you need to refresh it just add a little water to your hair and you are good to go. It has semi wet look which I love. Given the price point and the quality I&#x27;ll be buying this brand of pomade for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works best in my opinion on dry hair. Wanting to try the Firme Hold next</li>
            <li> So I just started getting into pomade a few weeks ago and this is by far my favorite. I originally started with American Crew but due to is medium hold, my curly hair started to go to its natural shape and I couldn&#x27;t find a stronger hold from this brand. Enter this one that I originally borrowed from my brother. My hair is fine and curly so this holds it nicely and doesn&#x27;t add too much weight and I get good volume and the smell is great. I only need about half to a three quarters of a fingertip to get a good hold. It&#x27;s also easy to brush later in the day and maintains the shape and hold you would want. Shine isn&#x27;t really my thing but this gets some shine to a matte with my hair. I also took off a star because it does tend to garden and clump sometimes. Other than that, I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing product. Give it a try and see how it works for your type of hair. It definitely makes your hair stay in place.</li>
            <li> I got this for my brother bc he doesn&#x27;t like how hard the gel gets and he likes it! It smells good and easy to wash.</li>
            <li> This is the best Pomade on the market. Its not greasy like most other pomade products and it really has a nice hold. Looks way more natural. It&#x27;s perfect A+++++++++</li>
            <li> Very good product and easy to work with. Like that it is so easy to wash out and it also doesn&#x27;t make hair crusty like many hair gels do.</li>
            <li> Makes your hear bee very manageable, if you got curly of waive hair depends on the amount you put on it makes it go straight hear, I got waive hair and it&#x27;s fun to see it straight some times</li>
            <li> Perfect product for HOLD (use brylcreem in conjunction to this product for sheen).</li>
            <li> Nice smell and hold but a little too waxy/hard for my taste.</li>
            <li> Our 23 year old son loves this product. It is not easy to find here in Toronto so I was thrilled to be able to buy it online. It is not cheap but one jar lasts a long time for medium length hair.No problems with the order. It arrived early and in time for Christmas. I would definitely shop from this supplier again.</li>
            <li> Decent product. Does what it says, but i have had better pomade.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair (both volume and the hair strands themselves) and this product just can&#x27;t provide enough hold. It&#x27;s a shame because I really like the consistency, fragrance and price. But, even after applying and combing through my hair, my hair quickly becomes unruly looking. I confess to having very difficult-to-manage hair, so hopefully others will have better luck.</li>
            <li> I thought this would give me a slick, greaser retro look.  It didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s bc this is a gel, not a true pomade.  I have tried many products for a pompadour, but the only ones that really work are American Crew&#x27;s Fiber and Murray&#x27;s Light Pomade.  They can be used together.  I like the lift the Fiber gives,and the shiny look Murray&#x27;s provides.</li>
            <li> Good product and came on time!</li>
            <li> Updated. The seller has also been spamming me emails to review the product. Smells too much like Worcestershire sauce for me personally but the hold is ok. I&#x27;ve got super wavy hair that defies any product, now for someone with normal hair it&#x27;d work like a charm. PS you&#x27;re going to smell like a shepards pie if you use this not a sexy scent at all. But delicious, So I guess if your into &amp;#34;bears&amp;#34; this would be your thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line this stuff is garbage don&#x27;t pull it on it&#x27;s smells awful and the Unique Salon Customer Service Team will harass you.</li>
            <li> Great pomade! Works on all of my boys&#x27; hair with all different styles!</li>
            <li> Although I prefer the firm hold better, this product rocks.  Keeps my hair in place all day.  Not heavy.  Doesn&#x27;t get hard or flake.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, nice product.  It works</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get past the weird smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Works as well if not better than the larger name brand hair products and washes out very easily.  Won&#x27;t make your hair crust out or oily and the container lasts months if you use the recommended amount.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, holds all day. Will run down your face is you sweat too much though.</li>
            <li> A bit too gummy for me</li>
            <li> Very good and washes out easy</li>
            <li> ordered this for my pops and he loves it</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. However he does apply a very small amount of get for those annoying flyaway hairs that stick out right on the hairline. Regardless this is a great buy no need to spent $50+ for another pomade that works the same.</li>
            <li> Great gel. Like advertised, easily washed out and easily restyled with water. The only thing you might not like is the smell. It has that old barbershop smell. Like those greasers from the 70s. John Travolta in Grease, Patrick Swayze and the Fonz come to mind.</li>
            <li> A chunk of my pomade was missing when i opened my lid for the first time. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got the suavecita instead of the suavecito now my hair smells like strawberries</li>
            <li> Hardens a bit too much for my taste, but works well for a good price</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! The hold is greater and stronger than a gel or wax, but doesn&#x27;t have that heavy feeling, and leaves a wonderful shine! I usually run a comb through it for a classic or a brush for a James Dean look. Also, the smell is the best ever! A clean, masculine scent with hints of spice and lime that radiates off of you.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and holds good washes out very easy</li>
            <li> I found my new favorite hair product! It applies easily to dry hair, holds like a champ and washes out completely with water! It also smells nice which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to &amp;#34;reactivate&amp;#34; it with water after a night out, but I believe that it&#x27;ll deliver should I need it to.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work out to well with my hair, I have curly thick hair and the smell is horrible in my opinion. When you open it you can smell it and it smells strong but it&#x27;s when it&#x27;s on your hair it smells like sweat. Personally I recommend Layrite over this.</li>
            <li> This pomade gives a great hold and shine without making your hair feel too hard and artificial.</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about Suavecito so i figured i would give it a try. I gotta say they have blown it out of the water with this product here. Its a little different but i do my hair at night so getting ready for work in the morning goes quicker. Even so the product last and holds all night and all the next day. Hair looks natural and has a great smell. I would deffinietly recomend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good I wish they made cologne too. Works great. My son says it&#x27;s the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever bought for him. I got it after he visited a new barber shop that used it &amp; he raved about how much he liked it and how good it smelled.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better pomades I&#x27;ve ever used. It is light while providing plenty of hold, and it washes out easily as well. The smell is wonderful; my wife loves it, but it definitely stays within your hair. It doesn&#x27;t radiate out, which is great because I love wearing cologne (it&#x27;s kind of a hobby of mine). Some of the reviews here led me to believe that this products loans its smell to you in a cologne-like fashion, but that&#x27;s simply untrue. If someone puts her nose in your hair, she will definitely smell the pomade; otherwise, she&#x27;s gonna smell you (or your cologne). The size you get is a great value as well! Buy this stuff, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I like the way that this softens my hair for easy styling. Also it smells pretty good and isn&#x27;t too greasy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT....WORK REALLY GOOD THIS IS THE THIRD CAN I BOUGHT...</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my hair switching away from gel. Great product/price. Has a nice barber-like smell to it as well that my wife loves.</li>
            <li> Good water-soluble pomades are hard to find. Suavecito was recommended to me by a barber, and I&#x27;m glad he did it. It has a great hold. Plus, you can go for a more solid slicked look if you put it in while your hair is wet, or you can do the more natural look by putting it on dry hair. Either way it has great hold and washes out easily. Plus, it&#x27;s made in LA.</li>
            <li> Suavecito is a GREAT product.  The pomade was perfect for hair that you want to stay where you put it.  I&#x27;ve used other products that were good, but suavecito set the bar higher.  You don&#x27;t have to use as much of this pomade to fix your hair compared to others.  The price point is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I love the container and artwork.  In reality that doesn&#x27;t make the product good, but I felt cool having it in my Bathroom</li>
            <li> I have thick, somewhat wavy hair and it has been extremely hard finding a hair product that holds my thick hair in place.  I&#x27;ve used Murrays, Dax, SGB, B&amp;W but hate the greasy residue they all leave.  I bought this pomade due to reviews and couldn&#x27;t be more happy.  Holds fantastically and washes out easily.  This is by far the best hair product I have ever used!!  You can even restyle your hair once it dries and the scent of this pomade is like great smelling cologne.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on the scent.  Thank you Suavecito, your product is amazing and I am a customer for life!!!</li>
            <li> Got a great cut at Uptown Barber Shop in Whittier, ca. By \\&quot;Gabe\\&quot;.  He threw some of this in my hair.  This stuff holds great and can be recombed by wetting your comb. Washes out like gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This pomade is amazing&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice firm hold on my head&lt;br /&gt;Especially since I have curly hair&lt;br /&gt;It makes me hair look straight&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> Too thick for my straight hair and scent is too strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this product despite the reviews that complained about the slight scent, thinking I could handle it. I&#x27;ve tried this for three days so far and the smell is giving me a headache. If you&#x27;re like me and are sensitive to many of the lab created (i.e. antibacterial hand soap) smells then you&#x27;ll want to stay away from this one. If you&#x27;re not bother by these smells then by all means get it, it does hold the your hair nicely without the crunch and is easily restyled with a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pomade would be amazing without the smell.</li>
            <li> This pomade works very well. It is easy to work in and stiffens after the application. It works up to two days in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Ok, scent is awesome, manly! Not for women nor kids. But women like it and know your not like other guys! The hold is medium depending on how much you use, a little goes a long way! For me, I have fine curly/wavy hair ( no crazy fancy hair) and I put it on when my hair is not too wet nor too dry to get the best control and shine! Water based washes out clean and easy. Root beer in color! Only for \\&quot;true original\\&quot; men!</li>
            <li> Sua Vecito has a clean smell, and is not greasy like other pomades. It had great hold with only a small dab needed at a time. It&#x27;s all I use.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is easier to use than the other non-water soluable products</li>
            <li> i have used both suavecito and lay rite. just like lay rite pomades, they too are water based and i just stick with the original stuff rather than that super hold both of them make. anyhow, suavecito, in my opinion is better. suavecito washes out better than lay rite. lay rite still had that semi waxy feel to it and it still felt waxy even after washing. you could tell after drying your hair as well. suavecito is also much more easier to run through your hair because it doesn&#x27;t have that waxy feel.</li>
            <li> Great pomade, smells great and looks great! Holds up well and washes out easily off hands. I&#x27;ve recommended it to several friends already!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It gets the job done. I suggest you rinse your hair before you go to sleep when you have this product on, because if you don&#x27;t your hair is going to be really stiff and possible flakes next morning. This stuff cost cheaper than Steadfast and Layrite.</li>
            <li> Works great like other pomades I&#x27;ve had, but washes out with much more ease.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a pomade or similar to style their hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, a co-worker of mine introduced it to me a while back, great for lazy people like me who doesn&#x27;t have time to comb their hair every morning</li>
            <li> Love Suavecito! I smells amazing!! The original hold pomade, holds my really thick, curly hair pretty well. I am looking to try the firm hold though, just to see how it compares! Overall good product and shipping was on time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9yr olds combover. He loves it and it smells great.</li>
            <li> First off, I did not purchase this stuff from amazon but I&#x27;ve used it on many occasions. The first time I got this I had an extremely long (and pretty darn respectable) southern gentleman dew going on and my cousin who had recently sold his barbershop (which sold layrite products) had started working for another shop and this one sold suavecito. So I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It was okay I guess. It just didn&#x27;t give me very good hold. My hair kept sliding to the side and in my face and that gets annoying after a while. And it didn&#x27;t matter how much I use. It still couldn&#x27;t hold up. Later I find out from my cousin that they pretty much just try to copy everything layrite makes and does it a little cheaper so it doesn&#x27;t have the same quality to it. Barbershops can also get it cheap wholesale and sell it expensive to make some massive profit from it. Anyways, I still have some and I use it when I&#x27;m out of everything else. This didn&#x27;t work well with my hair. But that&#x27;s just me. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different. I&#x27;ve definitely used worse stuff. I just assume use layrite opposed to this stuff.</li>
            <li> Always awesome. Wish it was cheaper and available locally.</li>
            <li> Item was awesome great buy and buy again</li>
            <li> Works great! I use the firme hold because my hair is curly, holds all day.</li>
            <li> Best product ever! It holds all day and let&#x27;s me style any way I want.</li>
            <li> this thing works great it smells great</li>
            <li> Worked just as advertised! Washes out super easy and smells good. Holds everything in place nicely and is easy to work with</li>
            <li> works well, and does exactly what it says it does. Preferable over beeswax since it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel like its glued  and comes off really easy with water. Simple removal. Only downside if you&#x27;re somewhere hot and you get a little sweaty you may lose a bit of hold.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine and smells fantastic. What else do you need? The stuff is really fantastic, get some today!</li>
            <li> No need to get complicated, this pomade does what I need it to do and the shipping is always amazing, always receive it within 2 days of ordering.</li>
            <li> Holds strong. Washes out clean. Goes on easy. Only complaint is it is only 4oz and for the price it is worth it but I wish it had more. Good for thin and thick hair. Can style many different hairstyles</li>
            <li> Bought this for the grandsons. They say it&#x27;s the best. They like the hold and the fresh smell. Will be buying more for them.</li>
            <li> According to my barber, the person responsible for developing Suavecito Pomade was a former employer for Layrite and while I&#x27;m not entirely sure as to the accuracy of his dramatic re-telling, I do know this: it&#x27;s a lot better than Layrite. For the people complaining that it hardens like gel, I&#x27;m not a scientist but maybe use less? it&#x27;s water soluble, so you&#x27;ll never have to wash your hair 3-4x like you were using Murray&#x27;s. Since you&#x27;re obviously interested in pomades, just go ahead and take your man card back with the easy purchase of Suavecito Pomade. Pair it with a Kent The Handmade Comb, to get that greaser look you always wanted to but were too much of a pussy to actually ever do. Man up!</li>
            <li> Great woodsy/manly smell. Good hold - though the firme hold is even better - without getting a hard shell. Not oily. Overall pretty pleased</li>
            <li> I purchased this product reading many reviews. I had ended up purchasing American Crew pomade and this. However, because of all the knock off brands/discoloration about American Crew, I returned it. Upon opening Suavecito, the smell was slightly overwhelming. The consistency of the product was more like wax, but when applied to damp hair, it was very workable. One thing I have to say about the product that bothers me is the strong strong smell. It is very overwhelming for me and actually caused me to have headaches and dizziness.</li>
            <li> I very much love how good this smells. My wife loves it too. It goes on like a gel and holds decently throughout the day. I have thick, almost curly hair so if I want a really good hold, I have to use a lot of it- which is kind of a downer. I just wish I got more for the price. I&#x27;ve used Murray&#x27;s before and dislike the viscosity, makes it harder to apply and rinse out, although I appreciate the hold a lot more.  I use Suavecito when my hair is shorter, but when I let the top grow out to about 4 inches, I have to use something stronger.</li>
            <li> Awesome pomade!! Every man should own some!</li>
            <li> I have thicker, coarse hair so this stuff did nothing for me. It is for &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; only - it has basically no hold at all.</li>
            <li> This Pomade is one of the better ones that I have tried. It smells great and the hold is great. The only caveat is that it is a little hard to get it to apply evenly. Does wash out nicely and can be adjusted by running a wet comb through it to rejuvenate it.</li>
            <li> Great pomade. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, it has a firm hold, and it washes out very easily.</li>
            <li> Product arrived and was as advertised but it isn&#x27;t as good as pyrite or similar products. Smells pretty good, though.</li>
            <li> Works well, but not as much hold as I was hoping for. My hair will fall down all day if I don&#x27;t keep it up constantly. Could be I&#x27;m not using enough, but it&#x27;s a bit hard to work though my hair when it&#x27;s mostly dry (which is what it recommends for best hold). I style up and over the top like this: http://style.gq.com.au//media/images/6/5/8/2/0/658263-1_lp.jpg?155543</li>
            <li> It truly works great! I no longer have greasy hair from using Paul Mitchell hair cream, or any other hair product.&lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is wet and comb, and it&#x27;s just like new. It lasts all day and the smell is subtle enough to where you can smell it, but it&#x27;s not overbearing. Definitely going to continue to buy this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give me the helmet hair look and if I put it in while my hair is wet it gives a very nice pliable effect where your hair keeps its place but will still move around.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing</li>
            <li> Works great and you only need a tiny amount to do the job. Holds all day and you can easily restyle if needed (like on a windy day).</li>
            <li> Gives a great hold and lasts all day, only thing is that it dries out your hair a bit. All in all a great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well and it washes out well and doesn&#x27;t leave residue or any stickyness when I decide to sleep at night w/o showering. The only issue I have with it is the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but there definitely is a frangrancy smell in it and after using it, your head will smell that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people might really like it, I was a little put off by it. I&#x27;ve gotten used to it now but I would prefer it without the smell.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff just as much as Layrite, but it is cheaper. Will be my go-to pomade for the foreseeable future. Good shine, great hold, excellent workability.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff the only problem that I have with it is that as the day goes on I tend to get a greasy face due to the product running down my forehead no bueno o well nothing a napkin can&#x27;t fix good stuff</li>
            <li> Awsome pomade smells good and is better then other name brand products</li>
            <li> Good scent. Washes out very easily. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is it has hardly any hold.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. Great hold, style, and works with wet or dry hair. Inexpensive, and last long time. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty put off by the smell.  It&#x27;s not overly strong if you like a perfumed product, but I&#x27;d rather have a much more subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is alright, but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> Just because you aren&#x27;t hip, doesn&#x27;t mean you hair has to give you away. This stuff is great at holding your hair in place, and does about as good of a job as one can expect at duplicating the look of a nice greasy pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are tired of ruining the collars of your shirts, and all your pillow cases, this is a good way to go.</li>
            <li> It has a good hold but no shine its almost matte It does wash out with just water which is a plus compared to other products</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff! Great all-day hold.....nice smell.... washes out easily.... but.... I want more shine.&lt;br /&gt;It looks shiny initially, but after it dries it dulls a little.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product!  I got it for him and he wants to reorder.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my thick hair and it holds great, and washes out super easy. Yada-yada everything everyone else says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is really important is that this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell horrible at all.  It has a slight cologne smell to it, not strong, but it is there.  Whenever my fiancee is smelling my hair now she always comments on how nice it smells from this stuff!</li>
            <li> The smell is really bad. I tried it one day and I could just smell it on me all the time. And I was really self-conscious about it. My girlfriend got a whiff of it and she hated it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my man. It&#x27;s pretty&lt;br /&gt;Heavy duty stuff. I&#x27;m a hairdresser and have given him many products to try . This stuff works the best so far . Keeps his thick hair straight back and in place</li>
            <li> Great product. First time user and the smell is enchanting. Package was wrap very nicely with free sticker included. Top class seller and will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. Good price.  It&#x27;s water based and not greasy. Excellent hold.</li>
            <li> Great service highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Suavecito! A name like that makes you want to stand up and support it in Congress.  I&#x27;ve heard so many positive reviews about this product on YouTube and here on Amazon too.  I wondered, \\&quot;Wow! This product must be perfect! The perfect pomade! Finally!\\&quot; To my surprise, it was not. The pomade is more of a gel than, well, actual pomade. It is thick, heavy, and complicated to use. I never had so many problems with a single hair product in my life until I came across, \\&quot;SUAVECITO!!!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad...&lt;br /&gt;Where do I begin. I purchased this product on the Suavecito website. It cost me a total of $14 including shipping. Pricey. The bottle was small, 4oz, which is roughly the size of my Voodoo Brew pomade, and that one only cost half the price. For a small $14 container, I&#x27;ve expected a positive outcome from the product. Instead, I&#x27;ve found this product too tacky or thick to apply properly in my hair. I have thick, wavy, stubborn natural-curly hair by the way. I&#x27;ve had a large amount of hair-pulls just putting it in. In fact, I have small bald spots on my hair line now because of this stuff. I was so upset, after only three days of using it, I&#x27;ve trashed this pomade.  What a waste of money, and I lost hair in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the pomade dries, it hardens like a level 12 gel.  You can brush through this and the pomade softens but, you&#x27;ve guessed it, more hair-pulls in the process.  The shine is decent, just barely a shade better than Murray&#x27;s pomade. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve trashed this product after only three days use.  This is the first time I ever had to give up on a product before a week&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other bad things about this pomade or gel is that it doesn&#x27;t hold up well in heat, and if your hair is too damp or watered-down then this stuff comes right off.  Yes, it&#x27;s water soluble but it&#x27;s very tacky to style into place. I&#x27;ve literally spent 45 minutes just trying to pull off a decent pompadour with three different combs. I never had to use morethan one comb to style my hair into place; this is another first.  I&#x27;ve spend three days testing/experimenting with the level of water I had to use to make the pomade movable and, at the same time, stay in your hair.  Who has time to do this much experimenting with a hair product? The bottom line, a good hair product should be easy to go into your hair, style, and then come right out the next day with minimal hair loss/pulls.  This pomade only passed one of these test. Congratulations! And only $14 wasted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good...&lt;br /&gt;The bay-rum smell and the fact that it&#x27;s water-soluble. You don&#x27;t need shampoo to wash it out; just add a tad of water and done, it&#x27;s off. The bay-rum smell is...okay. It&#x27;s a manly smell and smells throughout the day, but like I&#x27;ve said, it&#x27;s a sweet rum smell. If you are a recovering alcoholic, this smell could very well cause a relapse. I&#x27;m a causal drinker and this bay-rum smell made me crave rum and alcohol throughout the day. It&#x27;s crazy. The smell triggers craving and that is a bad thing even for a causal drinker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall...&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t appreciate the hair-loss or the fact that this product dried the crap out of my hair when I washed it out.  I didn&#x27;t appreciate the large amount frizz it left my hair after it was washed out. I didn&#x27;t appreciate the high price and small container ratio. I didn&#x27;t appreciate the thickness, styling problems, amount of time wasted, and experimentation I was forced to conduct just to make this product work, for me. And finally, I didn&#x27;t appreciate the sweet bay-rum smell that had me craving alcohol all day. Good riddance, \\&quot;SUAVECITO!!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Arrived late (bought from BioBeauty&amp;Essentials Store).  Pomade holds well.  Has a pleasant, but strong smell.  Now, when I use this product, it smells like I slathered myself in the cologne.  Think of all the men you snickered about who smelled like they bathed in cologne.  That&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll smell like when using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to style my hair but when i went to the barber for a quick touch up, unfortunately they messed up my hair and cut it far too short... Therefore there was no longer a need for this product.  When i tried to return, i found out that the buyer pays return shipping of over 5 dollars.  I bought this for 10 so no use in returning if i only get half money back.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Suavecito Holds great and smells good. I really have nothing else but I&#x27;m required to type more words than I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new (about a month in) to a haircut that requires the use of pomade to style. I was previously using a pomade called \\&quot;Classic Vinyl,\\&quot; which I picked up on a whim at a local store. I purchased that pomade because I figured pomade is pomade, and there couldn&#x27;t be much difference in how they work with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was so dissatisfied with that pomade--and the sloppy, terrible styling that resulted from it--I was on the verge of reverting back to a hairstyle which would not require pomade to style.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I saw a lot of users raving about Suavecito pomade, in the comments of a post on Reddit. I came to Amazon, saw that it was relatively cheaply priced, and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure glad I did!! This pomade has made a HUGE difference in how my hair looks when it&#x27;s styled. Now that I have the pomade to style it properly, I can finally appreciate the fantastic haircut I was given.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My boyfriend bought it at a barber when he was in vacation. We were so happy to find it here to buy extra! Its long lasting and smells great.  My son even asks to use it.</li>
            <li> Poor pomade. Good gel. Good smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair much more pliable than simply wetting it.  It also smells like extremely condensed hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan.</li>
            <li> So awesome. Great hold, perfect shine, nice body, combs I. Easy, washes out clean, and smells fantastic. The best water based pomade I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of others. Five stars all the way Suavecito!!</li>
            <li> Stop looking elsewhere. This is the Pomade for you. $10?? Come on! Simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply to towel dried hair and you&#x27;ll have lasting hold all day.&lt;br /&gt;Re-comb with water later in the day and you&#x27;ll keep your suave. Note: Water based Pomade will get slightly hard after wetting.</li>
            <li> This pomade will help you achieve superior styles. It&#x27;s strong hold can be used to create anything, from gravity defining fauxhawks to the smoothest pompadours.</li>
            <li> Pros - Excellent creamy texture making application easy, firm but not rigid hold.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Makes you smell like a date rapist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and it&#x27;s the best pomade I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s light but holds well, washes out very easily, smells great, and requires only a small amount so lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Seriously, there is not better water based pomade on the market right now. Holds your hair perfectly all day, has great re-comb value through out the day, just the right amount of shine. Not only is it a great pomade, but you would be hard pressed to find a better company to order from, not only are they fast and efficient they always throw in special little goodies and thank yous in their orders. Every time I try another water based pomade I just end up dissapointed because it just does not stack up to the high bar that Suavecito has set.</li>
            <li> By far the best product I have used in a long time!</li>
            <li> I love this pomade!  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of pomades, some petroleum based and some water based.  I love the hold and look of the petroleum based, but getting it out is a PAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying lots of water based pomades, Suavecito is know the one I buy over and over again.  I usually keep both the regular and firme on hand.  It goes in my hair easy and comes out even easier.  For my hair style, I find that adding it to my slightly damp hair and then styling works best for me and gives me the sheen I like.  I get a great all day hold and don&#x27;t even bother carrying a comb with me.  The only down side of going with the water based pomade for me is that if you live in a rainy climate (like I do!) then a good rain can be disasterous for your hair.  I&#x27;ve never had much luck re-style my hair with water based pomades, so if it looks like it is raining I do what I can to protect the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give Suavecito 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not really a huge fan of the scent.  It isn&#x27;t terrible by any means, but I would prefer a &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; scent.  Suavecito has more of an Old Spice scent.  I don&#x27;t find the scent too overpowering though, so it doesn&#x27;t deter me from buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend trying this product if you are on the fence or just looking for a new pomade to try.</li>
            <li> Great pomade!! Hold last all day!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Best I&#x27;ve ever used. Just enough hold without being too firm. I know they make a firmer hold version but I&#x27;m glad I tried this one first. I just wish I had heard of this sooner. No alcohol in this product which dries out hair. I love it and have already recommended it to a friend. Make styling my hair a breeze. I was a little concerned about the cologne scent but it is super light and you can only smell it when you put your nose close to the jar. Once you apply some the scent is pretty much gone. The light smell is good anyway so it&#x27;s not an issue. Nothing much else to say. Try this and save money over the other over priced Pomades out there.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products before, like Bed Hair wax, Axe Clean Cut Look Pomade, other brands of Gel, you name it. None of them made me feel I could get the best out of my hair. I started to think my hair was the problem, but then I found Suavecito Pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suavecito Pomade made a difference the very moment I opened it. It has a fantastic scent to it. As soon as covered my hands on it, I knew it was different than all that I&#x27;ve tried. And it really was. In less than a minute, I had my hair ready to go. Seriously, I hadn&#x27;t feel so confident in months. Later that day, I don&#x27;t know if it was my hair or my confidence, but I got asked out by a girl in my college class. Really, she asked me out. I can thank Suavecito Pomade for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend this pomade? Being so cheap, it would be a crime for you not to try it. It worked wonders for me. I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son&#x27;s stocking at Christmas. Yes, he&#x27;s 22 &amp; still gets a stocking! LOL Anyway he says this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> This pomade is water-based which makes it easy to wash out with shampoo.  It also has a great hold and is very easy to work with.  The scent is also really nice as well. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Suaveceto Firme has terrific hold. No doubt. But it has a very cheap cologne smell that is very pungent. And it stays with you all day; it never diffuses. But the big issue for me is that it is very sticky and &amp;#34;waxy-like&amp;#34;. It lays very heavy on your head all day just as heavy as Murrays Superior. It&#x27;s also just as difficult to comb through your hair as a very heavy petrolatum-based pomade. And it&#x27;s not the easiest pomade to style. After about 4-5 hours of Suaveceto Firme in your hair if you recomb it without using water your hair will feel and look like straw. It will look dried out as all hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re looking for great hold in a water-based pomade Sauveceto Firme is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I personally find Tres Flores water-based moulding pomade to be a better choice all the way around; it has a pleasant fragrance, is easy to style, keeps your hair soft, and is much, much cheaper than Suaveceto  Firme. I also think Tres Flores&#x27; hold is almost as good as Suaveceto Firme&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love it. I think I&#x27;m ready for the next one.</li>
            <li> Awesome and makes my hair smell great</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever! Not stiff or sticky and leaves no yucky residue in hair. Wet your hair a bit and you can restyle easily. Love it!</li>
            <li> Holds my hair in place all day and has an awesome smell! Will order more!</li>
            <li> I love this pomade! Thank you for the fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great product! Excellent hold, and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suavecito has two pomades; the strong/firme hold and this one (original). You can tell the difference in the label. The original has the same look and smell as the strong, and holds quite nicely just not as firmly.  It just feels slightly softer to touch.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and awesome hold all day long.</li>
            <li> Best styling pomade ever!!!!! Goes easy with just water. Smells great and gives you freedom to style. Worth the price. 4.oz go along way.</li>
            <li> Love this pomade. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair super greasy, and washes out easily. Also it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife also uses it to smooth out her curl sets and avoid frizz and she&#x27;s also very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool pomade. I have EXTREMELY thick and hard to manage hair so it&#x27;s difficult to find a pomade that will hold well without a lot of elbow grease. Even wax based pomades have a hard time with my hair. Now with that said, for water-based pomade this is one is pretty good. It smells great. Good for the guy who doesn&#x27;t wear cologne but also prefers to smell nice. The hold is alright. Feels kind of like a fancy gel but doesn&#x27;t get rock hard. Washes out easily. It&#x27;s feels kind of thick but not waxy. If you have easy to medium to style hair this is pomade is for you. As for you guys with crazy thick hair like mine, perhaps the Strong/Firme hold do. I have yet to try that one but will probably get it.</li>
            <li> My sons use this all the time. Nuff said.</li>
            <li> Very good pomade.  The Suavecita works just as good and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Not the highest quality when it comes to actually keeping your hair in place. Normally by the end of the day, (I work in a very relaxed office setting) the gel fades and you have to reapply. Would not purchase again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of pomades on my hair and Suavecito is my second favorite pomade. It would easily be my favorite if the hold was a bit stronger. It seems like more of a medium weight hold, but maybe because of my hair type (thick wavy). I think it smells better than any other pomade I&#x27;ve used, but all pomades seems to lose their scent quickly, making that factor take a back seat to hold. This is a water based pomade to it washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Son uses this product everyday.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it!</li>
            <li> Very good product. I bought this and Imperial Pomade Gel at the same time to try them both, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of pomades without finding something I really like. This is an all day hold but without the shine. Softer. Recommend.</li>
            <li> works well, keeps the hair under control</li>
            <li> Love the product however the container was broken when it arrived</li>
            <li> It took me a while to find the perfect essential for my hair. This works for me great, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This was everything I wanted it to be and more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great but it doesn&#x27;t give me the hold that I am looking for.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I read was about the smell. It does have a strong smell but its not to bad. I can not get it to work with out looking like a wet dog. I am just looking for a dry look. I must be doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Love this as an alternative to Hawleywood&#x27;s layrite. I like that product for shorter hair and this one when my hair grows out a bit. I use both regularly</li>
            <li> Makes my boyfriend and sons hair look and smell great!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this for my 6 year old son. He has thick hair and the only product I&#x27;ve found that works on his hair was Gorilla Snot from Walmart, although that stuff is extremely sticky....We took him to a barber this past weekend and they highly recommend this product.  I thought I would give it a try and both he and I are in love with this. It smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky when I do his hair like the other stuff did. We will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it&#x27;s wavy. the pomade doesn&#x27;t keep my hair in place and the hairs curl back quickly.</li>
            <li> Seems promising ; the hold is a bit weird ; love the smell but my hair is so difficult to deal with. Doesn&#x27;t hold well to my liking ; good product but not for my hair</li>
            <li> I like this pomade more than most more expensive options.  I find it works best to put on wet then comb and once it dries just run your fingers thru for a more matted look while the shape still holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;think im going to stick with this brand.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to this stuff, it is pretty awesome.  Holds much better if your hair is not too wet, as it is WATER-BASED.  But that is awesome, because it washes out very easily and doesn&#x27;t make you feel gross.</li>
            <li> Works for a classic sculpted look. 17 more words required17 more words required17 more words required17 more words required. done.</li>
            <li> I done a lot of research before buying, i have read some good reviews so decided to give it a try. The container is actually what made me cave in. I love it. First opening it i loved the smell, it smelt like a cologne of some sort. Putting it through my hair was also a surprise, after it was in, my hands were pretty much dry and non sticky. Once i got my hair styled like i wanted, i let it dry and loved the smell of it through out the day. I personally dont really like the slick look that it gives, so what i do it let it dry for about 10 mins then i just comb it through with a comb. It just takes the slick hard look, but still keeps the hold and style i was going for. It does last all day and night and i love the fact it comes out super easy in the shower. What sucks is when i have those little hair pop up when im out and about and try to use water to slick it back down, it only just comes up more since it is water based; Overall great product i love it.</li>
            <li> good stuff at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is the best pomade I have ever used hands down. A lot of people are iffy about the smell, but I like it a lot. I used to use murray&#x27;s a long time ago, which is pretty hardcore stuff and my barber recommended I start using water soluble pomades. Tried out American Crew and was pretty happy, but once I came up on some Suavecito, I never turned back. It holds really well and gives my hair the perfect amount of shine I like. If you are looking for something with a firmer hold, look into their Suavecito&#x27;s firm/strong hold as this one is just a regular hold.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> Smells great, washes out easily. This is just like any other water-based pomade in that it dries just like hair gel. One needs to wet their hair a little in order to re-style during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to find a non-greasy pomade that stays pliable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. He really likes it but would love it if it had stronger hold. I was worried about the smell but it smells really good! It fades away a little after a while like I hoped.</li>
            <li> I have tried Rev and Tigi pomade paste. This stuff rocks! Holds my hair perfectly in place. Smells awesome too. Washes right out with just water. Will always buy!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> suavecito is a great pomade and smells great. once it dries it looks dry. i added tres flores for a good shone and a solid wet look.</li>
            <li> Best  pomade I&#x27;ve used!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed! Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tries every pomade known to man most of them hold, but are a bitch to wash out of your hair. Suavecito is easy to wash out and has a very good hold. I&#x27;ve found the pomade I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> it hardens  up to much</li>
            <li> This is a medium hold pomade. The scent smells like some mens perfume. I can&#x27;t say it worked poorly but the scent wasn&#x27;t for me. It wasn&#x27;t a bad smell but I found it a bit nauseous. I used it 4 times and now it&#x27;s sitting under my sink gathering dust. Also, it tends to dry like a gel. Not all water based pomades do this and I would have like Suavecito to not dry like it did. Plenty of people will like this but I&#x27;d recommend Layrite if you want a similar hold or Imperial pomade.</li>
            <li> I have normal/thin hair and this product works really well. I would recommend this to anyone really. Your hair wont get crispy and there wont be any flakes because it&#x27;s water base. Use this product</li>
            <li> Nice shine. Decent hold. I just can&#x27;t get past the smell. It will make you smell like a maaaajor douche (pardon my French). Other than the smell I really like it. But honestly once I run out of this tub I&#x27;ll probably just go back to Layrite.</li>
            <li> A FRIEND RECOMMENDED IT TO MY HUSBAND.&lt;br /&gt;HE HAS USED IT AND LIKES IT VERY MUCH.&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES THE JOB.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;IT CAME QUICK IN THE MAIL.</li>
            <li> Holds and forms almost as well as oil based pomades without the hassle of getting out. Smells amazing, makes me think of a cologne for you hair but not overpowering. I&#x27;ve had many compliments from girls when laying next to them or being close enough. Would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love this pomade. I&#x27;ve used it everyday for 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only side note: If you plan on sweating, this stuff burns your eyes worse than any other hair product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I still love it.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!! Best I ever used.</li>
            <li> Definitely will purchase again, long lasting and works great</li>
            <li> Stuff works great, and smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;Holds most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fixing it later though is a bit tricky a bit of water helps, but does weaken the hold a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, this stuff is worlds easier to deal with than murrays.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for my hair. I have thick hair, it held my hair but I need to add a bit of hairspray. This pomade made my hair somewhat stiff. Good product just not perfect for my hair. I switch to axe pomade, holds a little better but it keeps my hair flowing and not stiff.</li>
            <li> This pomade came in quickly, on its expected delivery date. About 2-3 days. Amazing product, super easy to wash out, super easy to apply. I get best results whenever I apply on just a bit dryer than damp hair, and rub it in my hair and blow dry it on low. Works great, probably one of the best products I have used. Great for my super thick hair!</li>
            <li> The ONLY product that will take my husbands unruly cow licks and not look greasy. Plus it smells great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has curly hair and uses pomade to smooth it down. He said it is the best brand he has ever tried (and it smells good, too!)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. no flakey. it work great on curly hair too.</li>
            <li> Ordered this on kind of a random whim not knowing if I would like it or not, when i got it turns out I love it the smell is pretty good. Good hold and very easy to wash out after, the smell is not to over powering very easy to apply to your hair only thing is I wish there was more in a bottle of it haha.  Ordered 2 more after my first one ran out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture is what the pomade looks like, the one shown has been used a few times.</li>
            <li> Love this pomade....I am on my third tub. It has a strong hold but is not too shiny, which is what I want.</li>
            <li> Second favorite product and smell Next to layrite</li>
            <li> Could see myself using this for the rest of my life, it&#x27;s that good. I got a fade with longer hair up at the top and this works. very little goes a long long way. Don&#x27;t over apply! Washes off in seconds with any shampoo.</li>
            <li> So Ive tried a bunch... American Crew, Axe, Murrays etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impressions: This is a slightly larger container @ 4oz than the Murrays @ 3oz and Axe @ 2.365oz. Packaging is actually appealing so if left out, it doesnt look like some dated hair care product my mom use to use in the 80s or my wife uses. I open it and it has a super nice smell and a caramel coke color. 4oz may not seem like alot but, it actually is lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: WOWOWOW.. It is def like a video review i saw. The smell is very very appealing. I prefer NON musky smells, sort of like old spice redzone deoderant (Swagger) or Axe Anarchy body wash. This is a blend of those types of sporty yet not musky smell. Its not overwhelming at all and just adds to &amp;#34;my scent&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture/Use: AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG. I kid you not... Forget about all the others.. this for me has exactly what i was looking for. It melts in and smears better into my hand, and only a dime size is needed as i have an undercut hair cut with maybe 4-5 inches of hair up top for now. Ill stick my hair, hands BARELY damp, straight up in the air and with that dime amount smeared out just go to town and ensure all hair is coated well than go to styling how i want. (it also works well if u smear some on a comb.. but thats not into my style realy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold: This holds 5x better than the Axe brand and def alot better than the others ive used. It ll reactivate too when your hands get damp (or comb) and u wanna reposition hair or fix your self up on the fly (which i love, between meetings). Ive taken off my shirt and hit my hair - it didnt realy mess up at all, where the other ones will. BUT surprisingly its NOTHING like hair spray or hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extras: This company has sent me two jars that come in with the pomade on a 45 degree angle. why does this matter? i dont wanna dip my fingers into this like a savage getting it under my nails... its on a perfect angle for me to wipe some out and smear in my hands for use. Its just a nice thing to do for customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor: buy this american owned and american made product, save yourself the $$$ from buying others, and go to town. if you have a particular style you are new to like me, you def wanna look up youtube videos and google how to use pomade for xyz hair cut. the advice i got was invaluable... and my wifey LOVESSS the new look after 12 yrs the same look with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS PRODUCT!for use. Its just a nice thing to do for customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor: buy this american owned and american made product, save yourself the $$$ from buying others, and go to town. if you have a particular style you are new to like me, you def wanna look up youtube videos and google how to use pomade for xyz hair cut. the advice i got was invaluable... and my wifey LOVESSS the new look after 12 yrs the same look with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Suavecito was my very 1st pomade i have ever used. it is great!!! one thing that suavecito is known for is the smell. it has a cologne type smell. you will fall in love with it. Suavecito has a strong hold and it will last you the whole day. i recomend it Plus, it is affordable.</li>
            <li> Great hold, easy to work with and very to wash out.  Will definitely be a repeat customer for this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try out Suavecito because a ton of other people on Amazon seem to really like it, there are even reviews that say it is comparable to Layrite pomade (which is what I usually used).  The hold of the pomade is decent, but it is still inferior to Layrite.  I can deal with the mediocre hold, but I really can&#x27;&#x27;t stand the strong smell of this pomade, it reminds me of toilet deodorizer.  The smell is extremely strong all day long and after a while it made me feel nauseous.  Also, Suavecito doesn&#x27;t wash out as clean like Layrite does -- leaves a slightly greasy residue in my hair and the scent of the pomade remains in your hair even after several shampoo washes.  I have used this product for 5 days before I could not stand the smell any more -- Maybe I am just more sensitive to the smell than other users. This pomade is really not THAT much cheaper than Layrite, if you have Amazon Prime.  In my opinion, it was not worth the cheaper price because of the weaker hold, strong odor, and greasy residue.  I will not be buying this product again and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> First time user of pomade...terrific product...my wife loves the smell...I now have to buy some for my son-in-law</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different hair &amp;#34;glues&amp;#34;, and I think I like this one the best so far. It smells good too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Layrite only user, But I&#x27;m sold on this pomade. The color looks like root beer, the smell is like coke &amp; tea tree, The hold on this pomade is almost the same as the Layrite super hold. All i&#x27;d ask for is more shine with this product, It turns matte after an hour, The scent will last till you wash it out which i like. It lasted me close to two months using it everyday so the price is very fair.</li>
            <li> Really no need to go into much further. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but this just stuff smells tackier than a 7th grade locker room. Ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Holds my hair in perfect place! The only thing I must mention is that the product says to either apply to damp or dry hair. My advice is to apply to damp. Depending on your hair type (mine is straight) it tends to dry out your hair if you don&#x27;t keep water in it througout the day. I love this product because of the way it holds it&#x27;s excellent. Just make sure to keep it with water when needed!</li>
            <li> Smells great, styles great. I use this to style a pompadour and it works great.  Some people complain of the smell but I have found that it is strong at first but dissipates fairly quickly after application.  I enjoy the smell anyway!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I do not frequently use hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type at the time of this product&#x27;s usage: thick, coarse Asian hair that is medium length at the top with bald fade at the sides and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going for a natural-looking pompadour that could still have some sort of flow so a pomade is necessary.  There are so many on the market so which ones?  I decided to narrow my search to the least expensive one that still had hundreds of positive reviews.  Suavecito pomade fit the bill so the purchase was made.  Upon receiving it and opening the lid, two things are readily apparent.  First, the product does indeed look like a brown Jello like on reviewer said.  Second, the smell is very overwhelming, and it&#x27;s not a pleasant one either.  It&#x27;s a very...unnatural chemical smell that is hard to describe.  I&#x27;m not a fan of heavy odors and just prefer the product to serve its purpose without making me unintentionally smell.  Is it easy to rub into the hands and hair at least?  Yes.  How is the hold?  It is indeed a medium hold so don&#x27;t expect the style at the beginning of the day to resemble what it is at the end of the day.  That was what I was expecting though from a product that could still allow my hair to flow a bit.  However, Suavecito provided my hair with too much of a wet look which I was not going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Relatively inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Water-soluble&lt;br /&gt;It does indeed provide a medium hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is overwhelming and unpleasant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?&lt;br /&gt;No&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely consider the smell of a product before buying any future hair products.</li>
