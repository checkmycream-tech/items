            <li>Glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Great to use with blow dryer to add volume to fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I always thought that it was all about the products I used to make my hair look good, but this brush has made a huge difference!</li>
            <li>And not the nice ringlet curls that you can just leave either.</li>
            <li>I feel it doesn&#x27;t really warm up well.</li>
            <li>But otherwise it is sturdy and looks nice.</li>
            <li>It goes perfectly with my new Babyliss Pro BABNt5548 Ionic hair dryer!</li>
            <li>a great job smoothing out the hair, and 2 inches is just right for shoulder length or longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;Wife</li>
            <li>Just love love love this brush!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush!  </li>

            <li>VERY LIGHT DOESNT TANGLE</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to hold and makes my hair shine.  </li>
            <li>The brush was great my hair is curly and long and when I styled it with brush and was great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the brush my hairdresser uses.</li>
            <li>Why do I need six more words?</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>this comp is not my favorite, i have others which i like much more</li>
            <li>Love the hide-away pick feature.</li>
            <li>Nice and light.  </li>
            <li>This design is a bit better because the handle doesn&#x27;t seem like it will separate.</li>
            <li>I have better blowout brushes, this brush didnt even do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am assuming she is satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>works great and heats up fast</li>
            <li>This brush is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love how it works--I bought two sizes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>it was ok not what i thought.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have had many and can say you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>got this for my family to try it, and they love it and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Now my favorite hair brush.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>As a result, I have burned myself when the top of the brush touches my neck.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS BRUSH</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re asking why the 3 Star rating???</li>
            <li>Static was my biggest problem, but not anymore. :)</li>
            <li>so I had to replace my favorite styling brush.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush for styling my curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>The diameter of this size brush as measured across the top from tip of the bristles to tip of the bristles is 31/8\\&quot; and across the top but NOT including the bristles is 21/8\\&quot;.      </li>
            <li>Love this&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li>This is a great product that I highly recommend,</li>
            <li>Until getting this brush, I never realized how important a good ceramic round brush is if you want to successfully style your hair with it!!</li>
            <li>But this size was perfect for my long hair which is below my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>more fine</li>
            <li>The brush is light weight and leaves my hair shiny and smooth!  </li>
            <li>For years I had tried so many products on my hair to get it to behave, but now I have realized that it wasn&#x27;t the product that was necessarily important but the tools used to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, my hair comes out softer.  </li>
            <li>The burn has never been so severe as to scar my skin, fortunately, but it does hurt and I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this brush again unless the model changed so that the top was covered with rubber or something else that doesn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li>But either way, the hot top on the brush hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works well at keeping the frizz away from my hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to work with.....</li>
            <li>Easy to use and retains heat</li>
            <li>This brush makes styling my hair so easy.  </li>
            <li>I like it easy to use and hold</li>
            <li>But good value and fast shipping didnt make my hair as smooth as I was hoping like the salon does</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I am anywhere close to good with hair, but I&#x27;m finding myself in love with how I have been able top style and dry my hair using this brush.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good brush, but for me it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to all the glowing reviews</li>
            <li>Good value if you need a new blow drying, styling brush.</li>
            <li>Works fine, well made.  </li>
            <li>I cut the time in half, and it did a great job!!!</li>
            <li>Takes a little practice but for those who are like me, I can get that perfect volume and shine under 7 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The #65 smooth&#x27;s, straightens well AND dries my hair faster.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair looking shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>And it is easy to clean, too.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush.</li>
            <li>i had no idea my hair could look so smooth.</li>
            <li>Light wait</li>
            <li>This brush is one of the best round brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Hair had a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job at smoothing &amp; straightening out my hair with the hair dryer and</li>
            <li>Makes my hair Shiny and smooth , does not pull my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush seeing so many reviews, it&#x27;s really worth having one...</li>
            <li>So far seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>This size is good for straightening medium-long hair and adding a soft curl at the end.</li>
            <li>Brush is right in many ways.  </li>
            <li>It is light, but powerful!  </li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied with how smooth my hair is when I use this brush.</li>
            <li>I had no idea how important the right tools are!</li>
            <li>The top on mine is metal and that metal gets extremely hot when I&#x27;m blow-drying.</li>
            <li>First, I have to say I LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li>and i dont have to do as many passes because the hot air blows all through the brush.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus the silver pin comes out of the handle and can be used to part hair or help clean the brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is a great product for straightening while you blow dry.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and works perfectly with my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is anything too special about this brush.</li>
            <li>This goes right through my medium length, fine hair without a snag.</li>
            <li>Works great just as expected.</li>
            <li>Love fixing my hair now, thanks to this brush.</li>
            <li>and the width was perfect for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The top of the brush is a dome shape that sticks out a quarter of an inch past the bristles and is metal that get incredible hot while blow drying and styling</li>
            <li>but the bristels are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>Not bad burns by any means</li>
            <li>Easy for styling and gentle to the head!</li>
            <li>It is so easy and fast to dry my hair in the morning when I am in a hurry and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I have very very long, thick hair, and this brush is the perfect size and does a good job at rounding out my ends.</li>
            <li>I use this brush every day -- never pulls and dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>This brush works extraordinarily well.  </li>
            <li>Just replaced the older model of this brush that I had for many years.</li>
            <li>The large size also makes it easy to add volume.</li>
            <li>It works well and the best thing about it is that is doesn&#x27;t break my hair like older types of round brushes that pull the hair out.</li>
            <li>to better achieve her new style.  </li>
            <li>I bought a new hair dryer and decided to invest in a better brush as well.</li>
            <li>Not super great at curling hair.</li>
            <li>your hair will easily &#x27;catch&#x27; in the bristles, but not so much that it seems stuck.  </li>
            <li>Using it Makes my hair sleek and smooth through the whole day.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The secret weapon of ladies with a perfect blow out.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>It is just right for the price.</li>
            <li>With better brush technique, I could probably get the time down even more.</li>
            <li>It was absolutely nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Big, easy to manage,very light.</li>
            <li>I have short to medium length hair and this brush does wonders for my very fine, flyaway, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>Left hair nice and straight .</li>
            <li>My hair comes out soft and shiney I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy some new brushes and tried this one!  </li>
            <li>Love all the different sizes.</li>
            <li>Fast service!</li>
            <li>I first learned about this brush at the Aveda salon</li>
            <li>I would still recommend this brush and I would most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li>First one lasted for years.  </li>
            <li>The metal on the end of this brush becomes extremely hot after just a couple of minutes of blow drying.</li>
            <li>but here&#x27;s a REAL one for you!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, no issue.</li>
            <li>I am going to see about maybe buying another one from this same brand (a more sturdier one) and see if that will hold up.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many round brushes over the years but the Olivia Garden Ceramic and Ion Thermal Brush works best on my thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money, plus it&#x27;s really well-made.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this brush!</li>
            <li>If I get a minute, I will come back and post the diameter of the brush as measured across the top of the cylinder, not including the bristles.  </li>
            <li>Love it but the nice hair doesn&#x27;t only depends on the brush like any other review says.</li>
            <li>Olivia Garden Ceramic and Ionic Brush Works great for smooth wave and less frizz on long straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to brush with and works well to blow dry hair straight.</li>
            <li>I love this brush for blow drying my long hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I quite have the &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; of this brush yet but, even with my fumbling attempts, I can see it is making a difference - in a good way.</li>
            <li>This brush was initially a good purchase - I was searching for a round brush that did not trap my hair and yank it out where the brush part meets the handle, and on that point, this brush did a decent job.</li>
            <li>Still better than many other similar products.</li>
            <li>(I bought the 2.5&amp;#34; brush), and it&#x27;s so much easier to style long hair smooth and silky with this!</li>
            <li>I have thick, long 4c hair and it works great!</li>
            <li>I get daily numerous compliments on how healthy, full and voluminous it looks.</li>
            <li>Pretty comfortable grip, so far no trouble with hair getting caught in any seams.  </li>
            <li>I have become quite skilled at blowing dry my curly hair straight and this brush is part of my toolkit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never thought a hairbrush would make such a huge difference in blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>I only need to touch up a few spots with the straightener (the lovely cowlicks mostly).</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>I do have to use a smaller round brush for the top layer but love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have bought much sooner</li>
            <li>My hair dries much quicker.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to pay what I did for a hair brush, but honestly, it really made a difference in styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like the grippy</li>
            <li>Retains heat from the blowdryer very well.</li>
            <li>very well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and this brush does not pull my hair or cause split ends like others I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>I debated buying this brush for a while and couldn&#x27;t get a straight answer on the diameter and size and eventually took a chance.  </li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>The round brush is easy to use and long lasting - does a great job of straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are soft but does the job right ....</li>
            <li>This brush worked wonders for me and was easy to handle while blowing out my long hair.</li>
            <li>I have long curly hair and this brush dries my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>While she&#x27;s still working on the skills necessary to properly wield this brush, the static in her hair has been reduced fairly dramatically; and the brush glides through her usually tangled-because-of-curls hair.</li>
            <li>It is pretty well identical to a MUCH more expensive hair brush from Moroccan Oil (though I love their products too).  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a high quality brush similar to what my hairdresser uses and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>I was always afraid to get a big brush because I really didn&#x27;t think it would grab and style my hair the right way, but this one is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to create long lasting waves in my hair with this brush, a hot blowdryer, and some hair spray.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give the 5th star is because the top of the brush gets pretty hot from the blow dryer and I&#x27;ve burned my neck and cheek a few times when I turn the brush certain angles and it touches my skin.</li>
            <li>I really needed a new brush.  </li>
            <li>Side bonus is less static and snarling.</li>
            <li>and I was always afraid of this kind of brushes thinking it would cause more breakage and frizz...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using a high heat dryer don&#x27;t get this brush.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This brush leaves my hair so straight and silky soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned a round brush but after a couple of uses I love this.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to say that this brush has helped me defeat many bad hair days!</li>
            <li>The new version is considerably cheaper looking and feeling than the older one.</li>
            <li>Seems to dry my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>This brush does not get tangled in my hair and it makes my hair very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>It completely defrizzes your hair!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t hesitate to get the exact same brush again.  </li>
            <li>Great for long thick hair!  </li>
            <li>It puts just the right amount of curl in my long hair.</li>
            <li>It seems like using them helps my thick hair dry more quickly, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li>My mother recently cut her hair and she needed a new hair brush (and honestly a new hair dryer to go with it!)</li>
            <li>I think it does this because the handle is soft rubber.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny, even without putting any products in.</li>
            <li>I ordered it from Amazon and my old brush is now gone.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and styled.  </li>
            <li>Soon after, my cheap 2&amp;#34; round brush broke, so I got this OG brush to replace it.  </li>
            <li>It would take me over 30 minutes to blow dry and straighten my whole head on a normal basis.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t really fine or thick - it is normal I would say.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, so to just blow dry and go doesn&#x27;t usually work without using a hot iron to smooth out the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>But yes, occasionally my hair does get tangled in the rubber grip but much less than w my old Chi brush and very rarely.  </li>
            <li>Wet or dry hair, this brush goes smoothly through to untangle without tearing up my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little larger around than I&#x27;m used to but doesn&#x27;t tangle and seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I have fairly long straight hair</li>
            <li>I really like this brush to dry my hair with.</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm enough that my fine hair stays put, but soft enough that I can spin the brush while my hair is wrapped around it.  </li>
            <li>the barrel doesn&#x27;t get too hot like some of the other ones do.  </li>
            <li>Was searching for a new round brush when I came across positive reviews on a beauty website of this one.  </li>
            <li>This product works fairly ok, but it occasionally pulls my hair because the handle design is not optimum.</li>
            <li>BUT, the one thing I wish was different is that the top of it (at least on my brush) is not covered in rubber, like some others that are similar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times so far, but I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my hair everytime.</li>
            <li>My thick curly hair has never looked so smooth.</li>
            <li>I use two other brushes that were purchased either in a drugstore or grocery store, and they work very well.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended I purchase this round brush as I am a complete novice when it comes to round brushes and this one is so so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I still need more practice with it (only used it a few times so far), but it really does dry my hair about 40-50% faster than my other metal round brush.</li>
            <li>Helps my hair dry faster, and stay soft and shiney.</li>

            <li> I always thought that it was all about the products I used to make my hair look good, but this brush has made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> And not the nice ringlet curls that you can just leave either.</li>
            <li> I feel it doesn&#x27;t really warm up well.</li>
            <li> But otherwise it is sturdy and looks nice.</li>
            <li> It goes perfectly with my new Babyliss Pro BABNt5548 Ionic hair dryer!</li>

            <li> The brush was great my hair is curly and long and when I styled it with brush and was great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the brush my hairdresser uses.</li>
            <li> Why do I need six more words?</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> this comp is not my favorite, i have others which i like much more</li>
            <li> Love the hide-away pick feature.</li>
            <li> Nice and light.  </li>
            <li> This design is a bit better because the handle doesn&#x27;t seem like it will separate.</li>
            <li> I have better blowout brushes, this brush didnt even do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am assuming she is satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> works great and heats up fast</li>
            <li> This brush is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Love how it works--I bought two sizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li> it was ok not what i thought.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have had many and can say you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> got this for my family to try it, and they love it and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Now my favorite hair brush.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I have burned myself when the top of the brush touches my neck.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re asking why the 3 Star rating???</li>
            <li> Static was my biggest problem, but not anymore. :)</li>
            <li> so I had to replace my favorite styling brush.  </li>
            <li> Love this brush for styling my curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> The diameter of this size brush as measured across the top from tip of the bristles to tip of the bristles is 31/8\\&quot; and across the top but NOT including the bristles is 21/8\\&quot;.      </li>
            <li> Love this&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I highly recommend,</li>
            <li> Until getting this brush, I never realized how important a good ceramic round brush is if you want to successfully style your hair with it!!</li>
            <li> But this size was perfect for my long hair which is below my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> more fine</li>
            <li> The brush is light weight and leaves my hair shiny and smooth!  </li>
            <li> For years I had tried so many products on my hair to get it to behave, but now I have realized that it wasn&#x27;t the product that was necessarily important but the tools used to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, my hair comes out softer.  </li>
            <li> The burn has never been so severe as to scar my skin, fortunately, but it does hurt and I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this brush again unless the model changed so that the top was covered with rubber or something else that doesn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li> But either way, the hot top on the brush hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well at keeping the frizz away from my hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to work with.....</li>
            <li> Easy to use and retains heat</li>
            <li> This brush makes styling my hair so easy.  </li>
            <li> I like it easy to use and hold</li>
            <li> But good value and fast shipping didnt make my hair as smooth as I was hoping like the salon does</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I am anywhere close to good with hair, but I&#x27;m finding myself in love with how I have been able top style and dry my hair using this brush.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good brush, but for me it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to all the glowing reviews</li>
            <li> Good value if you need a new blow drying, styling brush.</li>
            <li> Works fine, well made.  </li>
            <li> I cut the time in half, and it did a great job!!!</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice but for those who are like me, I can get that perfect volume and shine under 7 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The #65 smooth&#x27;s, straightens well AND dries my hair faster.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair looking shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> And it is easy to clean, too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush.</li>
            <li> i had no idea my hair could look so smooth.</li>
            <li> Light wait</li>
            <li> This brush is one of the best round brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Hair had a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job at smoothing &amp; straightening out my hair with the hair dryer and</li>
            <li> Makes my hair Shiny and smooth , does not pull my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush seeing so many reviews, it&#x27;s really worth having one...</li>
            <li> So far seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> This size is good for straightening medium-long hair and adding a soft curl at the end.</li>
            <li> Brush is right in many ways.  </li>
            <li> It is light, but powerful!  </li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied with how smooth my hair is when I use this brush.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how important the right tools are!</li>
            <li> The top on mine is metal and that metal gets extremely hot when I&#x27;m blow-drying.</li>
            <li> First, I have to say I LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li> and i dont have to do as many passes because the hot air blows all through the brush.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus the silver pin comes out of the handle and can be used to part hair or help clean the brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is a great product for straightening while you blow dry.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and works perfectly with my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything too special about this brush.</li>
            <li> This goes right through my medium length, fine hair without a snag.</li>
            <li> Works great just as expected.</li>
            <li> Love fixing my hair now, thanks to this brush.</li>
            <li> and the width was perfect for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The top of the brush is a dome shape that sticks out a quarter of an inch past the bristles and is metal that get incredible hot while blow drying and styling</li>
            <li> but the bristels are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> Not bad burns by any means</li>
            <li> Easy for styling and gentle to the head!</li>
            <li> It is so easy and fast to dry my hair in the morning when I am in a hurry and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I have very very long, thick hair, and this brush is the perfect size and does a good job at rounding out my ends.</li>
            <li> I use this brush every day -- never pulls and dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> This brush works extraordinarily well.  </li>
            <li> Just replaced the older model of this brush that I had for many years.</li>
            <li> The large size also makes it easy to add volume.</li>
            <li> It works well and the best thing about it is that is doesn&#x27;t break my hair like older types of round brushes that pull the hair out.</li>
            <li> to better achieve her new style.  </li>
            <li> I bought a new hair dryer and decided to invest in a better brush as well.</li>
            <li> Not super great at curling hair.</li>
            <li> your hair will easily &#x27;catch&#x27; in the bristles, but not so much that it seems stuck.  </li>
            <li> Using it Makes my hair sleek and smooth through the whole day.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The secret weapon of ladies with a perfect blow out.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It is just right for the price.</li>
            <li> With better brush technique, I could probably get the time down even more.</li>
            <li> It was absolutely nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Big, easy to manage,very light.</li>
            <li> I have short to medium length hair and this brush does wonders for my very fine, flyaway, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Left hair nice and straight .</li>
            <li> My hair comes out soft and shiney I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy some new brushes and tried this one!  </li>
            <li> Love all the different sizes.</li>
            <li> Fast service!</li>
            <li> I first learned about this brush at the Aveda salon</li>
            <li> I would still recommend this brush and I would most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> First one lasted for years.  </li>
            <li> The metal on the end of this brush becomes extremely hot after just a couple of minutes of blow drying.</li>
            <li> but here&#x27;s a REAL one for you!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, no issue.</li>
            <li> I am going to see about maybe buying another one from this same brand (a more sturdier one) and see if that will hold up.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many round brushes over the years but the Olivia Garden Ceramic and Ion Thermal Brush works best on my thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money, plus it&#x27;s really well-made.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this brush!</li>
            <li> If I get a minute, I will come back and post the diameter of the brush as measured across the top of the cylinder, not including the bristles.  </li>
            <li> Love it but the nice hair doesn&#x27;t only depends on the brush like any other review says.</li>
            <li> Olivia Garden Ceramic and Ionic Brush Works great for smooth wave and less frizz on long straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to brush with and works well to blow dry hair straight.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for blow drying my long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I quite have the &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; of this brush yet but, even with my fumbling attempts, I can see it is making a difference - in a good way.</li>
            <li> This brush was initially a good purchase - I was searching for a round brush that did not trap my hair and yank it out where the brush part meets the handle, and on that point, this brush did a decent job.</li>
            <li> Still better than many other similar products.</li>
            <li> (I bought the 2.5&amp;#34; brush), and it&#x27;s so much easier to style long hair smooth and silky with this!</li>
            <li> I have thick, long 4c hair and it works great!</li>
            <li> I get daily numerous compliments on how healthy, full and voluminous it looks.</li>
            <li> Pretty comfortable grip, so far no trouble with hair getting caught in any seams.  </li>
            <li> I have become quite skilled at blowing dry my curly hair straight and this brush is part of my toolkit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never thought a hairbrush would make such a huge difference in blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I only need to touch up a few spots with the straightener (the lovely cowlicks mostly).</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I do have to use a smaller round brush for the top layer but love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have bought much sooner</li>
            <li> My hair dries much quicker.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to pay what I did for a hair brush, but honestly, it really made a difference in styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like the grippy</li>
            <li> Retains heat from the blowdryer very well.</li>
            <li> very well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this brush does not pull my hair or cause split ends like others I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> I debated buying this brush for a while and couldn&#x27;t get a straight answer on the diameter and size and eventually took a chance.  </li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> The round brush is easy to use and long lasting - does a great job of straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are soft but does the job right ....</li>
            <li> This brush worked wonders for me and was easy to handle while blowing out my long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and this brush dries my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> While she&#x27;s still working on the skills necessary to properly wield this brush, the static in her hair has been reduced fairly dramatically; and the brush glides through her usually tangled-because-of-curls hair.</li>
            <li> It is pretty well identical to a MUCH more expensive hair brush from Moroccan Oil (though I love their products too).  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a high quality brush similar to what my hairdresser uses and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> I was always afraid to get a big brush because I really didn&#x27;t think it would grab and style my hair the right way, but this one is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to create long lasting waves in my hair with this brush, a hot blowdryer, and some hair spray.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give the 5th star is because the top of the brush gets pretty hot from the blow dryer and I&#x27;ve burned my neck and cheek a few times when I turn the brush certain angles and it touches my skin.</li>
            <li> I really needed a new brush.  </li>
            <li> Side bonus is less static and snarling.</li>
            <li> and I was always afraid of this kind of brushes thinking it would cause more breakage and frizz...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using a high heat dryer don&#x27;t get this brush.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush leaves my hair so straight and silky soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a round brush but after a couple of uses I love this.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to say that this brush has helped me defeat many bad hair days!</li>
            <li> The new version is considerably cheaper looking and feeling than the older one.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> This brush does not get tangled in my hair and it makes my hair very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> It completely defrizzes your hair!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hesitate to get the exact same brush again.  </li>
            <li> Great for long thick hair!  </li>
            <li> It puts just the right amount of curl in my long hair.</li>
            <li> It seems like using them helps my thick hair dry more quickly, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> My mother recently cut her hair and she needed a new hair brush (and honestly a new hair dryer to go with it!)</li>
            <li> I think it does this because the handle is soft rubber.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny, even without putting any products in.</li>
            <li> I ordered it from Amazon and my old brush is now gone.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and styled.  </li>
            <li> Soon after, my cheap 2&amp;#34; round brush broke, so I got this OG brush to replace it.  </li>
            <li> It would take me over 30 minutes to blow dry and straighten my whole head on a normal basis.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t really fine or thick - it is normal I would say.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, so to just blow dry and go doesn&#x27;t usually work without using a hot iron to smooth out the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> But yes, occasionally my hair does get tangled in the rubber grip but much less than w my old Chi brush and very rarely.  </li>
            <li> Wet or dry hair, this brush goes smoothly through to untangle without tearing up my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little larger around than I&#x27;m used to but doesn&#x27;t tangle and seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long straight hair</li>
            <li> I really like this brush to dry my hair with.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough that my fine hair stays put, but soft enough that I can spin the brush while my hair is wrapped around it.  </li>
            <li> the barrel doesn&#x27;t get too hot like some of the other ones do.  </li>
            <li> Was searching for a new round brush when I came across positive reviews on a beauty website of this one.  </li>
            <li> This product works fairly ok, but it occasionally pulls my hair because the handle design is not optimum.</li>
            <li> BUT, the one thing I wish was different is that the top of it (at least on my brush) is not covered in rubber, like some others that are similar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times so far, but I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my hair everytime.</li>
            <li> My thick curly hair has never looked so smooth.</li>
            <li> I use two other brushes that were purchased either in a drugstore or grocery store, and they work very well.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended I purchase this round brush as I am a complete novice when it comes to round brushes and this one is so so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I still need more practice with it (only used it a few times so far), but it really does dry my hair about 40-50% faster than my other metal round brush.</li>
            <li> Helps my hair dry faster, and stay soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> I recently cut 8 inches off my hair and needed to purchase a new size round brush.  </li>
            <li> Got one for my daughter, who has long hair, and she says the same thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair, but I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s a frizzy/kinky curl (thanks for that dad!).</li>
            <li> I could not believe I didn&#x27;t have to use a flat iron after blow drying!</li>
            <li> Gives her flat hair volume and body and reduces frizz!</li>
            <li> I use some hair product and then blow dry in just a matter of minutes with the help of the heated ceramic barrel, and can also curl in big waves and body in the process.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I blow dry my hair differently or maybe it has to do with the length of one&#x27;s arms</li>
            <li> It is long, passed my chest with longer layers.</li>
            <li> Cut my hair not too long after I bought it.</li>
            <li> It was time to replace my old round brush</li>
            <li> It is not overly thick, but very curly/wavy.</li>
            <li> I use expensive salon shampoo an products, my other brushes give such a smooth blowout but not this one.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this brush for anything other than use with low heat, which almost defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> The blow dryer heats up the bristles so you can styles and you dry.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair in a couple minutes</li>
            <li> You have to know how to dry the hair.</li>
            <li> It heats your hair instantly and it takes less time to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Wasnt painful at all and easily removed the tangles!</li>
            <li> Actually helps your hair dry faster with less frizz!</li>
            <li> Since I brought this little guy, it takes me only about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> (the mark is gone within a few mins), but it still hurts for that second or two</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same round brush that I bought at a salon over 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It is a standard round brush -- that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> This brush smooths my hair well without needing anything else if I want to just dry and go!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t section my hair when blow drying; I typically just use the brush to grab up hair and then blow dry it away from my head in an upward motion.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews about faster drying time and hoe it smooths out hair.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the piping hot end, I was not impressed with the brush.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t run into the burning issue that some of the other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break my hair like other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that tends to be dry and straw-like after blow-drying.</li>
            <li> Hair does sometimes get stuck on rubber handle but that would be only complaint.</li>
            <li> Absolute worse brush I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
            <li> I have really thick coarse hair and havent noticed any issues.</li>
            <li> Ordered it and haven&#x27;t put it down since.  </li>
            <li> Price was less than Ulta</li>
            <li> It literally cuts my drying time in half.</li>
            <li> My previous brush wouldn&#x27;t grab my hair...</li>
            <li> Since I purchased this brush, I wear my hair down almost everyday.</li>
            <li> In the past it has been very time consuming and difficult to manage, but this brush has literally changed the way I do my hair.</li>
            <li> I used to wear my hair in a bun everyday to work because I couldn&#x27;t deal with the hassle of doing it every morning.</li>
            <li> and it helps to keep it from frizzing if I pull a round brush through it while drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using round brushes for 2 decades and this has never happened.  </li>
            <li> This brush is a replacement for one bought a few years ago.</li>
            <li> it is too harsh on the scalp because there is no rounded tip.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair...  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever had this issue with a round brush, however inexpensive, and I am exceedingly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this products .</li>
            <li> I am not a hair stylist and I have a difficult time straightening my very long hair.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t heard any negative feedback, so</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, thick with a wave.</li>
            <li> and that could be just because of my hair style (i have thick curly hair)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair and so overheating it will make it frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have a nasty large round burn on my neck from 3 days go.</li>
            <li> This brush sucks!</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy curly hair and never brush it because its a painful waste of time without conditioner.</li>
            <li> But I am so tired of the brush ripping out hairs.</li>
            <li> For years, I have struggled with my difficult hair.</li>
            <li> ive been using the wrong brush for years.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and damage hair</li>
            <li> This item was carelessly manufactured - so please beware!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> I was wrong!!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed if you purchase it!</li>
            <li> Use this brush with a Babyliss Pro blow dryer and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this brush every day -- never pulls and dries hair quickly.  It&#x27;s better than the brush my hairdresser uses.</li>
            <li> Olivia Garden brushes are the best. I was introduced to them by my stylist so decided to try one. One led to two. My hair is shoulder length, thick with a wave. The #65 smooth&#x27;s, straightens well AND dries my hair faster. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I could not believe I didn&#x27;t have to use a flat iron after blow drying! It completely defrizzes your hair! Excellent!</li>
            <li> Easy for styling and gentle to the head!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well at keeping the frizz away from my hair. Why do I need six more words?</li>
            <li> This is my third hairbrush! Love all the different sizes. Bought the hairbrush cleaner also. Works like a charm! Great products! Fast service!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I have thick, long 4c hair and it works great!</li>
            <li> So I saw the ratings and had to try it. It heats your hair instantly and it takes less time to blow dry my hair. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> this comp is not my favorite, i have others which i like much more and that could be just because of my hair style (i have thick curly hair)</li>
            <li> This product works fairly ok, but it occasionally pulls my hair because the handle design is not optimum. Still better than many other similar products.</li>
            <li> Love the hide-away pick feature. I first learned about this brush at the Aveda salon I go to, where it is used by virtually all the stylists.</li>
            <li> Love fixing my hair now, thanks to this brush.</li>
            <li> I recently cut 8 inches off my hair and needed to purchase a new size round brush.  The salon I go to uses OG brushes so I decided to order one for myself.  The brush is light weight and leaves my hair shiny and smooth!  As an added bonus the silver pin comes out of the handle and can be used to part hair or help clean the brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works extraordinarily well.  My mother recently cut her hair and she needed a new hair brush (and honestly a new hair dryer to go with it!) to better achieve her new style.  While she&#x27;s still working on the skills necessary to properly wield this brush, the static in her hair has been reduced fairly dramatically; and the brush glides through her usually tangled-because-of-curls hair.</li>
            <li> Nice and light.  Works great</li>
            <li> Just replaced the older model of this brush that I had for many years. This design is a bit better because the handle doesn&#x27;t seem like it will separate. Gives great volume for heat styling.</li>
            <li> I have better blowout brushes, this brush didnt even do anything for my hair. Frizzy and poofy. I use expensive salon shampoo an products, my other brushes give such a smooth blowout but not this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for straightening hair. I don&#x27;t have thick hair, but I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s a frizzy/kinky curl (thanks for that dad!). I am pretty satisfied with how smooth my hair is when I use this brush. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give the 5th star is because the top of the brush gets pretty hot from the blow dryer and I&#x27;ve burned my neck and cheek a few times when I turn the brush certain angles and it touches my skin. Not bad burns by any means (the mark is gone within a few mins), but it still hurts for that second or two it touches the skin (maybe more startling than actual pain). I would still recommend this brush and I would most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received my product on time.  The brush was great my hair is curly and long and when I styled it with brush and was great.</li>
            <li> I have above-shoulder length, layered hair and the brush size works great to straighten my hair. But I am so tired of the brush ripping out hairs. I think it does this because the handle is soft rubber. I thought I could get around this by holding my fingers in such a way that hair wouldn&#x27;t wrap around the handle. But no luck - hairs still rip out of my head every time I use it. I&#x27;m brush shopping again...</li>
            <li> Perfect for fine medium length hair</li>
            <li> This is the best styling brush I&#x27;ve ever owned!  It is so easy and fast to dry my hair in the morning when I am in a hurry and does a great job.  You will not be disappointed if you purchase it!</li>
            <li> Works great for my medium-length hair style - no pulling or tangling</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Came promptly and is great quality. Gives great curls when blow drying. Leaves hair looking shiny and smooth. I have really thick coarse hair and havent noticed any issues.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for blow drying my long hair. Using it Makes my hair sleek and smooth through the whole day. The large size also makes it easy to add volume.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good brush, but for me it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to all the glowing reviews</li>
            <li> your hair will easily &#x27;catch&#x27; in the bristles, but not so much that it seems stuck.  Use this brush with a Babyliss Pro blow dryer and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> If I could marry a brush, I probably would marry this one. For years, I have struggled with my difficult hair. It is not overly thick, but very curly/wavy. And not the nice ringlet curls that you can just leave either. I also have the misfortune of having not one, but two cowlicks on my head. It would take me over 30 minutes to blow dry and straighten my whole head on a normal basis. Since I brought this little guy, it takes me only about 15 minutes. I only need to touch up a few spots with the straightener (the lovely cowlicks mostly). I used to wear my hair in a bun everyday to work because I couldn&#x27;t deal with the hassle of doing it every morning. Since I purchased this brush, I wear my hair down almost everyday. I get daily numerous compliments on how healthy, full and voluminous it looks. I never understood how people got such body and volume in their hair, but now I have that same look! I was always afraid to get a big brush because I really didn&#x27;t think it would grab and style my hair the right way, but this one is absolutely perfect. The blow dryer heats up the bristles so you can styles and you dry. My hair isn&#x27;t really fine or thick - it is normal I would say. It is long, passed my chest with longer layers. In the past it has been very time consuming and difficult to manage, but this brush has literally changed the way I do my hair. I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair...  but I have a lot of it and it has various textures...  this brush has helped me defeat my hair!  It is light, but powerful!  I am happy to say that this brush has helped me defeat many bad hair days! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and works perfectly! I do have to use a smaller round brush for the top layer but love it.</li>
            <li> Love it. I agree with other reviews about faster drying time and hoe it smooths out hair.  Hair does sometimes get stuck on rubber handle but that would be only complaint. I&#x27;d have bought much sooner had I realized the benefits of a ceramic brush.</li>
            <li> The secret weapon of ladies with a perfect blow out.  This works great. Takes a little practice but for those who are like me, I can get that perfect volume and shine under 7 minutes.  (yes I timed myself)</li>
            <li> I have short to medium length hair and this brush does wonders for my very fine, flyaway, frizzy hair.  I use some hair product and then blow dry in just a matter of minutes with the help of the heated ceramic barrel, and can also curl in big waves and body in the process.  For years I had tried so many products on my hair to get it to behave, but now I have realized that it wasn&#x27;t the product that was necessarily important but the tools used to style my hair.  This is a quality product, too, because I use it every day with a lot of twisting and turning the barrel, and the handle has not loosened and it is just the same as when I bought it.  And it is easy to clean, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I quite have the &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; of this brush yet but, even with my fumbling attempts, I can see it is making a difference - in a good way.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush. Very easy to brush with and works well to blow dry hair straight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything too special about this brush. It works about as well as similar brushes that I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;purchased at the drug store for $12.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my shop, accidentally brought it home, and the wife said she was keeping it.&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job smoothing out the hair, and 2 inches is just right for shoulder length or longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;Wife likes the detachable pick in the handle end.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter...she asked for it....and I haven&#x27;t heard any negative feedback, so I am assuming she is satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It has a good grip and the bristles are good quality. I would definitely reccomend it!</li>
            <li> My hair dries much quicker. No tangles and great price!</li>
            <li> It puts just the right amount of curl in my long hair. Good quality materials. I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and it&#x27;s holding up great, not losing bristles.</li>
            <li> I am not a hair stylist and I have a difficult time straightening my very long hair. This brush worked wonders for me and was easy to handle while blowing out my long hair. Add an attachment to your blowdryer and there is no way you will burn your hair.</li>
            <li> Works fine, well made.  Price was less than Ulta so I bought it.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush to dry my hair with. I have fairly long straight hair and it helps to keep it from frizzing if I pull a round brush through it while drying. It&#x27;s a little larger around than I&#x27;m used to but doesn&#x27;t tangle and seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended I purchase this round brush as I am a complete novice when it comes to round brushes and this one is so so easy to use. My hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled and there isn&#x27;t a gap at the end for hair to get stuck. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> i had no idea my hair could look so smooth. ive been using the wrong brush for years. so happy i tried this one.</li>
            <li> Great product that does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> very comfortable to hold while drying, the brush does not tangle or pull your hair.Great brush for longer hair. I am very happy with this product and will buy again when this one wears out! Happy customer, Jane</li>
            <li> This is the second brush I&#x27;ve purchased.  First one lasted for years.  Light wait and I will never buy anything but ceramic!</li>
            <li> Best styling brush ever! Easy to use doesnt tangle in my hair. Love this brush ! You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> works great and heats up fast</li>
            <li> The metal on the end of this brush becomes extremely hot after just a couple of minutes of blow drying. I have a nasty large round burn on my neck from 3 days go. Aside from the piping hot end, I was not impressed with the brush. It&#x27;s going back!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. It leaves my hair soft and shiny, even without putting any products in.</li>
            <li> Was searching for a new round brush when I came across positive reviews on a beauty website of this one.  Ordered it and haven&#x27;t put it down since.  My hair is frizzy and wavy and this brush tames it perfect when blow drying. High quality</li>
            <li> This brush is my favorite.  Great to use with blow dryer to add volume to fine hair.  I use it every day and it does not scratch your head as some have posted...maybe I have a tougher scalp.  Very good quality, and very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly thick hair. This brush is a great product for straightening while you blow dry. I am always looking for brushes that will help manage my hair. This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! It literally cuts my drying time in half. I have very very long, thick hair, and this brush is the perfect size and does a good job at rounding out my ends.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used. Got one for my daughter, who has long hair, and she says the same thing. Wet or dry hair, this brush goes smoothly through to untangle without tearing up my hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful; no sticking or pulling my hair. Love how it works--I bought two sizes. Great brand/style.</li>
            <li> I really needed a new brush.  I see a big difference in shine and ease of styling.  So far seems like a good product. Company was prompt in shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same round brush that I bought at a salon over 10 years ago.  At my last hair appt. my hairdresser used this brush and I loved it.  I ordered it from Amazon and my old brush is now gone.  This goes right through my medium length, fine hair without a snag. I love it!</li>
            <li> This brush is one of the best round brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It perfectly grabs my hair and lifts it up.  I don&#x27;t section my hair when blow drying; I typically just use the brush to grab up hair and then blow dry it away from my head in an upward motion.  This brush does it well.  My previous brush wouldn&#x27;t grab my hair...it just rolled over the hair without the bristles actually going through it.  It drove me nuts.  After a week, I tossed the brush and bought this one instead.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t run into the burning issue that some of the other reviewers have mentioned.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I blow dry my hair differently or maybe it has to do with the length of one&#x27;s arms--I don&#x27;t know.  But either way, the hot top on the brush hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me!</li>
            <li> Not super great at curling hair. I feel it doesn&#x27;t really warm up well. But otherwise it is sturdy and looks nice.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this products . Its realy good rprofessional product.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel like these reviews are payed for! This brush sucks! Don&#x27;t listen to the reviews! It does tangle your hair! The handle has grip and it gets stuck to your hair when you try to rotate it! Absolute worse brush I&#x27;ve ever bought! Reviews suck on Amazon but here&#x27;s a REAL one for you! Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to pay what I did for a hair brush, but honestly, it really made a difference in styling my hair.  I really like the grippy&lt;br /&gt;handle, and the width was perfect for my thick hair.  I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> My hair is shinier and straighter from using this brush.  I love it!  It goes perfectly with my new Babyliss Pro BABNt5548 Ionic hair dryer!</li>
            <li> it was ok not what i thought. But good value and fast shipping didnt make my hair as smooth as I was hoping like the salon does</li>
            <li> The top of the brush is a dome shape that sticks out a quarter of an inch past the bristles and is metal that get incredible hot while blow drying and styling and I melted off skin on my face and neck.  I&#x27;ve been using round brushes for 2 decades and this has never happened.  This item was carelessly manufactured - so please beware!</li>
            <li> Brush is right in many ways.  Seems to dry my hair quickly.  Most importantly, my hair comes out softer.  Good value if you need a new blow drying, styling brush.</li>
            <li> I never thought a hairbrush would make such a huge difference in blow drying my hair. I cut the time in half, and it did a great job!!! Hair had a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Actually helps your hair dry faster with less frizz!</li>
            <li> I bought a variety of brushes on Amazon to try to find one with softer bristles, and this is the one; returned all the rest. The bristles are firm enough that my fine hair stays put, but soft enough that I can spin the brush while my hair is wrapped around it.  Pretty comfortable grip, so far no trouble with hair getting caught in any seams.  This size is good for straightening medium-long hair and adding a soft curl at the end. I also bought a 1 3/8&amp;#34; size for tighter curls an waves.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Very good brush. My hair would get caught in that area where the handle hooks to the brush, this has a flat/smooth design, so my hair does not get &#x27;caught&#x27; !  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have had many and can say you get what you pay for.  This is not the best and is definitely not the worst.  It is just right for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and excellent service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I loved the most was that it came in a perfect shape with no bent tips compared to another seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my family to try it, and they love it and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Retains heat from the blowdryer very well. I&#x27;m able to create long lasting waves in my hair with this brush, a hot blowdryer, and some hair spray. Until getting this brush, I never realized how important a good ceramic round brush is if you want to successfully style your hair with it!!</li>
            <li> Now my favorite hair brush.  Great for long thick hair!  Easy to work with.....I am so happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I was looking for a high quality brush similar to what my hairdresser uses and this fit the bill.  I bought this size and another that is 1 3/8 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> This brush was initially a good purchase - I was searching for a round brush that did not trap my hair and yank it out where the brush part meets the handle, and on that point, this brush did a decent job. Unfortunately, the brush does not seem able to withstand the heat of a blowdryer. It recently melted. I was alarmed; it melted in my hair. The melted plastic of the bristles stuck to my hair and caused an entire clump to fall out. This is the first time I have ever had this issue with a round brush, however inexpensive, and I am exceedingly disappointed. I do not recommend this brush for anything other than use with low heat, which almost defeats the purpose. There also seems to be an inadequate return policy on the item, so getting my funds returned seems an impossibility - this is no consolation for the bald patch this product left.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, so to just blow dry and go doesn&#x27;t usually work without using a hot iron to smooth out the frizzies.  This brush smooths my hair well without needing anything else if I want to just dry and go!!</li>
            <li> I totally love my brush!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It is light weight and works perfectly with my thick hair.  I recently got my hair cut to shoulder length and this brush makes styling a breeze.</li>
            <li> This brush is one of the best thermal brushes I have ever bought.  It leaves my hair soft and styled.  I don&#x27;t have thick hair and so overheating it will make it frizzy.  No frizz with this brush!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and damage hair and I was always afraid of this kind of brushes thinking it would cause more breakage and frizz... I was wrong!! It cut blow drying time and also made my hair softer! Wish I had started using it sooner!</li>
            <li> It works well and the best thing about it is that is doesn&#x27;t break my hair like older types of round brushes that pull the hair out. BUT, the one thing I wish was different is that the top of it (at least on my brush) is not covered in rubber, like some others that are similar. The top on mine is metal and that metal gets extremely hot when I&#x27;m blow-drying. As a result, I have burned myself when the top of the brush touches my neck. The burn has never been so severe as to scar my skin, fortunately, but it does hurt and I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this brush again unless the model changed so that the top was covered with rubber or something else that doesn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li> THIS AN AWESOME BRUSH LEAVES MY HAIR SILKY SMOOTH !! VERY LIGHT DOESNT TANGLE AT ALL I LOVE THIS BRUSH</li>
            <li> Olivia Garden Ceramic and Ionic Brush Works great for smooth wave and less frizz on long straight hair.  Side bonus is less static and snarling.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome it doesn&#x27;t look it but the bristels are nice and soft.  It does a fantastic job at smoothing &amp; straightening out my hair with the hair dryer and the barrel doesn&#x27;t get too hot like some of the other ones do.  I didn&#x27;t think a brush could make a difference but this one has.  My hair comes out soft and shiney I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy some new brushes and tried this one!  It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used with the hair dryer!!!</li>
            <li> very happy with this brush, it does not get stuck in my hair at all - its the one my hairdresser uses.</li>
            <li> While shopping to replace this brush I stumbled across it and figured I&#x27;d better warn folks about it! This brush has a rubber handle so hair gets caught in it and rips. I am throwing it away and buying a brush with a handle that is made of plastic that wont stick to my hair and rip it out. The bristle portion of this brush works well but the handle ruined it for me.</li>
            <li> Good quality product! Lightweight and durable. Dries my hair faster and gives it volume. I always use a glossing product with it when I use the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely brush.  It would be perfect if it didn&#x27;t pull my hair out every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush! I have long, thick hair that tends to be dry and straw-like after blow-drying. I bought a new hair dryer and decided to invest in a better brush as well. My hair dresser uses one that looks very similar (I bought the 2.5&amp;#34; brush), and it&#x27;s so much easier to style long hair smooth and silky with this! The brush actually holds the hair in place when you wrap strands around it, so you can straighten the hair with the dryer running along it. It works! Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> my hair look great when i use this brush when blow drying my hair. It looks almost as good as when my hairdresser does it.</li>
            <li> Cut my hair not too long after I bought it. Great brush though</li>
            <li> It did not worked for me. The plastic handle pulls the hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and retains heat very well!&lt;br /&gt;So well, that I purchased a second for my gym bag.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are soft but does the job right ....thank you for making this product</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, no issue.</li>
            <li> First, I have to say I LOVE this brush. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re asking why the 3 Star rating??? Well, because the bristles are either falling out and/or their melting and falling over! This brush leaves my hair so straight and silky soft but the bristles don&#x27;t hold up to my Rusk Speed Freak dryer AND I&#x27;ve only been using it for ONE WEEK! I am going to see about maybe buying another one from this same brand (a more sturdier one) and see if that will hold up. If you&#x27;re using a high heat dryer don&#x27;t get this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a round brush but after a couple of uses I love this.  It works well in my shorter than shoulder length hair!</li>
            <li> This brush was touted to be one of the best brushes on the market for styling women&#x27;s hair.  It was absolutely nothing special.  It is a standard round brush -- that&#x27;s it.  I use two other brushes that were purchased either in a drugstore or grocery store, and they work very well.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many round brushes over the years but the Olivia Garden Ceramic and Ion Thermal Brush works best on my thick wavy hair.  The round brush is easy to use and long lasting - does a great job of straightening my hair.  This is a great product that I highly recommend,</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me by my hairdresser. I have become quite skilled at blowing dry my curly hair straight and this brush is part of my toolkit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it smooths my hair without damaging it (paired with Living Proof/Frederic Fekkai products)</li>
            <li> It was time to replace my old round brush so I looked up some reviews and made the leap for this one. It&#x27;s a great brush that leaves my hair smooth and shiny and free of static. Static was my biggest problem, but not anymore. :)</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  I have very curly hair and this brush does not pull my hair or cause split ends like others I&#x27;ve had.  It is very comfortable to hold and makes my hair shine.  Very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have thought that this brush could make a noticeable difference, but it actually does. I still need more practice with it (only used it a few times so far), but it really does dry my hair about 40-50% faster than my other metal round brush. With better brush technique, I could probably get the time down even more. It&#x27;s worth the money, plus it&#x27;s really well-made.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser bought me the larger barreled OG brush like this one.  Soon after, my cheap 2&amp;#34; round brush broke, so I got this OG brush to replace it.  These are wonderful styling tools.  It seems like using them helps my thick hair dry more quickly, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Works great just as expected.</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy curly hair and never brush it because its a painful waste of time without conditioner. It took time, but this brush works wonders! Wasnt painful at all and easily removed the tangles!</li>
            <li> This brush is a replacement for one bought a few years ago. The new version is considerably cheaper looking and feeling than the older one. Guess its just the way it is these days. Its a good brush, just not as good as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and this brush dries my hair very quickly. It doesn&#x27;t break my hair like other brushes I&#x27;ve used. I always thought that it was all about the products I used to make my hair look good, but this brush has made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I forgot some of my toiletries at our vacation house so I had to replace my favorite styling brush.  I didn&#x27;t hesitate to get the exact same brush again.  Love this brush for styling my curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This Brush is perfect. I blow dry my hair in a couple minutes and i dont have to do as many passes because the hot air blows all through the brush.</li>
            <li> Just love love love this brush!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush!  Works great on my fine hair!</li>
            <li> My thick curly hair has never looked so smooth. Also, greatly reduces drying time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Bestie after she saw her hairstylist use it on her! She absolutely loves this brush! Gives her flat hair volume and body and reduces frizz! Amazon has the cheapest price online!</li>
            <li> Love it but the nice hair doesn&#x27;t only depends on the brush like any other review says. You have to know how to dry the hair. Its got nothing to do with the brush. Its the technic.</li>
            <li> Big, easy to manage,very light. Left hair nice and straight . Best purchase and the price is even greater ,good cuality.</li>
            <li> it is too harsh on the scalp because there is no rounded tip.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I am anywhere close to good with hair, but I&#x27;m finding myself in love with how I have been able top style and dry my hair using this brush. Helps my hair dry faster, and stay soft and shiney. I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times so far, but I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my hair everytime. Definitely a good buy. I have color treated hair that is a medium length.</li>
            <li> I debated buying this brush for a while and couldn&#x27;t get a straight answer on the diameter and size and eventually took a chance.  Glad I did!  I bought 3 of these to have conveniently at work, in my gym bag and at home.  It is pretty well identical to a MUCH more expensive hair brush from Moroccan Oil (though I love their products too).  If I get a minute, I will come back and post the diameter of the brush as measured across the top of the cylinder, not including the bristles.  But this size was perfect for my long hair which is below my shoulders.  It is likely too big if you have short hair or hair shorter than your shoulders. But yes, occasionally my hair does get tangled in the rubber grip but much less than w my old Chi brush and very rarely.  On the end of the handle is a tool that slides out and allows you to part your hair.    The diameter of this size brush as measured across the top from tip of the bristles to tip of the bristles is 31/8\\&quot; and across the top but NOT including the bristles is 21/8\\&quot;.      Btw - my hair dresser said he recognized and knows this brand well.</li>
            <li> Great brush, great price! Makes my hair Shiny and smooth , does not pull my hair.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Fast service.</li>
            <li> Awesome find! Perfect blow-out!</li>
            <li> I have never been good at doing my hair.  This brush makes styling my hair so easy.  I had no idea how important the right tools are!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush seeing so many reviews, it&#x27;s really worth having one...</li>
            <li> Love this&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair fuller&lt;br /&gt;And more fine I like it easy to use and hold&lt;br /&gt;A must have for any girl</li>
            <li> This brush does not get tangled in my hair and it makes my hair very soft and silky.  I Highly recommend.</li>
