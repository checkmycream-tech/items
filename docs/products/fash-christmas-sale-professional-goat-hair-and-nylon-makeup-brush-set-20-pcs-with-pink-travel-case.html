            <li>After your brushes are clean, sit them on their side so they can air dray.</li>
            <li>Bought for a Christmas present for a friend, she loved it.  </li>
            <li>Then you should wash the soap and olive oil out in like warm water and continue the circular motions on your palm until water runs clear.</li>

            <li>I have enjoyed trying different makeup styles especially eye colors.</li>
            <li>love the brushes however the bristles could have been a little more sturdy in the sense that is picks up the eye shadow a little easier.</li>
            <li>Bought them as a Christmas present last year for my mother, the only brush that was decent was the foundation brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute little set, and I played with a couple of the brushes when they arrived to see if they were too stiff, or would shed...</li>
            <li>They seemed very soft and didn&#x27;t lose a single bristle, but I haven&#x27;t actually used them for makeup.</li>

            <li> Other than that, the bristles were way too pokey...not soft enough for the lids.</li>
            <li> Only thing wrong with it is that it does smell but only the two big blush brushes, guess its the size, but other than that its worth the money and very soft.</li>
            <li> Do not have them dry with the bristles facing up because the water can get into the handle and loosen up the glue.</li>
            <li> but the only thing is that the foundation brush is a little rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles are itchy and fall out every where they wouldn&#x27;t be bad for people who use cheap make up but for someone who uses</li>
            <li> However was disappointed with wooden handle, hopefully will prove me wrong and hold up better than plastic.</li>
            <li> I washed mine several times and the results were even worse.</li>
            <li> Definitely a waste of money,</li>
            <li> First off they have a bad smell to them and it doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> the bristles are def not nice to the face.</li>
            <li> expensive make up its going to just waste your make up.</li>
            <li> The bristles fell out as soon as I washed them and the smell got even worse.</li>
            <li> Terrible brushes.</li>

            <li> Bought these as a gift and she loves them!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time.  Great set for a great price.  Bought for a Christmas present for a friend, she loved it.  Nice variety of brushes that are a good quality.</li>
            <li> I love this make up brush set, the price was perfect, it helps me very much with my make up, it&#x27;s easy to pack, and travel with it!!</li>

            <li> I bought two of these as stocking stuffers for teenage girls and I am satisfied with them! It&#x27;s a cute little set, and I played with a couple of the brushes when they arrived to see if they were too stiff, or would shed... They seemed very soft and didn&#x27;t lose a single bristle, but I haven&#x27;t actually used them for makeup.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for the price. Although, they stain easily since they&#x27;re white and they still smell after deep cleaning them twice. To deep clean your brushes you can use Dawn Anti-bacterial dish soap and olive oil (to condition your brushes) and rub brushes on your hand in circular motions before you wash the soap and olive oil out. Then you should wash the soap and olive oil out in like warm water and continue the circular motions on your palm until water runs clear. After your brushes are clean, sit them on their side so they can air dray. Do not have them dry with the bristles facing up because the water can get into the handle and loosen up the glue.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. The brushes are very soft and work great for applying make-up. However was disappointed with wooden handle, hopefully will prove me wrong and hold up better than plastic.</li>

            <li> I would NOT recommend anyone to buy these. First off they have a bad smell to them and it doesn&#x27;t go away. I washed mine several times and the results were even worse. The bristles fell out as soon as I washed them and the smell got even worse. I&#x27;m sure its the plastic thing they are covered in that made them smell like that but it doesn&#x27;t go away. I ended up throwing away the majority of them.&lt;br /&gt;And the bristles are def not nice to the face. They are too pokey and itchy!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes the variety is great and the quality was better than expected for the price. I have enjoyed trying different makeup styles especially eye colors. I even love the feel of the case.</li>

            <li> Every brush is wrapped independently. its worth that money. the only thing that bothers me is the bag kinda smells. i think is the plastic. hope the smell will be gone soon</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!! Super soft feel and such a cute color. I would recommend these to all my friends</li>
            <li> some of the bristle are soft, it works really good, i like it but the only thing is that the foundation brush is a little rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> Good product, love it alot</li>
