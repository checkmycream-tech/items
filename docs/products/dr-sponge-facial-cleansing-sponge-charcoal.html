            <li>Great sponge!</li>
            <li>It is great!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got to say it does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>Not the best idea to store sponge in bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; Sponge will deteriorate sooner with alcohol-</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>but my face looked photoshop&#x27;d compared to the remarkable bumps and spots I was sporting for two years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s March, now.</li>

            <li>results were positively unprecedented after adding each item to my routine.</li>
            <li>The texture of the charcoal sponge isn&#x27;t as awesome and mystical as the original, and I feel like my face isn&#x27;t as smooth after washing.</li>

            <li>It have a fantastic exfoliating texture.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Since tea-drinking, my acne has been significantly reduced, and if there are any spots to follow, it&#x27;s easy-come</li>

            <li>Highly recommended ! :)</li>
            <li>I bought the Original one first, and then after it worked so well for my skin I decided to get another one!</li>
            <li>I wash my face with this and a mild cleanser twice per day and my acne is improving.</li>
            <li>Gentle cleansing and good for people with sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>to economically and painlessly fade your blemishes?</li>
            <li>brown skin has two years worth of spots on jaw and cheeks +</li>
            <li>I have super oily acne prone skin and this sponge has helped more than the countless acne medications that I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li>While I do enjoy the charcoal sponge, I like the original (plain) variety much better.</li>
            <li>The hype is real!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin wicked soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>When you first start scrubbing in circles</li>
            <li>but after about 30-45 seconds when you feel your skin it is literally so soft and feels squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>started using this after a particularly disheartening breakout.&lt;br /&gt;After the first month, it seemed like my spots were lighter and that the baby-zits were shrinking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some Sparta are very acne prone.</li>
            <li>I also have redness and very bumpy skin on my cheeks.</li>

            <li>it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing much</li>
            <li>but I really like this product</li>
            <li>The sponge&#x27;s properties are really a 3star...</li>
            <li>(so GENTLE</li>
            <li>After pictures.&lt;br /&gt;After three months, my skin is much closer to what I look like before</li>
            <li>the acne.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge will remain a staple because it is foolproof, gentle on the skin, and not battery</li>
            <li>I clean the sponge after EACH use with soap, run it under warm water and keep on squeezing until little to no suds are left.</li>
            <li>Better than expected!</li>
            <li>Either way, It&#x27;s soft and gentle and my face actually FEELS clean, like maybe for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>Mine is very sensitive in some spots, and others not at all.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s an incredibly gentle exfoliator and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It can get very oily and also very dry and flakey.</li>

            <li> So glad that I got the opportunity to test out this product. I love it so much! Highly recommended ! :)</li>
            <li> Great sponge! I have super oily acne prone skin and this sponge has helped more than the countless acne medications that I have tried over the years. I wash my face with this and a mild cleanser twice per day and my acne is improving. It works great to gently exfoliate too! I&#x27;ll be buying this regularly!</li>
            <li> While I do enjoy the charcoal sponge, I like the original (plain) variety much better. The texture of the charcoal sponge isn&#x27;t as awesome and mystical as the original, and I feel like my face isn&#x27;t as smooth after washing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an incredibly gentle exfoliator and lasts a long time.  However, the other claims (increased skin clarity, anti-acne etc etc etc) are definitely overblown.  In about a month of use it&#x27;s done none of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it lasts forever, feels great, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges. After trying this one I have ordered several other ones.My skin feels so good after useing it.</li>
            <li> I have just about every skin type combined. Mine is very sensitive in some spots, and others not at all. Some Sparta are very acne prone. It can get very oily and also very dry and flakey. I also have redness and very bumpy skin on my cheeks. I use this sponge twice a day and notice that it doesn&#x27;t matter whether or not I use it with my cleanser. It balances my skin- it is neither dry nor greasy. My redness is calmed and my pores are cleaned. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy this sponge sooner! I absolutely love it and I plan on trying the different ones</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get the hype around these sponges.  It was fine, but nothing earth shattering.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin and didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My favorite Konjac sponge! It have a fantastic exfoliating texture. Works with all of my cleansers. Will continue to purchase for sure! The hype is real!</li>
            <li> This sponge is great for a very gentle exfoliation. I feel like it makes my skin feel firmer and smoother after use. However it does soak up a lot of soap and it&#x27;s hard to get out of afterwards. I also don&#x27;t know if the charcoal version does anything differ from the other versions.</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> I feel the difference every time I use this product. I wet the sponge and use it in circular motion all over my face, can do it with or without soap. Overall I really like it!</li>
            <li> Bought one of these for my daughter since she has acne.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> It is great! Just wish it was alittle bit bigger. 👍😀</li>
            <li> When I used it, it was good. Gentle cleansing and good for people with sensitive skin. Unfortunately it started to tear and crumble after a few uses. I don&#x27;t believe I was rough with it but do be aware that these are particularly fragile.</li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin wicked soft and smooth. I have noticed my T zone is clearing up and looking less greasy, though that could be a number of other changing factors in my skin as well (stopped eating sugar, bought better makeup etc). Either way, It&#x27;s soft and gentle and my face actually FEELS clean, like maybe for the first time ever. Gave a me a great confidence boost the first day I tried it. Great product.</li>
            <li> It got a very musty smell very quickly!!</li>
            <li> I really do like this product. It was a little different to sue this at first but it is an amazing face sponge</li>
            <li> I bought the Original one first, and then after it worked so well for my skin I decided to get another one! These sponges made the over all texture and quality of my skin SO AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I had a bad allergic reaction to a lotion and my face was extremely sensitive, itchy, and dry. I did not want to use my Clarisonic in fear of making my skin worse because the brush might be too rough on my inflammed skin. I decided to buy the sponge and within a week or two of using it, my skin got better. It gently exfoliates and leaves my skin smoother than before. I use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. I clean the sponge after EACH use with soap, run it under warm water and keep on squeezing until little to no suds are left. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the sponge getting moldy or smelly.</li>
            <li> So I bought this hoping it could replace my face wash in the morning because I find that washing my face twice a day dries out my skin. Ive had it for a week now and I&#x27;ve got to say it does a wonderful job. When you first start scrubbing in circles it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing much but after about 30-45 seconds when you feel your skin it is literally so soft and feels squeaky clean. I don&#x27;t use my face wash with my sponge and it works perfectly fine. I also don&#x27;t use it with makeup or anything since I use it in the morning but I really like this product and I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> The sponge&#x27;s properties are really a 3star...&lt;br /&gt;... or a 2star if you&#x27;re looking for an immediate &amp;#34;bad skin cure-all&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to minimize &amp;#34;T-Zone&amp;#34; zits? give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Want to economically and painlessly fade your blemishes? THIS IS IT. 4stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a (so GENTLE i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing anything) kind of exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;If you have the occasional zit but even-tone skin, you will not be wow&#x27;d by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have the occasional zit and I do not have even skin-tone.&lt;br /&gt;My brown skin has two years worth of spots on jaw and cheeks + yucky summer breakouts + monthly sprinkles of acne.&lt;br /&gt;In short: my face was a circus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the sponge twice a day, almost everyday, and never ever have to worry about it ripping my skin off.&lt;br /&gt;Being skeptical, I took up using the Pearl Powder, as well. So I was eventually/often using both sponges per face wash.&lt;br /&gt;THREE MONTHS LATER: My darkest blemishes are no longer eyesores; I don&#x27;t even get dark spots anymore, just brown spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this after a particularly disheartening breakout.&lt;br /&gt;After the first month, it seemed like my spots were lighter and that the baby-zits were shrinking.&lt;br /&gt;That progress was wiped out by the next month&#x27;s breakout. Hence, this sponge WILL NOT clear hormonal acne on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Natural Routine for hormonal acne.&lt;br /&gt;Use the sponge in combination with ...&lt;br /&gt; + SOAP: containing Dead Sea Salt AND Activated Charcoal&lt;br /&gt; + MILD CLAY: nightly (or weekly) face wash with French Green Clay&lt;br /&gt; + DRINK TEA: daily cup of Burdock Root, Dandelion Root, or Rooibos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results were positively unprecedented after adding each item to my routine. I should&#x27;ve did Before/After pictures.&lt;br /&gt;After three months, my skin is much closer to what I look like before the acne.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge will remain a staple because it is foolproof, gentle on the skin, and not battery-operated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;PRO TIP&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; Not the best idea to store sponge in bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; Sponge will deteriorate sooner with alcohol- and sulfate-based cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; Might want to keep sponge near the AC during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (4/15): I started using this sponge in August 2014. By November, my darkest spots were no longer eyesores. By January 2015, I was only using one sponge but my face looked photoshop&#x27;d compared to the remarkable bumps and spots I was sporting for two years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s March, now. I still have some barely-there &#x27;freckling&#x27; on my cheeks but I can live with that. Since tea-drinking, my acne has been significantly reduced, and if there are any spots to follow, it&#x27;s easy-come easy-go. I thank the sponge&#x27;s soft texture for smoothing out my skin-tone, and the tea for contributing to the healing process and calming down whatever was causing my skin to act up. I don&#x27;t use the sponge consistantly now, but I drink the tea everyday. If there has been any side-effects, it&#x27;s from the tea. Other than that *purging* phase, the tea has acted as a blood-thinner, and also caused my gently-exfoliated face to be sensitive (so I&#x27;ve bought some cute, cheap, velvet/fleece washcloths). Bottom line, I&#x27;m grateful to have found out such alternatives.eriorate sooner with alcohol- and sulfate-based cleansers. &#x3D; Might want to keep sponge near the AC during the summer.  ______________________________________________________________________________ EDIT (4/15): I started using this sponge in August 2014.
