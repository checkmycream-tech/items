            <li> This works as long as you don&#x27;t skip any days of application. I like this product also because it doesn&#x27;t mess up my polish( no acetone)</li>
            <li> it came with half of the product int he flask.</li>
            <li> This does not work at all. Used it for about 4 months and it showed no improvement. Just made the exposed nail bed dry and flakey. Looked awful.</li>
            <li> Great product it does the job</li>
            <li> I think this product is GREAT!  My husband had a fungus on two of his toes. We were told that this was because of the time he spends in the water surfing.  He applied Fung Off 2x a day for about 5 weeks. It&#x27;s gone!!!  Great deal! I think I only paid $8.00.</li>
            <li> I had a vertically split toe nail for years. This product came highly recommended &amp; worked. Took about 6 months to grow out.  Used 2-3 times daily &amp; kept nail trimmed. Removed pain associated with split. Will remove nail polish so use on clean, unpolished nail.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a traditional brand... i know it for a long time and i can say it really works!</li>
            <li> Hard to tell yet how we&#x27;ll it is working .</li>
            <li> This stuff seems like it could kill anything. : -)</li>
            <li> Product is as described.  Have been using for about a month.  I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement but it is going to take a while according to the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I had a bad pedicure and ended up with a bad nail.  I tried numerous products, including what my doctor recommended.  This has helped the best.  The nail is growing out and the new growth looks normal.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know if this is an inherited issue or if I contracted this fungus from the salon but it is so super embarrassing to have pretty feet and a yellow toe nail. Over several years I have tried so many different over the counter formulas and none of them worked or even helped. About 2 years ago my nail stylist suggested the product and it worked. It took about 6 months but my once completely yellow big toe nail was clear and pretty. The key is to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Caught a fungal infection at the salon. I only go to ones with disposable liners now. They service women with nasty fungus, its very contagious and causes irreparable, permanent damage to your nails. My pinky has never recovered, have to now put on acrylic. I&#x27;m very OCD and they should ban those kind of people. Cure your infection, then return, rather than subject others to your disease!. This product improved condition somewhat, but still hasn&#x27;t grown all the way out, so I can&#x27;t tell. The bottle is gone, yet lifting is still visible.</li>
            <li> This seems to work better than other products I have used. I think it is important to use it as directed - I tend to not use as often as directed and then the effects aren&#x27;t as good (naturally).</li>
            <li> Item does what it promises. Works well with acrylic nail users.Easy to use with brush included. Does what is promised.</li>
            <li> By the time the shipment reached me, all of the medicine had leaked out of the bottle rendering the purchase worthless to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before. I went to 5 different stores looking for this product. That includes Walmart and Target. I love this product. It works..</li>
