            <li>Smells great and does a super job of hydrating your skin</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the feel, love this lotion!</li>
            <li>If you like Hempz lotion or if you&#x27;re just looking for a new great lotion that works for an AMAZING PRICE with great delivery timing (two day shipping with prime), I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of the orginal.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love using this.  </li>
            <li>I still use it because I love it and it works into your hands.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have a car or the time to run from salon to salon looking for my favorite lotion, so I decided to try Amazon.</li>
            <li>the authentic one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews how this lotion helped so many people with their winter skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a better moisturizer period....</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I discovered it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the lotion it is all I use...</li>
            <li>Really love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>This Certainly Was Not The Original Lotion!!</li>
            <li>I am really picky about the kind of lotion I use, I need it to be moisturizing but not oily.</li>
            <li>With lower prices and--with my prime account-- free shipping, it was tempting.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments that my skin is so soft and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>The Hempz lotion scent is also amazing, it&#x27;s described as &amp;#34;floral and banana&amp;#34; and I would say its creamy and lightly floral with only a hint of banana.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft but the &#x27;Floral &amp; Banana&#x27; scent of the &#x27;original&#x27; is too strong for me; I much prefer the Hempz Herbal Moisturizer Age Defying scent of &#x27;Vanilla &amp; Musk&#x27; as it does not clash with my perfume.  </li>
            <li>Although I do use other lotion occasionally, Hemps is my favorite because of the moisturizing qualities &amp; the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the original lotion, and it&#x27;s a really light lotion compared to others that are heavy</li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written, but with a product that is as controversial as this one I felt it was necessary.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I  will definitely buy it  again.</li>
            <li>it smells pretty.</li>
            <li>looked around Amazon and read every reviews under different sellers to make sure I get</li>
            <li>Essentially, this is the best lotion ever if you&#x27;re looking for something versatile that hydrates skin without being thick or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Light enough to use day and night but still hydrating and nourishing enough to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>tried a small sample at Ulta, and fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and live in the Pacific Northwest where humidity is an issue.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion,  and it is hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old told me it smells like bananas.  </li>
            <li>I compared the new lotion with some that I had left over from my last bottle, and it is the exact same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That was my review for the product in general.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelming, it&#x27;s just sweet enough.</li>

            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know why I was getting these rashes, and then slowly figured out that it was the lotion.</li>
            <li> probably because it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that has hemp seed as the only active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Sorry for all the capitals, I&#x27;m just really excited.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a tiny little bottle at a salon, and when it ran out, i knew i needed a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll probably just buy the small tiny size from Ulta..</li>
            <li> When looking for this Hempz lotion, I found several Amazon vendors who were receiving complaints because their lotion wasn&#x27;t  actually Hempz brand, people complained that it was knock off.</li>
            <li> there is absolutely no other lotion is thick, creamy and soothing as hempz....</li>
            <li> It helps keep my hair from getting frizzy without being weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li> though, I think the fragrance might be too harsh?</li>
            <li> The rash stays on for few days even if I stop using the lotion.</li>
            <li> In the past I received this as a gift and now I continue to purchase for myself and others.</li>
            <li> they charged me a little over 5.00 to ship it:(</li>
            <li> I was hesitant in purchasing this product because I am obsessed with Hempz products.</li>
            <li> Talk about false advertising!</li>
            <li> , It Smelled Awful Like Banana Lotion.</li>

            <li> This lotion is what a lot of the local spas use.  It&#x27;s so moisturizing...and I love the smell of the orginal.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion with a great price.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells good.  Makes your skin soft. Great price.  Also bought for a gift</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great!</li>
            <li> I love using this.  My 5 year old told me it smells like bananas.  I have to agree.  I still use it because I love it and it works into your hands. Its not greasy.  It was delayed in shipping because of the snow and not the sellers fault. I still got it in the time they said.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> A longtime favorite..love this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic!!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I  will definitely buy it  again.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written, but with a product that is as controversial as this one I felt it was necessary. When looking for this Hempz lotion, I found several Amazon vendors who were receiving complaints because their lotion wasn&#x27;t  actually Hempz brand, people complained that it was knock off.

It&#x27;s not overwhelming, it&#x27;s just sweet enough. Essentially, this is the best lotion ever if you&#x27;re looking for something versatile that hydrates skin without being thick or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was my review for the product in general. I have purchased this lotion from salons all around California for years, but now I&#x27;m a college student and I don&#x27;t have a car or the time to run from salon to salon looking for my favorite lotion, so I decided to try Amazon. With lower prices and--with my prime account-- free shipping, it was tempting. Despite all the stigma, I bought the lotion from Amazing Innovation. I have to tell you THIS IS THE ACTUAL PRODUCT. This is the same lotion as the Hempz I purchased from a salon for $25. I compared the new lotion with some that I had left over from my last bottle, and it is the exact same. Same bottle, same ingredients, same scent, same lotion. THIS IS NOT A KNOCK OFF. If you like Hempz lotion or if you&#x27;re just looking for a new great lotion that works for an AMAZING PRICE with great delivery timing (two day shipping with prime), I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. Sorry for all the capitals, I&#x27;m just really excited. Buy this product from Amazing Innovations!</li>

            <li> love this stuff!!  use it all the time.  it smells pretty.</li>
            <li> looked around Amazon and read every reviews under different sellers to make sure I get the authentic one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a small sample at Ulta, and fell in love with the scent. It smelled so amazing!&lt;br /&gt;And I read a lot of reviews how this lotion helped so many people with their winter skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;For me though, I think the fragrance might be too harsh? I get rash every time I put it on. At first I didn&#x27;t know why I was getting these rashes, and then slowly figured out that it was the lotion. The rash stays on for few days even if I stop using the lotion. Now I just use it on my hands for the scent. Next time, I&#x27;ll probably just buy the small tiny size from Ulta..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a better moisturizer period....it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the original lotion, and it&#x27;s a really light lotion compared to others that are heavy</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have been using Hempz lotion for years.  Although I do use other lotion occasionally, Hemps is my favorite because of the moisturizing qualities &amp; the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I just received this and the bottle that i got is totally different from the actual bottle. Its in a different language and the font of the letters are different. It doesn&#x27;t Seems like this is a knock off. I want my money back.</li>
            <li> there is absolutely no other lotion is thick, creamy and soothing as hempz....probably because it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that has hemp seed as the only active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Best lotion that money can buy. And it smells like bubblegum!</li>
            <li> the lotion is great, yes.  However, the image shown for this product has two bottles of lotion.  I was shipped only one.  Talk about false advertising!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I had purchased a tiny little bottle at a salon, and when it ran out, i knew i needed a bigger bottle. This stuff feels good on my skin, and smells good without being overpowering. I have naturally curly hair and live in the Pacific Northwest where humidity is an issue. When i get out of the shower, i put this on my hands then run my hands through my hair. It helps keep my hair from getting frizzy without being weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li> This Certainly Was Not The Original Lotion!!, It Smelled Awful Like Banana Lotion. Yuck!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!</li>

            <li> Great price, smells amazing, my gf loves it</li>

            <li> I love the price! Extremely happy that I received it before the delivery date!</li>
            <li> Always a great purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I ordered this lotion, thinking that I was getting two bottles for this price. I got only one. However, when I contacted the vendor about the picture showing 2 bottles for the price, they actually sent me another bottle, which I have just received. Excellent customer service, however the picture is misleading.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I love it! Best lotion I&#x27;ve even bought</li>
