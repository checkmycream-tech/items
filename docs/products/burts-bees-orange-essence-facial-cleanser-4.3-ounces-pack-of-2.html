            <li>I also have rosacea and extremely fair skin, so I can say for those fair maidens out there -</li>
            <li>this is good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutly adore beauty items that smell as good as they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>was because I was looking for something that is not toxic and actually GOOD to use on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a while and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product and now they have ruined it.  </li>
            <li>I have really good luck with this.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve realized that this is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I read on some rosacea forums that folks had good luck with Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence</li>
            <li>Good combination.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I returned it, I had hoped for an excellent product with a sweet orange smell, instead it made me gag.</li>
            <li>So I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees Rose Water Toner which is also really awesome to clean up the residue.</li>
            <li>The smell is delicious if you like the smell of fresh oranges.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love this face wash!</li>
            <li>but for skin that is more on the oily side, this wasn&#x27;t a pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has done amazing things for my skin.</li>
            <li>What it does have is an amazing orange scent.</li>
            <li>And the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>If you know much about skin care, you also know how wonderful olive oil is (for ALL skin types) and has been used for centuries as a \\&quot;beauty secret\\</li>
            <li>I decided to give it another try because I really liked the smell</li>
            <li>I massage it on, per the directions, using my hands, and then wipe/rinse with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li>This kind of leads to a feeling of a moisturized face...</li>
            <li>However, I massaged it over my face and neck and then rinsed with warm water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective-</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this item was the incredible smell.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it awesome to take off makeup</li>
            <li>Smells great but the natural type of great instead of chemically perfumed.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m not in love with this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely stunned by the results, my skin loved it!</li>
            <li>Cleans without drying, smells wonderful, and I get complimented on my skin all the time which is nothing short of amazing at my age, lemme tell ya.</li>
            <li>clean and smell good.</li>
            <li>Smells good, seems to keep my face clean.</li>
            <li>My skin glows after using it and it made my skin very smooth</li>
            <li>I love the scent, it is very refreshing and after rubbing it in with my fingertips and then wiping off with a clean, damp face-cloth</li>
            <li>This is very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Works best in combination with a weekly deep pore scrub exfoliation.</li>
            <li>like I have, you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li>With most product lines I cleanse &amp; moisturize and end up with a burning, stinging face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found my cleanser, will use the rest of my life, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>Simply the best face soap I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m transitioning away from synthetic ingredients and the &#x27;sodium lauryls/laureths&#x27; in so many products.</li>
            <li>I find that when I use this product, most days I don&#x27;t even have to mosturize.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I can say the more</li>
            <li>the more I like it,</li>
            <li>The ingredients are safe.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this great cleanser.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot better products to use to wash your face than this.</li>
            <li>and it did not work with my skin at all as I had a more oily skin at that time.  </li>
            <li>And I love the texture also.</li>
            <li>after not being able to find Giovanni&#x27;s Dtox System in the store once the samples I had ran out.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 2 years now and still love it.</li>
            <li>They do not foam like you expect facial cleaners to, but if you read the ingredients, they&#x27;re awesome.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it was doing anything.</li>
            <li>It seems that most people who don&#x27;t like this cleanser ignored that it isn&#x27;t for oily skin.</li>
            <li>This smell is so sweet and strong, in a good way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and it smell wonderful, like fresh oranges!</li>
            <li>And so far so good!</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell, moisturizes well, cleans well.</li>
            <li>It helped mix the product and oil making a nice consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People saying it doesn&#x27;t lather: This is true.</li>
            <li>I love the orange scent and the way it washes away easily.</li>
            <li>It has a bright, invigorating orange scent and is gently exfoliating, sort of like a sugar scrub (though I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any sugar in it).</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I was looking to change up my cleanser specifically to a more natural cleanser, because I have fairly oily skin yet combination skin, and wanted to try something that wasn&#x27;t specifically an acne product.</li>
            <li>But when i am used to use it, it really feel good.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and I love the ingredient list - short and full of good stuff for the skin (and pronounceable!).</li>
            <li>AFTER I use the toner (burts bees rose toner) everything feels fresh and clean, without feeling stripped.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the BB Orange Essence cleanser for a couple of years and had excellent results - fewer blemishes, less dryness and tightness after cleansing, and easy makeup removal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Today, everything seems fine and dandy.  </li>
            <li>It has a light scent and washes away easily.  </li>
            <li>It is very important since most people with oily skin try to use something that will give them that squeaky clean feeling, except it only triggers skin to produce EVEN more oil!</li>
            <li>With the added soft grit of the baking soda it was the most amazing exfoliation I&#x27;ve ever gotten at home.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling gentle, yet effective facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s left my face looking great.</li>
            <li>My face was smoothe and pimple free; I never had to use powder or foundation.  </li>
            <li>I hope I&#x27;ll always be able to find this cleanser here, as I rarely see it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>even if they said oil free or wont clog pores which they did anyway.</li>
            <li>It has a light earthy orange scent.</li>
            <li>My skin loves this product now that I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s (caucasion, light complexion)and</li>
            <li>I will state that it worked well for my complexion and keeping me pimple free</li>
            <li>This face wash leaves my skin so smooth</li>
            <li>Ordered because I heard that Burt&#x27;s Bees products were gluten free.</li>
            <li>This cleaner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>They have such great products</li>
            <li>It is 100% natural and makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li>The product is natural, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of removing makeup and it doesn&#x27;t improve complexion.  </li>
            <li>and I liked how it made my face feel even though the product was making it breakout at the time, and probably this product was more suitable for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little overwhelming at first, but it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin and, after washing with this cleanser, my skin feels even more oily than it did to begin with.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>I first purchased it from Walgreens, so I could return it if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li>The waxy-ness leaves my face feeling soft &amp; the orange leaves me feeling so fresh &amp; so clean!!!</li>
            <li>Orange oil, for those who don&#x27;t know, is a powerful natural cleaner that is high in antioxidants, vitamin c, and is very good for antiaging, inflammation, and acne issues.</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s 100% natural in a time when most beauty products are riddled with chemicals and preservatives.</li>
            <li>As an adult who has had rebellious skin for decades, this cleaner and Burt&#x27;s facial wipes have provided me with a flawless skin.  </li>
            <li>it gets my face clean even without having used any sort of makeup remover beforehand.</li>
            <li>My skin is left with a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>It seems to get my face clean and it was rated well by EWG.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love the smell &amp; doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of its natural oils.  </li>
            <li>note is that it does not give your skin that squeaky clean feel.  </li>
            <li>After I clean this cleanser, i still fell oil on my face.</li>
            <li>and I love it just as much.</li>
            <li>This product is like most Burt&#x27;s Bees: so gentle.</li>
            <li>The over all texture of my skin is softer and smoother, more light-reflective and has a really dewy feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly like an oily clear orange gel that smells divine, I was worried at first because of the amount of oils that this product contains</li>
            <li>For a cleanser appealing to the \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; crowd, I was surprised by how strong this product smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one for the strong Orange smell; however, I don&#x27;t care, as long as my face gets better!</li>
            <li>This cleanser does seem to help the mild breakouts as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is why I purchase Burt&#x27;s Bees orange facial cleanser because it is SLS free and does a spectacular job of cleaning my skin without causing irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li>It is suitable for dry skin, but if you have oil skin, you better choose another one.</li>
            <li>So long Burts Bees for good.</li>
            <li>The only time I experienced \\&quot;the heat\\&quot; as described by others is when my palms are already warm from hot water and then went to apply it on dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have a fair to medium completion that runs on the slightly dry side.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I have tried every cleanser on the shelf and all they did was irritate my skin more.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, fast delivery, accurate description of what the produce is, this is not the first time I purchased this product and it will not be the last.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used this cleanser, though, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean away like a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees products do.  </li>
            <li>The oils in it leave skin lightly moisturized, although if you have very oily skin, you may find it greasy.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love Burts Bees, but I find that several of their facial cleansers, including the orange essence don&#x27;t work for my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li>, it felt like it absorbed into my skin rather than cleansing and then being rinsed away.</li>
            <li>It makes my 67 year old face feel very clean, but not over-dry.</li>
            <li>Finally, I found that the best way to use this is to wet my face first,</li>
            <li>I thought the problem was that my chapstick wasn&#x27;t doing it&#x27;s thing right.</li>
            <li>my skin feels very clean, but not tight.  </li>
            <li>Great on sensitive skin and dry skin, even with breakouts.</li>
            <li>Fortunately [as it turns out] one day I ran out of my normal cleanser and tried this product.  </li>
            <li>orange oil really seems to make my skin more glowy and softer than my old cleanser did.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s super gentle and helped my skin heal itself.e in the health of your lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle and helped my skin heal itself.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with it now is that it does leave a slight orangey residue over time and my husband keeps eating it! :D</li>
            <li>Since I began use my skin has seemed so much softer, more fresh, and healthier in general.</li>
            <li>It did take me a little bit to \\&quot;trust\\&quot; its doing its job but so far so good!</li>
            <li>Why would they mess with a good thing?  </li>
            <li>I find this cleanser very gentle</li>
            <li>I also feel this product is very reasonably priced.     </li>
            <li>It is essential for me that my personal and home products are ethically produced and relatively free of potentially harmful chemicals, so this is perfect all-around.</li>
            <li>I love this product, if you&#x27;ve have issues finding a facial cleanser</li>
            <li>Most of them have cleared up but the breakouts left marks and discoloration on the side of my face.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not the cheapest product on the market, for me it&#x27;s worthwhile, and you really only need a dime-sized amount.</li>
            <li>Granted, the directions state to rinse with a wash cloth, but I tried without one first thinking that all the hair products rinse so well</li>
            <li>I love Burts Bees products for myself and for my children and this product is no different!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Burts Bees!</li>
            <li>And sure enough it worked wonders and cleared up my face!</li>
            <li>Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li>Since the first day I tried this I have used nothing else.  </li>
            <li>the time I first used it</li>
            <li>Most facial cleansers contain sodium laureth sulfate which is basically a foaming agent found in many personal care products, and if it is accidentally ingested, it can&#x27;t be metabolized by the liver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People saying it&#x27;s oily: I shook my bottle up because when I first squeezed it a lot of oil came out.</li>
            <li>Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees!  </li>
            <li>it has no foam, SO at first, i dont adapt it.</li>
            <li>It made my face feel hot while I was washing my face.  </li>
            <li>So if you are just trying it for the first time, give it a week or two to notice the difference.  </li>
            <li>on the first usage my face will feel taut, itch, and my lips will peel.</li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t make my face red.</li>
            <li>I just gently rub some on my dry face and wipe it off with a warm, moist, cloth.</li>
            <li>but with a caveat - perhaps it&#x27;s best with the toner (especially with some types of water, like my hard well</li>
            <li>You want to clean off makeup and dirt, not your natural barrier.</li>
            <li>This cleanser leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt incredibly soft, clean, and supple.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it is a natural product, 100% natural.</li>
            <li>I found this product again and was surprised at how quickly it helps so much!  </li>
            <li>It reeks of sickly sweet oranges, with some even less appealing odors underneath (perhaps the reason for the over-powering orange?).</li>
            <li>First of all I have to say I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin does not feel taut and dry after washing, and I have been using the Mama Bee body oil (very lightly) as a night-time moisturizer.     </li>
            <li>This along with taking Renew FishSmart for my Omega-3 oils has pretty much taken my acne away.  </li>
            <li>I switched to mostly all natural products a few years ago, and this is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>My usual experience has been that when I try something that&#x27;s manufactured and supposed to be good for sensitive skin (CB shampoo, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Baby Mild, etc.)</li>
            <li>It cleans deeply, removing even my stubborn mascara and eyeliner easily.</li>
            <li>I certainly did.</li>
            <li>and my skin is now soft, smooth and clear of breakouts!  </li>
            <li>I think that balance, clean but not stripping my face bare, is what makes this stuff work</li>
            <li>One thing I struggle with is the oily residue that you are left with on your skin, but i gently wipe it with a flannel and its fine.</li>
            <li>The first night I used this cleanser, I had no cracking lips after like a month of suffering, and my lips returned to normal the very.</li>
            <li>The first night I used this cleanser, I had no cracking lips after like a month of suffering, and my lips returned to normal the very.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t claim to improve complexion or remove makeup, so it&#x27;s not falsely advertised.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry face and leaves the skin fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>(Yes, I use the whole line now).</li>
            <li>So, I think it&#x27;s more a mental thing at the moment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t put that much on</li>
            <li>which makes it very eco-friendy in terms of packaging.  </li>
            <li>I am more comfortable with what&#x27;s in this product than what was in the Murad things I&#x27;d been using, and so far it has not broken me out, nor has it dried my skin.</li>
            <li>you think its going to do, it cleanses gently, leaves moisture</li>
            <li>I only buy cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>So much easier to purchase online.</li>
            <li>if you have problem skin at all, it&#x27;s best to wash less, not more.</li>
            <li>Maybe would be better for someone with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>Lately I have realized I don&#x27;t want to be throwing so many chemicals onto my face (sulfates to name one) just to get it clean.</li>
            <li>This is better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Prior to trying this product I was using Clean and</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and smooth and hydrated when I use this regularly</li>
            <li>This is so much better for your skin than constant stripping with soap of the natural protective oils and ph barrier that keep skin soft and protected.</li>
            <li>After using the Clean &amp; Clear, I HAD to use the moisturizer because the Clean and Clear made my face so dry, however, I never stopped using it because it didn&#x27;t make my face break out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now down to 1 a month at most.  </li>
            <li>But if you are looking for those qualities, then I do not recommend this particular Burts Bees product.</li>
            <li>Does not lather, no big deal, neither did my other nice cleanser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT, when I use my toner I do see more a little makeup on my cloth.</li>
            <li>so I decided I needed something a little more enriching.</li>
            <li>So gentle, and leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It is really think damn near like honey.</li>
            <li>typically most cleansers leave my skin dried out and parched, but not with this Burt&#x27;s Bees cleanser.</li>
            <li>Another plus for it is that to make a scrub with it is not difficult: add a pinch of natural sugar to my palm then dab a dime size portion of cleanser next to it, gently swirl together, and then gently wash my face.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser and have used it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li>they way most harsh cleansers do.  </li>
            <li>Was looking for an alternative to the more harsh, chemical laden products which I felt were drying my skin and causing me to break out.</li>
            <li>what we&#x27;re normally used to.  </li>
            <li>I used to get a few pimples a week, not bad, but worth addressing.  </li>
            <li>Then I realized the squeaky clean from other facial cleansers I was used to was actually the soap stripping my skin &amp; leaving it more prone to dryness.  </li>
            <li>I mean seriously, do I really need my cleanser to be bright blue</li>
            <li>Upon the first usage of this cleanser, I massaged it into my dry skin and rinsed with warm water, I was pleasantly surprised that none of the typical reactions occurred</li>
            <li>my face really appreciates the extra moisture and the fine lines around my eyes are not nearly as noticeable as with harsher cleansers.</li>
            <li>While this is recommended for normal to dry skin types, if you use this and have super oily or combination skin skin try a toner with it on your problem areas.</li>
            <li>My new find and obsession.</li>
            <li>Hesitant to try a new face wash because of my acne prone skin, I ordered this Burt&#x27;s Bees based on the reviews, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t use harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that Burts Bees facial cleanser is a natural product and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin after use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been slowly adding to my Burt&#x27;s Bees skin care collection since I started using the Radiance Day Lotion &amp; the Citrus Facial Scrub (and loved them both).</li>
            <li>I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN AND CAN NOT USE ALOT OF OVER THE COUNTER PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>and my skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in another moment of being tired of researching for natural facial cleansers that were inexpensive, easy to obtain, did not contain added fragrance, coconut-derived surfactants, and after many repeat failures using DIY recipes.  </li>
            <li>First, I did not buy this on Amazon, I bought locally after reading the reviews here.</li>
            <li>It does the exact opposite</li>
            <li>Stores are usually sold out and this pricing is better.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The first second you uncap this cleanser</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin, oily skin, or normal skin.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and normally would not choose such a very emollient oil cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Most other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried leave my skin really dry.  </li>
            <li>Clear Morning Burst Face Wash along with Olay Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The pad was clear.</li>
            <li>Old ingredients: Vegetable glycerin, olive oil, orange oil, oat flour, lanolin, oat oil, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, vegetable oil &amp; beta carotene, tocopherol (vitamin E), quillaja extract, rosemary leaf oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I wanted to switch to natural products</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t claim to be a deep pore cleanser, but I swear my face looks and feels so much cleaner now than it ever has in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is oily but just a tiny drop washes your whole face.  </li>
            <li>[it&#x27;s &#x27;our&#x27; cleanser now] this one tube can last a whole year.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my pores any smaller, but it does make them look really clearer.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural product that removes makeup and also improves complexion.  </li>
            <li>My skin tends to be sensitive and prone to drying as well as to break outs.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;You absolutely need to use a wash cloth or facial pad like it says in the directions.</li>
            <li>You also need to rinse it off completely or else it leaves a film on your skin.</li>
            <li>I just smooth this over my face with a few drops of water and wipe it off with a damp cotton ball.  </li>
            <li>It is the only cleanser I have tried that I have really stuck with over time.  </li>
            <li>However this will get you one step closer to soft skin</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to the smell of fragrances, but the orange essence has not created an issue for me.</li>
            <li>It has natural antiseptic qualities.</li>
            <li>This has not caused any issues anywhere and leaves my skin touchably soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would have worked as well for me when I was younger with much oilier skin, but now that I&#x27;m nearing 40</li>
            <li>Every once in a while, when I am traveling or run out, I have experimented with another cleanser for a few days, but am always so glad to get back to this product.  </li>
            <li>I started using the new formula normally, just subbing it into my regular routine.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using this product, but I can say  I recommend it on the basis of the fact that it didn&#x27;t dry my sensitive skin out and it does the job of cleansing without burning.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this works well for people who have pretty dry skin, but not for skin like mine.  </li>
            <li>In addition to being a fantastic product, Orange Essence Facial Cleanser is all-natural and contains none of the mystery ingredients found in other cleansers.</li>
            <li>In fact, this cleanser is so natural that when a little bit of it got into my mouth, it tasted sweet like orange juice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Being in my mid 20&#x27;s, I have tried every kind of cleanser under the sun from the low end to the super expensive including just about every drug store verity.</li>
            <li>It is also a lot of hassle if you want to clean your skin because if you don&#x27;t use a washcloth you will have messy goop on your face you feel like you can&#x27;t get</li>
            <li>It gives me clean skin without that dried out feeling I used to get with astringents or acne medicine.  </li>
            <li>People often think I&#x27;m ten years younger than I really am!  </li>
            <li>I can wash my face right before going somewhere and not be embarrassed due to redness.</li>
            <li>Most washes make my face turn a little red for five to ten minutes, but this one doesn&#x27;t give me that problem!</li>
            <li>In the past my skin felt smooth and balanced.</li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a new cleanser and want to try something completely different, give this product a try!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pregnant and sometimes get a few breakouts from the hormones.</li>
            <li>In any case, the smell alone is enough to warrant steering clear!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use anything else, and especially nothing that isn&#x27;t all natural again!</li>
            <li>so I do spend some time cleaning my face but not to much or it might loose</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on the reviews, I bought this cleanser for my significant other who has dry skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After being a long time user of the orange facial cleanser, I noticed a new feeling after buying the new bottle:</li>
            <li>gently massage/swipe the cleanser over my face, use a wet baby washcloth to wipe it off and then rinse.</li>
            <li>Oh, and this cleanser is actually 100% Natural, not the 98.8% listed on the product description.</li>
            <li>my skin is a tad more dry and delicate as I age.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the product tube that I bought says for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal, but leans towards the dry side at times.</li>
            <li>My skin is a combination of normal &amp; dry.</li>
            <li>This will not dry your face out at all.</li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to the first couple of times</li>
            <li>I used to have really dry skin esp during the winter months, but this has helped tremendously to keep my skin softer and much less flaky from dry</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to use it because of my sensitive, oily-prone, dehydrated, mature skin and previous redness (sign of irritation) from using other products with EOs and the conflicting information about using citrus oils on sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> It looks and feels like orange toothpaste, but it smells really pleasant.</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant orange fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> Smells good</li>
            <li> I also have rosacea and extremely fair skin, so I can say for those fair maidens out there -</li>
            <li> this is good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutly adore beauty items that smell as good as they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good cleanser.</li>
            <li> was because I was looking for something that is not toxic and actually GOOD to use on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product and now they have ruined it.  </li>
            <li> I have really good luck with this.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve realized that this is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I read on some rosacea forums that folks had good luck with Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence</li>
            <li> Good combination.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I returned it, I had hoped for an excellent product with a sweet orange smell, instead it made me gag.</li>
            <li> So I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees Rose Water Toner which is also really awesome to clean up the residue.</li>
            <li> The smell is delicious if you like the smell of fresh oranges.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash!</li>
            <li> but for skin that is more on the oily side, this wasn&#x27;t a pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has done amazing things for my skin.</li>
            <li> What it does have is an amazing orange scent.</li>
            <li> And the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> If you know much about skin care, you also know how wonderful olive oil is (for ALL skin types) and has been used for centuries as a \\&quot;beauty secret\\</li>
            <li> I decided to give it another try because I really liked the smell</li>
            <li> I massage it on, per the directions, using my hands, and then wipe/rinse with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li> This kind of leads to a feeling of a moisturized face...</li>
            <li> However, I massaged it over my face and neck and then rinsed with warm water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective-</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this item was the incredible smell.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it awesome to take off makeup</li>
            <li> Smells great but the natural type of great instead of chemically perfumed.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not in love with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely stunned by the results, my skin loved it!</li>
            <li> Cleans without drying, smells wonderful, and I get complimented on my skin all the time which is nothing short of amazing at my age, lemme tell ya.</li>
            <li> clean and smell good.</li>
            <li> Smells good, seems to keep my face clean.</li>
            <li> My skin glows after using it and it made my skin very smooth</li>
            <li> I love the scent, it is very refreshing and after rubbing it in with my fingertips and then wiping off with a clean, damp face-cloth</li>
            <li> This is very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works best in combination with a weekly deep pore scrub exfoliation.</li>
            <li> like I have, you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li> With most product lines I cleanse &amp; moisturize and end up with a burning, stinging face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found my cleanser, will use the rest of my life, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Simply the best face soap I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m transitioning away from synthetic ingredients and the &#x27;sodium lauryls/laureths&#x27; in so many products.</li>
            <li> I find that when I use this product, most days I don&#x27;t even have to mosturize.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I can say the more</li>
            <li> the more I like it,</li>
            <li> The ingredients are safe.  </li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this great cleanser.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot better products to use to wash your face than this.</li>
            <li> and it did not work with my skin at all as I had a more oily skin at that time.  </li>
            <li> And I love the texture also.</li>
            <li> after not being able to find Giovanni&#x27;s Dtox System in the store once the samples I had ran out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 years now and still love it.</li>
            <li> They do not foam like you expect facial cleaners to, but if you read the ingredients, they&#x27;re awesome.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it was doing anything.</li>
            <li> It seems that most people who don&#x27;t like this cleanser ignored that it isn&#x27;t for oily skin.</li>
            <li> This smell is so sweet and strong, in a good way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and it smell wonderful, like fresh oranges!</li>
            <li> And so far so good!</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell, moisturizes well, cleans well.</li>
            <li> It helped mix the product and oil making a nice consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People saying it doesn&#x27;t lather: This is true.</li>
            <li> I love the orange scent and the way it washes away easily.</li>
            <li> It has a bright, invigorating orange scent and is gently exfoliating, sort of like a sugar scrub (though I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any sugar in it).</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I was looking to change up my cleanser specifically to a more natural cleanser, because I have fairly oily skin yet combination skin, and wanted to try something that wasn&#x27;t specifically an acne product.</li>
            <li> But when i am used to use it, it really feel good.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and I love the ingredient list - short and full of good stuff for the skin (and pronounceable!).</li>
            <li> AFTER I use the toner (burts bees rose toner) everything feels fresh and clean, without feeling stripped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the BB Orange Essence cleanser for a couple of years and had excellent results - fewer blemishes, less dryness and tightness after cleansing, and easy makeup removal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Today, everything seems fine and dandy.  </li>
            <li> It has a light scent and washes away easily.  </li>
            <li> It is very important since most people with oily skin try to use something that will give them that squeaky clean feeling, except it only triggers skin to produce EVEN more oil!</li>
            <li> With the added soft grit of the baking soda it was the most amazing exfoliation I&#x27;ve ever gotten at home.  </li>
            <li> Great smelling gentle, yet effective facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s left my face looking great.</li>
            <li> My face was smoothe and pimple free; I never had to use powder or foundation.  </li>
            <li> I hope I&#x27;ll always be able to find this cleanser here, as I rarely see it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> even if they said oil free or wont clog pores which they did anyway.</li>
            <li> It has a light earthy orange scent.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this product now that I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s (caucasion, light complexion)and</li>
            <li> I will state that it worked well for my complexion and keeping me pimple free</li>
            <li> This face wash leaves my skin so smooth</li>
            <li> Ordered because I heard that Burt&#x27;s Bees products were gluten free.</li>
            <li> This cleaner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> They have such great products</li>
            <li> It is 100% natural and makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> The product is natural, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of removing makeup and it doesn&#x27;t improve complexion.  </li>
            <li> and I liked how it made my face feel even though the product was making it breakout at the time, and probably this product was more suitable for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little overwhelming at first, but it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin and, after washing with this cleanser, my skin feels even more oily than it did to begin with.  </li>
            <li> So far I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> I first purchased it from Walgreens, so I could return it if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li> The waxy-ness leaves my face feeling soft &amp; the orange leaves me feeling so fresh &amp; so clean!!!</li>
            <li> Orange oil, for those who don&#x27;t know, is a powerful natural cleaner that is high in antioxidants, vitamin c, and is very good for antiaging, inflammation, and acne issues.</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s 100% natural in a time when most beauty products are riddled with chemicals and preservatives.</li>
            <li> As an adult who has had rebellious skin for decades, this cleaner and Burt&#x27;s facial wipes have provided me with a flawless skin.  </li>
            <li> it gets my face clean even without having used any sort of makeup remover beforehand.</li>
            <li> My skin is left with a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> It seems to get my face clean and it was rated well by EWG.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love the smell &amp; doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of its natural oils.  </li>
            <li> note is that it does not give your skin that squeaky clean feel.  </li>
            <li> After I clean this cleanser, i still fell oil on my face.</li>
            <li> and I love it just as much.</li>
            <li> This product is like most Burt&#x27;s Bees: so gentle.</li>
            <li> The over all texture of my skin is softer and smoother, more light-reflective and has a really dewy feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly like an oily clear orange gel that smells divine, I was worried at first because of the amount of oils that this product contains</li>
            <li> For a cleanser appealing to the \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; crowd, I was surprised by how strong this product smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one for the strong Orange smell; however, I don&#x27;t care, as long as my face gets better!</li>
            <li> This cleanser does seem to help the mild breakouts as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is why I purchase Burt&#x27;s Bees orange facial cleanser because it is SLS free and does a spectacular job of cleaning my skin without causing irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li> It is suitable for dry skin, but if you have oil skin, you better choose another one.</li>
            <li> So long Burts Bees for good.</li>
            <li> The only time I experienced \\&quot;the heat\\&quot; as described by others is when my palms are already warm from hot water and then went to apply it on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have a fair to medium completion that runs on the slightly dry side.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I have tried every cleanser on the shelf and all they did was irritate my skin more.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, fast delivery, accurate description of what the produce is, this is not the first time I purchased this product and it will not be the last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used this cleanser, though, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean away like a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees products do.  </li>
            <li> The oils in it leave skin lightly moisturized, although if you have very oily skin, you may find it greasy.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Burts Bees, but I find that several of their facial cleansers, including the orange essence don&#x27;t work for my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li> , it felt like it absorbed into my skin rather than cleansing and then being rinsed away.</li>
            <li> It makes my 67 year old face feel very clean, but not over-dry.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found that the best way to use this is to wet my face first,</li>
            <li> I thought the problem was that my chapstick wasn&#x27;t doing it&#x27;s thing right.</li>
            <li> my skin feels very clean, but not tight.  </li>
            <li> Great on sensitive skin and dry skin, even with breakouts.</li>
            <li> Fortunately [as it turns out] one day I ran out of my normal cleanser and tried this product.  </li>
            <li> orange oil really seems to make my skin more glowy and softer than my old cleanser did.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s super gentle and helped my skin heal itself.e in the health of your lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle and helped my skin heal itself.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it now is that it does leave a slight orangey residue over time and my husband keeps eating it! :D</li>
            <li> Since I began use my skin has seemed so much softer, more fresh, and healthier in general.</li>
            <li> It did take me a little bit to \\&quot;trust\\&quot; its doing its job but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Why would they mess with a good thing?  </li>
            <li> I find this cleanser very gentle</li>
            <li> I also feel this product is very reasonably priced.     </li>
            <li> It is essential for me that my personal and home products are ethically produced and relatively free of potentially harmful chemicals, so this is perfect all-around.</li>
            <li> I love this product, if you&#x27;ve have issues finding a facial cleanser</li>
            <li> Most of them have cleared up but the breakouts left marks and discoloration on the side of my face.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not the cheapest product on the market, for me it&#x27;s worthwhile, and you really only need a dime-sized amount.</li>
            <li> Granted, the directions state to rinse with a wash cloth, but I tried without one first thinking that all the hair products rinse so well</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees products for myself and for my children and this product is no different!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Burts Bees!</li>
            <li> And sure enough it worked wonders and cleared up my face!</li>
            <li> Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> Since the first day I tried this I have used nothing else.  </li>
            <li> the time I first used it</li>
            <li> Most facial cleansers contain sodium laureth sulfate which is basically a foaming agent found in many personal care products, and if it is accidentally ingested, it can&#x27;t be metabolized by the liver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People saying it&#x27;s oily: I shook my bottle up because when I first squeezed it a lot of oil came out.</li>
            <li> Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees!  </li>
            <li> it has no foam, SO at first, i dont adapt it.</li>
            <li> It made my face feel hot while I was washing my face.  </li>
            <li> So if you are just trying it for the first time, give it a week or two to notice the difference.  </li>
            <li> on the first usage my face will feel taut, itch, and my lips will peel.</li>
            <li> I also love that it doesn&#x27;t make my face red.</li>
            <li> I just gently rub some on my dry face and wipe it off with a warm, moist, cloth.</li>
            <li> but with a caveat - perhaps it&#x27;s best with the toner (especially with some types of water, like my hard well</li>
            <li> You want to clean off makeup and dirt, not your natural barrier.</li>
            <li> This cleanser leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt incredibly soft, clean, and supple.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that it is a natural product, 100% natural.</li>
            <li> I found this product again and was surprised at how quickly it helps so much!  </li>
            <li> It reeks of sickly sweet oranges, with some even less appealing odors underneath (perhaps the reason for the over-powering orange?).</li>
            <li> First of all I have to say I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin does not feel taut and dry after washing, and I have been using the Mama Bee body oil (very lightly) as a night-time moisturizer.     </li>
            <li> This along with taking Renew FishSmart for my Omega-3 oils has pretty much taken my acne away.  </li>
            <li> I switched to mostly all natural products a few years ago, and this is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> My usual experience has been that when I try something that&#x27;s manufactured and supposed to be good for sensitive skin (CB shampoo, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Baby Mild, etc.)</li>
            <li> It cleans deeply, removing even my stubborn mascara and eyeliner easily.</li>
            <li> I certainly did.</li>
            <li> and my skin is now soft, smooth and clear of breakouts!  </li>
            <li> I think that balance, clean but not stripping my face bare, is what makes this stuff work</li>
            <li> One thing I struggle with is the oily residue that you are left with on your skin, but i gently wipe it with a flannel and its fine.</li>
            <li> The first night I used this cleanser, I had no cracking lips after like a month of suffering, and my lips returned to normal the very.</li>
            <li> The first night I used this cleanser, I had no cracking lips after like a month of suffering, and my lips returned to normal the very.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t claim to improve complexion or remove makeup, so it&#x27;s not falsely advertised.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry face and leaves the skin fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> (Yes, I use the whole line now).</li>
            <li> So, I think it&#x27;s more a mental thing at the moment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t put that much on</li>
            <li> which makes it very eco-friendy in terms of packaging.  </li>
            <li> I am more comfortable with what&#x27;s in this product than what was in the Murad things I&#x27;d been using, and so far it has not broken me out, nor has it dried my skin.</li>
            <li> you think its going to do, it cleanses gently, leaves moisture</li>
            <li> I only buy cruelty free products.</li>
            <li> So much easier to purchase online.</li>
            <li> if you have problem skin at all, it&#x27;s best to wash less, not more.</li>
            <li> Maybe would be better for someone with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Lately I have realized I don&#x27;t want to be throwing so many chemicals onto my face (sulfates to name one) just to get it clean.</li>
            <li> This is better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Prior to trying this product I was using Clean and</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and smooth and hydrated when I use this regularly</li>
            <li> This is so much better for your skin than constant stripping with soap of the natural protective oils and ph barrier that keep skin soft and protected.</li>
            <li> After using the Clean &amp; Clear, I HAD to use the moisturizer because the Clean and Clear made my face so dry, however, I never stopped using it because it didn&#x27;t make my face break out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now down to 1 a month at most.  </li>
            <li> But if you are looking for those qualities, then I do not recommend this particular Burts Bees product.</li>
            <li> Does not lather, no big deal, neither did my other nice cleanser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT, when I use my toner I do see more a little makeup on my cloth.</li>
            <li> so I decided I needed something a little more enriching.</li>
            <li> So gentle, and leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It is really think damn near like honey.</li>
            <li> typically most cleansers leave my skin dried out and parched, but not with this Burt&#x27;s Bees cleanser.</li>
            <li> Another plus for it is that to make a scrub with it is not difficult: add a pinch of natural sugar to my palm then dab a dime size portion of cleanser next to it, gently swirl together, and then gently wash my face.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and have used it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> they way most harsh cleansers do.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for an alternative to the more harsh, chemical laden products which I felt were drying my skin and causing me to break out.</li>
            <li> what we&#x27;re normally used to.  </li>
            <li> I used to get a few pimples a week, not bad, but worth addressing.  </li>
            <li> Then I realized the squeaky clean from other facial cleansers I was used to was actually the soap stripping my skin &amp; leaving it more prone to dryness.  </li>
            <li> I mean seriously, do I really need my cleanser to be bright blue</li>
            <li> Upon the first usage of this cleanser, I massaged it into my dry skin and rinsed with warm water, I was pleasantly surprised that none of the typical reactions occurred</li>
            <li> my face really appreciates the extra moisture and the fine lines around my eyes are not nearly as noticeable as with harsher cleansers.</li>
            <li> While this is recommended for normal to dry skin types, if you use this and have super oily or combination skin skin try a toner with it on your problem areas.</li>
            <li> My new find and obsession.</li>
            <li> Hesitant to try a new face wash because of my acne prone skin, I ordered this Burt&#x27;s Bees based on the reviews, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t use harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that Burts Bees facial cleanser is a natural product and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin after use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly adding to my Burt&#x27;s Bees skin care collection since I started using the Radiance Day Lotion &amp; the Citrus Facial Scrub (and loved them both).</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN AND CAN NOT USE ALOT OF OVER THE COUNTER PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> and my skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in another moment of being tired of researching for natural facial cleansers that were inexpensive, easy to obtain, did not contain added fragrance, coconut-derived surfactants, and after many repeat failures using DIY recipes.  </li>
            <li> First, I did not buy this on Amazon, I bought locally after reading the reviews here.</li>
            <li> It does the exact opposite</li>
            <li> Stores are usually sold out and this pricing is better.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The first second you uncap this cleanser</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin, oily skin, or normal skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and normally would not choose such a very emollient oil cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Most other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried leave my skin really dry.  </li>
            <li> Clear Morning Burst Face Wash along with Olay Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The pad was clear.</li>
            <li> Old ingredients: Vegetable glycerin, olive oil, orange oil, oat flour, lanolin, oat oil, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, vegetable oil &amp; beta carotene, tocopherol (vitamin E), quillaja extract, rosemary leaf oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch to natural products</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t claim to be a deep pore cleanser, but I swear my face looks and feels so much cleaner now than it ever has in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is oily but just a tiny drop washes your whole face.  </li>
            <li> [it&#x27;s &#x27;our&#x27; cleanser now] this one tube can last a whole year.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my pores any smaller, but it does make them look really clearer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural product that removes makeup and also improves complexion.  </li>
            <li> My skin tends to be sensitive and prone to drying as well as to break outs.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;You absolutely need to use a wash cloth or facial pad like it says in the directions.</li>
            <li> You also need to rinse it off completely or else it leaves a film on your skin.</li>
            <li> I just smooth this over my face with a few drops of water and wipe it off with a damp cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> It is the only cleanser I have tried that I have really stuck with over time.  </li>
            <li> However this will get you one step closer to soft skin</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to the smell of fragrances, but the orange essence has not created an issue for me.</li>
            <li> It has natural antiseptic qualities.</li>
            <li> This has not caused any issues anywhere and leaves my skin touchably soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would have worked as well for me when I was younger with much oilier skin, but now that I&#x27;m nearing 40</li>
            <li> Every once in a while, when I am traveling or run out, I have experimented with another cleanser for a few days, but am always so glad to get back to this product.  </li>
            <li> I started using the new formula normally, just subbing it into my regular routine.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using this product, but I can say  I recommend it on the basis of the fact that it didn&#x27;t dry my sensitive skin out and it does the job of cleansing without burning.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this works well for people who have pretty dry skin, but not for skin like mine.  </li>
            <li> In addition to being a fantastic product, Orange Essence Facial Cleanser is all-natural and contains none of the mystery ingredients found in other cleansers.</li>
            <li> In fact, this cleanser is so natural that when a little bit of it got into my mouth, it tasted sweet like orange juice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Being in my mid 20&#x27;s, I have tried every kind of cleanser under the sun from the low end to the super expensive including just about every drug store verity.</li>
            <li> It is also a lot of hassle if you want to clean your skin because if you don&#x27;t use a washcloth you will have messy goop on your face you feel like you can&#x27;t get</li>
            <li> It gives me clean skin without that dried out feeling I used to get with astringents or acne medicine.  </li>
            <li> People often think I&#x27;m ten years younger than I really am!  </li>
            <li> I can wash my face right before going somewhere and not be embarrassed due to redness.</li>
            <li> Most washes make my face turn a little red for five to ten minutes, but this one doesn&#x27;t give me that problem!</li>
            <li> In the past my skin felt smooth and balanced.</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a new cleanser and want to try something completely different, give this product a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pregnant and sometimes get a few breakouts from the hormones.</li>
            <li> In any case, the smell alone is enough to warrant steering clear!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else, and especially nothing that isn&#x27;t all natural again!</li>
            <li> so I do spend some time cleaning my face but not to much or it might loose</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on the reviews, I bought this cleanser for my significant other who has dry skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After being a long time user of the orange facial cleanser, I noticed a new feeling after buying the new bottle:</li>
            <li> gently massage/swipe the cleanser over my face, use a wet baby washcloth to wipe it off and then rinse.</li>
            <li> Oh, and this cleanser is actually 100% Natural, not the 98.8% listed on the product description.</li>
            <li> my skin is a tad more dry and delicate as I age.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the product tube that I bought says for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is normal, but leans towards the dry side at times.</li>
            <li> My skin is a combination of normal &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> This will not dry your face out at all.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to the first couple of times</li>
            <li> I used to have really dry skin esp during the winter months, but this has helped tremendously to keep my skin softer and much less flaky from dry</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use it because of my sensitive, oily-prone, dehydrated, mature skin and previous redness (sign of irritation) from using other products with EOs and the conflicting information about using citrus oils on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have the previous container (orange one that&#x27;s shown in the picture) and then get a new tube that is now white, check the ingredients and you will see there are now about double the ingredients!</li>
            <li> I usually wake up with somewhat oily skin, and my skin looks much improved after using it.</li>
            <li> I would use other cleansers and my skin would sting intensely after using them for up to half an hour.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I&#x27;ve not been using it that long!</li>
            <li> and the combination left my skin flaky dry and breaking out.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to get into the organic stuff because regular over the counter cleansers were making my face dry out</li>
            <li> My skin used to be oily but for the last year I have been dealing with perioral dermatitis (a rosacea subtype) that has been leaving my skin dry, tight, flaking, and incredibly sensitive.</li>
            <li> It defenitely feels different from other facial cleasners.</li>
            <li> My skin is truly combination and a little sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I remember using this product in my late teens and it totally broke my face out because my skin was really oily/sensitive at the time and some problem areas, not really acne.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it would work on normal to oily or oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and find that I don&#x27;t usually need a moisturizer with this cleanser</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this cleanser and see how it works in the long term.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Burt&#x27;s Bees product line for a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my thin skin, smells fresh after a long day, and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Now I couldn&#x27;t go back to any other cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Hope they keep making this product for a long time!</li>
            <li> the gets dry</li>
            <li> On days you skip makeup, but want a refresher, just splash your face with water and towel dry, and/or put some toner on if you have some.</li>
            <li> I rinsed, then I rinsed again, then I grabbed a dry cloth and rubbed off what I could still feel on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> So it seems to balance out the dry effects on the combo skin.</li>
            <li> My skin changed from Oily to Dry</li>
            <li> I used this years ago when I was struggling with dry flaky skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> I am no longer experiencing dry skin patches or oiliness.</li>
            <li> My skin sort of glowed, didn&#x27;t look greasy, but it wasn&#x27;t dry either.</li>
            <li> For the price, limited number of ingredients, ease of obtaining, and the results - this an HG for me.</li>
            <li> At this point, the only down side is the reside feel.  </li>
            <li> No redness or irritation, didn&#x27;t leave it too dry, and even reduced my acne outbreaks!</li>
            <li> It has parabens and other ingredients that are not natural.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this cleanser, I haven&#x27;t had a single day like that!</li>
            <li> I was using it actually did create a little bit of a lather and was easier to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did find that if I massaged the product on the wet washcloth or face pad</li>
            <li> Should be applied on wet skin.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no tightness after using this.</li>
            <li> The less you wash, the less your face will try to fight back trying to produce oil to &#x27;resurface&#x27; itself over and over.</li>
            <li> The addition of preservatives and the restructuring of the formula, coupled with the discontinuation of their Tomato Complexion Soap (so sad, switched to the orange cleaner after), leaves me with no choice but to search for a new facial cleanser and company.</li>
            <li> During summer, I think I will prefer a lighter cleanser, but at least for winter or dry climates this is now my go-to facial cleansing</li>
            <li> Your skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Product thoughts aside - like other reviewers have mentioned...</li>
            <li> I got the trial size to begin with and will move on to some other Burts Bees items to try for my face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting or burn like other products that I&#x27;ve used, and it is 100%</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to toss this stuff, and I&#x27;m quite disappointed as it was a favorite.</li>
            <li> For those of us used to the stripped feeling of other cleansers, the idea of using a cleanser with oils in it may seem counterproductive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very good at removing makeup and cleaning your face at the same time.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice less oily, less irritated, and less dry skin.</li>
            <li> See how the cotton turns dark because of all the dirt that&#x27;s still on your skin.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about the olive oil that&#x27;s in this face wash, but it has not broken me out AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s maybe 10% down,</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this cleanser is that it feels a little greasy and doesn&#x27;t lather like I&#x27;m accustomed to from other cleansers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It might not work for some people as it might create some zits/ breakouts due to heavy moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I had started a retin-A regime (1x a week) and was using a typical cleanser</li>
            <li> This cleanser is odd.</li>
            <li> I think the slight oily residue helps protect the skin, and it makes your skin have a dewy appearance.</li>
            <li> I live in a cold climate and find that my face has dry patches during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> A tight and flush feeling.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling tight and itchy after use.</li>
            <li> but it does not clean my face.</li>
            <li> I just sprinkle in a little baking soda.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little greasy when applied.</li>
            <li> This can be a little messy, if you&#x27;re not in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Try it for a few days, then rub your face using a cotton &amp; toner.</li>
            <li> I replaced the harsh cleanser with this</li>
            <li> I just use it because I bought it and don&#x27;t want it to go to waste.</li>
            <li> After a few days, the skin under my eyes swelled and began to peel.  </li>
            <li> This product does the opposite: it moisturizes and cleans without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> On occasion when I don&#x27;t use this for a few days, I notice the difference</li>
            <li> My skin still feels a little oily like it usually does in the summertime.  </li>
            <li> or they are now mislabeling the new bottles with the wrong ingredients!  </li>
            <li> I use this with my clarisonic everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what my skin is reacting to, but it&#x27;s causing me to develop peeling and swelling around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then started using my usual moisturizer (ROC) again, and had no reaction.  </li>
            <li> The alkalinity of the baking soda is itself tonifying but the slight residue of the orange oil works well in the cold, dry climate of winter where I am.</li>
            <li> I AM FINDING THAT IT IS HARD TO FIND NOW IN THE STORE(S)&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it doesn&#x27;t lather it is hard to wash off your face.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I had horrible cracks and chaps on my upper lip I had gotten from wind/cold exposure that just wasn&#x27;t going away with my everyday facial routine...</li>
            <li> However this leaves a thick film on my skin</li>
            <li> Lather doesn&#x27;t mean squat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes, if I forgot to moisturize in the morning, my skin would be tight, dry and painful within an hour.</li>
            <li> Even worse, when I called the company to inquire, the Customer Service Rep was rude and said they didn&#x27;t change the product.  </li>
            <li> It takes the bad stuff off and leaves essentials behind, unlike the typical harsh cleansers.  </li>
            <li> but I cannot take the thick, honey substance that does not lather - at all!</li>
            <li> Just because it doesn&#x27;t foam doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not doing its job!</li>
            <li> and I feel like it&#x27;s worse than</li>
            <li> 1 tube lasts approximately 2 mos using a (garbanzo) pea-size amount.</li>
            <li> (though I use one in the cold weather).</li>
            <li> I usually end up in a vicious cycle of cleansing and mosturizing.  </li>
            <li> It would have been bad news if I hadn&#x27;t checked the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have oily to combination skin with extremely bad blackhead areas along the outer sides of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> So painful.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using this product again :(</li>
            <li> This product contained oats :(  </li>
            <li> I hate how it does not lather.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a bad product, but it was nothing compared to this!</li>
            <li> (very bad).  </li>
            <li> ; it was the worst smelling stuff in a tube.</li>
            <li> Using this product was the worst decision I ever made.  </li>
            <li> Sodium benzoate is terrible for you and a lot of people have problems with Soy.  </li>
            <li> Nothing nasty in it at all.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Old ingredients: Vegetable glycerin, olive oil, orange oil, oat flour, lanolin, oat oil, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, vegetable oil &amp; beta carotene, tocopherol (vitamin E), quillaja extract, rosemary leaf oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New ingredients: Glycerin, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, limonene, avena sativa (oat) kernal flour, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) oil, avena sativa (oat) kernel oil, lanolin, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, quillaja saponaria (quillaja) bark extract, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, beta-carotene, tocopherol, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, glycine soja (soybean) oil, canola oil, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being a long time user of the orange facial cleanser, I noticed a new feeling after buying the new bottle: A tight and flush feeling. In the past my skin felt smooth and balanced. No longer. The addition of preservatives and the restructuring of the formula, coupled with the discontinuation of their Tomato Complexion Soap (so sad, switched to the orange cleaner after), leaves me with no choice but to search for a new facial cleanser and company. So long Burts Bees for good.</li>
            <li> I bought this locally and oh my goodness; it was the worst smelling stuff in a tube. Like orange oiled burnt rubber. I returned it, I had hoped for an excellent product with a sweet orange smell, instead it made me gag.</li>
            <li> Great smelling gentle, yet effective facial cleanser. Does not leave skin \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot;, instead it preserves moisture. Great on sensitive skin and dry skin, even with breakouts. Not sure how well it would work on normal to oily or oily skin. Works best in combination with a weekly deep pore scrub exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I love this product, if you&#x27;ve have issues finding a facial cleanser like I have, you&#x27;ll love this product. Trust me! I have sensitive skin the gets dry a flaky but it&#x27;s left my face looking great. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling tight and itchy after use. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Smells good but it does not clean my face. Try it for a few days, then rub your face using a cotton &amp; toner. See how the cotton turns dark because of all the dirt that&#x27;s still on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly adding to my Burt&#x27;s Bees skin care collection since I started using the Radiance Day Lotion &amp; the Citrus Facial Scrub (and loved them both). So recently I added this product, the Facial Cleanser - and I love it just as much. First of all I have to say I have super sensitive skin. With most product lines I cleanse &amp; moisturize and end up with a burning, stinging face. This product is like most Burt&#x27;s Bees: so gentle. I also have rosacea and extremely fair skin, so I can say for those fair maidens out there - this is good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s 100% natural in a time when most beauty products are riddled with chemicals and preservatives. In fact, this cleanser is so natural that when a little bit of it got into my mouth, it tasted sweet like orange juice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The olive oil in it makes your skin feel delightful after use - typically most cleansers leave my skin dried out and parched, but not with this Burt&#x27;s Bees cleanser. If you know much about skin care, you also know how wonderful olive oil is (for ALL skin types) and has been used for centuries as a \\&quot;beauty secret\\&quot; so I just adore Burt&#x27;s Bees for including it in this cleanser. Since I began use my skin has seemed so much softer, more fresh, and healthier in general. I rarely get any zits or pimples, except lately I&#x27;ve been pregnant and sometimes get a few breakouts from the hormones. This cleanser does seem to help the mild breakouts as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found my cleanser, will use the rest of my life, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Simply the best face soap I have ever used.  Love the scent.  So gentle, and leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed.  Needs to be a \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; item!</li>
            <li> For someone who has reacted adversely even to Clinique cleansers, this Burts Bees cleanser is a godsend. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my thin skin, smells fresh after a long day, and lasts forever. I just apply and wipe off with moist cotton pads. Sometimes I even use it in the bath for a pick-me-up.   It is essential for me that my personal and home products are ethically produced and relatively free of potentially harmful chemicals, so this is perfect all-around.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN AND CAN NOT USE ALOT OF OVER THE COUNTER PRODUCTS.  I AM FINDING THAT IT IS HARD TO FIND NOW IN THE STORE(S)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GLAD YOU HAVE IT HERE AT AMAZON!!  THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch to natural products so I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees.  I&#x27;m 24 and  haven&#x27;t had pimples since middle school, but when  I started using this a month ago my face popped up with pimples.  Most of them have cleared up but the breakouts left marks and discoloration on the side of my face.  My face was smoothe and pimple free; I never had to use powder or foundation.  Now, I have to use concealer and pray these marks fade away.  Using this product was the worst decision I ever made.  To BB&#x27;s credit, when I called up to complain on their customer service line, I was refunded the amount.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my face. I switched to mostly all natural products a few years ago, and this is one of my favorite products. It has a bright, invigorating orange scent and is gently exfoliating, sort of like a sugar scrub (though I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any sugar in it). The oils in it leave skin lightly moisturized, although if you have very oily skin, you may find it greasy. I have normal skin and find that I don&#x27;t usually need a moisturizer with this cleanser (though I use one in the cold weather). While it&#x27;s not the cheapest product on the market, for me it&#x27;s worthwhile, and you really only need a dime-sized amount. As a final caveat, it does not foam, so if you simply must have foam in your cleanser, this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> I also found that this cleanser doesn&#x27;t get all my makeup off. Don&#x27;t let that scare you off though. I used to use Paula&#x27;s choice cleansers which worked great. But I&#x27;m transitioning away from synthetic ingredients and the &#x27;sodium lauryls/laureths&#x27; in so many products. I find this cleanser very gentle and I love the ingredient list - short and full of good stuff for the skin (and pronounceable!). I believe it&#x27;s won an award for it&#x27;s purity and effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have well water, but I find that when I&#x27;m drying my face it has a sensation of being coated, like I&#x27;m rubbing off honey. Not a big deal, and I know it&#x27;s because of the oils so I can get over that, knowing it&#x27;s moisturizing. Does not lather, no big deal, neither did my other nice cleanser. Lather doesn&#x27;t mean squat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, when I use my toner I do see more a little makeup on my cloth. AFTER I use the toner (burts bees rose toner) everything feels fresh and clean, without feeling stripped. So yes, I recommend it - but with a caveat - perhaps it&#x27;s best with the toner (especially with some types of water, like my hard well water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product thoughts aside - like other reviewers have mentioned...if you have problem skin at all, it&#x27;s best to wash less, not more. On days you skip makeup, but want a refresher, just splash your face with water and towel dry, and/or put some toner on if you have some. This is so much better for your skin than constant stripping with soap of the natural protective oils and ph barrier that keep skin soft and protected. You want to clean off makeup and dirt, not your natural barrier. The less you wash, the less your face will try to fight back trying to produce oil to &#x27;resurface&#x27; itself over and over. You&#x27;ll notice less oily, less irritated, and less dry skin. I certainly did.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this item was the incredible smell.  Yummy!  I absolutly adore beauty items that smell as good as they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this cleanser, though, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean away like a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees products do.  Granted, the directions state to rinse with a wash cloth, but I tried without one first thinking that all the hair products rinse so well, why wouldn&#x27;t this?  I rinsed, then I rinsed again, then I grabbed a dry cloth and rubbed off what I could still feel on my face.  I then went to my toner and mask like usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, everything seems fine and dandy.  My skin still feels a little oily like it usually does in the summertime.  I will continue to use this cleanser and see how it works in the long term.  At this point, the only down side is the reside feel.  If it clears up my skin and has no SLS, then I may come back and change my 4 star to a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees products for myself and for my children and this product is no different!  I live in a cold climate and find that my face has dry patches during the winter months.  I usually end up in a vicious cycle of cleansing and mosturizing.  I find that when I use this product, most days I don&#x27;t even have to mosturize.  It has a light scent and washes away easily.  Great product.  Thanks Burts Bees!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Burts Bees, but I find that several of their facial cleansers, including the orange essence don&#x27;t work for my skin.  I have pretty oily skin and, after washing with this cleanser, my skin feels even more oily than it did to begin with.  Perhaps this works well for people who have pretty dry skin, but not for skin like mine.  Good thing I got the trial size to begin with and will move on to some other Burts Bees items to try for my face.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I was looking to change up my cleanser specifically to a more natural cleanser, because I have fairly oily skin yet combination skin, and wanted to try something that wasn&#x27;t specifically an acne product. However this leaves a thick film on my skin and I feel like it&#x27;s worse than before I washed it. It feels cooling, but it feels like it sticks in my pores and clogs them. Maybe would be better for someone with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. Amazon&#x27;s price is best unless you happen to find these on sale. I have dry skin and this has always been the best for me. Also, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I have tried every cleanser on the shelf and all they did was irritate my skin more. Finally I tried going totally organic, no chemicals whatsoever, and tried this cleanser. I was absolutely stunned by the results, my skin loved it! No redness or irritation, didn&#x27;t leave it too dry, and even reduced my acne outbreaks! I tell everyone to go organic and to try this Burts Bees product and all their products.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has rescued my skin!  I had started a retin-A regime (1x a week) and was using a typical cleanser and the combination left my skin flaky dry and breaking out.  I replaced the harsh cleanser with this and my skin is now soft, smooth and clear of breakouts!  I was leery because it doesn&#x27;t lather well and it feels greasy but it took my makeup off, so it&#x27;s doing the job.  I had to get used to not feeling \\&quot;scrubbed\\&quot; afterward.  It takes the bad stuff off and leaves essentials behind, unlike the typical harsh cleansers.  I would not recommend for oily skin.  In fact, the product tube that I bought says for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It is 100% natural and makes my skin feel so good. It defenitely feels different from other facial cleasners.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, fast delivery, accurate description of what the produce is, this is not the first time I purchased this product and it will not be the last.</li>
            <li> I hope I&#x27;ll always be able to find this cleanser here, as I rarely see it in stores anymore. It makes my 67 year old face feel very clean, but not over-dry.</li>
            <li> Only thing that will take my waterproof mascara!  Can&#x27;t live without it awesome to take off makeup then I use another cleaner afterward to remove greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I use this with my clarisonic everyday! The waxy-ness leaves my face feeling soft &amp; the orange leaves me feeling so fresh &amp; so clean!!!</li>
            <li> This is better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve used. It smells wonderful, and does the job without a lot of effort. It doesn&#x27;t sting or burn like other products that I&#x27;ve used, and it is 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only a 4 star? To be honest, I&#x27;m not in love with this cleanser. I like it, and it&#x27;s a very good cleanser. Another plus for it is that to make a scrub with it is not difficult: add a pinch of natural sugar to my palm then dab a dime size portion of cleanser next to it, gently swirl together, and then gently wash my face. What I don&#x27;t like about this cleanser is that it feels a little greasy and doesn&#x27;t lather like I&#x27;m accustomed to from other cleansers I&#x27;ve used. I can say the more I use this cleanser the more I like it, and my face doesn&#x27;t feel oily after I rinse my face thoroughly, use my Burt&#x27;s Bees toner, and then apply my Burt&#x27;s Bees Ageless moisturizer. (Yes, I use the whole line now). So, I think it&#x27;s more a mental thing at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t claim to be a deep pore cleanser, but I swear my face looks and feels so much cleaner now than it ever has in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also say that I&#x27;m hooked to Burt&#x27;s Bees now! I won&#x27;t use anything else, and especially nothing that isn&#x27;t all natural again!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and have used it for a few years now.  My skin is truly combination and a little sensitive.  Most other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried leave my skin really dry.  This cleanser leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  The smell is delicious if you like the smell of fresh oranges.  The ingredients are safe.  I love this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I remember using this product in my late teens and it totally broke my face out because my skin was really oily/sensitive at the time and some problem areas, not really acne. So I decided to get into the organic stuff because regular over the counter cleansers were making my face dry out even if they said oil free or wont clog pores which they did anyway. And I needed something that wasn&#x27;t foamy or lathery. So after a few years of going through cleansers and getting really discouraged, some how I went back to this cleanser in my mid 20&#x27;s. I decided to give it another try because I really liked the smell and I liked how it made my face feel even though the product was making it breakout at the time, and probably this product was more suitable for dry skin. Well oh well.  And sure enough it worked wonders and cleared up my face! And this product is inexpensive! And now I&#x27;m almost 30 and I still use it. So my face type now is sensitive/combination. The only problem I have with it now is that it does leave a slight orangey residue over time and my husband keeps eating it! :D And I don&#x27;t put that much on so I do spend some time cleaning my face but not to much or it might loose it&#x27;s softness. So I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees Rose Water Toner which is also really awesome to clean up the residue. :) And so far so good! I hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  As an adult who has had rebellious skin for decades, this cleaner and Burt&#x27;s facial wipes have provided me with a flawless skin.  I can purchase this cleanser at my grocery store, but since I am a &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; member, I order on-line and then I know I have a supply on-hand.</li>
            <li> This is a non-traditional cleanser.  It is an emollient based cleanser and has lots of citrus in it for exfolliation.  I use it on my acne prone skin and find that it actually helps prevent breakouts, rather than contributes to them.  I love the scent, it is very refreshing and after rubbing it in with my fingertips and then wiping off with a clean, damp face-cloth my skin feels very clean, but not tight.  It takes away the dirt and excess oil without stripping the skin of every molecule of oil they way most harsh cleansers do.  My skin feels very soft and smooth and hydrated when I use this regularly and I find I don&#x27;t really need a moisturizer when I use it everyday.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this great cleanser.  Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Orange Essence Facial cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the reviews, I bought this cleanser for my significant other who has dry skin.  I have combination skin and normally would not choose such a very emollient oil cleanser.  Fortunately [as it turns out] one day I ran out of my normal cleanser and tried this product.  It is oily but just a tiny drop washes your whole face.  I&#x27;m guessing at the rate we&#x27;re going [it&#x27;s &#x27;our&#x27; cleanser now] this one tube can last a whole year. We&#x27;ve had it a couple of months and it&#x27;s maybe 10% down, if that...  which makes it very eco-friendy in terms of packaging.  To cut the oiliness I just sprinkle in a little baking soda.  Since the first day I tried this I have used nothing else.  Let me tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The orange oil really seems to make my skin more glowy and softer than my old cleanser did.  With the added soft grit of the baking soda it was the most amazing exfoliation I&#x27;ve ever gotten at home.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my pores any smaller, but it does make them look really clearer. The over all texture of my skin is softer and smoother, more light-reflective and has a really dewy feel. The alkalinity of the baking soda is itself tonifying but the slight residue of the orange oil works well in the cold, dry climate of winter where I am. So it seems to balance out the dry effects on the combo skin. During summer, I think I will prefer a lighter cleanser, but at least for winter or dry climates this is now my go-to facial cleansing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time I first used it I had horrible cracks and chaps on my upper lip I had gotten from wind/cold exposure that just wasn&#x27;t going away with my everyday facial routine... partly because my lips kept cracking at night while I slept.  I thought the problem was that my chapstick wasn&#x27;t doing it&#x27;s thing right. I was getting up in the middle of the night to put on chapstick, and still - I would wake up with split lips. So painful.  I didn&#x27;t know a cleanser could make such a big difference in the health of your lips. The first night I used this cleanser, I had no cracking lips after like a month of suffering, and my lips returned to normal the very. next. day.  For that I am sold on this product.  I would recommend it to anyone, with the caveat that if your skin in combo or oil - sprinkle some baking soda in when you use it, and it doubles as an exfoliater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super gentle and helped my skin heal itself.e in the health of your lips.

            <li> I love the fact that Burts Bees facial cleanser is a natural product and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin after use.  However, it didn&#x27;t meet all of my expectations.  I was looking for a natural product that removes makeup and also improves complexion.  The product is natural, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of removing makeup and it doesn&#x27;t improve complexion.  The product doesn&#x27;t claim to improve complexion or remove makeup, so it&#x27;s not falsely advertised.  But if you are looking for those qualities, then I do not recommend this particular Burts Bees product.</li>
            <li> First, I did not buy this on Amazon, I bought locally after reading the reviews here. Did not want to wait for shipping.     I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 days and I am pleased so far. Was looking for an alternative to the more harsh, chemical laden products which I felt were drying my skin and causing me to break out. My skin tends to be sensitive and prone to drying as well as to break outs.     This cleanser is odd. It looks and feels like orange toothpaste, but it smells really pleasant. I massage it on, per the directions, using my hands, and then wipe/rinse with a warm washcloth. And, even though it doesn&#x27;t lather at *all* it gets my face clean even without having used any sort of makeup remover beforehand. My skin does not feel taut and dry after washing, and I have been using the Mama Bee body oil (very lightly) as a night-time moisturizer.     So far I have been very pleased. I am more comfortable with what&#x27;s in this product than what was in the Murad things I&#x27;d been using, and so far it has not broken me out, nor has it dried my skin. I also feel this product is very reasonably priced.     The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I&#x27;ve not been using it that long!</li>
            <li> I have been using Cliniques 3 step system for around 5 years until now! My skin changed from Oily to Dry so I decided I needed something a little more enriching. This product does the trick! It&#x27;s surprisingly like an oily clear orange gel that smells divine, I was worried at first because of the amount of oils that this product contains but you don&#x27;t break out! It does the exact opposite you think its going to do, it cleanses gently, leaves moisture (but i still have to moisturise afterwards) and I believe the orange scent wakes me up. One thing I struggle with is the oily residue that you are left with on your skin, but i gently wipe it with a flannel and its fine. I think the slight oily residue helps protect the skin, and it makes your skin have a dewy appearance. I have seen a radical difference in my skin - i&#x27;m now going to buy the burts bees moisturiser. You may need to do a weekly scrub with an exfoliant otherwise your pores may become clogged.  I definitely recommend to try this product out!</li>
            <li> Most facial cleansers contain sodium laureth sulfate which is basically a foaming agent found in many personal care products, and if it is accidentally ingested, it can&#x27;t be metabolized by the liver. Besides the only things in nature that are suppose to foam are dogs with rabies, water falls, and babbling  brooks.That is why I purchase Burt&#x27;s Bees orange facial cleanser because it is SLS free and does a spectacular job of cleaning my skin without causing irritation or dryness. I love the orange scent and the way it washes away easily. My skin is left with a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I only buy cruelty free products. I think it&#x27;s a good cleanser. My skin is normal, but leans towards the dry side at times. I also don&#x27;t have acne. It&#x27;s very easy to use and smells wonderful. It has a light earthy orange scent. I used a facial wash pad or washcloth with the cleanser. My skin glows after using it and it made my skin very smooth/soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You absolutely need to use a wash cloth or facial pad like it says in the directions. It&#x27;s not very good at removing makeup and cleaning your face at the same time. I started using it only in the morning or on the nights I didn&#x27;t use makeup. You also need to rinse it off completely or else it leaves a film on your skin. It is also a lot of hassle if you want to clean your skin because if you don&#x27;t use a washcloth you will have messy goop on your face you feel like you can&#x27;t get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People saying it&#x27;s oily: I shook my bottle up because when I first squeezed it a lot of oil came out. It helped mix the product and oil making a nice consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People saying it doesn&#x27;t lather: This is true. I did find that if I massaged the product on the wet washcloth or face pad I was using it actually did create a little bit of a lather and was easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it doesn&#x27;t lather it is hard to wash off your face. I just use it because I bought it and don&#x27;t want it to go to waste. There are a lot better products to use to wash your face than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the BB Orange Essence cleanser for a couple of years and had excellent results - fewer blemishes, less dryness and tightness after cleansing, and easy makeup removal.  However, I am going to have to discontinue use after the recent recipe change.  I&#x27;m not sure what my skin is reacting to, but it&#x27;s causing me to develop peeling and swelling around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to jump to conclusions about the product, so I attempted to give it as scientific of a go as I could.  I started using the new formula normally, just subbing it into my regular routine.  After a few days, the skin under my eyes swelled and began to peel.  I didn&#x27;t immediately decide it was the BB, instead I stopped using all product on my face (including makeup) for about a week.  The swelling went away.  I then started using my usual moisturizer (ROC) again, and had no reaction.  I wore makeup again and didn&#x27;t have any reaction.  Then I added the BB back into the routine and within two days my under-eye area was reacting again.  I&#x27;m going to have to toss this stuff, and I&#x27;m quite disappointed as it was a favorite.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this product now that I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s (caucasion, light complexion)and my skin is a tad more dry and delicate as I age.  I just smooth this over my face with a few drops of water and wipe it off with a damp cotton ball.  This along with taking Renew FishSmart for my Omega-3 oils has pretty much taken my acne away.  I will say I also tried this product in my mid-20&#x27;s and it did not work with my skin at all as I had a more oily skin at that time.  With some aging on my part it has been wonderful though and I can&#x27;t imagine not using it through the years to come.  People often think I&#x27;m ten years younger than I really am!  Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees!  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> My new find and obsession. It cleanses my oily (!) skin without drying it out. It is very important since most people with oily skin try to use something that will give them that squeaky clean feeling, except it only triggers skin to produce EVEN more oil! This product does the opposite: it moisturizes and cleans without irritating the skin. It&#x27;s all natural and it smell wonderful, like fresh oranges! Absolutely definitely a must!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It smells just like oranges.  Great way to cleanse my face!  And I love the texture also.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Cleans without drying, smells wonderful, and I get complimented on my skin all the time which is nothing short of amazing at my age, lemme tell ya. Hard to find in stores so I buy it up whenever I see it. Hope Burt &amp; his Bees keep making it :: crossing paws ::</li>
            <li> I had to stop using the creamy crack (ProActive)! It has parabens and other ingredients that are not natural. I bought Burt Bee&#x27;s Orange Essence - NEVER AGAIN...after not being able to find Giovanni&#x27;s Dtox System in the store once the samples I had ran out. I bought! I cannot wait until this product runs out. My skin is a combination of normal &amp; dry. I LOVE that it is a natural product, 100% natural. I hate how it does not lather. It is really think damn near like honey. I will state that it worked well for my complexion and keeping me pimple free but I cannot take the thick, honey substance that does not lather - at all! I assume this is because of all the oils that are in the ingredients. I won&#x27;t be using this product again :(</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.  Prior to trying this product I was using Clean and Clear Morning Burst Face Wash along with Olay Moisturizer.  After using the Clean &amp; Clear, I HAD to use the moisturizer because the Clean and Clear made my face so dry, however, I never stopped using it because it didn&#x27;t make my face break out (very bad).  I wanted to switch face washes was because I was looking for something that is not toxic and actually GOOD to use on your skin. Hesitant to try a new face wash because of my acne prone skin, I ordered this Burt&#x27;s Bees based on the reviews, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t use harmful ingredients.  I&#x27;m SO glad I did!!  I was really skeptical about the olive oil that&#x27;s in this face wash, but it has not broken me out AT ALL.  This face wash leaves my skin so smooth and I haven&#x27;t had to use any face lotion since using this face wash.  It may both some that it doesn&#x27;t lather/foam up, but from what I&#x27;ve read, the ingredients that cause foam are actually toxic, so the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago when I was struggling with dry flaky skin on my face.  A friend bought this as a gift and helped get my face back into shape.  I found this product again and was surprised at how quickly it helps so much!  I use this with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Carrot Nutritive Night Cream.  I&#x27;ve never been one for the strong Orange smell; however, I don&#x27;t care, as long as my face gets better!</li>
            <li> it has no foam, SO at first, i dont adapt it.But when i am used to use it, it really feel good. clean and smell good.</li>
            <li> So much easier to purchase online. Stores are usually sold out and this pricing is better. Shipment arrived on time</li>
            <li> Love this! Feels greasy but once you have used it your skin is not greasy at all. I have been using this for 2 years now and still love it. I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> For a cleanser appealing to the \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; crowd, I was surprised by how strong this product smells. It reeks of sickly sweet oranges, with some even less appealing odors underneath (perhaps the reason for the over-powering orange?). When I tried it out on my face (despite the smell!), it felt like it absorbed into my skin rather than cleansing and then being rinsed away. This kind of leads to a feeling of a moisturized face...but for skin that is more on the oily side, this wasn&#x27;t a pleasant feeling. In any case, the smell alone is enough to warrant steering clear!</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed above are no longer correct.  I have been using this product for a while and loved it.  I just ordered from Amazon and I immediately noticed the tube is now white instead of orange.  I thought \\&quot;no big deal\\&quot; until I looked at the ingredients and found they have added several, including soybean oil and sodium benzoate.  Sodium benzoate is terrible for you and a lot of people have problems with Soy.  I can&#x27;t tolerate either one.  they both make my skin red and itchy.  It would have been bad news if I hadn&#x27;t checked the ingredients.  Why would they mess with a good thing?  I loved this product and now they have ruined it.  Even worse, when I called the company to inquire, the Customer Service Rep was rude and said they didn&#x27;t change the product.  Well, they either changed the ingredients (which is the same thing as changing the product) or they are now mislabeling the new bottles with the wrong ingredients!  If you have the previous container (orange one that&#x27;s shown in the picture) and then get a new tube that is now white, check the ingredients and you will see there are now about double the ingredients!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t lather, but I don&#x27;t mind this.  It seems to get my face clean and it was rated well by EWG.  Very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Ordered because I heard that Burt&#x27;s Bees products were gluten free. This product contained oats :(  It made my face feel hot while I was washing my face.  And I didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using the orange essence facial cleanser from Burts Bees for about 10 years now.  It is the only cleanser I have tried that I have really stuck with over time.  Every once in a while, when I am traveling or run out, I have experimented with another cleanser for a few days, but am always so glad to get back to this product.  I used to have really dry skin esp during the winter months, but this has helped tremendously to keep my skin softer and much less flaky from dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love the smell &amp; doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of its natural oils.  It took a little getting used to the first couple of times I tried it a decade ago because it didn&#x27;t leave that \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; feeling I had been used to.  Then I realized the squeaky clean from other facial cleansers I was used to was actually the soap stripping my skin &amp; leaving it more prone to dryness.  So if you are just trying it for the first time, give it a week or two to notice the difference.  Now I couldn&#x27;t go back to any other cleansers.  Hope they keep making this product for a long time!</li>
            <li> These are GREAT!  They do not foam like you expect facial cleaners to, but if you read the ingredients, they&#x27;re awesome.  Your skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry.  Cleans well because of the oils and lanolin.  Smells great but the natural type of great instead of chemically perfumed.  I know some people don&#x27;t like it without the foam, since that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re normally used to.  It did take me a little bit to \\&quot;trust\\&quot; its doing its job but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff has done amazing things for my skin. I used to use an oil-free, grapefruit scented cleanser from Neutrogena. It wasn&#x27;t a bad product, but it was nothing compared to this! Sometimes, if I forgot to moisturize in the morning, my skin would be tight, dry and painful within an hour. Since I started using this cleanser, I haven&#x27;t had a single day like that! For those of us used to the stripped feeling of other cleansers, the idea of using a cleanser with oils in it may seem counterproductive. However this will get you one step closer to soft skin that&#x27;s the stuff of dreams. Yes, as some reviewers have pointed out, it doesn&#x27;t foam. Just because it doesn&#x27;t foam doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not doing its job! In addition to being a fantastic product, Orange Essence Facial Cleanser is all-natural and contains none of the mystery ingredients found in other cleansers. Bravo Burt&#x27;s Bees, bravo!</li>
            <li> I have really good luck with this. Smells good, seems to keep my face clean.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell, moisturizes well, cleans well. What else is there to say? I don&#x27;t know what else to write.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this product, but I can say  I recommend it on the basis of the fact that it didn&#x27;t dry my sensitive skin out and it does the job of cleansing without burning.  Has a pleasant orange fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice a day.  It did not always remove my makeup or just daily dirt.  Using a toner help to remove all the left on dirt and makeup this product did not remove.  I did leave face feeling moisturized.  I was not drying at all to my combination skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this in another moment of being tired of researching for natural facial cleansers that were inexpensive, easy to obtain, did not contain added fragrance, coconut-derived surfactants, and after many repeat failures using DIY recipes.  I first purchased it from Walgreens, so I could return it if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied. I was hesitant to use it because of my sensitive, oily-prone, dehydrated, mature skin and previous redness (sign of irritation) from using other products with EOs and the conflicting information about using citrus oils on sensitive skin. My usual experience has been that when I try something that&#x27;s manufactured and supposed to be good for sensitive skin (CB shampoo, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Baby Mild, etc.) on the first usage my face will feel taut, itch, and my lips will peel. Upon the first usage of this cleanser, I massaged it into my dry skin and rinsed with warm water, I was pleasantly surprised that none of the typical reactions occurred and my skin felt very soft. After two days of using it in that manner, I did have that gummy residue on my face. I then tried using it like a cleansing balm, wiping it off with a moistened cotton pad, etc. Finally, I found that the best way to use this is to wet my face first, gently massage/swipe the cleanser over my face, use a wet baby washcloth to wipe it off and then rinse. This can be a little messy, if you&#x27;re not in the shower.  I am sensitive to the smell of fragrances, but the orange essence has not created an issue for me. The only time I experienced \\&quot;the heat\\&quot; as described by others is when my palms are already warm from hot water and then went to apply it on dry skin. For the price, limited number of ingredients, ease of obtaining, and the results - this an HG for me. 1 tube lasts approximately 2 mos using a (garbanzo) pea-size amount. Of course, I follow cleansing with patting on 1 drop of squalane oil and then applying moisturizer. I am no longer experiencing dry skin patches or oiliness. Yahoo!</li>
            <li> Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This is very good for sensitive skin.Should be applied on wet skin.It might not work for some people as it might create some zits/ breakouts due to heavy moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This cleaner is fantastic.  It gives me clean skin without that dried out feeling I used to get with astringents or acne medicine.  I used to get a few pimples a week, not bad, but worth addressing.  I&#x27;m now down to 1 a month at most.  My wife, father, and sister have now had the same experience, though we have very different skin.  Of those folks, 2 dropped their prescription meds.  My sister in law still uses her prescription meds, but switched to the Orange cleaner for her day to day facewash, since she says it has been an improvement.  So, my family is extremely happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll also say that I like that this stuff is basically edible.  Nothing nasty in it at all.&lt;br /&gt;One note is that it does not give your skin that squeaky clean feel.  But I&#x27;ve realized that this is a good thing.  It means my skin doesn&#x27;t then overreact and get all oily.  I think that balance, clean but not stripping my face bare, is what makes this stuff work so well.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Burts, please keep making this stuff just as it is.  You do and you have a lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> I have a fair to medium completion that runs on the slightly dry side.  I also have contact dermatitis on my left temple area because I sleep on my left side. This leaves my skin in that area with surface &#x27;bumps&#x27;.  Additionally, I often have problems with facial products because I develop a resistance to them.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I had doubts about this cleanser. It feels a little greasy when applied. It doesn&#x27;t lather. What it does have is an amazing orange scent. I think of it as Orange Glo for the skin. I wasn&#x27;t sure it was doing anything. However, I massaged it over my face and neck and then rinsed with warm water. My skin felt incredibly soft, clean, and supple. After cleaning, I used an astringent pad to see if there was residual dirt on my skin. The pad was clear. My skin sort of glowed, didn&#x27;t look greasy, but it wasn&#x27;t dry either. Extended use over a couple of weeks improved the texture and eliminated the dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;Four years later, I am still using this on a daily basis. Sometimes I apply it with my Clarisonic or Neutrogena cleanser pad. Regardless of season, this cleanser works. On occasion when I don&#x27;t use this for a few days, I notice the difference and it isn&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Burt&#x27;s Bees product line for a long time. I can&#x27;t say I totally like everything I&#x27;ve tried in their line, but this is among my favorites.</li>
            <li> This product works incredibly well. Orange oil, for those who don&#x27;t know, is a powerful natural cleaner that is high in antioxidants, vitamin c, and is very good for antiaging, inflammation, and acne issues. It has natural antiseptic qualities. This product is PACKED with orange oil. The first second you uncap this cleanser you are transported to an orange grove. This smell is so sweet and strong, in a good way. Oh and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger throughout the day in case you are worried it might compete with your perfume or something. I used a Clarisonic with this for the exfoliation benefit but I will comment that no matter how you use this product, with or without a Clarisonic, you will not get a lather. It&#x27;s simply not meant to lather. It&#x27;s an oil based cleanser. This will not dry your face out at all. I have oily to combination skin with extremely bad blackhead areas along the outer sides of my cheeks. This has not caused any issues anywhere and leaves my skin touchably soft. While this is recommended for normal to dry skin types, if you use this and have super oily or combination skin skin try a toner with it on your problem areas. There is absolutely no tightness after using this. This cleanser is truly very low impact on your skin. Being in my mid 20&#x27;s, I have tried every kind of cleanser under the sun from the low end to the super expensive including just about every drug store verity. Lately I have realized I don&#x27;t want to be throwing so many chemicals onto my face (sulfates to name one) just to get it clean. I mean seriously, do I really need my cleanser to be bright blue all crammed with dye? Oh, and this cleanser is actually 100% Natural, not the 98.8% listed on the product description. If you are in the market for a new cleanser and want to try something completely different, give this product a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m turning into a &amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees&amp;#34; addict. They have such great products, I just can&#x27;t wait to wash my face</li>
            <li> Smells delightful, but this made my skin break out terribly. It has wheat derived ingredients, which causes skin irritation for a lot of people. I returned the product for a refund.. Oh well! Done with you, Burt.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! It&#x27;s effective- I usually wake up with somewhat oily skin, and my skin looks much improved after using it. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t make my face red. Most washes make my face turn a little red for five to ten minutes, but this one doesn&#x27;t give me that problem! I can wash my face right before going somewhere and not be embarrassed due to redness. And the smell is amazing. It&#x27;s a little overwhelming at first, but it&#x27;s wonderful. I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin, oily skin, or normal skin.</li>
            <li> It seems that most people who don&#x27;t like this cleanser ignored that it isn&#x27;t for oily skin. My skin used to be oily but for the last year I have been dealing with perioral dermatitis (a rosacea subtype) that has been leaving my skin dry, tight, flaking, and incredibly sensitive. I would use other cleansers and my skin would sting intensely after using them for up to half an hour. I read on some rosacea forums that folks had good luck with Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence and I picked some up at CVS. My skin is so grateful! It cleans deeply, removing even my stubborn mascara and eyeliner easily. I just gently rub some on my dry face and wipe it off with a warm, moist, cloth. My skin doesn&#x27;t sting at all after using it. It leaves moisure in the skin instead of stripping it all out and my face is no longer flaking. I don&#x27;t think it would have worked as well for me when I was younger with much oilier skin, but now that I&#x27;m nearing 40 my face really appreciates the extra moisture and the fine lines around my eyes are not nearly as noticeable as with harsher cleansers.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily along with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Citrus Face Scrub. Good combination. Great products!! Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> After I clean this cleanser, i still fell oil on my face. It is suitable for dry skin, but if you have oil skin, you better choose another one.</li>
            <li> This is a very good cleanser. So say I ans so say my wife. It doesn&#x27;t dry face and leaves the skin fresh and clean.</li>
