    <ol>
            <li>I am really happy with my order!</li>
            <li>BUT this is the best gold</li>
            <li>It looks great!</li>
            <li>I have been searching for the perfect gold.  </li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>The best way to where:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>this is the polish for you :D</li>
            <li>One of the best metallic polishes I have.</li>
            <li>The shine is like perfect gold leaf.  </li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>Essie products are so good!</li>
            <li>that I am realy happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I got this because the gold I had stained and refused to remove, ever so this was a great replacement.</li>
            <li>This is a great color; will buy again.</li>
            <li>but maybe because the formula was streaky for me that I didn&#x27;t have a great feel for it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>or if it goes on poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have confidence in Essie products and I am happy the Metallic colors are here now-</li>
            <li>I ordered the good as gold and it was great.</li>
            <li>This gold is stunning and is absolutely perfect for nail stamping.</li>
            <li>This color is perfect, pure liquid gold, never streaky and glides on perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It makes for a good accent nail polish.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still a good color(:</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my seller too--they gave me free shipping</li>
            <li>With As Good as Gold, it seems to streak no matter what you do.</li>
            <li>Love the color!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I will defiantly be purchasing more colors!</li>
            <li>the polishes are exactly as shown the pictures, and with two coats is perfect!</li>
            <li>I love the nail polish!</li>
            <li>Super gorgeous metallic gold!  </li>
            <li>This is a great, one coat, metallic light gold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing color.</li>
            <li>It is a really nice metallic gold.</li>
            <li>So a good top coat here may be helpful as it evens out the appearance of streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is great, a nice pretty metallic gold.</li>
            <li>Great color, easy to apply and quick drying.</li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments on the color and look of it on the nails,</li>
            <li>Love the metallic gold.</li>
            <li>Color was interesting.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite Essies.</li>
            <li>But I love it and may have found my favorite nail polish ever.</li>
            <li>Love all the color.</li>
            <li>so you have to apply more than 2 coats</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the color</li>
            <li>I love the metallic gold.  </li>
            <li>So glad I</li>
            <li>While I do see a bit of copper, penny-like coloring I would describe this polish as more &amp;#34;metallic dust rose&amp;#34; in color.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one coat makes it look more mettalicy and more like gold foil</li>
            <li>as opposed to waiting for  the holidays/wintertime-which is when many polish companies tend to release metallic colors.</li>
            <li>Essie is one of my favorite brands, and this gold did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>This gold has more of a flat/matte finish, so if you&#x27;re looking for more of a sparkly gold, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, the fact that it works almost too well giving the effect of a metal on your nails, this is my favorite polish.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a shocking gold which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>People who may do a lot of typing will find that kind of wear happening to them, but quick touch ups by this polish covers it up well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This would be the perfect Chanel Peridot dupe, minus the peridot/green coloring.</li>
            <li>The color came exactly as pictured which I am very pleased about.</li>
            <li>do not need much to get good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SUCH a beautiful colour</li>
            <li>I know, I am being handed a brand new bottle of ESSIE&#x27;s * GOOD</li>
            <li>and it spreads SO easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>&gt; If you want a true, genuine metallic gold polish, that is has authentic gold tone and does not lean toward yellow-ish?</li>
            <li>Work quickly if using it for stamping!</li>
            <li>and they came within a few days &amp; were packaged perfectly</li>
            <li>Sort of like the underside of a gold ring where the light isn&#x27;t hitting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to get this nail polish forever and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I got this for someone for their birthday, and it was a nice, cute metallic and festive addition to their present.</li>
            <li>perfect color, even better than the picture, fast dry &amp; very shinny.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find true metallics, so this is great!</li>
            <li>However, I will be rocking the Good as Gold through winter, possibly picking up the silver shade from this line as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I bought it from online instead of the store, especially with Essie&#x27;s price increase to $8.50 a bottle--though it is well worth the money if you buy it full price!</li>
            <li>(P.S. Highly recommend using Sally Hansen&#x27;s No Chip Top Coat with it--it chips in no time if used alone.)</li>
            <li>Exactly how pictured!</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like gold!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when I need to!</li>
            <li>Very opaque and smooth.</li>
            <li>I feel like you can where it everywhere for a classy and confident look.</li>
            <li>and my nails still look freshly done.</li>
            <li>only draw back is that you have to make sure your nails are buffed well or use a good ridge filler.</li>
            <li>Gold and Silver polish can look gaudy if it is not the right tone</li>
            <li>I just recently discovered I could buy Essie polish for super cheap online!</li>
            <li>Yet when I used the polish as a french tip over a light pink (great look btw) there isn&#x27;t this problem.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of Essie</li>
            <li>pretty and feminine.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I am still wearing my first application out of the bottle and it is over a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No quite mirrored finish, but much more shiny than the bottle appears from the outside.</li>
            <li>The only difference is that I do not like this color without a topcoat, and I do not like Chanel&#x27;s Peridot with a top coat.</li>
            <li>This polish will wipe off any layer that is not totally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too interested when these metallics came out.</li>
            <li>Absolutely beauuuuuutiful!</li>
            <li>No more buying Essie at Target for me - and thats really saying something because I really love my Target!!</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite gold metallic I&#x27;ve seen, since it isn&#x27;t too much on the yellow side.</li>
            <li>sure to wipe any excess off the brush-the mixture is very generous and you can misjudge how much you actually need to do your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to just use it for the whole nail and no nail</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is a very shiny gold on the nails.</li>
            <li>The only problem is I guess because it reflects light so well, any exposed nail even at the microscopic edge of your nail bed looks grimy.  </li>
            <li>I love Essie nail polishes for their super short dry time, but this is my first time buying a metallic colour from this brand so of course I was a little nervous, but definitely NOT disappointed!</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s possible for a gold color, it does have a drop of silver in it, but I guess that just makes it even more suited for different skin tones.</li>
            <li>I am really liking this brand of nail polish lately, and they have a nice selection of colors.</li>
            <li>It covers in just one coat, may use two to be sure or correct any mess ups.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>unlike other essie polishes,  this one is super opaque!</li>
            <li>&gt;( I lightly touched up any slight wear to the nail tip</li>
            <li>Would not recommend unless staying power improved considerably.  </li>
            <li>So shiny and nice and thin.</li>
            <li>Chips off from day one like a cheap &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; nail polish from the past.  </li>
            <li>So this is especially really hard to use this for nail art when using it with nail brushes to do free hand art.</li>
            <li>The gold color is super close minus the green cast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little tricky to apply evenly because the metallic shade is very unforgiving to and imperfections on the surface of the nail.</li>
            <li>I bought this for stamping, and it works well though it dries a little fast.</li>

            <li> Its weird because the polish is completely opaque, the issue isn&#x27;t seeing through the polish, but I&#x27;m still going to do an undercoat of light opaque pink any time I use it from now</li>
            <li> I just get so annoyed when it fades SOOOooo quickly when you don&#x27;t use topcoat, like 2 days.  </li>
            <li> Yellow nail polish really looks horrible with my skin tone, but this gold one somehow looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I ordered Essie from two different places and the nail polish was expected to get to me in a week</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using with base coat or two coats, make sure the polish is completely and totally dry before you move on to the next coat.</li>
            <li> Have never had a nail polish that didn&#x27;t take an interminable amount of time to dry.  </li>
            <li> and I suggest to wait for it to dry between each coats.  </li>
            <li> formula is streaking so it let it completely dry after one layer.</li>
            <li> It pulls/drags if you don&#x27;t let it dry.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected with this style of finish.</li>
            <li> Create a flood or pool on the brush and apply carefully.</li>
            <li> This will allow you to fix and brush over without streaking/pulling because the layer is still wet.</li>
            <li> Both polishes have a tendency to streak, but it is avoidable with Peridot if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark, metallic gold just like I hoped.</li>
            <li> It somehow gives the effect of a greenish dark gray underneath.  </li>
            <li> Also the polish is thick so that I only needed one coat, and I like that.</li>
            <li> This polish is very opaque but also very thin.</li>
            <li> However, I purchased a few online</li>
            <li> I recommend at least two coats, depending on how you like your polish to look/how heavily you apply.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s in comparison to the shimmer of the polish or</li>
            <li> It does have this strange hint of an almost black outline to it when you put it on, if that makes any sense, almost like you have black on underneath; it&#x27;s not noticeable or bad, just a very slight appearance it takes on.</li>
            <li> The polish goes on thick but smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> Even with a base coat and two coats of nail color, some major nail imperfections may show through.</li>
            <li> apply one thin coat of polish&lt;br</li>
            <li> but is it illegal to mail nail polish in the us?</li>
            <li> I wore it on my toes and it stood out like crazy in the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it over a base coat (OPI)</li>
            <li> IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a base coat-</li>

            <li> Have never had a nail polish that didn&#x27;t take an interminable amount of time to dry.  With this Essie Mirror Metallic nail polish, it dries almost immediately.  I have had so many compliments on the color and look of it on the nails, that I am realy happy with the results.  Bravo Essie...a terrific nail polish!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the metallic gold. So shiny and nice and thin.</li>
            <li> I got this for someone for their birthday, and it was a nice, cute metallic and festive addition to their present.</li>
            <li> Chips off from day one like a cheap &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; nail polish from the past.  Would not recommend unless staying power improved considerably.  Color was interesting.</li>
            <li> Super gorgeous metallic gold!  It looks like liquid metal.  It is hard to find true metallics, so this is great!</li>
            <li> Great color, easy to apply and quick drying.</li>
            <li> I like this color. It makes for a good accent nail polish. It&#x27;s a little tricky to apply evenly because the metallic shade is very unforgiving to and imperfections on the surface of the nail. But it&#x27;s still a good color(:</li>
            <li> This is a great, one coat, metallic light gold. I got this because the gold I had stained and refused to remove, ever so this was a great replacement. One of my favorite Essies. Very opaque and smooth. Does show stroke lines but that&#x27;s expected with this style of finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get this nail polish forever and was not disappointed. If it&#x27;s possible for a gold color, it does have a drop of silver in it, but I guess that just makes it even more suited for different skin tones. It&#x27;s a dark, metallic gold just like I hoped. It does have this strange hint of an almost black outline to it when you put it on, if that makes any sense, almost like you have black on underneath; it&#x27;s not noticeable or bad, just a very slight appearance it takes on. But I love it and may have found my favorite nail polish ever. (P.S. Highly recommend using Sally Hansen&#x27;s No Chip Top Coat with it--it chips in no time if used alone.)</li>
            <li> Love the color! It also stays on longer without chipping!</li>
            <li> I am really liking this brand of nail polish lately, and they have a nice selection of colors. This is a great color; will buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the good as gold and it was great. I ordered Essie from two different places and the nail polish was expected to get to me in a week but it only took a couple of days! I am really happy with my order!</li>
            <li> Exactly how pictured! Love all the color. Big fan of essie polish, i buy every collection that comes out! !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of online search to look at all the different gold color swatches and this is the one I&#x27;ve been looking for! No yellow hue. Looks exactly like gold! Formula is streaky so you have to apply more than 2 coats and I suggest to wait for it to dry between each coats.  This is my first purchase of Essie and I&#x27;m not quite fond of their brush vs OPI and China Glaze but maybe because the formula was streaky for me that I didn&#x27;t have a great feel for it. BUT this is the best gold color!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Feb 24, 2013&lt;br /&gt;The formula is streaking so it let it completely dry after one layer. It pulls/drags if you don&#x27;t let it dry. So this is especially really hard to use this for nail art when using it with nail brushes to do free hand art. I&#x27;ve decided to just use it for the whole nail and no nail art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: July 2013&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve improved on the application. Create a flood or pool on the brush and apply carefully. This will allow you to fix and brush over without streaking/pulling because the layer is still wet. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! One coat is plenty! I&#x27;ve been using it over a base coat (OPI) and it spreads SO easily and smoothly. It looks great!</li>
            <li> I just recently discovered I could buy Essie polish for super cheap online! I&#x27;ve always been picky about purchasing them at Target because they are a bit on the pricey side. However, I purchased a few online and they came within a few days &amp; were packaged perfectly so they wouldn&#x27;t break! I absolutely love the color and I will defiantly be purchasing more colors! No more buying Essie at Target for me - and thats really saying something because I really love my Target!!</li>
            <li> The color is great, a nice pretty metallic gold. Shipping was very fast. I will definitely buy more when I need to!</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these because I didn&#x27;t want it to run out.  I love the metallic gold.  It&#x27;s an amazing color. I just get so annoyed when it fades SOOOooo quickly when you don&#x27;t use topcoat, like 2 days.  Otherwise it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the perfect gold.  This is it for me.  Not too yellow or brassy - and goes on well and lasts!! Thanks</li>
            <li> This color is glamorous. I feel like you can where it everywhere for a classy and confident look. I&#x27;m very glad I bought it from online instead of the store, especially with Essie&#x27;s price increase to $8.50 a bottle--though it is well worth the money if you buy it full price! This is probably my favorite gold metallic I&#x27;ve seen, since it isn&#x27;t too much on the yellow side. Yellow nail polish really looks horrible with my skin tone, but this gold one somehow looks amazing. So glad I purchased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my seller too--they gave me free shipping but I got my package within 3 days even though they ship form California and I shipped to the East Coast. Awesome!</li>
            <li> While I do see a bit of copper, penny-like coloring I would describe this polish as more &amp;#34;metallic dust rose&amp;#34; in color.&lt;br /&gt;Very pretty and feminine.</li>
            <li> Essie products are so good! the polishes are exactly as shown the pictures, and with two coats is perfect! thanks!</li>
            <li> No issues and I love the nail polish!</li>
            <li> I bought this for stamping, and it works well though it dries a little fast. Work quickly if using it for stamping! It also does give one coat coverage for painting your nails, though I recommend two or three to minimize brush strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a swatch on a piece of tape and tape it to the cap... The color in the bottle does not reflect the color on your nails well...  the picture on this listing of it in the bottle does not do it justice at all! It is a very shiny gold on the nails.</li>
            <li> It is a really nice metallic gold. The best way to where:&lt;br /&gt;1 wipe off nails with nail polish remover&lt;br /&gt;2 wash hands&lt;br /&gt;3 apply one thin coat of polish&lt;br /&gt;The one coat makes it look more mettalicy and more like gold foil</li>
            <li> unlike other essie polishes,  this one is super opaque! i only need one coat!! but is it illegal to mail nail polish in the us?</li>
            <li> I got this polish recently as a gift from a friend.  They got it for me when they noticed I was checking out the entire ESSIE MIRROR METALLIC COLLECTION online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next thing I know, I am being handed a brand new bottle of ESSIE&#x27;s * GOOD AS GOLD*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you want a true, genuine metallic gold polish, that is has authentic gold tone and does not lean toward yellow-ish? THIS IS IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a base coat- and then applied the polish.  The polish goes on thick but smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to wipe any excess off the brush-the mixture is very generous and you can misjudge how much you actually need to do your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not need much to get good coverage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need to put on several layers to get shiny,even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did 2 coats, because using 2 coats is standard for how I do my polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am still wearing my first application out of the bottle and it is over a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( I lightly touched up any slight wear to the nail tip and my nails still look freshly done. People who may do a lot of typing will find that kind of wear happening to them, but quick touch ups by this polish covers it up well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I cannot wait to try the Chrome color next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Gold and Silver polish can look gaudy if it is not the right tone or if it goes on poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have confidence in Essie products and I am happy the Metallic colors are here now- as opposed to waiting for  the holidays/wintertime-which is when many polish companies tend to release metallic colors.</li>
            <li> No quite mirrored finish, but much more shiny than the bottle appears from the outside. Just what I was looking for tips and nail art.</li>
            <li> This would be the perfect Chanel Peridot dupe, minus the peridot/green coloring. The consistency and coverage is almost identical. The gold color is super close minus the green cast. It covers in just one coat, may use two to be sure or correct any mess ups. The only difference is that I do not like this color without a topcoat, and I do not like Chanel&#x27;s Peridot with a top coat. Both polishes have a tendency to streak, but it is avoidable with Peridot if you&#x27;re careful. With As Good as Gold, it seems to streak no matter what you do. So a good top coat here may be helpful as it evens out the appearance of streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back is that you have to make sure your nails are buffed well or use a good ridge filler. This polish is very opaque but also very thin. Even with a base coat and two coats of nail color, some major nail imperfections may show through. If you&#x27;re using with base coat or two coats, make sure the polish is completely and totally dry before you move on to the next coat. This polish will wipe off any layer that is not totally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I absolutely love it. I wasn&#x27;t too interested when these metallics came out. However, I will be rocking the Good as Gold through winter, possibly picking up the silver shade from this line as well.</li>
            <li> This gold is stunning and is absolutely perfect for nail stamping. So if you are into Konad nail stamping this is the polish for you :D</li>
            <li> I am a nail polish ADDICT. Essie is one of my favorite brands, and this gold did not disappoint. I recommend at least two coats, depending on how you like your polish to look/how heavily you apply. This gold has more of a flat/matte finish, so if you&#x27;re looking for more of a sparkly gold, this isn&#x27;t it. One of the best metallic polishes I have.</li>
            <li> This color is perfect, pure liquid gold, never streaky and glides on perfectly.  The shine is like perfect gold leaf.  The only problem is I guess because it reflects light so well, any exposed nail even at the microscopic edge of your nail bed looks grimy.  It somehow gives the effect of a greenish dark gray underneath.  Sort of like the underside of a gold ring where the light isn&#x27;t hitting.  Not sure if it&#x27;s in comparison to the shimmer of the polish or what.  Yet when I used the polish as a french tip over a light pink (great look btw) there isn&#x27;t this problem.  Its weird because the polish is completely opaque, the issue isn&#x27;t seeing through the polish, but I&#x27;m still going to do an undercoat of light opaque pink any time I use it from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the fact that it works almost too well giving the effect of a metal on your nails, this is my favorite polish.  Wish they all went on like this!!</li>
            <li> I love Essie nail polishes for their super short dry time, but this is my first time buying a metallic colour from this brand so of course I was a little nervous, but definitely NOT disappointed! It&#x27;s SUCH a beautiful colour and it&#x27;s so shiny! I wore it on my toes and it stood out like crazy in the sun. LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beauuuuuutiful! perfect color, even better than the picture, fast dry &amp; very shinny. I am in love with this!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The color came exactly as pictured which I am very pleased about. It&#x27;s not a shocking gold which is what I was looking for. Also the polish is thick so that I only needed one coat, and I like that. I would recommend it and I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
