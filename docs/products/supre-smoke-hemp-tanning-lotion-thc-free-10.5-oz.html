    <ol>
            <li>Thank you again Supre for producing yet another great tanning lotion in the Smoke line!!</li>
            <li>I mix it with the Tingle lotion to get the best tan.</li>
            <li>Hempz Herbal Moisturizer instead, it is the best stuff ever.</li>
            <li>The lotion also moisturizes wonderfully.</li>

            <li>It gives my skin a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li>It was great.</li>
            <li>they really do a great job</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten a great tan</li>
            <li>This lotion smells great, applies perfect (no greasy feel) and is a great priced lotion that works just as well as any of the top shelf lotions I used for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and smells really good</li>
            <li>Nice tropical smell and not greasy!  </li>
            <li>I had tried this product from a friend who recommended it to me and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>Smells good going on.</li>
            <li>Great smell, love that it has no bronzer but got me tan.</li>

            <li>I love the smell too!</li>
            <li>Scent is very nice and not too strong.</li>
            <li>It smell alright- also not as amazing as described.</li>
            <li>The smell is really nice and</li>
            <li>scent is nice because it takes away that after-tanning smell</li>
            <li>I have managed many tanning salons for years and this is still one of my favorite products as well as a very popular lotion amongst customers.</li>
            <li>This was a great product and they shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>Its a good product although I expected something better from all the reviews praising how wonderful it was.</li>
            <li>SO glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten more effect from a Hemp Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Wish it came with a squeeze top though.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Ive been through many products</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the Smoke lotion</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I bought this bottle and &amp;#34;Designer Skin Love Notes Hydrating Intensifier Tanning Lotion&amp;#34; to use while building time in the bed.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I actually preferred the Love notes because it was silky smooth and smelled great!</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my skin soft and moisturized during and after tanning.</li>
            <li>so it gives you a great natural boost.</li>
            <li>If you want a light, natural lotion that smells great</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too strong smelling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a relatively new tanner and have never tried a tanning lotion and am relatively fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>I am new to tanning and have fair skin.</li>
            <li>I Love the Hemp because it is super moisturising.</li>
            <li>adsorbs quickly and smell isnt too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance, not heavy, no after tan smell, absorbs quickly into skin.  </li>
            <li>I switch alot with my indoor tanning lotions, but after using the Hemp lotion, I really started loving their line and decided to give their tanning lotion a try after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I thought the price was great, I would have paid over twice as much at my local tanning salon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light, airy, fruity/tropical, \\&quot;I wanna eat it\\&quot; type of smell.</li>
            <li>This really helped me tan nicely and faster.  </li>
            <li>then i would go for a light bronzer after.</li>
            <li>and I like the green bottle the best out of the smoke lotions because I don&#x27;t like lotions with bronzer in it (which can leave to streaks or splotches) or the tinglers (which can feel like you are being poked with needles).</li>
            <li>It has a sort of sweet perfumey smell to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, and I&#x27;m fair skinned.</li>
            <li>I am normally fair and tend to turn red before skin turns a golden brown.  </li>
            <li>The smell is decent compared to most tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>i still go to college in cramped rooms, so i really dont like strong smells to where everyone across the room can smell me.</li>
            <li>The smell is not too strong, but strong enough for me to not want to buy this product again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works amazingly, and I can keep my tan for 2x as long.</li>
            <li>I get a good color and go tanning less.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s what drew me to this lotion in the first place.</li>
            <li>product itself arrived on time and it came exactly as described by the seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied and will definitely order this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus what i love is the fact you dont smell like lotion the entire day.</li>
            <li>Really darkens your tan!  </li>
            <li>This is the first tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a nice</li>
            <li>I use this for tanning, and i am really fair skinned and have blonde hair and blue eyes.</li>
            <li>perfect for people just starting out and want to get a good base tan</li>
            <li>Received this in the mail very quickly after ordering and used it the same day it came.    </li>
            <li>product arrived quickly as advertised and as I said they are saving you money by where they are as far as pricing</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really like the tanning lotions with bronzers.    </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It moisturize my skin really well</li>
            <li>I have very fair and dry skin, so usually after tanning my skin hurts a lot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SHORT, SWEET, AND SIMPLY PUT-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why people are complaining about the smell, it&#x27;s actually really nice.</li>
            <li>I tried putting little, more, and a lot.</li>
            <li>It smells better than some others, plus the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>As I was new to tanning I was weary of the Bronzer and tinglier products.</li>
            <li>tried going in without any Lotion and had exactly the same effect for a month now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would buy this product again, but I think next time I&#x27;ll try the hot one.</li>
            <li>I use high pressure beds because they have better UV Rays (supposidly) and its hard for me to get and keep a tan.</li>
            <li>I may or may not try another hemp type lotion and will likely try something a little more intense but gentle enough for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>I only shaded a little darker than before and my normal tanning oil worked way better to build up some color than this.</li>
            <li>I have a natural bronze-y tint to my skin</li>
            <li>I also wanted a natural gradual tan and both of these products delivered that.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the natural hemp that does it</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this lotion for people who naturally tan easily and don&#x27;t need/want the extra boost bronzers in other lotions provide.</li>
            <li>I along with most of my customers love the smell of it, yet a few occasionally are not impressed.</li>
            <li>It gave me a darker, golden color with little to no noticeable smell.  </li>
            <li>far as accelerating your tan: this stuff definitely delivers.</li>
            <li>I should add that I do have sensitive skin, and this lotion does not make me break out, turn red, or itch like some others I&#x27;ve tried have done.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far (today).</li>
            <li>This stuff really helped give me that extra boost I needed to get a great base tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it wears off pretty quickly, especially with a little sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact i stayed out without other sunscreen and didn&#x27;t burn like I normally would expect.</li>
            <li>Other than the stench, it goes on smoothly, and a little goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> Other than the stench, it goes on smoothly, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I think i remember reading this in other reviews as well, but this stuff  smells kind of weird.</li>
            <li> it smelled really nice and was affordable in comparison to all those other expensive lotions.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin amazingly soft and and contrary to the previous reviews, does not smell like celery or stir fry.</li>
            <li> but it just helps you maintain that good base tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i ordered this stuff about a month ago and it came in the expected time frame.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s really heavy feeling on the skin and takes a lot of rubbing into to actually get it to blend into the skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is thicker with minimal scent.</li>
            <li> I saw some other reviews that said it smelled bad, I think it smells okay though.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to overshoot and get too dark.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The smell starts to fade within a coulple of hours and its not a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the smoke (hemp and black)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the smoke tanning lotion in the black bottle</li>
            <li> I have used Smoke by Supre in the past, paying at least $40 a bottle at a local salon.</li>
            <li> The  time in the booth and immediately following, the smell is irritating.</li>
            <li> just have a few sessions.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to help me get my base tan without turning to dark too fast, burning, or turning orange.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe how this stuff smells, but it&#x27;s not a good smell.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards, smell is subtle and fruity, but not over powering like some lotions.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews of this product, I was disappointed after using it for a week with no results.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know, but I don&#x27;t smell bad after using this one.</li>
            <li> but I stopped using them because I afraid I&#x27;ll get skin cancer (from the sun, not this product!)</li>
            <li> I also hate lotions that leave your cloths all orange or stained and this has NEVER done that!&lt;br</li>

            <li> I use this for tanning, and i am really fair skinned and have blonde hair and blue eyes. I use high pressure beds because they have better UV Rays (supposidly) and its hard for me to get and keep a tan. I also hate lotions that leave your cloths all orange or stained and this has NEVER done that!&lt;br /&gt;It works amazingly, and I can keep my tan for 2x as long. I use this in the bed and then I hydrate my skin with the HEMP lotion as well. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I think i remember reading this in other reviews as well, but this stuff  smells kind of weird. I tan at the gym so I work out after. The  time in the booth and immediately following, the smell is irritating. But it wears off pretty quickly, especially with a little sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as accelerating your tan: this stuff definitely delivers. I actually don&#x27;t use it all the time for that reason. Don&#x27;t want to overshoot and get too dark. If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, then I&#x27;d totally recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a gift for my boyfriend and we both ended up trying it the same day. This product makes your skin amazingly soft and and contrary to the previous reviews, does not smell like celery or stir fry. It has a sort of sweet perfumey smell to it. My boyfriend and I definitely  noticed a difference when we got out of the tanning bed. This product is fabulous!! Thank you again Supre for producing yet another great tanning lotion in the Smoke line!!</li>
            <li> Its a good product although I expected something better from all the reviews praising how wonderful it was. It smell alright- also not as amazing as described.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion &amp; the Smoke Tingle. I Love the Hemp because it is super moisturising. I mix it with the Tingle lotion to get the best tan. Love this brand!</li>
            <li> I switch alot with my indoor tanning lotions, but after using the Hemp lotion, I really started loving their line and decided to give their tanning lotion a try after reading the reviews.  SO glad I did.  Great fragrance, not heavy, no after tan smell, absorbs quickly into skin.  I will continue using this one along with their moisturizer to extend my tan and hydrate my skin.    **Update 8/17** I still like the lotion, but I noticed that my tan was not so tan after using this.  I switched to their bronzer, that way I get a good color and go tanning less.</li>
            <li> Stopped using it after 3 times. I tried putting little, more, and a lot. It does not darken or changes anything. I have gotten more effect from a Hemp Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried going in without any Lotion and had exactly the same effect for a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy Hempz Herbal Moisturizer instead, it is the best stuff ever.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells great and makes my skin soft and moisturized during and after tanning. I thought the price was great, I would have paid over twice as much at my local tanning salon.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews of this product, I was disappointed after using it for a week with no results. Did I get tan? Yes I got a hint of color after a WEEK of tanning. Was it noticeable? No. I only shaded a little darker than before and my normal tanning oil worked way better to build up some color than this. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t really like the tanning lotions with bronzers.    This stuff is great and smells really good and it&#x27;s not too strong smelling.  Wish it came with a squeeze top though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe how this stuff smells, but it&#x27;s not a good smell.  I guess it could be described as celery or sort of vegetable stir-fry.  Other than the stench, it goes on smoothly, and a little goes a long way.  The smell is not too strong, but strong enough for me to not want to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have used Smoke by Supre in the past, paying at least $40 a bottle at a local salon. I definitely recommend this lotion for people who naturally tan easily and don&#x27;t need/want the extra boost bronzers in other lotions provide. I have a natural bronze-y tint to my skin and I think this lotion helps me accentuate that feature. It gives my skin a beautiful glow. The lotion also moisturizes wonderfully. I should add that I do have sensitive skin, and this lotion does not make me break out, turn red, or itch like some others I&#x27;ve tried have done.&lt;br /&gt;This product smells great! I think that&#x27;s what drew me to this lotion in the first place. It&#x27;s a light, airy, fruity/tropical, \\&quot;I wanna eat it\\&quot; type of smell. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself arrived on time and it came exactly as described by the seller. I&#x27;m satisfied and will definitely order this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHORT, SWEET, AND SIMPLY PUT- If you want a light, natural lotion that smells great and you don&#x27;t crave bronzer, please try this product!!!</li>
            <li> I had tried this product from a friend who recommended it to me and she loved it.  It was great. I am normally fair and tend to turn red before skin turns a golden brown.  This really helped me tan nicely and faster.  It was moisturizing without being greasy.  Best of all it smelled really nice and was affordable in comparison to all those other expensive lotions.</li>
            <li> Ive been tanning for about 2 years now. Ive been through many products and i have to say this one is great for beginners trying to get their base tan. You wont notice a change till you tan for about 3 days. The smell is decent compared to most tanning lotions. Plus what i love is the fact you dont smell like lotion the entire day. The smell starts to fade within a coulple of hours and its not a very strong smell. So you dont have to worry about everyone smelling you. Well for me i dont like it i still go to college in cramped rooms, so i really dont like strong smells to where everyone across the room can smell me. So i would definalty recommend this for beginners trying to get their base tan then i would go for a light bronzer after.</li>
            <li> This was a great product and they shipped very fast. Pleasure doing business with. Would deffinitely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the smoke (hemp and black) they really do a great job but I stopped using them because I afraid I&#x27;ll get skin cancer (from the sun, not this product!)</li>
            <li> Received this in the mail very quickly after ordering and used it the same day it came.    I&#x27;m a relatively new tanner and have never tried a tanning lotion and am relatively fair skinned.  I wanted something to help me get my base tan without turning to dark too fast, burning, or turning orange.     This did the trick, after one use I can definitely see a difference.  It gave me a darker, golden color with little to no noticeable smell.  Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have managed many tanning salons for years and this is still one of my favorite products as well as a very popular lotion amongst customers. I along with most of my customers love the smell of it, yet a few occasionally are not impressed. The Hemp version has no bronzers so it gives you a great natural boost. This lotion smells great, applies perfect (no greasy feel) and is a great priced lotion that works just as well as any of the top shelf lotions I used for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Nice tropical smell and not greasy!  Really darkens your tan!  A little goes a long way!!  And it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than buying at the tanning salon!!</li>
            <li> i ordered this stuff about a month ago and it came in the expected time frame. adsorbs quickly and smell isnt too overwhelming. perfect for people just starting out and want to get a good base tan</li>
            <li> great pricing! product arrived quickly as advertised and as I said they are saving you money by where they are as far as pricing</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards, smell is subtle and fruity, but not over powering like some lotions. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far (today). The smell is really nice and after one go in the bed I noticed a change immediately. However, it&#x27;s really heavy feeling on the skin and takes a lot of rubbing into to actually get it to blend into the skin. Other than that it&#x27;s a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product about three or four days after ordering it.</li>
            <li> I have very fair and dry skin, so usually after tanning my skin hurts a lot. But this lotion just perfect. It moisturize my skin really well so id doesnt hurts anymore. Scent is very nice and not too strong.</li>
            <li> I used to work at a tanning salon and so I have tried lots of different lotions and this is one of my favorites. I love the smell of the Smoke lotion and I like the green bottle the best out of the smoke lotions because I don&#x27;t like lotions with bronzer in it (which can leave to streaks or splotches) or the tinglers (which can feel like you are being poked with needles). Love this lotion. Smells and works great!</li>
            <li> I am new to tanning and have fair skin. I bought this bottle and &amp;#34;Designer Skin Love Notes Hydrating Intensifier Tanning Lotion&amp;#34; to use while building time in the bed. I actually preferred the Love notes because it was silky smooth and smelled great! This lotion is thicker with minimal scent. As I was new to tanning I was weary of the Bronzer and tinglier products. I also wanted a natural gradual tan and both of these products delivered that. I may or may not try another hemp type lotion and will likely try something a little more intense but gentle enough for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Smells good going on. I&#x27;ve used the smoke tanning lotion in the black bottle and I&#x27;ve left the tanning beds smelling like garbage. Maybe it&#x27;s the natural hemp that does it, I don&#x27;t know, but I don&#x27;t smell bad after using this one. So two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This is the first tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used and I love it. I don&#x27;t get burnt and I&#x27;ve gotten a great tan just have a few sessions. I love the smell too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after I had been tanning a couple months. I figured it would make me darker but it just helps you maintain that good base tan.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice because it takes away that after-tanning smell but it&#x27;s not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are complaining about the smell, it&#x27;s actually really nice. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, and I&#x27;m fair skinned. This stuff really helped give me that extra boost I needed to get a great base tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be recommending this to my friends!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m tanner because this stuff helped, or if it&#x27;s just because I was tanning.  I saw some other reviews that said it smelled bad, I think it smells okay though.  It smells better than some others, plus the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.  I would buy this product again, but I think next time I&#x27;ll try the hot one.</li>
            <li> Great smell, love that it has no bronzer but got me tan. In fact i stayed out without other sunscreen and didn&#x27;t burn like I normally would expect.</li>
