            <li>My kids love these.  </li>
            <li>These are so cute and compact.  </li>
            <li>I like to think that it protects against germs a lot more than leaving your toothbrush in a cup on the sink.</li>
            <li>How could it be better?</li>
            <li>Plus they are very easy to take apart and clean.</li>
            <li>This works well and keeps my tooth brush safe and sound at my girl friend&#x27;s house on the mirror.</li>

            <li>It is not only an adorable product, but the functionality of it is great.</li>
            <li>These are great because they have fun taking them out and putting them in and they hold very well to the bathroom mirror.  </li>

            <li>Anything that gets them excited to brush their teeth, amiright?</li>
            <li>It keeps their toothbrushes clean.  </li>
            <li>They do need to be cleaned every onece in a while (as with all things), but do a great job of drying the toothbrush out yet keeping the brush enclosed and protected from other airborne germs.</li>
            <li>But overall it does its job and keeps the toothbrush clean, easy to put it in and pull it out!</li>
            <li>I was looking for toothbrush holders for my sons and wanted something that would be fun to put their toothbrush into with out breaking a proceline holder and that would vent the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>Love this!&lt;br /&gt;Sticks well to the mirror, works better than I expected, and the kiddo loves it.  </li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>Once you have opened the body the first time, to put in your toothbrush, it is hands-free from then on.</li>

            <li>And it was very sturdy .</li>
            <li>I love this little guy.</li>
            <li>The only thing I haven&#x27;t liked is that if you don&#x27;t get the toothbrush mostly dry before you put it away you can end up with white lines down the mirror.</li>
            <li>I really like that little ones can&#x27;t reach it without adult help, but the bigger kids (3 1/2 and older) can reach it using their step stool.</li>
            <li>The only thing about it is it can fit a normal size toothbrush not an electric one by crest that I have sadly.</li>

            <li> My kids love this holders and I even use one for myself. Keeps the toothbrush from getting dust and very handy. We even took it on our vacation. The 2 suction cups work very well. I bought 4 of them.</li>
            <li> My husband loves giraffes, so I bought him this, him being the kid he is. He loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this (and the zebra model) for my nieces. It is not only an adorable product, but the functionality of it is great. Once you have opened the body the first time, to put in your toothbrush, it is hands-free from then on.</li>
            <li> I love this little guy. I had wanted one of these toothbrush holders for a while and I finally decided on the Giraffe. He looks so cute. However, the top suction cup (there are two) doesn&#x27;t like to stick so i often find my little friend leaning away from the wall. I simply re-stick the top suction cup and I&#x27;m good to go. He hasn&#x27;t fallen off and I&#x27;m not worried. I figure I can always replace the suction cup if need be. It is a good buy for anyone.</li>
            <li> I needed something for my daughter&#x27;s toothbrush and based on the reviews I got this. I love it. It is cute and functional. I intend to buy more - my nephew and niece want one... and of course, one for me!</li>
            <li> Love this idea...I have bought all the animals!!!</li>
            <li> We have a bunch of these little animals hanging on our bathroom mirror and we get so many compliments!  They are all cute and so much fun for the kids.  The only thing I haven&#x27;t liked is that if you don&#x27;t get the toothbrush mostly dry before you put it away you can end up with white lines down the mirror.</li>
            <li> Super cute, love how it hangs on the mirror</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to my friends as an apartment warming gift (: They love it! The only thing about it is it can fit a normal size toothbrush not an electric one by crest that I have sadly. But overall it does its job and keeps the toothbrush clean, easy to put it in and pull it out! (:</li>
            <li> My kids love these.  They suction to the smooth tile with 100% ease.  No quality issues, have had them for a year</li>
            <li> We have eight people in our household and these are great to keep the toothbrushes clean and organized. Plus they are very easy to take apart and clean. I get compliments on them all the time.</li>
            <li> This works well and keeps my tooth brush safe and sound at my girl friend&#x27;s house on the mirror. I had to get her one as she laughed at mine!</li>
            <li> These are so cute and compact.  I was looking for toothbrush holders for my sons and wanted something that would be fun to put their toothbrush into with out breaking a proceline holder and that would vent the tooth brush.  These are great because they have fun taking them out and putting them in and they hold very well to the bathroom mirror.  I got a bunch of different ones and even one for me so I can brush my teeth with them.  They do need to be cleaned every onece in a while (as with all things), but do a great job of drying the toothbrush out yet keeping the brush enclosed and protected from other airborne germs.</li>
            <li> I have one of these for each of my kids.  They love the different animal shapes.  It keeps their toothbrushes clean.  I really like that little ones can&#x27;t reach it without adult help, but the bigger kids (3 1/2 and older) can reach it using their step stool.</li>
            <li> Love this!&lt;br /&gt;Sticks well to the mirror, works better than I expected, and the kiddo loves it.  Anything that gets them excited to brush their teeth, amiright?</li>
            <li> Love it so far. Replaced my previous one from Urban Outfitters. Has not fallen off yet. I like to think that it protects against germs a lot more than leaving your toothbrush in a cup on the sink.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my tooth brush holder I bought, it was really cute. And it was very sturdy .</li>
            <li> It does the job and it&#x27;s a giraffe. How could it be better?</li>
