    <ol>
            <li>Just google henna and you will find this wonderful lady who know all about henna and sells the best product.</li>
            <li>100g of cassia was the perfect amount for me.</li>
            <li>This product has proven to be great!  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;D</li>
            <li>and it is the best feeling hair you could imagine.  </li>
            <li>Worked great just like I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the shipping process as well.</li>
            <li>but this is great if you are scared to try henna and want to experiment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great transition if you are thinking of switching from chemical dye to henna.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, and will continue to use it!!</li>
            <li>I added just very warm distilled water and a tablespoon of EVOO.  </li>
            <li>got the product in a timely manner and it was listed at a great price!! :)</li>
            <li>Product was fair.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>This is a quality product and I will be buying more!</li>
            <li>and I love tea!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, as well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This gives it some conditioning and a nice gloss.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make purchase for myself but it came in good condition and it looked ok.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll need some of your own.</li>
            <li>This made my hair really strong!</li>
            <li>If you want the benefits of henna, without the color highlights or the clean up, cassia is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>The results were a golden blond, which attractive, is still a bit light for me.  </li>
            <li>satisfied with the product results.</li>
            <li>I found a better henna supplier that doesn&#x27;t sell on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to ordering more product ...soon.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It had a lot more body, shine, moisture, and poofed a bit more out of the root.</li>
            <li>But, overall it is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Most of the product was used as soon as received.</li>
            <li>The product did not arrive in the packaging depicted in the picture, but I expect that, how many times have you gone to the store to pick something up and found that they&#x27;d modified the packaging?</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell at all appealing and did not leave my hair softer or in better condition.</li>
            <li>I think this is an okay product.</li>
            <li>but I see that people love using it.</li>
            <li>Used it as a facial, very good.</li>
            <li>My hair is so smooth and feels really healthy after using this product.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and rinse out.</li>
            <li>but it still did fine.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my naturally curly 3c/4a type hair and it leaves it soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I plan on using Chamomile Tea to try to keep things on the light side.</li>
            <li>It feels heavier and thicker and looks slightly more golden.</li>
            <li>Great for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>I loved this on my hair, it made it soft.</li>
            <li>I love Cassia as it is very gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>Love it , just what I wanted to mix with amla and red henna, and indigo for a more brunette color on my gray hair!</li>
            <li>Also, I heard that people say it makes curly hair straighter or more relaxed, however my hair had been so damaged it wouldn&#x27;t curl anymore not even with a hot iron.</li>
            <li>it does not stain so clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li>I used it last summer and loved the results.  </li>
            <li>On top of that delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li>I have used REAL henna and it is far superior to this stuff.</li>
            <li>I also put a few drops of lavender oil and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Fresh cassia and</li>
            <li>it is well worth the time</li>
            <li>okay since I had some from a book about natural hair care)</li>
            <li>but it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Cassia Obovata Senna Powder does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li>As you can probably tell, this will be my first experience with Henna</li>
            <li>but I can only assume she will want me to get her more.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using cassia obovata</li>
            <li>I was transitioning when i used this the first time along with alma powder for the first time</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as potent as henna, so you don&#x27;t get the same soothing effect.  </li>
            <li>Now it has more body and strength, and it really holds the curls when i use a curling iron into the next day even with no product in it!</li>
            <li>Henna helps the hair maintain a nice soft red highlight.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this, (leaving this mud mixture in my hair surrounding my scalp in plastic wrap for 4 hours), it left a light wheat color to my roots.</li>
            <li>I really recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought light brown henna and blonde henna to not color it again.</li>
            <li>And for those of you who worked with this product before, what color do you think this product plus the light brown and blonde Henna turn out to be on my hair?</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really nervous.</li>
            <li>My hair was so much easier to de-tangle</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference</li>
            <li>it does add some golden-y tones and maybe a bit of warmth to your hair, but I really like it that way.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Now that I know the latin name for real henna, I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li>the chemicals in commercial dyes are, I was frantic to find something more natural.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with warm water until it was the consistency of cake batter, then glooped the mud all over my head, put on a shower cap and a towel, and left it on for an hour.</li>
            <li>I also experience less breakage and get so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>As I have seen better prices for this in larger packages, I will probably look for another vendor in the future for this.</li>
            <li>It was gritty and difficult to rinse out, but the results are marvelous!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this in the future, both for my daughter and for my Mother in Law who saw the results and wanted to try it for herself.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is the real deal and has me convinced to stay far away from chemicals from now on!</li>
            <li>The henna was old and didn&#x27;t dye very well.  </li>
            <li>I have thin hair with a lot of breakage, and this stuff is doing wonders for it.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and this seller is good too.</li>
            <li>Heena gave nice strawberry red tint to my black hair.</li>
            <li>I have a relaxer and this made my relaxed african american hair feel soooooo strong.</li>
            <li>I just mixed it with warm water and a little bit of coconut oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But other than that,  my scalp dandruff is much calmed, and the hair is super shiny.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised of the smell, it smells like tea</li>
            <li>Was from a 2 year old crop  </li>
            <li>This works wonders on my 4a natural hair</li>
            <li>My hair is incredibly soft and silky.</li>
            <li>and i noticed a considerable difference in my hair than when I wasn&#x27;t using it.</li>
            <li>and it was so silky soft.</li>
            <li>This gives soft hair just like Amla.</li>
            <li>I miss a little with shikakai and my hair feels clean and soft</li>
            <li>1 week later I tried again using chamomile tea and a black tea bag (strongly steeped), instead of water.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is really good, I put it over my already bleached and toned hair (I&#x27;m naturally a dark dirty blonde but have been bleaching out my hair to get it to light neutral blonde), and it hasn&#x27;t changed my hair color.</li>
            <li>I have fairly thick, fine, blonde, nearly waist-length hair.</li>
            <li>The skin on your scalp is super thin, plus leaving that gunk on your hair for 30-45 minutes ensures you are absorbing poisons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also really hard to get it rinsed out of your hair and clean up your shower afterwards.</li>
            <li>Prefer this to henna (too drying no matter my recipe) for my 4a natural African American soft/fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have natural &#x27;mousey-brown&#x27; hair with lots of &#x27;mousey&#x27; grey.</li>
            <li>I used half of a packet for my shoulder-length hair that has a habit of getting greasy fast.</li>
            <li>I only use coconut oil ONLY on the ends after I wash the Senna off, air dry my hair and my hair is thick, luxurious and golden after!</li>

            <li> Prefer this to henna (too drying no matter my recipe) for my 4a natural African American soft/fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have natural &#x27;mousey-brown&#x27; hair with lots of &#x27;mousey&#x27; grey.</li>

            <li> I only use coconut oil ONLY on the ends after I wash the Senna off, air dry my hair and my hair is thick, luxurious and golden after!</li>
            <li> However, when using a natural product be prepared to deal with some down sides.</li>
            <li> My thick, curly natural AfricanAmerican hair is protein sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Regular monthly use has thickened my hair and helped to reduce single strand and fairy knots.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the basic product was as expected, looked like powdered green henna (though it isn&#x27;t) mixed very well, and gave the expected results on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed with the product, but once it&#x27;s all gone (I only used about half or less on midback, thick, curly hair)</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, was because this batch was a little gritty.  </li>
            <li> This is coming from dry brittle lifeless breaking hair to me swaying my hair saying</li>
            <li> Very dry.  </li>
            <li> It definitely adds moisture and body to dry limp hair.</li>
            <li> But, nothing a little sifting and extra conditioner coudln&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> My fault, I should have read carefully.  </li>
            <li> This is not real Henna.</li>
            <li> I generally keep it in my hair over night, or at least 5-6 hours.</li>
            <li> Will order again, it came faster than expected!</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t give color to dark hair.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the mess</li>
            <li> The consistancy was almost like cake batter or a little thicker because i didnt want it to be runny.</li>
            <li> I just mix it with water and put it on my hair overnight or for a few hours</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I got a keratin treatment and didn&#x27;t like the feel of my hair since.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good too disappointed</li>
            <li> I do not think this is a mehndi powder, this is the worst mehndi powder i ever bought.  </li>

            <li> Having grey/white hair and knowing how toxic (and untested) the chemicals in commercial dyes are, I was frantic to find something more natural. The skin on your scalp is super thin, plus leaving that gunk on your hair for 30-45 minutes ensures you are absorbing poisons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching this, (and stopping by several Indian groceries which never heard of it), I decided to chance it.  The first time I tried this, (leaving this mud mixture in my hair surrounding my scalp in plastic wrap for 4 hours), it left a light wheat color to my roots. 1 week later I tried again using chamomile tea and a black tea bag (strongly steeped), instead of water.  The results were a golden blond, which attractive, is still a bit light for me.  I plan to add sage with chamomile in the next two weeks, which according to some websites, should darker things to an ash blond. With white hair you need to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that,  my scalp dandruff is much calmed, and the hair is super shiny.  As I have seen better prices for this in larger packages, I will probably look for another vendor in the future for this.</li>
            <li> This made my hair really strong! I have a relaxer and this made my relaxed african american hair feel soooooo strong. I just mixed it with warm water and a little bit of coconut oil. The consistancy was almost like cake batter or a little thicker because i didnt want it to be runny.I then walked around the house with it on my hair for about 2 hours with a plastic cap on and washed it out with conditioner;then deep conditioned.On top of that delivery was super fast. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I loved this on my hair, it made it soft. I really recommend.</li>
            <li> Used it as a facial, very good.</li>
            <li> Worked great just like I hoped it would. Was from a 2 year old crop  but it still did fine. Will order again, it came faster than expected!</li>
            <li> satisfied with the product results. 50% this powder &amp; 50% Heena gave nice strawberry red tint to my black hair. I was happy with the shipping process as well. Will definitely return to buy again</li>
            <li> Cassia Obovata Senna Powder does exactly what it says it will.  It definitely adds moisture and body to dry limp hair.</li>
            <li> Love it , just what I wanted to mix with amla and red henna, and indigo for a more brunette color on my gray hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good too disappointed</li>
            <li> I have natural &#x27;mousey-brown&#x27; hair with lots of &#x27;mousey&#x27; grey. I bought light brown henna and blonde henna to not color it again. Can this product be added to the Henna? And for those of you who worked with this product before, what color do you think this product plus the light brown and blonde Henna turn out to be on my hair? I plan on using Chamomile Tea to try to keep things on the light side. Am I doing the correct thing? Should I purchase this product? As you can probably tell, this will be my first experience with Henna and I&#x27;m really nervous.</li>
            <li> This works wonders on my 4a natural hair I am definitely a hennahead but this is great if you are scared to try henna and want to experiment. My hair is so smooth and feels really healthy after using this product. I also experience less breakage and get so many compliments on my hair. It is easy to use I just mix it with water and put it on my hair overnight or for a few hours it does not stain so clean up is a breeze. Will keep buying this product over and over again!</li>
            <li> Product was fair.  The henna was old and didn&#x27;t dye very well.  I found a better henna supplier that doesn&#x27;t sell on amazon.  Just google henna and you will find this wonderful lady who know all about henna and sells the best product.</li>
            <li> Fresh cassia and it worked well.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick, fine, blonde, nearly waist-length hair. 100g of cassia was the perfect amount for me. I mixed it with warm water until it was the consistency of cake batter, then glooped the mud all over my head, put on a shower cap and a towel, and left it on for an hour. It was gritty and difficult to rinse out, but the results are marvelous! My hair is incredibly soft and silky. It feels heavier and thicker and looks slightly more golden. It&#x27;s also a tad straighter. I now feel like I have fairy tale hair! This is a quality product and I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister to condition her hair, she has noticed a big difference in the texture and softness. She has some left but I can only assume she will want me to get her more.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using cassia obovata and I was nervous. I was transitioning when i used this the first time along with alma powder for the first time and i noticed a considerable difference in my hair than when I wasn&#x27;t using it. My hair was so much easier to de-tangle and it was so silky soft. I&#x27;m not going to doubt either of the products because obviously something worked.&lt;br /&gt;And I was very surprised of the smell, it smells like tea and I love tea!</li>
            <li> The product was alright. I didn&#x27;t see much difference but now my hair is a bit sandy brown in the front.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff.  It is perfect for my naturally curly 3c/4a type hair and it leaves it soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This product has proven to be great!  I look forward to ordering more product ...soon.  This product is going to bring luster to my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.It&#x27;s a great transition if you are thinking of switching from chemical dye to henna. Great for deep conditioning. After having it on it was like my hair on crack. It had a lot more body, shine, moisture, and poofed a bit more out of the root. Also, I heard that people say it makes curly hair straighter or more relaxed, however my hair had been so damaged it wouldn&#x27;t curl anymore not even with a hot iron. Now it has more body and strength, and it really holds the curls when i use a curling iron into the next day even with no product in it! And I only used about 3-4 tablespoons cassia w/ camomile tea, conditioner, and coconut milk/oil for my shoulder length hair. This is coming from dry brittle lifeless breaking hair to me swaying my hair saying yes, yes, YES!!! like a herbal essences commercial but this stuff is the real deal and has me convinced to stay far away from chemicals from now on! I will be using it again when I dye with henna. It&#x27;s legit! Too legit to quit!!! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  My thick, curly natural AfricanAmerican hair is protein sensitive.  For me, Cassia &amp; Henna mimic the strengthening of protein treatments, without the damage.  If you want the benefits of henna, without the color highlights or the clean up, cassia is a good choice.  It isn&#x27;t as potent as henna, so you don&#x27;t get the same soothing effect.  But, overall it is an excellent product.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, was because this batch was a little gritty.  But, nothing a little sifting and extra conditioner coudln&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good, I put it over my already bleached and toned hair (I&#x27;m naturally a dark dirty blonde but have been bleaching out my hair to get it to light neutral blonde), and it hasn&#x27;t changed my hair color. it does add some golden-y tones and maybe a bit of warmth to your hair, but I really like it that way. This gives it some conditioning and a nice gloss. I generally keep it in my hair over night, or at least 5-6 hours.</li>
            <li> This gives soft hair just like Amla. But it doesn&#x27;t give color to dark hair. I miss a little with shikakai and my hair feels clean and soft</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and will continue to use it!! I have thin hair with a lot of breakage, and this stuff is doing wonders for it.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and this seller is good too.</li>
            <li> Henna helps the hair maintain a nice soft red highlight. It also strengthens the hair to make it thicker. Henna acts like a protein on the hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make purchase for myself but it came in good condition and it looked ok.  Most of the product was used as soon as received.</li>
            <li> The product did not arrive in the packaging depicted in the picture, but I expect that, how many times have you gone to the store to pick something up and found that they&#x27;d modified the packaging? Other than that the basic product was as expected, looked like powdered green henna (though it isn&#x27;t) mixed very well, and gave the expected results on my daughters hair. I will definitely be purchasing more of this in the future, both for my daughter and for my Mother in Law who saw the results and wanted to try it for herself.</li>
            <li> I love Cassia as it is very gentle on the hair. It smells amazing, as well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the product in a timely manner and it was listed at a great price!! :)</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased cassia obovata.  I used it last summer and loved the results.  A few weeks ago I got a keratin treatment and didn&#x27;t like the feel of my hair since.  Very dry.  I purchased cassia obovata again and applied it to my hair and it is the best feeling hair you could imagine.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it. I suggest applying to damp hair for an easier application.  I also put a few drops of lavender oil and it smells great. If you don&#x27;t mind the mess it is well worth the time and it&#x27;s affordable too!</li>
            <li> I have strawberry blonde hair, and I have stopped using commercial shampoos for over 3 years. For 2.5 years (after a botched baking soda and vinegar attempt at shampooing) I found Senna powder and this has become my shampoo ever since. I only use coconut oil ONLY on the ends after I wash the Senna off, air dry my hair and my hair is thick, luxurious and golden after!</li>
            <li> It darkened my bleach blonde to a darker brassy blonde. I like the way it made my hair feel but I can&#x27;t stand the color.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Fast shipping.  Prefer this to henna (too drying no matter my recipe) for my 4a natural African American soft/fine hair.  Adds strength nd elasticity AND BODY without changing my blue/black indigo color.  Regular monthly use has thickened my hair and helped to reduce single strand and fairy knots.  I added just very warm distilled water and a tablespoon of EVOO.  Mixed it.  Let it sit for 2 hours in a bowl covered and let it sit on my hair for 2 hours with a shower cap.  Then follow up with coconut oil deep conditioning treatment under a shower cap with a heating cap for 30 minutes max.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this neutral henna doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will, because it did soften and sooth my hair. However, when using a natural product be prepared to deal with some down sides. This does not come with any instructions (okay since I had some from a book about natural hair care) so you&#x27;ll need some of your own. It is also really hard to get it rinsed out of your hair and clean up your shower afterwards. I&#x27;m not disappointed with the product, but once it&#x27;s all gone (I only used about half or less on midback, thick, curly hair) I don&#x27;t plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> My fault, I should have read carefully.  Henna is Lawsonia inermis.  This is not real Henna. It is powdered senna. It doesn&#x27;t smell at all appealing and did not leave my hair softer or in better condition. I have used REAL henna and it is far superior to this stuff. I would like to know who came up with the idea of using this stuff for hair and passing it off as \\&quot;neutral henna\\&quot;. Now that I know the latin name for real henna, I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I do not think this is a mehndi powder, this is the worst mehndi powder i ever bought.  Please do not buy it, this mehndi have no color what so ever, even if you can put it on for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and rinse out. It gave my hair body and shine. I used half of a packet for my shoulder-length hair that has a habit of getting greasy fast. I will repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I think this is an okay product. After using it I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to stay moisturized but it was worth a try. I wont be using it again only because I have a fear of treatments to begin with but I see that people love using it.</li>
