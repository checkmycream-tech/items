            <li>I was so thrilled to find it on Amazon and ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>I have been using these citrus sprays for years now, I like them the best, other brands don&#x27;t spray well or not at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean orange scent eliminates odors quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>Their other scents are fine, but we like the orange the best.</li>

            <li>The SELLER did a FANTASTIC and quick job of sending the product, though!</li>
            <li>The smell of Orange-Mate mist is fantastic and a must have to impress your guests.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE FRESH SMELL OF ORANGES</li>
            <li>Now I find that it&#x27;s very useful</li>
            <li>I originally bought it when my dog was a puppy</li>
            <li>this is such a great smell - you would think that someone was slicing fresh oranges right under your nose!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like any of the other scents, including lemon, but the orange is great to dispel odors.  </li>
            <li>:) Will be back:)</li>
            <li>Last a long time and works real good on bathroom odors...</li>
            <li>I also have not been able to be a the price except when ordering directly in a case lot.</li>
            <li>AND IT MAKES MY HOME SMELL FRESH.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh natural scent of this product.  </li>
            <li>Smells like fresh cut oranges.</li>
            <li>Kinda pricy but worth it .</li>
            <li>: it smells exactly like a freshly sliced orange.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something that really smells like oranges - this does!</li>
            <li>Exactly the product I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy more of this product in the future....</li>
            <li>It is like peeling an orange for real!</li>
            <li>Therefore I followed her advise and am extremely pleased with the product and will continue to purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for our bathroom and it really smells like orange!  </li>
            <li>Last one lasted a year or more...</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>No synthetic ingredients to taint the real citrus smell.</li>
            <li>smells like you just peeled an orange, because it&#x27;s made with real citrus oils...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and I am not one to use them very</li>
            <li>I also worry about inhaling a lot of chemicals, and the ingredients in this are about as natural as you can get (the can lists the ingredients as &amp;#34;Pure, natural orange oils and concentrated orange essence from fresh oranges&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>and you can spray it on a cloth and clean things  like the sticky residue left over from taking the labels off of things.</li>
            <li>So natural and orange smell is like real oranges.  </li>
            <li>You can often find it in a supermarket for $8, but if that&#x27;s not convenient, the extra money is worth it for delivery.</li>
            <li>There are other flavors, such as lemon, but orange is our favorite.</li>
            <li>Comes in other citrus odors, such as grapefruit, lime, lemon, but the orange has always been my favorite.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, the bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li>That was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s all natural orange oils</li>
            <li>This is GREAT for persistent unpleasant smells, whether it be the bathroom or kitchen or where ever.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is I received two (out of all that I have ordered) that had &amp;#34;faulty&amp;#34; spray things on top.</li>
            <li>Unlike other air fresheners, this orange has a very pleasing natural smell.</li>
            <li>they have never called back or responded other than the first contact I had about the product.</li>
            <li>Smells just like fresh oranges and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Not overwhelming - just right.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> unbelievably DOES absolutely cover up pet smells</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so the can last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> so I tried to find it locally and was not able to locate it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to spray and the other one leaked out ALL THE INGREDIENTS from a faulty sprayer .</li>
            <li> It only takes a tiny bit to get rid of unpleasant odors, so a single can will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is oil based, so you need to be a little careful on what you spray it on.</li>
            <li> All I know is that it completely gets rid of bad smells and the scent it has only lasts for a short time.</li>
            <li> So I roll my windows down on the way home.</li>
            <li> When one lot  f&#x3D;ew years ago had bad spray-tip; they exchanged the product quickly with no questions asked.</li>
            <li> but the product is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> It ran down onto the plastic I had it sitting on and actually MELTED it :-(  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they appear to have gone through a bad batch of containers and spray mechanisms.</li>
            <li> Not like something artificial but like there might be orange juice in it.</li>
            <li> I dislike artificial fragrances, and there&#x27;s nothing artificial about this</li>
            <li> I use in my car, bedroom, bath and kitchen whenever I want to get rid of  bad smells.</li>
            <li> What is even worse, their customer service is terrible.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> cats hate citrus fruit smell were stressed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff!  A little bit goes a long way!  Get rid of all the flowery stuff and use this!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like any of the other scents, including lemon, but the orange is great to dispel odors.  I use it mostly in the bathroom.  You can often find it in a supermarket for $8, but if that&#x27;s not convenient, the extra money is worth it for delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that really smells like oranges - this does! Great smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It unbelievably DOES absolutely cover up pet smells, cigarette smoke smells, anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrific product!</li>
            <li> My household has been using this product since 1993. it&#x27;s the best natural orange airfreshener, you don&#x27;t much to make room smells fresh and delicious.</li>
            <li> This is GREAT for persistent unpleasant smells, whether it be the bathroom or kitchen or where ever. It&#x27;s clean orange scent eliminates odors quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> The smell of Orange-Mate mist is fantastic and a must have to impress your guests.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.  Exactly the product I was looking for.</li>
            <li> . . .because there two big sh_ _ters in our home. Once the bathroom is wrecked, one of us pulls out this baby and. . .poof. . .no more wrecked bathroom. Works just as well when wind is broke too! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Great alternative to febreeze. This spray is not an aerosol so I keep it in my glove box. I use it to get rid of the smell of my dog&#x27;s breath in my car. When she pants a lot it just smells like...fish and dog food. It&#x27;s gross. So I roll my windows down on the way home. And then spray my car when the dog is gone. It smells like orange juice. Not like something artificial but like there might be orange juice in it. I doubt there is. Maybe there is. I don&#x27;t know. All I know is that it completely gets rid of bad smells and the scent it has only lasts for a short time. It aids in covering up a smell and in the end makes that smell disappear. I&#x27;m glad I have it. I originally bought it when my dog was a puppy and she peed in my car. Now I find that it&#x27;s very useful and I&#x27;m glad we have it. I&#x27;ll probably buy more of this product in the future....maybe for the bathroom!</li>
            <li> Fantastic and authentic orange smell. It is like peeling an orange for real!</li>
            <li> A product I keep reordering - it&#x27;s the best smelling air freshener I&#x27;ve found, at a very reasonable price. When one lot  f&#x3D;ew years ago had bad spray-tip; they exchanged the product quickly with no questions asked. Their other scents are fine, but we like the orange the best. I also have not been able to be a the price except when ordering directly in a case lot.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE FRESH SMELL OF ORANGES AND IT MAKES MY HOME SMELL FRESH. AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE. THANK YOU . MRS. DAVIS  :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product before but it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve found the orange scent. We were running out of the lime spray. This is very natural-smelling and does a good job of dispelling bathroom odors. Not overwhelming - just right.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh natural scent of this product.  I used it 20 years ago in college and never forgot how much I liked it.  I was so thrilled to find it on Amazon and ordered it right away.  It is just as good as I remember.  No synthetic ingredients to taint the real citrus smell.</li>
            <li> When first using Orange Mate Air Freshener many years ago it was a great product. Unfortunately they appear to have gone through a bad batch of containers and spray mechanisms. What is even worse, their customer service is terrible. When contacted, you must send the product back at your cost and you are told they will check it out and contact you if they can replace it. I have sent two back and no contact. I have the tracking number that shows it was received. Then I call again and tell the person my story. T Hey promise to call me back. they have never called back or responded other than the first contact I had about the product. Makes me wonder if they are still in business. Even had the BBB contact them and again no call back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Covers smells ranging from fecal matter to burnt bacon. Yes, we&#x27;ve used it for both situations. Unlike other air fresheners, this orange has a very pleasing natural smell. It is oil based, so you need to be a little careful on what you spray it on. There are other flavors, such as lemon, but orange is our favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells just like fresh oranges and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this is such a great smell - you would think that someone was slicing fresh oranges right under your nose!</li>
            <li> My sister uses this product and I visited her and asked what the scent was. She showed me the canister so I tried to find it locally and was not able to locate it. She advised me to go on line because that is how she gets it. Therefore I followed her advise and am extremely pleased with the product and will continue to purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best air freshener I&#x27;ve ever found.  I dislike artificial fragrances, and there&#x27;s nothing artificial about this: it smells exactly like a freshly sliced orange.  I also worry about inhaling a lot of chemicals, and the ingredients in this are about as natural as you can get (the can lists the ingredients as &amp;#34;Pure, natural orange oils and concentrated orange essence from fresh oranges&amp;#34;).  It only takes a tiny bit to get rid of unpleasant odors, so a single can will last a long time.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough.</li>
            <li> Learned about product when I stayed at B&amp;B in Wihmette Valley Oregon. So natural and orange smell is like real oranges.  Great deodorizer</li>
            <li> The spray definitely smelled like orange but was overpowering.  It was like the \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; orange smell instead of a comforting aroma to fill your home.  The SELLER did a FANTASTIC and quick job of sending the product, though!</li>
            <li> I took a can to work for the office bathroom, and immediately everyone was asking me where I got it:  smells like you just peeled an orange, because it&#x27;s made with real citrus oils... completely natural fragrance and makes the room smell GREAT.  Have been buying this for years and love it.  Comes in other citrus odors, such as grapefruit, lime, lemon, but the orange has always been my favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells just like oranges - love the scent!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tolerate the chemical sprays, this seems to work for people with asthma</li>
            <li> I have been using these citrus sprays for years now, I like them the best, other brands don&#x27;t spray well or not at all. The Mate brand clears the air and are uplifting. Great in the bathroom,kitchen is a must. Best of the best.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so the can last a long time.  It leave a pleasant odor.  I use it in my bathroom all the time.</li>
            <li> Orange Mate is the best air freshener around! Have used for years. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works well in the bathroom or the litterbox area. Smells like fresh cut oranges. When I use this one up, I want to try the lime fragrance!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for our bathroom and it really smells like orange!  It masks the odor but the product is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells nice, &amp; kills any odor.  I think the orange oil droplets envelop the stinky particles, &amp; essentially overpower them. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.....it doesn&#x27;t mask odors it takes them away. Another plus is it is orange oil and you can spray it on a cloth and clean things  like the sticky residue left over from taking the labels off of things. The only complaint I have is I received two (out of all that I have ordered) that had &amp;#34;faulty&amp;#34; spray things on top. One I had to adjust everytime I wanted to spray and the other one leaked out ALL THE INGREDIENTS from a faulty sprayer . It ran down onto the plastic I had it sitting on and actually MELTED it :-(  That was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is the best room spray I&#x27;ve ever used.....and I am not one to use them very often./  Bed and Bath used to carry it but doesn&#x27;t any mnore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am  very happy I can get it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Thank you love this spray.  And it&#x27;s all natural orange oils so you can breath after spraying:) Great transaction!:) Will be back:)</li>
            <li> These are all we use in my house now. Worth the price, the bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> These air fresheners are the very best.  Expensive, but worth it.  Non-areasol, just a puff of orange!  We buy the orange, lime &amp; lemon.  All are good.</li>
            <li> scent too overpowering. postage extortionate. one sniff without spraying made cats run away. cats hate citrus fruit smell were stressed</li>
            <li> Last a long time and works real good on bathroom odors... Last one lasted a year or more... Kinda pricy but worth it .</li>
            <li> Product spray comes out well and the smell is heaven!  I use in my car, bedroom, bath and kitchen whenever I want to get rid of  bad smells.</li>
