            <li>Nice and roomy inside, can fit quite a few things in the bag.  </li>

            <li>Totally love this especially for the price!!</li>
            <li>So pretty and well made.</li>
            <li>I had already received one from my mom and thought it was so pretty, I decided to buy one as a gift for my boyfriend&#x27;s sister.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t quite sure if it would be too big or not.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so pretty to have in your bag.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I actually used it for my compact DSLR because I wanted to be able to take it with me in my purse but have it protected.</li>
            <li>It is really pretty, not expensive at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>so pretty.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cute and bigger</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised as to how much I could fit inside.</li>
            <li>Just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real spring picker-upper.</li>
            <li>and they were very ahppy.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping also.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the gold trimming around it too much</li>
            <li>The color really pops.</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected but its cute and cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more pink than purple (which I happen to like).</li>
            <li>Just as I expected .it&#x27;s of a good quality and roomy enough for a make up purse.</li>
            <li>Too big for my 12 year old grand to carry for school.</li>
            <li>It was better than I expected!</li>
            <li>Like the pink plastic handle, easy to grab hold of.  </li>
            <li>but the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as I am use to Lilly Pulitzer items being.</li>
            <li>Decent quality.</li>
            <li>The colors are really vibrant too.  </li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty, but much bigger</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The colors and print are gorgeous and as stated by other reviewers the color is pink rather than purple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty decent size so it definitely will get the job done!</li>
            <li>Lightweight, sturdy bag with a wide mouth (which I like because it makes things easily accessible).</li>
            <li>It has a very feminine, bold floral design, small enough to fit on your vanity and big enough to fit all your essentials.</li>
            <li>I love this Cosmetic Bag,the colors really pop out (Green and Hot Pink)</li>
            <li>Just large enough.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s so much room left.</li>
            <li>The one thing that surprised me was that it says EstÃ©e Lauder on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s roomy inside - to give you an idea, you can fit two glass cases side by side and have room for a small lens case and travel-sized contact lens cleaner (see pic).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and used material is cheap.</li>
            <li>I thought it was small enough to fit my purse</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised that it was bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I was pleasently surprised that it arrived before I went back to school.</li>
            <li>Gave this as gifts to my girl cousins last Chinese New Year</li>
            <li>Small and compact and just the right size</li>

            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite sure if it would be too big or not.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so pretty to have in your bag.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>

            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised as to how much I could fit inside.</li>
            <li> Just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real spring picker-upper.</li>
            <li> and they were very ahppy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping also.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the gold trimming around it too much</li>
            <li> The color really pops.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but its cute and cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more pink than purple (which I happen to like).</li>
            <li> Just as I expected .it&#x27;s of a good quality and roomy enough for a make up purse.</li>
            <li> Too big for my 12 year old grand to carry for school.</li>
            <li> It was better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Like the pink plastic handle, easy to grab hold of.  </li>
            <li> but the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as I am use to Lilly Pulitzer items being.</li>
            <li> Decent quality.</li>
            <li> The colors are really vibrant too.  </li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty, but much bigger</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The colors and print are gorgeous and as stated by other reviewers the color is pink rather than purple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty decent size so it definitely will get the job done!</li>
            <li> Lightweight, sturdy bag with a wide mouth (which I like because it makes things easily accessible).</li>
            <li> It has a very feminine, bold floral design, small enough to fit on your vanity and big enough to fit all your essentials.</li>
            <li> I love this Cosmetic Bag,the colors really pop out (Green and Hot Pink)</li>
            <li> Just large enough.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s so much room left.</li>
            <li> The one thing that surprised me was that it says EstÃ©e Lauder on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s roomy inside - to give you an idea, you can fit two glass cases side by side and have room for a small lens case and travel-sized contact lens cleaner (see pic).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and used material is cheap.</li>
            <li> I thought it was small enough to fit my purse</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised that it was bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised that it arrived before I went back to school.</li>
            <li> Gave this as gifts to my girl cousins last Chinese New Year</li>
            <li> Small and compact and just the right size</li>
            <li> Well constructed, with an extra long zipper pull.  </li>
            <li> I just got these two cuties and they are way bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit bigger than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> It came in earlier than the date expected, so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li> Way too long and expensive to fit in your purse</li>
            <li> The material is durable and thick which I appreciated as well.</li>
            <li> one is for my make up and the other are for my deodorant big on and comb brush for my upcoming vacation.</li>
            <li> My old cosmetic bag was too small, so I purchased this Estee lauder one.  </li>
            <li> The expected delivery date is in a week from today.</li>
            <li> It arrived in as little as 2 days</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a little pocket sleeve inside for q-tips and/or</li>
            <li> It fits well in my everyday purse</li>
            <li> but I have a small purse.</li>
            <li> but that is just a small thing.</li>

            <li> Great colors for spring and a bit bigger than I expected which was great. Came on time, which is a plus. The reason I gave it 4 and not five was because there were just some stray threads that i had to cut off but that is just a small thing.</li>
