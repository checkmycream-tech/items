    <ol>
            <li>awesome for the fall!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I am of tan complexion so these are perfect for me</li>
            <li>Great matte!</li>
            <li>Jordana has some of the best lipstick out there.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful choice for brown girls in search of the nude look and you can&#x27;t beat this price!  </li>
            <li>Especially love the color 38.</li>
            <li>Great quality for the price!</li>
            <li>Beautiful fall colored lipsticks!  </li>
            <li>The colors are perfect!</li>
            <li>but the waxy smell seemed incredibly insignificant compared to the hell I went through with this purchase.</li>
            <li>go on great</li>
            <li>Great colors for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and has great color.  </li>
            <li>lipstick looks GREAT on brown/dark brown skin tones.</li>
            <li>I use it when I go out very nice</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is very nice.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good productðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but they smell pleasant :)</li>
            <li>Great set, they go on smooth and stay after eating and drinking.</li>
            <li>It comes off very easily.</li>
            <li>I gave the Brick shade to a friend who has a fair complexion and it looked fine on her.</li>
            <li>and they go on nice and smooth and even.</li>
            <li>but It wasn&#x27;t that many</li>
            <li>Love product.</li>
            <li>Cafe is more of a nude.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I really love the lipstick that I do use .</li>
            <li>These lipsticks by Jordana are just as good as higher end lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Pretty and the gift was nice</li>
            <li>CHEAP MATERIAL, COULDV&#x27;E ATLEAST WARNED THAT IT</li>
            <li>These are really a great deal especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Not to mention the free pair of earrings.  </li>
            <li>NEVER received my free pair of earrings.</li>
            <li>Just beware buyers, don&#x27;t let someone trick you into purchasing a product that promises a free gift.</li>
            <li>very pigmented, they&#x27;re more of a mauve color (taupe cafe) which is my favorite type of shade.</li>
            <li>So, so far so good.</li>
            <li>however I  love very much.</li>
            <li>They smell a little like chocolate but the quality isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try them on with a full look.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a nice price if you just want to try out some natural brown shades.</li>
            <li>Overall I love the colors and get more when I&#x27;m done with these.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and smooth application.</li>
            <li>I you like lipsticks in a matte finish, these are worth a try.</li>
            <li>Colors not as expected but good quality lipsticks for the price.</li>
            <li>The quality and color of this lipstick easily competes with the high end brands.  </li>
            <li>Brown is more of a red but very pretty</li>
            <li>I like all of the lipsticks, gave me exactly what I was wanting to try out.</li>
            <li>Although, the shade Brown 17 was more red than I thought.</li>
            <li>When I first put them on they did look drying on my lips, but I&#x27;m going to do what I always do when applying my lipstick.</li>
            <li>I moisturize me lips with chapstick first.</li>
            <li>Good colors, not long lasting at all.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty much</li>
            <li>Brown is very brown, cafe has a sense of brown and orange-ish, while taupe is nude brown (I attached a picture of me in &amp;#34;Taupe&amp;#34;.)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been searching for the dupes, you know, matte lipsticks that stay a long time and smooth on my lips.</li>
            <li>I love all three colors, I am African American and the lip sticks go well with my caramel complexion.</li>
            <li>I love Kat Von D&#x27;s lipsticks but for me, the price can be a little high sometimes.</li>
            <li>While this lipstick goes on smooth and is matte, the color is not as expected.</li>
            <li>Then you can see the true color and not mixed with your natural lip color.</li>
            <li>My favorite between the 3 is the taupe color, although, the other 2 I would definitely still wear.</li>
            <li>(just lightly dust some powder on your lips to make them a little paler).</li>
            <li>So I have shades: nude, natural and coco malt too.</li>
            <li>I like them so far.</li>
            <li>The cafe is very orange and the brown 16 is a bit too red for my liking.</li>
            <li>Both the Brick and Taupe have a chocolate like scent to them (yummy), but the Cafe has an old lipstick scent to it.</li>
            <li>I hoped that I could find some decent matte lipsticks, the first issue was that it didn&#x27;t come on time, the delivery information wasn&#x27;t updated and I had to contact customer service, I read other reviews saying something similar</li>
            <li>The other colors included Taupe and Cafe were fine and as expected.</li>
            <li>I actually ordered this set and the natural set too.</li>

            <li> Dosent last long and the colors all kinda look the same,</li>
            <li> Nices shades and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m aware of how matte lipsticks are, but this was just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Secondly, The lipsticks we&#x27;re very dry.</li>
            <li> Very similar to Kat Von D&#x27;s matte mauve pink nude.</li>
            <li> It is matte which can be a little dry (not as dry as Nyx soft matte)</li>
            <li> The matte does swatch as matte but doesn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li> But the colours were not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Brown 17 is not what i expected</li>
            <li> I like the other colors as well.</li>
            <li> Not made for black women.</li>
            <li> Just a tips, if you want the color of these lipsticks to appear as it is, you may need to powder your lips a little bit</li>
            <li> so I add a little bit of lip gloss after applying.</li>
            <li> I use Taupe as my everyday nude lipstick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to wear it for a few hours, I think I may need to re-touch after 4-5 hours - which is not a problem because usually I retouch my lipstick every 4-5 hours anyway.</li>
            <li> The smell of the lipsticks was a little disturbing.</li>
            <li> Not happy with product.</li>
            <li> I opened them and smelled them immediately because I never want a weird crayon smell or just a plastic one on my lips all day</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable to a point.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I got rid of it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could&#x27;ve said a waxy smell was the worst part</li>

I opened them and smelled them immediately because I never want a weird crayon smell or just a plastic one on my lips all day but they smell pleasant :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They go on great and I am of tan complexion so these are perfect for me and they go on nice and smooth and even. I can&#x27;t wait to try them on with a full look.</li>
            <li> i like the cafe color but the others are alright</li>
            <li> I hoped that I could find some decent matte lipsticks, the first issue was that it didn&#x27;t come on time, the delivery information wasn&#x27;t updated and I had to contact customer service, I read other reviews saying something similar but It wasn&#x27;t that many so I figured I&#x27;d still buy it... I should&#x27;ve listened. Secondly, The lipsticks we&#x27;re very dry. Uncomfortable to a point. I&#x27;m aware of how matte lipsticks are, but this was just ridiculous. I wish I could&#x27;ve said a waxy smell was the worst part but the waxy smell seemed incredibly insignificant compared to the hell I went through with this purchase. I do not see myself ever buying Jordana again.</li>
            <li> I use it when I go out very nice</li>
            <li> Great colors for my skin tone. Love product. Arrived on time. Great matte!</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this set and the natural set too. So I have shades: nude, natural and coco malt too. I like them so far. I like the colors and the consistency. The matte does swatch as matte but doesn&#x27;t feel dry. So that&#x27;s good. I haven&#x27;t worn them yet, but I plan on wearing one today. So, so far so good.</li>
            <li> The smell of the lipsticks was a little disturbing. Take some time to get used to.</li>
            <li> Not made for black women.</li>
            <li> I like all of the lipsticks, gave me exactly what I was wanting to try out. Although, the shade Brown 17 was more red than I thought. I like the other colors as well. Cafe is more of a nude. And taupe is pinkish/light purple tan color. They&#x27;re a nice price if you just want to try out some natural brown shades. Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Good productðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Feels and smells like crayons when applying</li>
            <li> Very creamy and smooth application. But the colours were not what I expected. The cafe is very orange and the brown 16 is a bit too red for my liking.</li>
            <li> Jordana has some of the best lipstick out there.  It&#x27;s creamy and has great color.  This is a wonderful choice for brown girls in search of the nude look and you can&#x27;t beat this price!  Not to mention the free pair of earrings.  The quality and color of this lipstick easily competes with the high end brands.  It is matte which can be a little dry (not as dry as Nyx soft matte) so I add a little bit of lip gloss after applying.</li>
            <li> Good colors, not long lasting at all. Maybe an hour.</li>
            <li> Especially love the color 38.</li>
            <li> Brown 17 is not what i expected but these came on time</li>
            <li> The product itself was great(no complaints with packaging, colors,ect)&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick looks GREAT on brown/dark brown skin tones. I use Taupe as my everyday nude lipstick. To give this color some &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; I line my lips with a brownish red liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue, however, is with the advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I NEVER received my free pair of earrings. HM? Just beware buyers, don&#x27;t let someone trick you into purchasing a product that promises a free gift.</li>
            <li> Nices shades and long lasting.  Great quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Great set, they go on smooth and stay after eating and drinking.</li>
            <li> These lipsticks by Jordana are just as good as higher end lipsticks. I you like lipsticks in a matte finish, these are worth a try.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fall colored lipsticks!  Matte isn&#x27;t too drying on the lips. Love. Love. Love.</li>
            <li> I love all three colors, I am African American and the lip sticks go well with my caramel complexion. When I first put them on they did look drying on my lips, but I&#x27;m going to do what I always do when applying my lipstick. I moisturize me lips with chapstick first. Overall I love the colors and get more when I&#x27;m done with these.</li>
            <li> Love it! The colors are perfect!</li>
            <li> I really love the lipstick that I do use . I&#x27;m the type of person who once i find what I like that&#x27;s pretty much my go to . I only use one religiously but I do occasionally use the others . The one that I do use I however I  love very much.</li>
            <li> Colors not as expected but good quality lipsticks for the price.</li>
            <li> It was not as matted as it had been described. It took a lot to make it apply evenly. Not happy with product.</li>
            <li> They smell a little like chocolate but the quality isn&#x27;t very good. It comes off very easily.</li>
            <li> They smell like coffee or possibly chocolate. That would probably be a selling point for some but I personally did like it. The pigmentation is very nice.</li>
            <li> While this lipstick goes on smooth and is matte, the color is not as expected. I was expecting it to be Brick which is orange with a hint of brown, but when applied it was orange but then maybe my tan complexion was to blame. The other colors included Taupe and Cafe were fine and as expected. Both the Brick and Taupe have a chocolate like scent to them (yummy), but the Cafe has an old lipstick scent to it. Needless to say I got rid of it. I gave the Brick shade to a friend who has a fair complexion and it looked fine on her.</li>
