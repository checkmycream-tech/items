            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>the Daniel kern method smells good too great price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>I strongly believe this is the best acne prevention regimen ever!</li>
            <li>They must have changed their formula which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>but assuming it&#x27;s good, I give it 4 out of 5 stars..</li>
            <li>Delivered in good time to London, UK.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I tried this!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I can truly say it works amazing.</li>
            <li>So those need time to heal and go away on their own.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found it to be just as effective as the acne.org line of benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>Super happy with this product.</li>
            <li>it was kind of grainy, but this time it&#x27;s nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>For me, it was more like 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I for sure will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>before it felt like a watery gel (kinda like aloe) and now it seems more creamy and it spreads easier.  </li>
            <li>I hope they continue to offer this at such a great price!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for something that works as well a discontinued product that I enjoyed (AcneFree 2% BZ gel), but this will do.</li>
            <li>Closer to the acne.org product at a more tolerable cost.</li>
            <li>Overall, awesome product!</li>
            <li>but this is a better price and works just as well.</li>
            <li>A+ stuff at a cheaper price than Acne.org :)</li>
            <li>Glad I found this lotion and tried it.  </li>
            <li>but I can say this for sure when I apply it after a while</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t need to spend a fortune at acne org.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, very lightweight on the face which is awesome</li>
            <li>Great product that is considerably cheaper than acne.org.</li>
            <li>I guess this is kind of an &amp;#34;updated&amp;#34; review, meaning my opinion has changed since the first time I bought this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And yeah, it&#x27;s fine, the product came and it is 2.5% benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>The lotion is basically the same as the Dr. Lin&#x27;s formula, and is also a great cheaper alternative to the Acne.org treatment lotion.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a cheap alternative to Proactiv.</li>
            <li>Works very well and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the pump feature.</li>
            <li>u just have to use moisturizer over your treament thats all overall great</li>
            <li>but I honestly cannot live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is light, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave any after-irritation.  </li>
            <li>Works better than proactive and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>After running out relatively quickly (2 oz.</li>
            <li>Most benzoyl peroxide products have too high of a concentration and irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>The packaging is pretty cheap, though.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this product and its discounted price.</li>
            <li>and I like the new formula even better.  </li>
            <li>and I actually have gotten better results!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to make sure it is dry before putting on a shirt on going to bed because it will stain!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Acne.org regimen just like a lot of other reviewers, and this stuff really does work much better, and at a better price, too!  </li>
            <li>My skin is the most clear it&#x27;s been since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll pay for it with your face, I&#x27;m regretting it myself, ordered the acne.org one right after receiving the refund.</li>
            <li>I used Acne.org BP lotion before and this is very much like Acne and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for Benzoyl Peroxide in a 2.5 to 5% solution, that was in a large size that was economical.</li>
            <li>very light and easy to apply but leave lot of firm film</li>
            <li>Not only did this work better than the acne.org benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li>I was first using Dr. Lin&#x27;s line, as the lotion is also 2.5% benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>Pretty run of the mill stuff, but the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave it a second chance.</li>
            <li>I switched from another brand of 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide and the results are the same, for a much better price.</li>
            <li>(first purchase made in April 2014)  </li>
            <li>It seems to be working better, but I also changed my face soap at the same time so that might be contributing to my improved complexion</li>
            <li>This works exactly like acne.org</li>
            <li>I learned about this through acne.org and have always bought their form of the BP until recently when I found Dr. Song&#x27;s on amazon for a much better price.  </li>
            <li>I still get breakouts right before my period, but they seem more minor.  </li>
            <li>However, the description is pretty straight forward on the lotion part, so that&#x27;s on me.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Song&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide is strong and made my skin red.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough&lt;br /&gt;Effective against moderate acne&lt;br /&gt;Paraben free</li>
            <li>The product works, thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s acne gel that doesn&#x27;t hurt, doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily, and really helps with acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like 0%, does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s much cheaper).</li>
            <li>This was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast also</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But the important part is the actual product is inexpensive benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>and if I don&#x27;t use a gentle exfoliating tool each day then it is exacerbated by this product, but I don&#x27;t have any problems with dryness while using this product, the Olay exfoliating brush and just some Dermasil from the dollar store</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a scent to it really and it absorbs just like acne.org.</li>
            <li>And yes, this review is by a real consumer.</li>
            <li>(I use 5% tea tree on top of yours), applies easily with a nice moisturizing base, and above all the right price.</li>
            <li>You may experience some initial breakouts if you&#x27;re switching over from certain other higher priced products from infomercials, which I was. :-)</li>
            <li>To top it all off, it left a white, powdery residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>Looks to be high quality.</li>
            <li>I found this product on amazon with high ratings, so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>All in all, I would HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little bit better price.</li>
            <li>This sells for pretty much the same price as that did WITH the first-time discounts</li>
            <li>but the &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; the better, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely stick with this as long as I can!</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re somebody who uses benzoyl peroxide regularly, this product seems just fine, especially for the cost/oz.</li>
            <li>is going to get super dry and irritated.</li>
            <li>been using acne.org for years, had decent results, it was at least effective, but didn&#x27;t prevent from acne coming out, it helped kill the acne that already developed, but tried this since it&#x27;s the same % and size, but</li>
            <li>it works well on my son skin because is skin is so oily.great stuff and for myself i use it sometime just to keep my skin clear in the winter months</li>
            <li>and I depend on benzoyl peroxide each day to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>This is much easier on the wallet and maintains the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and BP is drying</li>
            <li>My back improves so much that I fool myself into thinking &amp;#34;maybe</li>
            <li>I would say make sure to use it for at least a month before making your decision.  </li>
            <li>Big fan of their products not so much of their prices and shipping.</li>
            <li>So far I can&#x27;t tell</li>
            <li>This is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>The first was ok but the actual product was gritty and left white residue when dry.</li>
            <li>much cheaper, big freaking mistake, this dries out my skin so much that my face was all flaky, YET it didn&#x27;t even do a single thing.</li>
            <li>The Acne.org BP gel took a long time to dry up on its own, felt a bit heavier, and does have an odd smell to it.  </li>
            <li>To whoever is the pure genius !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other benzoil products for over 40 years for acne.</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates my skin and and keeps the dry skin from building up.  </li>
            <li>( I been using it 3 months now so long enough for me to test the product and conclude the positive results)</li>
            <li>When you stick to the following regimen twice a day, your skin will be clear in no time:  </li>
            <li>It has helped keep my skin clear and keep my occasional bouts of cystic acne away!</li>
            <li>Keeps skin clear except for an occasional breakout.</li>
            <li>So far I only use it at night every night but now that I have a ton of it</li>
            <li>I discovered the Acne.org treatment a few months ago after watching several success videos on Youtube.</li>
            <li>The product is creamy white, thick, and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Not sure if that&#x27;s worth noting,</li>
            <li>I hate stuff that makes me feel oily all day, which is why i moved to this in the first place, and I would rate this lotion near the top of things I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and dry, apply 2.5% benzoyl peroxide and rub in well, then apply moisturizer (the moisturizer is key with BP even though many of us long-time acne sufferers are afraid of it).  </li>

            <li> been using acne.org for years, had decent results, it was at least effective, but didn&#x27;t prevent from acne coming out, it helped kill the acne that already developed, but tried this since it&#x27;s the same % and size, but</li>

            <li> Big fan of their products not so much of their prices and shipping.</li>
            <li> So far I can&#x27;t tell</li>
            <li> This is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> The first was ok but the actual product was gritty and left white residue when dry.</li>
            <li> much cheaper, big freaking mistake, this dries out my skin so much that my face was all flaky, YET it didn&#x27;t even do a single thing.</li>
            <li> The Acne.org BP gel took a long time to dry up on its own, felt a bit heavier, and does have an odd smell to it.  </li>
            <li> To whoever is the pure genius !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other benzoil products for over 40 years for acne.</li>

            <li> It has helped keep my skin clear and keep my occasional bouts of cystic acne away!</li>
            <li> Keeps skin clear except for an occasional breakout.</li>
            <li> So far I only use it at night every night but now that I have a ton of it</li>
            <li> I discovered the Acne.org treatment a few months ago after watching several success videos on Youtube.</li>
            <li> The product is creamy white, thick, and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s worth noting,</li>
            <li> I hate stuff that makes me feel oily all day, which is why i moved to this in the first place, and I would rate this lotion near the top of things I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and dry, apply 2.5% benzoyl peroxide and rub in well, then apply moisturizer (the moisturizer is key with BP even though many of us long-time acne sufferers are afraid of it).  </li>
            <li> The product from acne.org doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it does have it&#x27;s own scent, this doesn&#x27;t smell like anything (which is always nice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> This is the same product I&#x27;ve been buying from Acne.org for the last 2-3 years, except it&#x27;s missing two things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Same active ingredient</li>
            <li> lasted me a month and a half), I ordered this big guy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already been using benzoyl peroxide regularly before ordering this product, so my skin didn&#x27;t freak out, but if you&#x27;re somebody who doesn&#x27;t use benzoyl peroxide regularly, you should probably start with just a little bit and work your way up to about half a pump</li>
            <li> The only thing that happens with this pump quite often is that it gets a little clogged.</li>
            <li> But it will make a big difference in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> first batch I bought was a little coarse, scratchy and a little thin.</li>
            <li> so I tried St. Ives Blemish Control Apricot Scrub and not only is it cheaper, but it seems to be working just as well if not better)  </li>
            <li> Made zero effect to my acne, actually made worse since it never helped reduce the current acne from worsening.</li>
            <li> The only difference is this lotion after it dries leave a thin white powdery film over your skin.  </li>
            <li> When you get down to the bottom of the bottle, the pump no longer works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using about half a pump of the Dr. Song product on my face twice a day for about three weeks now, and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that this BP gel contains 1 or 2 less ingredients than the Acne.org gel.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint (albeit a small one) is the container.</li>
            <li> And I have started noticing some little rashes on my face a like one or two pimple.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still would get get a few hurtful blemishes)</li>
            <li> I still get the few hormonal pimples each month</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try Dr. Song&#x27;s brand and save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> ps I was a previous Acne.org user before I gave this a try and also have used proactiv in the past.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even come close to the quality of the Acne.org medicine I had used in the past.  </li>
            <li> The consistency has changed, it&#x27;s hard to explain how, but</li>
            <li> At least they refunded me my money</li>
            <li> Still less expensive, as for quality, I haven&#x27;t tried it yet</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant ordering because some reviewer claimed the product was fake, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot anyways.</li>
            <li> No big deal, but still sort of annoying.</li>
            <li> My back breaks out crazy bad when I&#x27;m not using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34; until two weeks late I&#x27;m breaking out something crazy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;2.)Horribly outdated and expensive shipping costs of the acne.org product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s expensive shipping.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> After a couple of years on a strict acne.org regimen, it started to get too expensive.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> it start itching me so bad!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not start using it yet but the product arrived on time and was well packaged. Looks to be high quality.</li>
            <li> The product works, thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s acne gel that doesn&#x27;t hurt, doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily, and really helps with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never tried this brand before, but I will definitely try it again considering how well it worked.  I hate stuff that makes me feel oily all day, which is why i moved to this in the first place, and I would rate this lotion near the top of things I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> You may experience some initial breakouts if you&#x27;re switching over from certain other higher priced products from infomercials, which I was. :-) (Can I say Pr****ive on here?) But give it some time. I was told a couple of weeks and my skin would adjust. For me, it was more like 3 weeks but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product now and I&#x27;m saving a ton of money over the brand I was using before.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this since most reviews said this didn&#x27;t compare to the benzoyl peroxide from acne.org. I had ran out of my acne.org benzoyl peroxide but both acne.org and amazon were out of stock for several days. I then gave up trying to purchase the acne.org peroxide because I became worried that if I didn&#x27;t get any product soon I&#x27;d start to break out! So on a limb I bought this as a temporary solution thinking I&#x27;d get the acne.org product once it was back in stock. But now I will not be going back to acne.org. I&#x27;m really glad I tried this!  Not only did this work better than the acne.org benzoyl peroxide but this is also way cheaper. ( I been using it 3 months now so long enough for me to test the product and conclude the positive results) I can truly say it works amazing. With this I get no acne (with acne.org I&#x27;d still would get get a few hurtful blemishes) I for sure will be repurchasing. bye bye acne.org.</li>
            <li> been using acne.org for years, had decent results, it was at least effective, but didn&#x27;t prevent from acne coming out, it helped kill the acne that already developed, but tried this since it&#x27;s the same % and size, but much cheaper, big freaking mistake, this dries out my skin so much that my face was all flaky, YET it didn&#x27;t even do a single thing. Made zero effect to my acne, actually made worse since it never helped reduce the current acne from worsening. It&#x27;s like 0%, does absolutely nothing yet it dries you out like a 10% treatment lotion, what a joke. At least they refunded me my money so im giving 2 stars. Please don&#x27;t buy this  to replace the Acne.org one, you&#x27;ll pay for it with your face, I&#x27;m regretting it myself, ordered the acne.org one right after receiving the refund.</li>
            <li> This is the same product I&#x27;ve been buying from Acne.org for the last 2-3 years, except it&#x27;s missing two things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)The smell (this has no smell). The product from acne.org doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it does have it&#x27;s own scent, this doesn&#x27;t smell like anything (which is always nice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.)Horribly outdated and expensive shipping costs of the acne.org product. I always threw up in my mouth a bit when seeing the price of the acne.org product and it&#x27;s expensive shipping. This is much easier on the wallet and maintains the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this from now on instead (it&#x27;s much cheaper).</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.  It didn&#x27;t even come close to the quality of the Acne.org medicine I had used in the past.  To top it all off, it left a white, powdery residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> I discovered the Acne.org treatment a few months ago after watching several success videos on Youtube. I was first using Dr. Lin&#x27;s line, as the lotion is also 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. After running out relatively quickly (2 oz. lasted me a month and a half), I ordered this big guy. The lotion is basically the same as the Dr. Lin&#x27;s formula, and is also a great cheaper alternative to the Acne.org treatment lotion. So far I only use it at night every night but now that I have a ton of it I may start using it in the morning as well. Pretty run of the mill stuff, but the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> I was looking for Benzoyl Peroxide in a 2.5 to 5% solution, that was in a large size that was economical. This was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast also</li>
            <li> I guess this is kind of an &amp;#34;updated&amp;#34; review, meaning my opinion has changed since the first time I bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first batch I bought was a little coarse, scratchy and a little thin. It lacked the smoothness and fullness the current batch has now. Maybe it was different for others before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What persuaded me to try this again was the price tag on Acne.org&#x27;s Benzoyl Peroxide Gel. I&#x27;m glad I gave it a second chance. I&#x27;m definitely going to continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Seems to be working great. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> very light and easy to apply but leave lot of firm film</li>
            <li> To whoever is the pure genius !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other benzoil products for over 40 years for acne. I have now used your benzoil for 4 weeks and am very pleased with the results.  For me, no acne developing, no peeling when used once a day all over the face (I use 5% tea tree on top of yours), applies easily with a nice moisturizing base, and above all the right price. Thank you for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Regards, Mark.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant ordering because some reviewer claimed the product was fake, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot anyways. And yeah, it&#x27;s fine, the product came and it is 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. I&#x27;ve been using about half a pump of the Dr. Song product on my face twice a day for about three weeks now, and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts. I&#x27;ve already been using benzoyl peroxide regularly before ordering this product, so my skin didn&#x27;t freak out, but if you&#x27;re somebody who doesn&#x27;t use benzoyl peroxide regularly, you should probably start with just a little bit and work your way up to about half a pump or else you&#x27;re skin is going to get super dry and irritated. But if you&#x27;re somebody who uses benzoyl peroxide regularly, this product seems just fine, especially for the cost/oz. The packaging is pretty cheap, though. The pump broke off when I dropped the bottle, but I managed to screw it back on. But the important part is the actual product is inexpensive benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> Great product that is considerably cheaper than acne.org. Arrived fast, very lightweight on the face which is awesome considering it&#x27;s summer.</li>
            <li> My back breaks out crazy bad when I&#x27;m not using this stuff.  The last time I bought this product it was kind of grainy, but this time it&#x27;s nice and smooth.  I have sensitive skin, and BP is drying but I have no problems when I use this in conjunction with my Olay Pro X scrubbing brush thingy.  It gently exfoliates my skin and and keeps the dry skin from building up.  I still get the few hormonal pimples each month but I honestly cannot live without this stuff.  My back improves so much that I fool myself into thinking &amp;#34;maybe I don&#x27;t need it anymore...&amp;#34; until two weeks late I&#x27;m breaking out something crazy.  I would say make sure to use it for at least a month before making your decision.  It&#x27;s not going to take away existing breakouts, and it&#x27;s not going to stop ones that are already forming but not yet visible.  So those need time to heal and go away on their own. But it will make a big difference in just a few weeks.  I have dry skin and if I don&#x27;t use a gentle exfoliating tool each day then it is exacerbated by this product, but I don&#x27;t have any problems with dryness while using this product, the Olay exfoliating brush and just some Dermasil from the dollar store lol.  This product DEFINITELY works for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a cheap alternative to Proactiv. Same active ingredient and I actually have gotten better results! Just be sure to make sure it is dry before putting on a shirt on going to bed because it will stain!</li>
            <li> I switched from another brand of 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide and the results are the same, for a much better price.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I like the new formula even better.  (first purchase made in April 2014)  The consistency has changed, it&#x27;s hard to explain how, but before it felt like a watery gel (kinda like aloe) and now it seems more creamy and it spreads easier.  It seems to be working better, but I also changed my face soap at the same time so that might be contributing to my improved complexion (I was using Olay ProX Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser, but CVS was constantly sold out so I tried St. Ives Blemish Control Apricot Scrub and not only is it cheaper, but it seems to be working just as well if not better)  I still get breakouts right before my period, but they seem more minor.  Also, for some reason my order said it shipped, but the tracking number showed no movement.  After waiting for a month I contacted them and they apologized and shipped my order out immediately.  I think it was just a mishap and don&#x27;t expect to keep having problems and will definitely continue to purchase from them.  I hope they continue to offer this at such a great price!  ps I was a previous Acne.org user before I gave this a try and also have used proactiv in the past.  This is my favorite product so far.</li>
            <li> Works very well and absorbs nicely. I&#x27;m still looking for something that works as well a discontinued product that I enjoyed (AcneFree 2% BZ gel), but this will do. I enjoy the pump feature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used acne.org products for years now.  Big fan of their products not so much of their prices and shipping. This is my 3rd purchase from Dr Song.  The first was ok but the actual product was gritty and left white residue when dry. They must have changed their formula which is a good thing.  No longer feels gritty or leaves white residue.  Closer to the acne.org product at a more tolerable cost.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough&lt;br /&gt;Effective against moderate acne&lt;br /&gt;Paraben free</li>
            <li> This works exactly like acne.org but it&#x27;s a little bit better price. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent to it really and it absorbs just like acne.org. So if you are looking for an alternative then look no further. The only thing that happens with this pump quite often is that it gets a little clogged. So you&#x27;ll have to unclog it periodically with a toothpick or something of that nature. Overall, awesome product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any connection with Dr. Song product or Acne.org. I have been using Acne.org&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide for years. I thought I&#x27;d try Dr. Song&#x27;s brand and save a few bucks. Boy was I wrong. Dr. Song&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide is strong and made my skin red. I have no issues with Acne.org&#x27;s 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, its great stuff. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I put an unopened Dr Song 16 oz. bottle on the scale and it weight 420 grams (14.815 oz), I had still one acne.org unopened bottle left and it weight 470 grams (16.579 oz)... Just saying. Still less expensive, as for quality, I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but assuming it&#x27;s good, I give it 4 out of 5 stars.. Don&#x27;t lie to me.</li>
            <li> Works great! My skin has never been clearer, I used to use acne.org stuff but this is a better price and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for the last 20 years (not everyone grows out of it!).  After using dozens of different products over the years, I found 2.5% benzoyl peroxide about six years ago.  When you stick to the following regimen twice a day, your skin will be clear in no time:  Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and dry, apply 2.5% benzoyl peroxide and rub in well, then apply moisturizer (the moisturizer is key with BP even though many of us long-time acne sufferers are afraid of it).  I learned about this through acne.org and have always bought their form of the BP until recently when I found Dr. Song&#x27;s on amazon for a much better price.  It works just as well-the gel may be even smoother than the acne.org formulation.  I strongly believe this is the best acne prevention regimen ever!</li>
            <li> A+ stuff at a cheaper price than Acne.org :)</li>
            <li> it works well on my son skin because is skin is so oily.great stuff and for myself i use it sometime just to keep my skin clear in the winter months u just have to use moisturizer over your treament thats all overall great</li>
            <li> Works better than proactive and is reasonably priced. I have tried everything and nothing worked for me until I tried this product. The reviews encouraged me to try it and This stuff has been a life saver. It has helped keep my skin clear and keep my occasional bouts of cystic acne away! Great stuff, well worth a try!!!</li>
            <li> Glad I found this lotion and tried it.  I used Acne.org BP lotion before and this is very much like Acne and cheaper.  The only difference is this lotion after it dries leave a thin white powdery film over your skin.  You need to wipe that off or apply a moisturizer over it to get rid off it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week now. So far I can&#x27;t tell but I can say this for sure when I apply it after a while it start itching me so bad!  I try as much as possible not to touch my face. And I have started noticing some little rashes on my face a like one or two pimple.  But am still fingers crossed hoping it will all improve in the fourth week . And the delivery was very impressive.  Please help with the itching.  What can I do?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since the transition into my teens. I&#x27;m now in my 20&#x27;s and I depend on benzoyl peroxide each day to keep my skin clear. After a couple of years on a strict acne.org regimen, it started to get too expensive. I found this product on amazon with high ratings, so I gave it a shot. The product is creamy white, thick, and goes on smoothly. The smell is initially off-putting, almost too sterile, but I found it to be negligible after a couple of uses. I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and I&#x27;ve found it to be just as effective as the acne.org line of benzoyl peroxide. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this product and its discounted price. I will continue buying exclusively from Dr. Song&#x27;s line of benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you use the 2.5% benzoyl peroxide twice a day; once in the morning, and once before bedtime. I&#x27;ve been doing the acne.org regimen for over two years, and it truly works. Now that I&#x27;ve found a well-priced, well-sized alternative to store-bought benzoyl peroxide via Dr. Song, my wallet is thanking me. My only complaint (albeit a small one) is the container. When you get down to the bottom of the bottle, the pump no longer works. No big deal, but still sort of annoying. All in all, I would HIGHLY recommend this product. And yes, this review is by a real consumer.</li>
            <li> Works great for the Daniel kern method smells good too great price for the amount you get. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Acne.org regimen just like a lot of other reviewers, and this stuff really does work much better, and at a better price, too!  The Acne.org BP gel took a long time to dry up on its own, felt a bit heavier, and does have an odd smell to it.  This stuff is light, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave any after-irritation.  You will have to follow this up with moisturizer, too.  I also noticed that this BP gel contains 1 or 2 less ingredients than the Acne.org gel.  Not sure if that&#x27;s worth noting, but the &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; the better, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely stick with this as long as I can!</li>
            <li> Super happy with this product. Replaced my acne.org stuff. This sells for pretty much the same price as that did WITH the first-time discounts and I ran out of email addresses to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is somewhat nicer to me. It applies well and doesn&#x27;t have any funky smell. Plus the pumps are smaller so I can control the amount a bit easier.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I like the stuff.  When used in conjunction with a facial cleanser and toner, results are definitely noticeable.  It definitely helps reduce breakouts.</li>
            <li> Delivered in good time to London, UK. Glad I didn&#x27;t need to spend a fortune at acne org. Works well. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the one in the acne.org regimen, and is a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Works as well as acne.org but cheaper. Keeps skin clear except for an occasional breakout. Great product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t occur to me that bleaches-everything-under-the-sun benzoyl peroxide would come in a lotion form.  Unless my entire wardrobe was white and everything I touched every day was white, I couldn&#x27;t imagine using it.  I thought I was buying a body wash.  However, the description is pretty straight forward on the lotion part, so that&#x27;s on me.  That being said, I can&#x27;t think of an application for a benzoyl peroxide lotion.  Even if it didn&#x27;t bleach everything, all lotions irritate the folliculitis I need it to help control.  So I can&#x27;t tell if it does what it claims well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products. Most benzoyl peroxide products have too high of a concentration and irritate my skin. This is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother me. My skin is the most clear it&#x27;s been since I was a teenager. Love it!</li>
