            <li>Perfect for a 15 year old girl!</li>
            <li>so clearly this was a perfect choice for her.</li>
            <li>Would have liked more packaging inside box so it didn&#x27;t let perfume box roll around.</li>

            <li>I also love the bottle, so cute.</li>

            <li>, I just figured that&#x27;s how many stars I&#x27;d give it if I bought it, what can I say?</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume ladies you must have this perfume to your collection.</li>
            <li>The price was excellent considering this perfume at this size would have cost double the price at sephora or macy&#x27;s(Yes</li>
            <li>Good size,  got money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>She is in love...</li>

            <li>I realy love Someday by Justin Bieber.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, and it arrived before it said it would. :)</li>
            <li>and I was able to get it at a price cheaper than if I were to buy it in stores.</li>
            <li>Very worth the money!</li>
            <li>its strong and lasts a while, plus the price is alot better than it would be in a perfume store.</li>
            <li>all love it, she loves it(the fun) a lot for the price, nice smell, so</li>
            <li>Perfect perfume as a gift if your not sure what kind she wears.</li>
            <li>It actually is very mild coming out of the bottle</li>
            <li>Came very quickly in time for Valentines Day.</li>
            <li>Sweet, but not too sweet - kind of a fruity/flowery mix.</li>
            <li>The one in the store smelled really strong and it lasted for HOURS.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter asked her for some of the similar scented hand cream she has (from a different set she received as a gift from her mother)and loved the scent, too, and IS a Beiber fan, so I have a perfect birthday gift lined up for her, too.  </li>
            <li>I love the sweet scent in this perfume.</li>
            <li>Best perfume I have EVER smelled, hands down.</li>
            <li>Excellent price - much less than in the stores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a HUGE Bieber fan</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just light and floral.</li>
            <li>Great smelling and would definitely order again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light floral scent that sticks with you all day but isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to be a fan of the Beb&#x27;s to enjoy this fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is a soft, warm (the vanilla) and feminine without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>A sample came  in a magazine and my six year old daughter rubbed the page on both of us and even though I loved it</li>
            <li>Such a great deal and quick arrival.</li>
            <li>sure talks about it a lot, he can inspect me any time ;)</li>
            <li>She was so excited that she received it.</li>
            <li>She was so excited to receive it</li>
            <li>bottle I got was in the original packaging and was sealed..</li>
            <li>it really has a great soft smell...</li>
            <li>This perfume is amazing it smells really SEXY  and is definitely an attract magnet thank Justin Bieber</li>
            <li>A nice light fruity scent for young girls.</li>
            <li>Smells so good just like I remembered I will definitely buy from this company again!</li>
            <li>Its fruity and sweet and it almost smells like Juicy Couture&#x27;s Viva La Juicy.</li>
            <li>just true</li>
            <li>My second favorite Perfume of course sweet!!</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was packed well.  </li>
            <li>This is so light and pretty.</li>
            <li>This was purchased for our Goddaughter&#x27;s 7th birthday and her very first perfume.</li>
            <li>MY GRAND DAUGHTER LOVES HER NEW PERFUME</li>
            <li>handsome guy&#x27;s name on it, middle age and older women would be loving it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, its very soft and floral-y.</li>
            <li>To me, it smells mostly fruity with some floral notes and just a little bit of sweetness which I love!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Kids would be lucky to have such a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>really wanted it, but I honestly don&#x27;t enjoy it that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually quite nice</li>
            <li>I think if you put a more mature.</li>
            <li>It probably only lasts about an hour on me to be honest.</li>
            <li>The flower top is soft rubber.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.</li>
            <li>yes if you are Mr. B. fun its the right perfume for you.</li>
            <li>The girls love it, very unique, very nice aroma, not overbearing, small dab goes a long way, another winner here!</li>
            <li>This is what every little girl wants great product shipped quickly</li>
            <li>My 15 year old was so excited!</li>
            <li>not only was it &amp;#34;justin bieber&amp;#34; perfume, but it actually has a very nice sweet scent.</li>
            <li>sister has had for 9 months, uses it more days than not, and has barely put a dent in itl</li>
            <li>I was given this as a free sample with a bunch of other perfumes I bought, and I sort of laughed, but after trying it, it smells better than 80 percent of the other 50 perfumes I got.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real stuff too!</li>
            <li>but you always smell yummy wearing this ;)</li>
            <li>pretty scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first smelled this perfume a year ago when my cousin&#x27;s granddaughter had it.</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied with purchase would buy from again once I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li>Really Pretty bottle and of Course it is Justin Bieber.  </li>
            <li>and if I spray it in one corner of the bedroom and walk just outside of the door I cannot smell it any more.</li>
            <li>The Amazon price is great, too, just a few bucks more than the retail store one that&#x27;s like 2 oz less.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised that it actually was a nice perfume.</li>
            <li>It smells very girly and pretty.</li>
            <li>I compared it with other light, clean, pretty scents, and it was nicer.  </li>
            <li>It was just as expected and arrived very quickly!  </li>
            <li>She had gotten a smaller bottle for her 5th birthday and ran out of it very quickly.</li>
            <li>huge bottle for a fraction of what places like even sam&#x27;s club wanted for smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>This perfume is priced really well.</li>
            <li>economic.</li>
            <li>A very adaptable perfume.  </li>
            <li>It looked and smelled like the one seen in departments stores but much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>he&#x27;s too much for us.</li>
            <li>It was so much cheaper than department stores.</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my nose doesnt like much perfurm smells</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I loved the sweet smell of it because somehow thats my personality, I personally like, not love, Justin Bieber</li>
            <li>I have since bought more for friends and ordered for other people as well.</li>
            <li>although this was very expensive, the look on her face when she received it was priceless!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for ladies of all age groups.</li>
            <li>Smells good but definitely doesn&#x27;t last long at all!</li>
            <li>I got this perfume for my 12 yr old daughter- after so much pressure from her.</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant with the whole &amp;#34;Justin Bieber&amp;#34; name, but this is definitely not a fragrance just for teens -</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re trying that new thing called....</li>
            <li>Its a pretty big bottle too.</li>
            <li>please try this out first in your local mall or something and buy it.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous and so long lasting!  </li>
            <li>nothing too loud for a young girl, very classy.</li>
            <li>i love the way it smells, it comes unwrapped, so be careful to keep it wrap so it won&#x27;t loose the smell</li>
            <li>cause a certain teenage lady is getting both of his Parfum&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 7 year old, just because she is a Bieber nut case.</li>
            <li>Gave this to my 10 year old Daughter for Christmas with Bieber Fever.  </li>
            <li>I am a \\&quot;bit \\&quot;old for &#x27;Bieberfever &#x27; (40).</li>
            <li>and I was surprised that the bottle was not damaged.  </li>
            <li>This scent will never get old.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised, too.  </li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter isnt a Justin Bieber fan</li>
            <li>bought this product and it smells like nothing really, doesn&#x27;t last or even smell like the perfume..</li>
            <li>I dont know if its just me, but most of my other perfumes last a long time on me and</li>
            <li>my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so sad though because I really do love the scent!</li>
            <li>People are always surprised to hear its &amp;#34;someday&amp;#34; The smell will last all day.</li>
            <li>This bottle of perfume barely made it to my house.</li>
            <li>I spray it on myself and drive 10 minutes to work and can barely smell it on my arm when I sniff about 30 minutes later.</li>
            <li>In the department stores you pay twice a much for half the size.  </li>
            <li>like to wear it when I&#x27;m tired of musky, spicy, or sweet/fruity strong scents.  </li>

            <li> so clearly this was a perfect choice for her.</li>
            <li> Would have liked more packaging inside box so it didn&#x27;t let perfume box roll around.</li>

            <li> , I just figured that&#x27;s how many stars I&#x27;d give it if I bought it, what can I say?</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume ladies you must have this perfume to your collection.</li>
            <li> The price was excellent considering this perfume at this size would have cost double the price at sephora or macy&#x27;s(Yes</li>

            <li> She is in love...</li>

            <li> I realy love Someday by Justin Bieber.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and it arrived before it said it would. :)</li>
            <li> and I was able to get it at a price cheaper than if I were to buy it in stores.</li>
            <li> Very worth the money!</li>
            <li> its strong and lasts a while, plus the price is alot better than it would be in a perfume store.</li>
            <li> all love it, she loves it(the fun) a lot for the price, nice smell, so</li>
            <li> Perfect perfume as a gift if your not sure what kind she wears.</li>
            <li> It actually is very mild coming out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Came very quickly in time for Valentines Day.</li>
            <li> Sweet, but not too sweet - kind of a fruity/flowery mix.</li>
            <li> The one in the store smelled really strong and it lasted for HOURS.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter asked her for some of the similar scented hand cream she has (from a different set she received as a gift from her mother)and loved the scent, too, and IS a Beiber fan, so I have a perfect birthday gift lined up for her, too.  </li>
            <li> I love the sweet scent in this perfume.</li>
            <li> Best perfume I have EVER smelled, hands down.</li>
            <li> Excellent price - much less than in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE Bieber fan</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just light and floral.</li>
            <li> Great smelling and would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light floral scent that sticks with you all day but isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to be a fan of the Beb&#x27;s to enjoy this fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is a soft, warm (the vanilla) and feminine without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> A sample came  in a magazine and my six year old daughter rubbed the page on both of us and even though I loved it</li>
            <li> Such a great deal and quick arrival.</li>
            <li> sure talks about it a lot, he can inspect me any time ;)</li>
            <li> She was so excited that she received it.</li>
            <li> She was so excited to receive it</li>
            <li> bottle I got was in the original packaging and was sealed..</li>
            <li> it really has a great soft smell...</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing it smells really SEXY  and is definitely an attract magnet thank Justin Bieber</li>
            <li> A nice light fruity scent for young girls.</li>
            <li> Smells so good just like I remembered I will definitely buy from this company again!</li>
            <li> Its fruity and sweet and it almost smells like Juicy Couture&#x27;s Viva La Juicy.</li>
            <li> just true</li>
            <li> My second favorite Perfume of course sweet!!</li>
            <li> It came quickly and was packed well.  </li>
            <li> This is so light and pretty.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for our Goddaughter&#x27;s 7th birthday and her very first perfume.</li>
            <li> MY GRAND DAUGHTER LOVES HER NEW PERFUME</li>
            <li> handsome guy&#x27;s name on it, middle age and older women would be loving it.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, its very soft and floral-y.</li>
            <li> To me, it smells mostly fruity with some floral notes and just a little bit of sweetness which I love!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Kids would be lucky to have such a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> really wanted it, but I honestly don&#x27;t enjoy it that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually quite nice</li>
            <li> I think if you put a more mature.</li>
            <li> It probably only lasts about an hour on me to be honest.</li>
            <li> The flower top is soft rubber.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> yes if you are Mr. B. fun its the right perfume for you.</li>
            <li> The girls love it, very unique, very nice aroma, not overbearing, small dab goes a long way, another winner here!</li>
            <li> This is what every little girl wants great product shipped quickly</li>
            <li> My 15 year old was so excited!</li>
            <li> not only was it &amp;#34;justin bieber&amp;#34; perfume, but it actually has a very nice sweet scent.</li>
            <li> sister has had for 9 months, uses it more days than not, and has barely put a dent in itl</li>
            <li> I was given this as a free sample with a bunch of other perfumes I bought, and I sort of laughed, but after trying it, it smells better than 80 percent of the other 50 perfumes I got.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real stuff too!</li>
            <li> but you always smell yummy wearing this ;)</li>
            <li> pretty scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume a year ago when my cousin&#x27;s granddaughter had it.</li>
            <li> Overall satisfied with purchase would buy from again once I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> Really Pretty bottle and of Course it is Justin Bieber.  </li>
            <li> and if I spray it in one corner of the bedroom and walk just outside of the door I cannot smell it any more.</li>
            <li> The Amazon price is great, too, just a few bucks more than the retail store one that&#x27;s like 2 oz less.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised that it actually was a nice perfume.</li>
            <li> It smells very girly and pretty.</li>
            <li> I compared it with other light, clean, pretty scents, and it was nicer.  </li>
            <li> It was just as expected and arrived very quickly!  </li>
            <li> She had gotten a smaller bottle for her 5th birthday and ran out of it very quickly.</li>
            <li> huge bottle for a fraction of what places like even sam&#x27;s club wanted for smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> This perfume is priced really well.</li>
            <li> economic.</li>
            <li> A very adaptable perfume.  </li>
            <li> It looked and smelled like the one seen in departments stores but much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> he&#x27;s too much for us.</li>
            <li> It was so much cheaper than department stores.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my nose doesnt like much perfurm smells</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I loved the sweet smell of it because somehow thats my personality, I personally like, not love, Justin Bieber</li>
            <li> I have since bought more for friends and ordered for other people as well.</li>
            <li> although this was very expensive, the look on her face when she received it was priceless!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for ladies of all age groups.</li>
            <li> Smells good but definitely doesn&#x27;t last long at all!</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for my 12 yr old daughter- after so much pressure from her.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant with the whole &amp;#34;Justin Bieber&amp;#34; name, but this is definitely not a fragrance just for teens -</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re trying that new thing called....</li>
            <li> Its a pretty big bottle too.</li>
            <li> please try this out first in your local mall or something and buy it.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous and so long lasting!  </li>
            <li> nothing too loud for a young girl, very classy.</li>
            <li> i love the way it smells, it comes unwrapped, so be careful to keep it wrap so it won&#x27;t loose the smell</li>
            <li> cause a certain teenage lady is getting both of his Parfum&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old, just because she is a Bieber nut case.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my 10 year old Daughter for Christmas with Bieber Fever.  </li>
            <li> I am a \\&quot;bit \\&quot;old for &#x27;Bieberfever &#x27; (40).</li>
            <li> and I was surprised that the bottle was not damaged.  </li>
            <li> This scent will never get old.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised, too.  </li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter isnt a Justin Bieber fan</li>
            <li> bought this product and it smells like nothing really, doesn&#x27;t last or even smell like the perfume..</li>
            <li> I dont know if its just me, but most of my other perfumes last a long time on me and</li>
            <li> my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so sad though because I really do love the scent!</li>
            <li> People are always surprised to hear its &amp;#34;someday&amp;#34; The smell will last all day.</li>
            <li> This bottle of perfume barely made it to my house.</li>
            <li> I spray it on myself and drive 10 minutes to work and can barely smell it on my arm when I sniff about 30 minutes later.</li>
            <li> In the department stores you pay twice a much for half the size.  </li>
            <li> like to wear it when I&#x27;m tired of musky, spicy, or sweet/fruity strong scents.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as id like</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it doesnt last long on me at all, or my clothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two bottles for her now and know it&#x27;s going to be a staple gift for a long time to come, she loves it (and despises JB) and wears it daily.  </li>
            <li> Scent does not last long..</li>
            <li> The consistency of the liquid itself even looks lighter in color and does not last long at all.  </li>
            <li> After a long wait of 28 days, I get the product.</li>
            <li> Or maybe JB &amp; his band after a long concert? &#x27;</li>
            <li> but the scent is not very strong..nor does it last long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last that long, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but I do recommend this to anyone looking for a light, casual, everyday scent.</li>
            <li> Also Indian, that serious organized and rated for your forwarded the goods permitted according to the new regulations of the Venezuelan Government, which has created an uncertainty in my for the reception of the same.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure we would be washing it off within ten minutes as a sick migraine would be hitting me within minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about $10 an ounce, which is crazy cheap if you think about it.</li>
            <li> I come to this prestigious firm AMAZON, with the purpose that I review in this respect of the acquired or make me money back.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s been on the skin for a while, it is just a soft, subtle</li>
            <li> When mine is empty I&#x60;m so buying another one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting overlooked and even misjudged sometimes due to the name.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I already placed my other order</li>
            <li> i recomend other to buy this product.</li>
            <li> on the other hand</li>
            <li> The Amazon price beats the other stores.</li>
            <li> With a little vaniella.</li>
            <li> so I know what I&#x27;m talking about, you have to believe in me, so a little about myself-</li>
            <li> All I know is that on Christmas morning she jumped up and down and was hugging and kissing the box!  </li>
            <li> There was quite a bit missing from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> every morning I wake up around 9 or about 9:15 if I feel a little lazy</li>
            <li> Someday&#x27; has to be the most horrible aroma ever!  </li>
            <li> In stores the small 1oz bottle is $26, online the 3.4 is $26.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells weird like bleach mixed with cat urine.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t usually these days.  </li>
            <li> My daughter had this on her wish list for Christmas and as usual, I found it cheapest on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time wearing anything \\&quot;Justin</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Christmas gift and it was hard not to keep it.</li>

            <li> Do not get the product that is buy: from the date that the purchase was made and will request the sent, the product never I was delivered to my destination, citing the customs agent, the Venezuelan customs were involved, which investigate and was false.</li>

            <li> This perfume is priced really well. It&#x27;s about $10 an ounce, which is crazy cheap if you think about it. I wear it every day. It&#x27;s a perfect scent for a teenage girl. It doesn&#x27;t last that long, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but I do recommend this to anyone looking for a light, casual, everyday scent.</li>
            <li> Great perfume a gift for my daughter. She absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> I really love it! It smells so good! I also love the bottle, so cute. When mine is empty I&#x60;m so buying another one!</li>
            <li> The perfume is better than his songs.</li>
            <li> After a long wait of 28 days, I get the product. But the product is good. I have no complaints. My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Smells so good just like I remembered I will definitely buy from this company again!</li>
            <li> MY GRAND DAUGHTER LOVES HER NEW PERFUME</li>
            <li> I love someday by Justin bieber. It is a nice fruity and floral sent. With a little vaniella. This perfume is s perfect gift for any girl or woman. You may think its made for girls and teens, but its made for everyone. You will deffently fall in love with someday.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stand J. Beiber... but this perfume smells amazing. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. Perfect perfume as a gift if your not sure what kind she wears.</li>
            <li> Or mothballs?  Or maybe JB &amp; his band after a long concert? &#x27;Someday&#x27; has to be the most horrible aroma ever!  Second to a skunk.  And just as lasting!</li>
            <li> In stores the small 1oz bottle is $26, online the 3.4 is $26. It&#x27;s the real stuff too! I recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells good but definitely doesn&#x27;t last long at all!</li>
            <li> this stuff smells weird like bleach mixed with cat urine. my friend&#x27;s mom bought this for her daughter and my friend let me smell it and we both agree that its awful.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it! I have since bought more for friends and ordered for other people as well. Great product and price.</li>
            <li> excellent product, it certainly would recommend to all my friends and family. Keep well. Fantastic. very good. economic. spectacular. practical.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand his music, but this fragrance is simply amazing! I wear it all the time.  I can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old, just because she is a Bieber nut case. She loves it....and sometimes I borrow it too! It&#x27;s actually quite nice</li>
            <li> This is what every little girl wants great product shipped quickly my child could not stop smiling!!!!! Smells wonderful on my teenager!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one of those &amp;#34;belibers,&amp;#34; but I do happen to enjoy great perfume. I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I have received when wearing this perfume. It smells amazing! Plus, the rose design on the top of the bottle is really cute. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells great! I had bought it for my mom but decided to keep it for myself. Its fruity and sweet and it almost smells like Juicy Couture&#x27;s Viva La Juicy. its strong and lasts a while, plus the price is alot better than it would be in a perfume store.</li>
            <li> Do not get the product that is buy: from the date that the purchase was made and will request the sent, the product never I was delivered to my destination, citing the customs agent, the Venezuelan customs were involved, which investigate and was false. Subsequently the same customs agent Mr. Lorenzo Colina, telephone in Miami 2005070 (owner of the company that would bring Venezuela product - supplies and services LM), indicated that the problem was with the goods door to door, reason by which it was returned to the United States. Also Indian, that serious organized and rated for your forwarded the goods permitted according to the new regulations of the Venezuelan Government, which has created an uncertainty in my for the reception of the same. I come to this prestigious firm AMAZON, with the purpose that I review in this respect of the acquired or make me money back.</li>
            <li> My second favorite Perfume of course sweet!! Doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as id like but you always smell yummy wearing this ;) I always repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a free sample with a bunch of other perfumes I bought, and I sort of laughed, but after trying it, it smells better than 80 percent of the other 50 perfumes I got.  Out of 5 perfumes I decided to purchase after smelling over 50 samples, this was one of the ones I bought.  I compared it with other light, clean, pretty scents, and it was nicer.  It smells good from start to finish.  Once it&#x27;s been on the skin for a while, it is just a soft, subtle pretty scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT just for kids.  Kids would be lucky to have such a nice scent.  I think if you put a more mature. handsome guy&#x27;s name on it, middle age and older women would be loving it.  It&#x27;s getting overlooked and even misjudged sometimes due to the name.&lt;br /&gt;I like to wear it when I&#x27;m tired of musky, spicy, or sweet/fruity strong scents.  This is so light and pretty.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my 10 year old Daughter for Christmas with Bieber Fever.  Needless to say I was &amp;#34;Super Dad&amp;#34; Christmas morning.</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite perfume now !! Smells great and got lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! Love it!!! I have tried others and I go back to this one every time!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a graduation gift.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughters and they are happy</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments and questions as to what I am wearing when I wear this perfume. People are always surprised to hear its &amp;#34;someday&amp;#34; The smell will last all day. It&#x27;s not too offensive  it&#x27;s just light and floral. I also have the body option too. Great date night perfume.</li>
            <li> It smells very nice!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great on my lovely lady.</li>
            <li> It was just as expected and arrived very quickly!  I can not say anything more about it.  But I have to keep writing</li>
            <li> I am a \\&quot;bit \\&quot;old for &#x27;Bieberfever &#x27; (40). Whoever made his fragrance &#x27;Forever&#x27; did an  excellent job creating a fragrance to cross generations. It is a soft, warm (the vanilla) and feminine without being overwhelming. A very adaptable perfume.  A sample came  in a magazine and my six year old daughter rubbed the page on both of us and even though I loved it I thought for sure we would be washing it off within ten minutes as a sick migraine would be hitting me within minutes. NO SUCH THING....GASP. And my husband came home and loved the scent too . ..  3.4oz purchased</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift.  It came quickly and was packed well.  It looked and smelled like the one seen in departments stores but much cheaper.  The recipient loved it, and has used it a lot since getting it!</li>
            <li> Pleased with this purchase. Bought it for my niece for christmas and she loved it. The price was great and it came quickly once ordered. Price was really great compared to the department stores.</li>
            <li> Best perfume I have EVER smelled, hands down. Bought it for my wife for here bday. This scent isn&#x27;t just for tweens/young adults. My fave!</li>
            <li> This bottle of perfume barely made it to my house. The package had one, skimpy piece of tape holding it together.  Because it was skimpy, of course it came off.  The box arrived open at my house and I was surprised that the bottle was not damaged.  When I contacted the seller, no response.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> got this for my sister last Christmas and boy did she love it. not only was it &amp;#34;justin bieber&amp;#34; perfume, but it actually has a very nice sweet scent. huge bottle for a fraction of what places like even sam&#x27;s club wanted for smaller bottle. sister has had for 9 months, uses it more days than not, and has barely put a dent in itl</li>
            <li> The perfume WAS THE BEST I LOVE IT, it smells sooooooo good and the price is just perfect❤️ I already placed my other order</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for my 12 yr old daughter- after so much pressure from her. Oh well, she&#x27;s a bieberlier ( or whatever they call themselves).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so so indifferent to Justin. The perfume arrived yesterday and out of curiosity I used it to work today.  It is fabulous and so long lasting!  I absolutely love it. My Justin&#x27;s fan hasn&#x27;t used the perfume -she just lovingly stares at it. LOL!</li>
            <li> Great smelling and would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this perfume</li>
            <li> Oh man, would you just look at that flowery top, that&#x27;s a sure way to attract a lady, that juan character he&#x27;s out of control- send him back to mexico he&#x27;s too much for us. I hope he didn&#x27;t use this on that celena dion lady he was with cause she would have never left him alone! I like to keep up with all my pop artists so I know what I&#x27;m talking about, you have to believe in me, so a little about myself- every morning I wake up around 9 or about 9:15 if I feel a little lazy and I read that perez guy you know with that puppy on the line ya know? and he&#x27;s talking about everybodys all on drugs, they&#x27;re trying that new thing called.... what is it, garcenea camboogea? Is that it? Well whatever it is, does anyone know where to get some? the handsome doctor oz sure talks about it a lot, he can inspect me any time ;) maybe he knows about this juan guy....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- I give this 3 stars because I&#x27;ve never bought, I just figured that&#x27;s how many stars I&#x27;d give it if I bought it, what can I say? And also I don&#x27;t even know how it smells, I try to go to that store, the one across my street ya know where all the hipsters and hippies hang out, where all theres cats and the crazy music, but all they ever serve me is coffee they never let me sample the perfume, whats up with that ya know what I&#x27;m saying? But one day i&#x27;ll buy it and maybe even smell if I ever get any damn service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pps- uhm is anybody doing anything for the orangutans? I mean just look at yourselfs</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume ladies you must have this perfume to your collection.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, greetings from Venezuela !!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for our Goddaughter&#x27;s 7th birthday and her very first perfume. She loves the Biebs so clearly this was a perfect choice for her. The price was excellent considering this perfume at this size would have cost double the price at sephora or macy&#x27;s(Yes I went to both and all over the internet). Smells awesome and its nice and light too since she&#x27;s 7 I didnt want an overpowering scent. Came super fast, very happy.</li>
            <li> When I received the package I thought the way it was packaged. But I was very disappointed when I opened the box and the perfume had leaked out. There was quite a bit missing from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve had this perfume before and this time around it just doesn&#x27;t smell the same. I&#x27;m really disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> Good size,  got money&#x27;s worth. We don&#x27;t usually these days.  Would have liked more packaging inside box so it didn&#x27;t let perfume box roll around.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my niece for Christmas. She is in love... She was so excited that she received it. The price was good</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter, but I am going to buy another bottle for myself.  The fragrence is very light and delightful.</li>
            <li> What can go wrong here?&lt;br /&gt;They all love it, she loves it(the fun) a lot for the price, nice smell, so yes if you are Mr. B. fun its the right perfume for you.</li>
            <li> i love the way it smells, it comes unwrapped, so be careful to keep it wrap so it won&#x27;t loose the smell</li>
            <li> This  perfume was for my 7yr olds Easter basket. She had gotten a smaller bottle for her 5th birthday and ran out of it very quickly. But this was such a steal for the price, especially because it was the big bottle too. That means we can share lol! This scent will never get old.</li>
            <li> Not going to lie, this is one of my favorite smelling perfumes. Sweet, but not too sweet - kind of a fruity/flowery mix. I have a hard time wearing anything \\&quot;Justin Bieber\\&quot; so I don&#x27;t wear it often... but if I&#x27;m rating the product itself, it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and the value was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to those looking for a good value and want to smell great.</li>
            <li> HATE TO SAY &amp;#34; I LOVE BIEBER&amp;#34; WONDERFUL SMELLING</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves this.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a wonderful scent to it! It smells very girly and pretty. To me, it smells mostly fruity with some floral notes and just a little bit of sweetness which I love! The packaging is also very cute. It comes in a nice box, and the rose on top is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it doesnt last long on me at all, or my clothing. It probably only lasts about an hour on me to be honest. It&#x27;s a very light scent. I dont know if its just me, but most of my other perfumes last a long time on me and my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so sad though because I really do love the scent!</li>
            <li> My daughter love it and got it on time.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume based solely on the reviews found here.  The bottle and cap are attractive and imaginatively done.  But most of all my wife was pleased.</li>
            <li> When I met my girlfriend, I laughed at her for wearing a Justin Bieber perfume...but she smelled great and I was shocked that it was the JB stuff...I&#x27;ve purchased two bottles for her now and know it&#x27;s going to be a staple gift for a long time to come, she loves it (and despises JB) and wears it daily.  I&#x27;ll admit, it smells great on her and I was surprised, too.  My daughter asked her for some of the similar scented hand cream she has (from a different set she received as a gift from her mother)and loved the scent, too, and IS a Beiber fan, so I have a perfect birthday gift lined up for her, too.  Forget the name on the box, once you&#x27;ve thrown that away all traces of Bieber are gone and you have a perfume that she loves.  The Amazon price is great, too, just a few bucks more than the retail store one that&#x27;s like 2 oz less.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever !!&lt;br /&gt;Love love love !</li>
            <li> I brought this for my 11 year old niece for christmas and when she opened it she screamed with excitement and it smells awesome!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter nd she loves it.</li>
            <li> So got this cause the wife wanted it. Personally,...smells pretty dang good!! Thanks!! Its a pretty big bottle too. The flower top is soft rubber. Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> All I know is that on Christmas morning she jumped up and down and was hugging and kissing the box!  Guess that says it all.</li>
            <li> In the department stores you pay twice a much for half the size.  My 15 year old was so excited!</li>
            <li> It was so much cheaper than department stores. I purchased for my sister and she loves it. It was delievered quickley and packaged well.</li>
            <li> My daughter had this on her wish list for Christmas and as usual, I found it cheapest on Amazon. She tells me she loves it so all is good with the world!!!</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume a year ago when my cousin&#x27;s granddaughter had it. It smells WONDERFUL! Doesn&#x27;t smell like a teen fragrance, it smells like a woman&#x27;s. I bought this for a Christmas gift and it was hard not to keep it. Very worth the money!</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter isnt a Justin Bieber fan but I was introduced to this perfume by a sales person via a mall and loved it so ordered it for her birthday...she loves it...it really has a great soft smell...nothing too loud for a young girl, very classy.</li>
            <li> Cant find a better deal!</li>
            <li> Fabulous! Such a great deal and quick arrival. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO!!!</li>
            <li> I love the sweet scent in this perfume. Great price too. Overall satisfied with purchase would buy from again once I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> I have had this same perfume as a gift... it smelt great.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product and it smells like nothing really, doesn&#x27;t last or even smell like the perfume.. I would not buy this product again from here. I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;maybe a knock off.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter loves the smell of this product. Started out as a birthday gift for someone and turned into a must have for the wife and daughter.</li>
            <li> I have very happy daughter!</li>
            <li> We ordered this for our niece for Christmas. We know it is going to be a hit! The price was great for the size of bottle-retail stores can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Really Pretty bottle and of Course it is Justin Bieber.  Excellent price - much less than in the stores.  This is going to be a Christmas gift and I am going to get hugged to death cause a certain teenage lady is getting both of his Parfum&#x27;s.  This is only because of the excellent price.</li>
            <li> Great Value and Great Smell. Would recommend this product to any of my friends. 100% of proceeds go to a charity.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;caracas Venezuela excelente servicio lo descrito por el vendedor lo recomiendo cien por ciento justo el producto q necesitaba Gracias&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the product was good i think is worth it.... i recomend other to buy this product. i made it into a gift and she loved it..</li>
            <li> My tween loves this&lt;br /&gt;Me on the other hand my nose doesnt like much perfurm smells and I could do without it.&lt;br /&gt;But my child loves loves it.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, daughter loved it</li>
            <li> Esto fue un regalo para mi hija la cualama todo lo que sea de este niño. Mi hija quedo muy agradecida</li>
            <li> great for the price and product</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my teenage niece who LOVES Justin Bieber.  It was a hit!!!  She was so excited to receive it and I was surprised that it actually was a nice perfume.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and could not be happier - At first I was hesitant with the whole &amp;#34;Justin Bieber&amp;#34; name, but this is definitely not a fragrance just for teens - I would highly recommend for ladies of all age groups.</li>
            <li> This perfume is geared towards teens, but I&#x27;m 27 and I love this stuff! It&#x27;s a light floral scent that sticks with you all day but isn&#x27;t overpowering. My boyfriend says it smells like candy, and he likes it too! Definitely perfect for every day wear!</li>
            <li> The perfume smells great, and it is a good value. My daughter doesn&#x27;t like Justin Beiber, buy she loves this perfume.  Makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> I heard so many good reviews about this perfume, and how Justin Bieber got an award from this perfume and all that.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted it, but I honestly don&#x27;t enjoy it that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please try this out first in your local mall or something and buy it. I believe that&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> My preteen daughter is obsessed with Justin Bieber...although this was very expensive, the look on her face when she received it was priceless!!</li>
            <li> people love the way I smell when I wear this</li>
            <li> Daughter loved her perfume. Smells great on her.</li>
            <li> producto de gran calidad y muy economico, lo que buscaba me gusto mucho llego e perfecto estado, seguire comprando excelente</li>
            <li> Scent does not last long..Maybe I got a bad bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I smelled this as a sample from a magazine and I really loved it and decided to purchase. I also smelled it from a sample bottle at a store after ordering mine online. The one in the store smelled really strong and it lasted for HOURS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I got was in the original packaging and was sealed..but the scent is not very strong..nor does it last long. It actually is very mild coming out of the bottle and if I spray it in one corner of the bedroom and walk just outside of the door I cannot smell it any more. However when I sprayed it in the store and walked away I could smell it at the end of the aisle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I got also fades in scent in about 30 minutes. I spray it on myself and drive 10 minutes to work and can barely smell it on my arm when I sniff about 30 minutes later. When I sprayed some on my arm in the store (and I tried TWO different stores) the scent lasted for about 4-6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love it but I will get the next bottle from a physical store next time.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, my daughter loved I recommend this size because it is generally  is cheaper than the smaller size !</li>
            <li> my kid love it just true justin bieber she like the color and the box i came in nice box</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume here cause I saw it on a sale and it was like 2 dollars. I loved the sweet smell of it because somehow thats my personality, I personally like, not love, Justin Bieber but I appreciate this perfume hes got</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing it smells really SEXY  and is definitely an attract magnet thank Justin Bieber I LOVE YOUUUUUUU!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my Niece, a Bieber fan for sure. But past that, this Eau De Parfum has a very nice fragrance and is an excellent buy. I am now the favorite Uncle! The Amazon price beats the other stores. They like it, so I am happy to provide the review. You don&#x27;t need to be a fan of the Beb&#x27;s to enjoy this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I realy love Someday by Justin Bieber. It is a fruity and floral sent. I think that women like this perfume, even it has a teen scent. So, i think it is a perfect gift for any girl or woman.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and it arrived before it said it would. :)</li>
            <li> This smells so good. Perfect for a 15 year old girl! Awesome price! Would recommend this to any Justin Bieber fan!</li>
            <li> New in the box and perfect.  My daughters love it and were very happy.  Much cheaper than Macy&#x27;s.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> MI hija esta complacida y feliz por tanto merece esta calificación. A mi me agrada la fragancia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is pleased and happy for so deserves this rating. To me I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for my 16th birthday. I&#x27;m a HUGE Bieber fan so this was the perfect gift! I love the smell, its very soft and floral-y. I want the \\&quot;girlfriend\\&quot; perfume now, too!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it! I admit it does smell nice. Came very quickly in time for Valentines Day. A nice light fruity scent for young girls.</li>
            <li> Excelente presentación de este perfume para damas y adolescentes (mi hija), llega pulcro y bien sellado, excelente aroma y presentación de 100mL / 3.4Oz fl, ideal para un obsequio</li>
            <li> The girls love it, very unique, very nice aroma, not overbearing, small dab goes a long way, another winner here!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with my purchase as the perfume scent seems diluted. The consistency of the liquid itself even looks lighter in color and does not last long at all.  I will chalk it up to a miss.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells great and I was able to get it at a price cheaper than if I were to buy it in stores. The smell is really nice and gets a lot of compliments.</li>
