            <li>satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Always love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand the smell of most hair products, but this has a nice light citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>It was OK.</li>
            <li>but it works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>but this will make your hair silky smooth without leaving the feeling of any kind of residue.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will like it once I tried it.  </li>
            <li>The product does indeed add shine to my hair, but it&#x27;s just an ok product to me.</li>
            <li>this is my &amp;#34;Hands down&amp;#34; favorite hair product...</li>
            <li>one of those &amp;#34;best kept&amp;#34; secrets for sure.</li>
            <li>This product was better than most</li>
            <li>Like a fine spray of a very light oil.  </li>
            <li>It makes styling easy, and leaves hair with a healthy shine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best de-frizzer I have found, and, unlike other de-frizzers, it is never sticky.  </li>
            <li>You only need 2 or 3 sprays and it makes your hair look so shiny an gorgeous; like you just came from the salon!</li>
            <li>Just use it sparingly if you have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>So if you came here looking for a silicone free product, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they just said that the original formula wasn&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li>The seller claims to sell the original formula</li>
            <li>Works best if you spray it on damp, then blow dry completely.</li>
            <li>This super shine mist gives hair a luminous shine.  </li>
            <li>adds shine, takes away frizz and feels pretty light.</li>
            <li>Very good product, hard to find though</li>
            <li>I loved the original formula, but this new product just weighs my fine hair down and makes it greasy if I put too much on (which is way too easy to do).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it&#x27;s pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had more natural ingredients</li>
            <li>And if I apply the right amount, there is seemingly no difference to my hair.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of this product.</li>
            <li>It really reduces your frizz and leaves your hair shiny and very soft!!!</li>
            <li>Add some more after it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t hardly live without this product!!  </li>
            <li>The first time I spritzed some on her hair, her older sister exclaimed, &amp;#34;Wow, the blond bits in your hair shine like gold!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I really recomend it to any body that have problems taming their frizzy hair like mine.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much, or your hair will look oily.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference in the appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li>Please keep selling this stuff as reasonably priced as it is now..</li>
            <li>Thanks any way, not your fault.</li>
            <li>The price is also reasonable.</li>
            <li>I want something that would add some shine because my hair is very curly and tends to frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair that gets really frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Her hair tends to be course and frizzy and she misses the natural blond hightlights that she had more of when she was younger.  </li>
            <li>love the smell, the shine, and it holds the cow licks where I curl them.</li>
            <li>I have fine, tangly long hair.  </li>
            <li>her soft and shiny&lt;br /&gt;and is very reasonably priced...</li>
            <li>It gives your hair a nice slick feeling without feeling sticky or greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This product gives it a nice shine without being heavy and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>and it was a little better.  </li>
            <li>This product can be hard to find, but it&#x27;s worth looking for!!!  </li>
            <li>Not sure why all the great reviews as this is pretty much a very typical laminator.</li>
            <li>I never thought I could find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair</li>
            <li>Light shiney mist that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down</li>
            <li>Not heavy or oily.  </li>
            <li>The lack of alcohol in the product means it leaves my hair soft, without causing dryness with long-term use.</li>
            <li>Makes it soft and swingin.  </li>
            <li>i have very thick hair and wavy, so it&#x27;s very easy to get tangled.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re after instant hair softness this product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It will last a long time, b/c you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>You do have to be careful not to use too much, or your hair gets a greasy-look to it.</li>
            <li>This alcohol-free spray left my hair shiny, and manageable like no other misting spray would.</li>
            <li>I typically spray it on my hand and then apply to my hair that way, making it more similar to the product I used in the past.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is very small, so I am saving its contents for special occasions.  </li>

            <li> Otherwise, can turn hair into an oil slick.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s difficult to say with my hair and all the humidity that has been here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> My daughter loves this stuff!  Her hair tends to be course and frizzy and she misses the natural blond hightlights that she had more of when she was younger.  The first time I spritzed some on her hair, her older sister exclaimed, &amp;#34;Wow, the blond bits in your hair shine like gold!&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it&#x27;s pretty cool.  And doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or gunky at all.  It will last a long time, b/c you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I really recomend it to any body that have problems taming their frizzy hair like mine.</li>
            <li> After styling I spray this on my hair and it give it a nice shine. I live in the desert and hair can appear dull and dry if NOT using this type of product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. adds shine, takes away frizz and feels pretty light. one of the best i&#x27;ve tried of it&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li> Helps the frizzies stay away!! A very cheap, many times usable anti-frizz products. Lasts a long time on your hair and the bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Like a fine spray of a very light oil.  It&#x27;s the best de-frizzer I have found, and, unlike other de-frizzers, it is never sticky.  Don&#x27;t use too much, or your hair will look oily.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re after instant hair softness this product is highly recommended. I&#x27;ve been using this magic in a bottle for 20 years now and not once did it fail me.</li>
            <li> Not sure why all the great reviews as this is pretty much a very typical laminator. Didn&#x27;t work great on my hair so I wasn&#x27;t very impressed. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I use Citre Shine Mist, Anti-Frizz Spray Laminator almost every day. It really makes a difference in the appearance of my hair. You only need 2 or 3 sprays and it makes your hair look so shiny an gorgeous; like you just came from the salon! Because you only need to use a couple sprays each time, the bottle lasts for a long time. My bottle isn&#x27;t even half empty after using it daily for 2 months. You get a quality product for a low price. This is the perfect product to finish off your hair routine. It&#x27;s not greasy AT ALL (unless you spray it an inch away from your roots) and definitely adds that extra \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; to your hair.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for a Shine Mist.  Not heavy or oily.  I continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Smells good but I didn&#x27;t see the shine.  It may have helped with frizz.  That&#x27;s difficult to say with my hair and all the humidity that has been here</li>
            <li> If you like greasy hair, then this is for you. no matter how little you spray, you hair will look like you havent showered in months. MASSIVE shine. almost blinding. but thereis no way around the greasy . i tried spraying on my hands then applying. no luck. tried hairspray after wards, no luck. dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of difference after I wash and dry my hair and then use this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It really reduces your frizz and leaves your hair shiny and very soft!!! I have curly damaged hair and this product helps me a lot!!!</li>
            <li> Please keep selling this stuff as reasonably priced as it is now..I never thought I could find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair but yet controls the flyaways a good bit and adds shine. I love it!</li>
            <li> Really good! My hair looks so shine! Like a got done in a hair salon.</li>
            <li> AGAIN, I can not buy it in HOng KOng!!!  I used it for years and try to find out replacement now!!!</li>
            <li> I guess it works for some, but not exactly for me, maybe  I will continue to use it, since I cold not get the via natural enhancing hair laminator. Thanks any way, not your fault.</li>
            <li> Light shiney mist that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down</li>
            <li> I have used Citre Shine products since turn of the century and then&lt;br /&gt;one day, the shampoo, conditioner and related products were gone&lt;br /&gt;from the shelves of all our stores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product truly makes hair shine unlike other products that have&lt;br /&gt;tons of advertising dollars and don&#x27;t deliver. If you can get the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;and conditioner, along with the Citre Shine Serum, then top off with&lt;br /&gt;the Laminator, you will be amazed how nice your hair will look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  love the smell, the shine, and it holds the cow licks where I curl them.</li>
            <li> Always love this stuff.  Can&#x27;t seem to find it in the stores anymore.  Just use it sparingly if you have fine hair.  Spray on hands then run through parts of hair that need it.  Otherwise, can turn hair into an oil slick.</li>
            <li> This product can be hard to find, but it&#x27;s worth looking for!!!  I have fine, tangly long hair.  I can&#x27;t hardly live without this product!!  It works great, and doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.  It makes styling easy, and leaves hair with a healthy shine.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell of most hair products, but this has a nice light citrus smell.  It also works well to defrizz my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the shine it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> smooths out my frizzy hair...great product!</li>
            <li> It was OK. It was too sticky. I washed my hair again, tried it again and it was a little better.  It got good ratings from others.</li>
            <li> I wish it had more natural ingredients but it works better than anything else I have tried. I have long hair that is prone to some frizz and tangling but this will make your hair silky smooth without leaving the feeling of any kind of residue. Works best if you spray it on damp, then blow dry completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray for years,  love it!  No alcohol so better on your hair! It&#x27;s a great detangler as well!</li>
            <li> This alcohol-free spray left my hair shiny, and manageable like no other misting spray would. You do have to be careful not to use too much, or your hair gets a greasy-look to it. I have a full head of thick, frizzy hair and this smoothes it out salon-style! The lack of alcohol in the product means it leaves my hair soft, without causing dryness with long-term use.</li>
            <li> Very good product, hard to find though, that&#x27;s why I bought two.</li>
            <li> I have not used this item yet.  The bottle is very small, so I am saving its contents for special occasions.  I am sure I will like it once I tried it.  This was my first purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It makes my hair look so silky and shiny without making it oily. I&#x27;ve used it for years.  The price is also reasonable.</li>
            <li> The seller claims to sell the original formula but I received a product with only silicones and a UV protectant as ingredients. It doesn&#x27;t even have any citrus extracts in it. I loved the original formula, but this new product just weighs my fine hair down and makes it greasy if I put too much on (which is way too easy to do). And if I apply the right amount, there is seemingly no difference to my hair. I contacted the seller and they just said that the original formula wasn&#x27;t available anymore. So if you came here looking for a silicone free product, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The product does indeed add shine to my hair, but it&#x27;s just an ok product to me. Will use longer and see if there are any noticeable changes</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny and lessens the frizz.</li>
            <li> I always went for the Citre Shine laminator that came in a tube format and prefer it to this.  However, this product works well and I would recommend it too.  I typically spray it on my hand and then apply to my hair that way, making it more similar to the product I used in the past.  It gives your hair a nice slick feeling without feeling sticky or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> i have very thick hair and wavy, so it&#x27;s very easy to get tangled. As soon as spray it my hair I can brush with no problem. It has a very pleasant smell and leaves hair very shiny with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Works well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t do a thing form my hair.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I want something that would add some shine because my hair is very curly and tends to frizz.  Wast of money.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been disappointed with this product. Just don&#x27;t see a shine or a reduction in frizz as I&#x27;d hoped for from reading the reviews. Doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference on my hair.</li>
            <li> this is my &amp;#34;Hands down&amp;#34; favorite hair product...I have been using it for 20 yrs...makes her soft and shiny&lt;br /&gt;and is very reasonably priced...one of those &amp;#34;best kept&amp;#34; secrets for sure.</li>
            <li> This product was better than most but I wanted a lighter shine because I have very short hair...it does not change the color of gray hair so that is a plus.....</li>
            <li> It definitely adds shine.</li>
            <li> This super shine mist gives hair a luminous shine.  Put it on while your hair is wet then blow it dry.  Add some more after it&#x27;s dry and it helps keep the frizzies down.  Makes it soft and swingin.  It&#x27;s go a nice scent too.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that gets really frizzy.  My hair can also look a little dull at times.  This product gives it a nice shine without being heavy and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I also use it to help detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
