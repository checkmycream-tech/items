    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I used to have perfect skin, but after age 19 things rapidly changed.</li>
            <li>Very impressed.</li>
            <li>AWESOME!</li>
            <li>It is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>My aesthetician commented at how great my skin looks and asked what I was using.  </li>
            <li>The PTR AHA/BHA acne clearing gel is great.  </li>
            <li>Both cleansers are good, by the way, but I prefer the ant-aging, as it has both salicylic acid and the glycolic acids.  </li>
            <li>how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li>the price is a bit steep but after paying for prescriptions with no results i cannot even put it into words how happy and pleased i am.</li>
            <li>I find it effective against acne and as a clarifying agent.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love the effectiveness of this acne busting gel.  </li>
            <li>I will say it&#x27;s a lovely, lightweight consistency and not sticky.  </li>
            <li>So many products with AHA/BHA are like rubbing glue on your face and this one is not.</li>
            <li>Okay . . .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s AHA/BHA for two years and love it.</li>
            <li>I love all the products that contain glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;purging effect\\&quot; like some people do, but I&#x27;m glad this is working for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a combination of the sleep, diet, and exercise that helps speed the healing process up, but I know for sure that this product contributes A LOT.  </li>
            <li>Whoever reads this, I hope this product works for you too :)</li>
            <li>i hope you have the same great results i have had!</li>
            <li>I love PTR products.</li>
            <li>I love them both.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this at a store before for twice the price, so I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things, over the counter, prescription, lotions, washes, etc...</li>
            <li>use this morning and night and also use vivant&#x27;s derm-a-gel (a retinoid) on top of it at night.</li>
            <li>The gel is very light, spreads easily, and soaks in/evaporates so that it feels and looks like you didn&#x27;t put anything on your skin at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t smell and can be used under makeup.  </li>
            <li>I now use benzoyl peroxide in the AM and this product in the PM and have seen great improvement in the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>When my friend told me this yesterday I looked in the mirror and said wow my skin does look good.</li>
            <li>i am so happy i finally found \\&quot;my product!\\&quot; .. it is so worth trying!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite skin product and hope PTR continues to make it forever!  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER personally had any good results, acne-wise, from using salicylic acid based products.  </li>
            <li>I had a travel size and now purchased full size product.</li>
            <li>I looked at the price and really wasn&#x27;t thrilled about paying that much for it.</li>
            <li>This AHA/BHA acne clearing gel is worth every cent</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This is easy, it works fast, and works consistently.</li>
            <li>ok but had to be applied with a pad (not eco friendly) and left a sticky, oily film (not what you want on oily skin).  </li>
            <li>I usually have great luck with PTR products and I have been using his scrubs and pads for years with no problems.  </li>
            <li>Finding it online for $24 instead of the usual steal was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I bought this PTR acne clearing gel along with a very gentle cleanser one day to try out.</li>
            <li>The Peter Roth AHA/BHA acne clearing gel really works!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects from using it, just nothing positive, either.</li>
            <li>I started getting mild acne as an adult.</li>
            <li>Most things I&#x27;ve tried wouldn&#x27;t work or would dry out my face.</li>
            <li>Large size for the price.</li>
            <li>I like that it comes in the large 2 oz.</li>
            <li>If there is one product I can&#x27;t live without, it&#x27;s this one!!  </li>
            <li>In spite of daily use my bottle is still quite full and I anticipate that it will last more than 6 months at this rate.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing to me.</li>
            <li>I put this product on before I went to bed and didn&#x27;t really expect a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I then started using it twice a day along with an SPF30 sunscreen and a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>whole grains, monounsaturated fat, lean proteins, and lots of fruits; and</li>
            <li>The gel is non sticky and penetrates into the skin very well.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price, the bottle is going to definitely get you your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m a very new user.</li>
            <li>I was previously using murad&#x27;s BHA exfoliating gel, but switched to this AHA/BHA exfoliating gel and it works better.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>The next morning (after some 8-hr glorious sleep) the redness was pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>I thought to myself I will try something new from this brand.</li>
            <li>My acne is very concentrated in a few spots (fortunately).</li>
            <li>I rarely get large pimples anymore, and I can actually leave the house with no makeup without feeling gross.</li>
            <li>It contains both types of acids which is a big plus as most products contain 1 or the other.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for several months and did not see any positive results from using it.  </li>
            <li>I also received the bottle half way open with leaking around the top.</li>
            <li>This product will clear your skin without overdrying.</li>
            <li>All I really noticed was that acne had diminished but this combo of AHA/BHA has improved my overall complexion.</li>
            <li>The 10% glycolic gel is much better and doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, this product is my least fav of the PTR line.</li>
            <li>I am 34 years old and have had acne since I was 14.</li>
            <li>there are still a few tiny blemishes after using the product for about two weeks now and i am confident it will continue to improve.</li>
            <li>I personally think that one intensive product is quite enough, which is why I&#x27;m using it with a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have moderate stubborn acne and this regime keeps me clear!</li>
            <li>It may sting a little but its worth the results.</li>
            <li>The clogged pores and blackheads are starting to clear up as well.</li>
            <li>One warning is your skin may appear to get worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li>After getting a facial and discovering that I actually have adult acne, I purchased this gel.</li>
            <li>I have been battling adult acne and clogged pores for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, large pores, and a few blemishes</li>

            <li> This product has helped tame the acne and has begun to lighten the red blotches; I feel somewhat normal again!</li>
            <li> But the pump dispenses too much, so it won&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would when I saw how big it was.</li>
            <li> while my acne has not completely cleared up, it is a VAST difference from where it was</li>
            <li> In the beginning of this summer, I started having really bad breakouts and they would go away on their own.</li>
            <li> Both cheap and expensive.</li>
            <li> She used a 10% Glycolic Gel to eat away at the dead skin and explained that, with my skin being as sensitive as it was, I could not use any type of exfoliant that required scrubbing or had beads, etc.</li>
            <li> My other recommendation is to use the gel, let it sit on the skin for about five to ten minutes, rinse it off and finish with a calming moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Does dry out my skin</li>
            <li> i have literally tried every single prescription treatment (clindamycin, retin-A, differin, benzaclin, benzoyl peroxide, accutane) and</li>
            <li> Really does help with black heads, but it must be used twice a week if you have a serious case.</li>
            <li> Also, it dries the skin, so be careful if you&#x27;re using another acne medication.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found other products that worked</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would go for other products for the regimen with AHA/BHA.</li>
            <li> I use this as a preventative treatment along with the PTR Max complexion correction pads, switching between the two every other night.</li>
            <li> i have struggled with acne on my back, shoulders and chest since my late 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It does burn a little kinda</li>
            <li> Sweat and dirt were trapped under layers of dead skin cells ergo acne was having a party under the surface.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t have a horrible odor, goes on easy and hasn&#x27;t made my skin dry.</li>
            <li> It has very weird smell and after putting it on my face my skin got really shiny and oily.</li>
            <li> and then my skin really started breaking out badly - something it hadn&#x27;t done in years.  </li>
            <li> and I have nothing negative to say.</li>
            <li> so I used it a few times, but was still uncomfortable with the scent.</li>
            <li> I use it as needed (approximately four times a week).</li>
            <li> I moved the the PNW to the Midwest in the middle of summer and had the worst break out of my life.</li>
            <li> I looked at and it was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> The breakout occurred once again and this time the inflammation was really bad.</li>
            <li> I was  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My chin is the worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this product, because after trying max complexion correction pads from Peter Thomas Roth I was amazed. I thought to myself I will try something new from this brand. I have acne prone skin. This product did absolutely nothing to me. It has very weird smell and after putting it on my face my skin got really shiny and oily. I also received the bottle half way open with leaking around the top. I was  very disappointed. This product is no for me!</li>
            <li> If there is one product I can&#x27;t live without, it&#x27;s this one!!  I love the effectiveness of this acne busting gel.  It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t smell and can be used under makeup.  I use it up to three times a day and don&#x27;t have a problem with dryness, however I do use a moisturizer.  My acne has cleared up dramatically.  My aesthetician commented at how great my skin looks and asked what I was using.  I use it with the anti-aging cleanser from PTR.  I also use the acne cleanser on occasion, as I have some samples left.  Both cleansers are good, by the way, but I prefer the ant-aging, as it has both salicylic acid and the glycolic acids.  This AHA/BHA acne clearing gel is worth every cent and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I usually have great luck with PTR products and I have been using his scrubs and pads for years with no problems.  I was looking for a treatment product that would keep my pores clearer and gave this a shot.  Thought I&#x27;d found the holy grail for a couple of days and then my skin really started breaking out badly - something it hadn&#x27;t done in years.  I guess I&#x27;m allergic to an ingredient in this stuff.  I will say it&#x27;s a lovely, lightweight consistency and not sticky.  So many products with AHA/BHA are like rubbing glue on your face and this one is not.</li>
            <li> After getting a facial and discovering that I actually have adult acne, I purchased this gel. The technician explained to me that the blotchy, red, groupings of nastiness (predominantly) on my cheeks was actually acne. Sweat and dirt were trapped under layers of dead skin cells ergo acne was having a party under the surface. She used a 10% Glycolic Gel to eat away at the dead skin and explained that, with my skin being as sensitive as it was, I could not use any type of exfoliant that required scrubbing or had beads, etc. So, I purchased this gel, because it had the same amount of Glycolic acid. I use it as needed (approximately four times a week). My acne is very concentrated in a few spots (fortunately). I used to have perfect skin, but after age 19 things rapidly changed. This product has helped tame the acne and has begun to lighten the red blotches; I feel somewhat normal again! Maybe the Salad Days have returned?!?!   Okay . . . the short summary . . . if you have super-sensitive skin and are dealing with acne, then this gel could help! My other recommendation is to use the gel, let it sit on the skin for about five to ten minutes, rinse it off and finish with a calming moisturizer. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s AHA/BHA for two years and love it. Finding it online for $24 instead of the usual steal was too good to be true. I received it, and there was an off odor. It wasn&#x27;t expired so I used it a few times, but was still uncomfortable with the scent. I&#x27;ve never had a bottle that smelled. I&#x27;ll stick to buying it at my facialist.</li>
            <li> I have been battling adult acne and clogged pores for as long as I can remember. My chin is the worst. This product was recommended by the place I go to get facials. I looked at and it was very skeptical. I looked at the price and really wasn&#x27;t thrilled about paying that much for it. I bit the bullet and bought it. It was worth every penny and then some. I have been using it for a month now and have seen drastic results. I also went out and got the cleansing gel from Peter Thomas and the buff beads. I love all the products that contain glycolic acid. It may sting a little but its worth the results. One warning is your skin may appear to get worse before it gets better. This happened to me. Just keep using it until its cleared up.</li>
            <li> I used this product for several months and did not see any positive results from using it.  I have NEVER personally had any good results, acne-wise, from using salicylic acid based products.  I have stubborn, hormonal acne, and this didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects from using it, just nothing positive, either.</li>
            <li> Large size for the price. Does dry out my skin but that is what I want. Will keep this on hand! Very impressed.</li>
            <li> I have oily porous skin. There no miracles in this situation will happen as we all know, but this product seems to make a difference. I find it effective against acne and as a clarifying agent. I had a travel size and now purchased full size product.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked on my skin. I moved the the PNW to the Midwest in the middle of summer and had the worst break out of my life. This is easy, it works fast, and works consistently. You can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price, the bottle is going to definitely get you your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I was looking for the fragrance-free salicylic acid, and I like that. I like that it comes in the large 2 oz. size. But the pump dispenses too much, so it won&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would when I saw how big it was. I like to use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, large pores, and a few blemishes so I have used many expensive skin products over the years.  The PTR AHA/BHA acne clearing gel is great.  It contains both types of acids which is a big plus as most products contain 1 or the other.  The gel is very light, spreads easily, and soaks in/evaporates so that it feels and looks like you didn&#x27;t put anything on your skin at all.  I&#x27;ve found other products that worked ok but had to be applied with a pad (not eco friendly) and left a sticky, oily film (not what you want on oily skin).  This is my new favorite skin product and hope PTR continues to make it forever!  Try it and I think you&#x27;ll agree.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with an olive skin tone. I have had problems with blackheads and some clogged pores on my nose -- no big deal. In the beginning of this summer, I started having really bad breakouts and they would go away on their own. Though, each time I got the breakout, I got acne scars and marks on my face. The breakout occurred once again and this time the inflammation was really bad. My cheeks were red from the acne and there were still some post-acne scars. I bought this PTR acne clearing gel along with a very gentle cleanser one day to try out. I put this product on before I went to bed and didn&#x27;t really expect a whole lot. The next morning (after some 8-hr glorious sleep) the redness was pretty much gone. I then started using it twice a day along with an SPF30 sunscreen and a gentle cleanser. By day 5, the scars had faded that my roommate and my boyfriend noticed. I didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;purging effect\\&quot; like some people do, but I&#x27;m glad this is working for me. I don&#x27;t know if I would go for other products for the regimen with AHA/BHA. I personally think that one intensive product is quite enough, which is why I&#x27;m using it with a gentle cleanser. The clogged pores and blackheads are starting to clear up as well. I&#x27;ve always been eating well -- whole grains, monounsaturated fat, lean proteins, and lots of fruits; and I try to get a lot of good-quality sleep every night. It&#x27;s probably a combination of the sleep, diet, and exercise that helps speed the healing process up, but I know for sure that this product contributes A LOT.  Whoever reads this, I hope this product works for you too :)</li>
            <li> i have struggled with acne on my back, shoulders and chest since my late 20&#x27;s. i have literally tried every single prescription treatment (clindamycin, retin-A, differin, benzaclin, benzoyl peroxide, accutane) and nothing has given me the confidence to wear backless anything. i heard about PTR through a friend and figured i would give it a try. the price is a bit steep but after paying for prescriptions with no results i cannot even put it into words how happy and pleased i am. while my acne has not completely cleared up, it is a VAST difference from where it was and i&#x27;m a very new user. there are still a few tiny blemishes after using the product for about two weeks now and i am confident it will continue to improve. i am so happy i finally found \\&quot;my product!\\&quot; .. it is so worth trying! i hope you have the same great results i have had!</li>
            <li> I started getting mild acne as an adult. Most things I&#x27;ve tried wouldn&#x27;t work or would dry out my face. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and I have nothing negative to say. It isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t have a horrible odor, goes on easy and hasn&#x27;t made my skin dry. I was complemented by several people (strangers &amp; friends) how good my skin looks. When my friend told me this yesterday I looked in the mirror and said wow my skin does look good. All I really noticed was that acne had diminished but this combo of AHA/BHA has improved my overall complexion. AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Added this product to my skin care regime as I was told by me esthetician that my skin could use softening. I now use benzoyl peroxide in the AM and this product in the PM and have seen great improvement in the overall appearance of my skin. In spite of daily use my bottle is still quite full and I anticipate that it will last more than 6 months at this rate. For the price it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> The Peter Roth AHA/BHA acne clearing gel really works! This product will clear your skin without overdrying. The gel is non sticky and penetrates into the skin very well. It also helps to prevent age related wrinkles. I like this product. Oily skin can benefit from this product without break outs. I recommend this product to all Amazon&#x27;s customers. Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love PTR products. I use this as a preventative treatment along with the PTR Max complexion correction pads, switching between the two every other night. I love them both. Especially since this gel has lasted me over a year!</li>
            <li> Really does help with black heads, but it must be used twice a week if you have a serious case. Also, it dries the skin, so be careful if you&#x27;re using another acne medication.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this at a store before for twice the price, so I&#x27;m glad I found it here. I&#x27;ve used this product for a while and I really like it. It does burn a little kinda like toner does when u apply it after washing your face, but it works well. I switched my skin regimen from proactive to ptr and saw an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> The 10% glycolic gel is much better and doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, this product is my least fav of the PTR line.</li>
            <li> I am 34 years old and have had acne since I was 14. I have tried many things, over the counter, prescription, lotions, washes, etc... Both cheap and expensive. I had remembered someone using Roth products on me during a facial. The gel made sense to me, because you don&#x27;t rinse it off. Nothing has ever made a difference in my skin , ever. This stuff does. It is amazing!! I never thought I would say that. I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot on skin care products, nothing works, so why should I? Now, I don&#x27;t ever go without this stuff. It is worth every penny. If I don&#x27;t use it, I see a difference. It has elimanted the cystic acne along my jaw line. I rarely get large pimples anymore, and I can actually leave the house with no makeup without feeling gross.</li>
            <li> I was previously using murad&#x27;s BHA exfoliating gel, but switched to this AHA/BHA exfoliating gel and it works better. BHA (aka salycylic acid) exfoliates the inside of your pores and AHA (aka gycolic acid) exfoliates the surface of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely tell a difference by switching to a combination product because now the surface of my skin is being exfoliated in addition to the inside of my pores. My skin feels smoother and is clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this morning and night and also use vivant&#x27;s derm-a-gel (a retinoid) on top of it at night. For face wash I use glytone&#x27;s oily skin cleanser. I have moderate stubborn acne and this regime keeps me clear!</li>
