            <li>It is a good moisturizer for the eye area.</li>
            <li>For the price it is good buy.</li>
            <li>I saw good reviews on the product and also saw reviews saying that people had allergic reactions to it.</li>
            <li>This eye cream had good reviews</li>
            <li>eye cream works good and going through Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this eye serum and was so impressed!  </li>
            <li>May be a good moisturizer, but that wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Olay is a good name</li>
            <li>This product does a good job of reducing puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Amazon.com is a good source to turn to purchase this eye serum.</li>
            <li>I have a really good dermatologist, so I consulted him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is a product that can take all the wrinkles away,but this ones does a good job.</li>
            <li>I would say this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Good bargain.</li>
            <li>blends in nicely and lasts all day, Great price too, quite affordable.</li>

            <li>People comment on my skin looking good.  </li>
            <li>Olay regenerist feels good when I put it on.</li>
            <li>Good price and good product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Even though I cannot deny the fact that Olay did a good job on my eye, not to compare with L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>The Olay Regenerist Eye serum does a good job of smoothing the crow feet of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The product is good, the packaging wasteful.</li>
            <li>Good price; shipped promptly; as advertised.</li>
            <li>ITS TRUE, ITS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE TRIED AND WILL CONTINUE.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that it&#x27;s in this squeeze tube instead of the stand up bottle that I could never get most of the product out of.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very glad it can still be ordered through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this for awhile and love the lightness and the great job it does around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Even on the rare sale there-the best price is still Amazon.</li>
            <li>I Love It - very effective - not greasy - very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>Very good product - not greasy, but rich.  </li>
            <li>is a good brand with many many many awesome products, but dont be suckered into spending more money than you need to!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>So I purchased 3 more of the Regenerist products to try!  </li>
            <li>Love it and hope you do too!</li>
            <li>I always love my Olay products and use them faithfully!</li>
            <li>and I am receiving many compliments!  </li>
            <li>I used it for about a month and it made my eyes more puffy!</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m totally satisfied with it!</li>
            <li>I will update my review at the end of this bottle to let you know if I still love it or if anything has changed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eye cream!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not excessively expensive but it smooths your skin and feels great!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Oil of Olay!  </li>
            <li>I use it on top of my makeup!  </li>
            <li>I Love it!</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product!</li>
            <li>The item was exactly  what I ordered and was happy to receive it so promptly!  </li>
            <li>I tried it as soon as I  got it and love it!</li>
            <li>I am very particular about my eyes and making them look their best.</li>
            <li>and the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing serum.</li>
            <li>well it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I always liked Olay products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely effective for under the eye</li>
            <li>I started the regimen about two weeks ago, and I can honestly say that I see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>was nice.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice though</li>
            <li>Anytime you can provide a good moisturizer &amp; do it each and every day, you are going to have better looking skin than doing nothing all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always tried to take care of my skin, but I thought my age was catching up with me.</li>
            <li>The size of the lotion bottle kind of scared me given the cost</li>
            <li>No miracles but absorbs nicely and smooths wrinkles temporarily.</li>
            <li>This feels really nice to apply....</li>
            <li>these are both excellent, but neither is as good as ROC&#x27;s Retinol Correxion Sensitive Eye Cream.</li>
            <li>Product is nice.</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>Nice eye cream - can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I found this serum to be nice and it does help.</li>
            <li>and I like that the serum is not greasy and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>It feels nice going on and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had estheticians comment about how nicely the skin around my over-50 eyes is retaining its tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are others just as good with easier to access product.</li>
            <li>What a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>I tried this Eye Lifting Serum because I read so many good reviews about it</li>
            <li>They offered a product I love at a really fair price.</li>
            <li>Regenerist series received many good reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to lift all of the wrinkles around my eyes at 58 yo, but it smoothed them out and gave my eyes a kind of glow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided that those reviewers must own stock in the company and are attempting to drum up sales.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>nice feel and seems to be showing results</li>
            <li>I have it on autoship and never have to worry about running out or catching a sale.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any effective results.</li>
            <li>Handy to travel with also</li>
            <li>Did a lot of research to find a good quality eye cream with acceptable price and found a video where it said that this cream was recommended by most dermatologists.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve using this proactively (I&#x27;m 25), but I do have some wrinkles forming, but I don&#x27;t know if this product is honestly helping me at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use some retina-a around my eyes and a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is a nice consistency and has no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>will continue to have it automatically sent to my home with is great price and quick service.</li>
            <li>Have used this for years and continue to be impressed with its quality and effect--very smooth and light; easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Pure 2 oz.]](not Olay but a really good deal!), the eye serum and</li>
            <li>I do see a visible improvement of very fine lines.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to start taking better care of my eyes and have read that Olay products are very good.  </li>
            <li>Bottle]]\\&quot; is a great choice as it is FRAGRANCE FREE and does a great job of keeping my face looking fresh and clean after a shave or after washing.</li>
            <li>have always been a fan of the Olay Regenerist line - they are excellent products that are generally quite affordable.</li>
            <li>I prefer the ProX Eye Cream, though this one felt very smooth  </li>
            <li>This serum makes my skin feel very smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and makes my skin feel nice.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, she was able to avoid the rash!</li>
            <li>Received super fast and great price!</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t tan which probably contributes, but I&#x27;ve started using the regenerist spf lotion on my hands and what a huge difference it has made!  </li>
            <li>I have been using Oil of Ulay &amp;#34;beauty fluid&amp;#34; since 1972 and continue to be a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I used this serum for many years, then changed to Pro-X at some point.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I was purchasing this from Target-this is a much better price,</li>
            <li>My eyes are looking better every day.</li>
            <li>Product is OK.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, and has a nice, almost shiny look to it.  </li>
            <li>Much better products out there</li>
            <li>While there is no proof of a causal link, the EU has banned many of these ingredients.     </li>
            <li>I have signed up for Subscribe &amp; Save on all of these products, PLUS the Night Resurfacing Elixir and the Micro Sculpting Cream, more for my neck than my face, since I tend to break out with anything heavier than a lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold.  :)</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years now and find it to be the best even over department store products.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with Olay&#x27;s eye lifting serum.</li>
            <li>i love the way this feels when applied.  </li>
            <li>i still have more than 1/2 the bottle to use, so it may get better.  </li>
            <li>And the eye cream itself is quite nice, goes on smoothly, moisturizes and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>Consumer reports rated this over many, many top selling, name brand skin care</li>
            <li>Maybe a tube would be better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist Eye Serum for about 3 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I use this as a twice a day moisturizer around my eyes, am &amp; pm, and still really love it.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Ladies, its maintenance, and if you want to look your best, than you gotta find a routine for a product, such as this.  </li>
            <li>I also LOVE getting this from Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save, as its saves me money and is always there when I run out.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the product...</li>
            <li>I use this product daily, and it works great!!</li>
            <li>It is nice going on, it seems to smooth the eye area, help with lines and firms the eye area.  </li>
            <li>, when you can not pump any more out do not throw it away.  </li>
            <li>Just pull off the top and put the bottle on the side</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this since so many people seem to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I am using so many Olay products</li>
            <li>No, I don&#x27;t have the pump accidentally in the locked position. :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ended up having to unscrew the pump top to get to the rest of the product in the bottle which defeats the convenience of the pump and purity of the product.</li>
            <li>There needs to be a better way to package the product so that one can use all without having to remove the top and try and get the cream out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the Olay roller, but I like this serum better.  </li>
            <li>All skin needs moisture to stay healthy.</li>
            <li>- I am glad to be able to save 150 bucks on one eye cream now</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>also love that the serum doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as I do have sensative</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I heart Amazon. :)</li>
            <li>but I have switched to Oil of Olay and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>Signed up for scheduled refills, to get an even better price than store sales.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I credit it to using this eye serum for many years.  </li>
            <li>I hope this helps people :-)</li>
            <li>As for giving a lift for your eye lids skin, I am not so sure of that.  </li>
            <li>After looking at many eye creams I stumbled upon this one.</li>
            <li>I really love it, and for a man..</li>
            <li>I can be sure that I will get carded.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, great product in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li>but then most eye creams can&#x27;t take wrinkles away anyhow.  </li>
            <li>I just bought wrinkle twinkle and like it better.</li>
            <li>2) most of the ingredients in their products are \\&quot;fillers\\&quot;, which have no benefits they just work to bulk up the cream.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t develop my sensitivity until my 30s, but I&#x27;m told that it&#x27;s something most people will eventually develop.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s obvious it works great!  </li>
            <li>I use this night and day and love the way it feels.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I was expecting more in the eyelid and area between eye and eyebrow.  </li>
            <li>They need to design a better bottle and/or dispenser.</li>
            <li>I love Oil of Olay products.  </li>
            <li>I make sure I never run out.  </li>
            <li>I did some research and this seems to be the most bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>love the product, do see a difference in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have to take the top off and scrape the insides to get product out.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It can take more than it says.</li>
            <li>just overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I love the container, which is so much better than a pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;AND, if you buy more, you don&#x27;t want to risk.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>it seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li>I like the pump because one has better control  when applying the cream.</li>
            <li>want to order more from Olay like this</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d ever use an Olay product, but I&#x27;m finding more and more that the Regenerist line is great.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I tossed this in the trash and will think twice before buying more Olay products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok moisturizer, but I haven&#x27;t seen any firming or lifting effects at all.</li>
            <li>All you do is apply it around the eyes twice a day and the results were satisfying.</li>
            <li>I love this eye serum because it keeps my eyes looking youthful.</li>
            <li>I thought I would make more of an effort to look better</li>
            <li>I love this eye serum.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for many years</li>
            <li>Love the product and the way it goes on.</li>
            <li>My lower eyelid experienced spasms from using it and my eyes also became very watery.</li>
            <li>okay there is still some</li>
            <li>Many can expect allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with it and think I will likely continue to use it!</li>
            <li>I use a bit more at night.</li>
            <li>Ladies, its maintenance, and if you want to look your best, than you gotta find a routine for a product, such as this.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE getting this from Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save, as its saves me money and is always there when I run out.</li>
            <li>What i liked about the product is that it was really light.</li>
            <li>Love this product it keeps the eye area</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores for a while.  </li>
            <li>A lot of the time I do not like the newer, better version of products and most companies are &amp;#34;upgrading&amp;#34; their products so rapidly.</li>
            <li>I love olay regenerist im 32 and</li>
            <li>Nice light under eye serum.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>this eye cream works better</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>I love this product, but I don&#x27;t like the packaging of the serum itself.  </li>
            <li>While some products can run close to a hundred dollars or more, for the price the product does deliver.  </li>
            <li>but now I am using Meaningful Beauty, which I believe is much better.  </li>
            <li>And with my Amazon subscription for regular deliveries, I get more before I run out, at the best price!</li>
            <li>Most of the anti-aging eye products are loaded with ingredients that burn the heck out of my eyelids.</li>
            <li>It is okay.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last 12 months and am so impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li>Love the product..</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Most of them oil of olay.  </li>
            <li>This is a great lotion for the eye area, especially on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It does not cause any allergic reactions and helps aging skin look better, too.  </li>
            <li>this is my favorite eye</li>
            <li>cream!&lt;br /&gt;much much better than chanel, rancome, or estee</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>and I am way more satisfied with this than the creme.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs</li>
            <li>if it you already used it before or if you are sure that it will not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>I love oil of olay but not this one.</li>
            <li>I love the product but DON&#x27;T USE THE IMAGE OF THE SQUEEZE TUBE WHEN YOU SEND IT IN THE PUMP -</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t unscrew the top; it&#x27;s attached.  </li>
            <li>Worked ok.</li>
            <li>My favorite eye serum.</li>
            <li>Normally, I love Olay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lotion on my face for most of my life, but never an &amp;#34;eye cream&amp;#34</li>
            <li>(I suggest reapplying under-eye after an hour or so, for more prolonged moisturizing.)</li>
            <li>I can buy it cheaper and more conveniently at Walmart stores.</li>
            <li>I liked the smooth, creamy feel of this serum but saw no &#x27;lifting&#x27; or improvement under my eyes.</li>
            <li>The skin around the eyes is more taut.</li>
            <li>Better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I real.ly love this product</li>
            <li>I am in love with this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and can&#x27;t wait to see more</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with my purchase, and plan to keep on purchasing this item.</li>
            <li>If I rub at my watery eyes and cause more darkness and inflammation kinda defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>Felt good on my eyes and helped the bags under them, seemed to brighten them right away.</li>
            <li>This eye cream despenses just the right amount and feels good going on.  </li>
            <li>Great for the dark circles under my eyes, great for reduced redness and puffiness-</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this great product.  </li>
            <li>It has a good consistency, goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Has a nice light, creamy feel (NOT oily, NOT greasy)...and absorbs quite easily into skin.</li>
            <li>I have to add that Olay products are excellent in the long run.  </li>
            <li>good buy for the money, and really works!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s about as good as any other nice eye cream out there, good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Not at all happy and looking for a new product line.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, felt great, soft, hydrating from the get go.</li>
            <li>The cream comes out easily and does not put out more than one needs.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this one was perfect for me, didn&#x27;t dry me out or leave me too oily and that happens with a lot of products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>So glad that Amazon makes it so easy to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I wanted this one with dropper top for easy application.  </li>
            <li>I had noticed that the fine lines in my face were becoming more prominent and that the L&#x27;Oreal products were not delivering anymore.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product love how you can subscribe and get even a better deal</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely soft cream that leaves the area under my eyes feeling very nice.</li>
            <li>As for as lifting and fine line magic.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a remarkable difference in my eyes after the first use, which is rare for a lot of products!</li>
            <li>I love the silky smooth feel of the serum/cream.  </li>
            <li>Many are free of PEGs, EDTA, Parabens, phthalates and ureas (among others).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s available most places.</li>
            <li>, I shook it, I tried everything possible, but the pump was incredibly inconsistent (if it worked at all).  </li>
            <li>Although it is available at Walgreens and Target stores, the price is much better through the auto ship program.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed nicely around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>The container has a good pump (easy control on how much to pumo out).</li>
            <li>Not greasy, just perfect if you don&#x27;t mind paying a little more.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to carry in a make-up bag for raveling too.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and you can see the difference as soon as you put it on.  </li>
            <li>I read many great reviews about Olay&#x27;s product and this will be my last buy from them.</li>
            <li>I thought the cream had run out very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and I plan to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Olay products work well, are affordable, and are easy to get your hands on.  </li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed using Olay skin products, specially the Regenerist moisturizer for the face.</li>
            <li>Yes, I do see results--less fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>When looking in the mirror, I noticed the fine lines disappearing.</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Now I have to fine another product to undo (or hide)</li>
            <li>Found the serum smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve notice a reduction in fine lines (crows feet)</li>
            <li>This product moisturizes well while reducing puffiness and fine lines over time.</li>
            <li>did nothing for my under eye fine lines..</li>
            <li>I had previously used this product for years with excellent results until they changed the packaging AND the formula.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was a trial size, which was fine; since I was testing it out.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any change with my fine lines and crows feet.  </li>
            <li>Fine lines diminished.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll make much more difference in terms of firming than this product.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and while the packaging is new, the results are just as great as with the original packaging.</li>
            <li>Super smooth going on and the resusts are fabulous!</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to get to the bottom of the product.&lt;br /&gt;But very satisfied and will purchase again! :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in wrinkles</li>
            <li>those darn crows feet are starting, and this Olay eye serum feel smooth going on, makes your eyes look great, even under make-up.</li>
            <li>Nothing will work miracles, but this has been the most effective remedy that I have found so far.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference (yet)</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan if all Olay products, this one included.  </li>
            <li>and it has made a huge difference in the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and can&#x27;t say I see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>This product has never made my eyes sting, and it just keeps on keeping my aging eyes sag and line free.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a year, and it greatly improves the look of the upper eyelid</li>
            <li>It seemed shear and light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can turn the pump so that it locks into an open position, great for if you need to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smooth, not oily - doesn&#x27;t interfere with contact lenses.</li>
            <li>I have confirmed this.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy all of the Olay products.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great thing with all the shaving and scrubbing of my face on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, goes on light and absorbs in.</li>
            <li>This serum goes on smoothly and and apprears to be fragrance free (a fragrance is ALWAYS a deal breaker for me).  </li>
            <li>of course I cannot yet tell if I appear much younger, but it feels great, and I don&#x27;t worry about putting it on my eyelid</li>

            <li>but it does go on smooth and</li>
            <li>I had a lengthy conversation with Olay customer service today and the rep confirmed that in order to improve the formula they added &amp;#34;sodium peg seven olive oil carboxylate&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>and she recommended the Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Roller.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the moisture this product provides.</li>
            <li>This makes for a thoughtful gift just by itself as well.</li>
            <li>I have a great extra use for this eye serum -</li>
            <li>I agree with the majority of reviewers about this gentle but effective cream.  </li>
            <li>and honestly I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin or eyes.</li>
            <li>I tried this because Amazon made it so cheap; I had never used an eye lifting serum before.  </li>
            <li>Also, product goes on smoothly and does not sting.</li>

            <li>I use it anyway to help keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>Works well if you are looking for light moisturizing.</li>
            <li>They are available just about everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I do like how light of a cream this is.  </li>
            <li>So far, it is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product feels on my eyes, better than any cream I&#x27;ve used but the dispenser as others have reported leaves much to be desired.  </li>
            <li>I have it on good authority that eye area serums, lotions, and creams are all gimmicks, and you are better off just using your regular moisturizer generously in your eye area.</li>
            <li>Good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the formula changed when the packaging changed, but I liked the &#x27;old&#x27; version better.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Super hydrating, goes right into skin and not oily!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the results and certainly the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used excellent eye creams before, and they normally tighten your skin in the eye area instantly, but this serum is way too watery to tighten your skin...     </li>
            <li>The skins around my eyes is significantly tighter.</li>
            <li>SO, I must first say I typically LOVE Regenerist products.</li>
            <li>Well, yes, as I am a consistent user and never miss a day with this product, so that consistency is part of why I think my eyes and the skin around them remains more youthful than others my age.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks of use, I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li>and I received the Olay Regenerist Eye Listing Serum, but it was in a tube rather than the original pump container.</li>
            <li>J was.purchasing Olay original eye serum.</li>
            <li>I just wish I had ordered more because I like it so much!</li>
            <li>so the demand will keep Olay making this great product for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li>Used it successfully for several years.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way to get the last 1/4&amp;#34; or so of product out of the container without prying off the top and digging it out with some kind of implement that will fit the bottle&#x27;s opening.  </li>
            <li>The Original Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100%</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Did I always have this many fine lines and the product made it more apparent?</li>
            <li>I think alot of this has to do with this product, (and clean living of course, ) and I say give it a try.</li>
            <li>but I like the smooth feel of this serum and how quickly it soaks into my eye skin (eyelid and under eye).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special</li>
            <li>My swollen under-eye bags have gone down an amazing amount, I look like I did more than 5 years ago!  </li>
            <li>The serum isn&#x27;t anything special, but it&#x27;s also not a bad item either.  </li>
            <li>My thirsty skins soaks this right up, erasing fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I have used this eye serum for at least 10 years because it is the best eye product I have ever found.</li>
            <li>I bought it from reading the overall good reviews.      </li>
            <li>This product is full of PEGs, EDTA and parabens -- ingredients now banned in the EU because they are endocrine disruptors.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s doing a good job.</li>
            <li>These were the only good things about it for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We all get old sooner or later, yes, but if I could age more gracefully, which now I can, I am one happy woman.</li>
            <li>; Stands true to claims.</li>
            <li>This serum is excellent around the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that this product has transformed my eyes, but I suppose it&#x27;s not a bad product as eye creams/serums</li>
            <li>I saw the Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum here on Amazon and due to the great price, I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>the Amazon price is outstanding, particularly on the Subscribe and Save plan; and NO TAXES!&lt;br /&gt;10)</li>
            <li>the pump no longer dispenses any more), there&#x27;s still a lot more left inside.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful - not greasy or heavy under my eyes, it absorbs really well.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but I ordered it in the tube, and it came in the older pump bottle.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and gentle with my skin, but those are the only good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>I went by guidelines with getting adequate amounts of sleep, drinking water, staying away from sodium etc..</li>
            <li>The shipment was quick.</li>
            <li>Just know that this particular one is more of a sample size.</li>
            <li>If I put this on over the moisturizer, it&#x27;s super shiny.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was as ordered.</li>
            <li>Feels nice but really didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li>After a visit to the dermatologist for a botox consultation, and being informed that my particular set of wrinkles wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be alleviated by botox to the extent I was looking for, I thought I&#x27;d purchase some eye cream and see if that helped.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I highly recommend it to all.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see that it is any better than any other kind of eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I think \\&quot;Shopper\\&quot; did a great job breaking down all the pros and cons</li>
            <li>Kind of a clever way to get you to buy the cream sooner than when it really runs out.</li>
            <li>I mean, it does the lifting around the eyes like it said it would, I&#x27;m impressed, fragrance-free, which is better for my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>My right eye looked much better than the left one, which means L&#x27;Oreal cream works better than Olay.</li>
            <li>Dermalogica Multiyitamin power firm eye cream is my savior, I looks incredibly handsome, before I couldn&#x27;t even look at me in the mirror, but now I am so happy and confident because of my face,  and it takes only 3 days for the difference.</li>
            <li>Never had contact dermatitis before, will be much more carefull trying a new product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to be frugal, but this is one of the areas where I think taking good care of yourself is worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>is highly moisturising (YEY!!!)</li>
            <li>Thank you SO MUCH Olay!!  </li>
            <li>It did pretty well!  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome buy for far less than the price at the store.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it does much to diminish my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>So far, I really enjoy this serum, it feels very smooth and silky, my skin absorbs it really fast without feeling oily and it does not set in the lines.</li>
            <li>Olay Reginerist Eye Lifting Serum is a great product, especially for fine wrinkles around the eyes (they will actually go away after faithful use).</li>
            <li>Will invest future purchases as this is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>The price is amazing especially on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product really made my eye area smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Fantastic price, and fast shipping</li>
            <li>The product was easily absorbed, and there was no noticable fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin of anyone I know, and this product does not irritate it at all.  </li>
            <li>I am always told that I look way too young to have 8 grandchildren, &amp; most people assume that when I have any of my grandchildren with me that I am \\&quot;mom\\&quot;, not \\&quot;grandma\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying for yourself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth a try.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li>All in all, I don&#x27;t think this product is worth a penny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>But then red, swollen and puffy wasn&#x27;t any kind of improvement.  </li>
            <li>, it was true when you made your first order.</li>
            <li>The serum did nothing to make my eyes look energetic, soft, or lessen the bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product because the price is well worth it</li>
            <li>It gives the skin around my eyes a very shiny look, and I imagine it must take some doing to make eye makeup actually look good with this shine going on.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on a .05 ounce bottle of magic potion about the size of a thumbnail.  </li>
            <li>Eating right and staying fit will keep you healthy, this product will help you look younger.</li>
            <li>I know that Olay continues to bring out new, more advanced products all the time, but I have sensitive skin and will react to new products more often than not.  </li>
            <li>I know that Olay continues to bring out new, more advanced products all the time, but I have sensitive skin and will react to new products more often than not.</li>
            <li>This particular one was voted the best value and test results were very positive and comparable to the more expensive competitors.  </li>
            <li>Ok,  I have used other products that seem to work better.</li>
            <li>Has a strong fragrance, too strong, in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li>Good results, does not make the eyes puffy as some other eye creams do</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product (moisturises and tightens without causing allergies) and its price (product is long lasting and comes with Amazon discount, free delivery and no taxes).</li>
            <li>All other Amazon products I have ordered have been good, just not this one.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with its results, which have been better than more expensive creams.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, there were good reviews from my friends for L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s one of the pricier ones in the drug store -- but you can get the eye cream for right under $20.</li>
            <li>The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li>And was delivered right away</li>
            <li>If the proof weren&#x27;t right on my face, I wouldn&#x27;t believe it myself.</li>
            <li>but right now it is thumbs up.</li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much every eye skin product available in the department and specialty store, including Clinique and Chanel.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products far more expensive, and have found this one to be the most effective at this stage of my life.  </li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve seen some wand type highlighting products for a pretty high price and I smile that I already have a perfect highlighter with reflective mica that is treating my eye area.  </li>
            <li>I started to weigh new bottles to make sure new bottles were full when purchased and this is not the problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect consistency, &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; pretty quickly for make up application and has just enough little gold highlights to make the eye area pop.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using this one for the last half a year, so that&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>all these new fine lines I&#x27;m stuck with.</li>
            <li>This eye serum, with slight tinted shade, is very smooth that gets absorbed easily.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more to get better quality.</li>
            <li>Look for a product that is hypoallergenic if you know you are sensitive; that your eyes become irritated easily.</li>
            <li>The smile lines around my eyes are noticeably lessened by quite a bit and, while I could be happier (a product that completely removed wrinkles and smile lines would be nice), this product far exceeded my expectations for what could be accomplished using a dedicated eye cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and smooth</li>
            <li>The product is contained in a nice little travel friendly pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>so I use this primarily for the moisturizer, but I figure it&#x27;s never to early to start anti-aging!</li>
            <li>This is a decent eye cream but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>In just 2 days I actually saw fine lines forming under my eyes!</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>(During the day I use Olay Eye Regenerating Cream With A Touch Of Concealer, which I like very much.)</li>
            <li>I like this eye lifting serum very much.</li>
            <li>i like it very much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t take care of with a little make-up, good sleeping habits, diet, exercise, sunblock, and water.</li>
            <li>Most of them don&#x27;t work and some actually make your eyes sting and burn.</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>Works the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to go order more products from this line, because if this eye serum is any indication, I think the Olay commercials touting the benefits of their Regenerist line are actually telling the truth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sufficient by itself though, and needs a layer of the total effects eye cream on top.</li>
            <li>If it could actually do what it claims it would cost a ton more and be administered by a doctor.</li>
            <li>First, in case the name didn&#x27;t give it away, I&#x27;m a man.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has varied results given everyone&#x27;s skin is different</li>
            <li>Be aware of this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks so no immediate results, but love the product.</li>
            <li>People look at your eyes all the time when they talk to you, so they notice that pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to be frugal, but this is one of the areas where I think taking good care of yourself is worth it in the long run.alk to you are generally looking at your face and your eyes when they do</li>
            <li>At first when I started using this product, it seemed to moisturize my under eye area well.</li>
            <li>I found Beautypedia last year, and not only are they free, but 100% of their info is backed by their own research and experimentation&lt;</li>
            <li>I bought this product first, before getting the Olay ProX eye lifting serum.  </li>
            <li>I love all Olay products but especially the Regenerist Serums and night cream.</li>
            <li>First time user of this product.  </li>
            <li>but it never lasts me long enough to feel like it&#x27;s a great price for the size.</li>
            <li>Finally, I had to pop the top off</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>But this product works very well for me!</li>
            <li>WHICH, AFTERALL, IS EXACTLY</li>
            <li>so I wish I would have bought it online first because it&#x27;s noticeably cheaper.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it&#x27;s not the fountain of youth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive and it works.  </li>
            <li>It lifts as much as a non-surgical method can do!</li>
            <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t expect miracle eye creams/serums, plenty of sleep + healthy life style is the key.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li>I know that someday I&#x27;ll have to get an eye lift, but insurance is funny about approving surgery untl the lid interferes with my vision.</li>
            <li>same size, a bit more money</li>
            <li>Ordering through Amazon is a lot more convenient and actually cheaper (esp.</li>
            <li>Product seems to be working pretty well - my eyes seem litter and smoother every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>My under-eyes started looking really haggard and a bit puffy!</li>
            <li>At first use I saw the result.</li>
            <li>My only wish is for more in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and leaves my eye area soft.  </li>
            <li>Overall though, I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It is not very expensive, but, still pricey and would be more worth the money if it came in a bigger size.  </li>
            <li>And this is when the bottle is new and supposedly full.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, this eye serum goes on very easily.</li>
            <li>but Amazon had it at a great price, though a very small container.</li>
            <li>and P.M. Feels rich, creamy, but not heavy.</li>
            <li>My concealer goes on nicely after applying this serum which is not always the case with other eye creams.  </li>
            <li>The product in this new packaging is inferior and not as creamy and absorbing as the original in the pump container.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product (moisturises and tightens without causing allergies) and its price (product is long lasting and comes with Amazon discount, free delivery and no taxes).</li>
            <li>For less than $20 you can have a more hydrated and toned eye area!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very satisfied with the results the serum produced in just a few days of applying it.</li>
            <li>Works OK result cannot be seen until you use it for a long time.</li>
            <li>If we had seen those reviews first, she could have been spared much agony.</li>
            <li>has pretty much disappeared.</li>
            <li>So I stopped trying to find the miracle cream for dark circles and just wanted a nice moisturizer for around my eye area.</li>
            <li>This has effectively depuffed my eyes and lightened my dark circles.</li>
            <li>Not only does it feel good when I put it on, it also absorb quickly and after a bottle, my lines were reduced, my dark eye circle was a lot lighter.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy enough to just get it out with the tube and put it around your eyes.</li>
            <li>You can easily spend $50 and up for the same amount of eye cream at places like Sephora or Department stores.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Product came very quickly an is used daily.</li>
            <li>Garnier, Estee Lauder, and multiple other providers of similar (and sometimes superior) product are able to continue manufacturing their products in the US and Canada.    </li>
            <li>Olay&#x27;s Regenerist has certainly &amp;#34;lifted&amp;#34; both my eyes and my appearance.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly does the job for what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>But, I think this stuff does make the skin around my eyes look smoother and lighter, and it certainly moisturizes without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I know with handmade lotions I make, the recipes say they&#x27;ll last a month at the most before you want to discard them and make a new batch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product seems to work well, the area around my eyes looks a bit more lively now than before with regular use of this product.</li>
            <li>The container is great - the little pump makes it easy to get out just the few drops you need.</li>
            <li>is fine line wrinkles starting to set in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product but not a miracle worker!</li>
            <li>Not so sure I see any progress/eye lifting, but no new lines!</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t do what these products have been doing, and in a much shorter time.  </li>
            <li>Olay&#x27;s regenerist serum for the eyes hides wrinkles and is so gentle on the sensative eye area.  </li>
            <li>Do I really think this product is part of why this happens?  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon...you make my life easier.</li>
            <li>But unless you have a surgical procedure, nothing ever really makes them disappear.</li>
            <li>It suffices, but I wish products would stop claiming to absolutely \\&quot;lift\\&quot; the eye area.  </li>
            <li>It did not do much for wrinkles that I could tell</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product.</li>
            <li>visibly baggy, wrinkley, eyes and this stuff works better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>My eyes seems brighter now and much much tighter.  </li>
            <li>This is another one of Olay products that I really like.</li>
            <li>really like the Olay Regenerist eye cream.</li>
            <li>And really, it makes sense.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of nightly use, I really can&#x27;t tell any difference</li>
            <li>Gentle to put on</li>
            <li>I held the bottle to the light and saw that I had 3/4 left.  </li>
            <li>Really would not want to go without it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and wears really well under makeup.</li>
            <li>Fast absorption, which helps if you plan on using an under-eye concealer or primer.</li>
            <li>It will depend on how much you use each time, and how often you apply it.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t noticed any real changes to my skin.  </li>
            <li>but the eye serum is very soothing.</li>
            <li>This eye lifting serum is non-greasy, it absorbs very well and it does refresh your eyes.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t tell that much about that.  </li>
            <li>The product is quality and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>really helped.  </li>
            <li>The ROC is a much stronger product and start with it once a day, use sparingly, go to morning and evening applications and you will see results.</li>
            <li>It absolutely works.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s really done much.</li>
            <li>Feels very oily and doesn&#x27;t really seem to have the &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; effect desired.  </li>
            <li>This used to be available locally</li>
            <li>It is , however, very mosturizing.</li>
            <li>Really seems to help with lines and puffiness . . . .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it really gets rid of my crow&#x27;s feet</li>
            <li>but it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>eye cream really feels moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I want to start by saying that I really like this product.</li>
            <li>so I tried a real eye cream.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I guess the fact that I keep using it despite this inconvenience shows how much I like it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I see much difference</li>
            <li>it works,great condition, reasonable price, arrived on time, skin feels tighter</li>
            <li>i ran out in two weeks rather than the whole month.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I used it for 3 weeks and did not saw any real difference.</li>
            <li>I really like this and had it on my subscription</li>
            <li>thanks folks!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>If I put it on by itself, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Anytime one my age can find something that really works this</li>
            <li>I dab a tiny bit of regenerist eye serum under each eye and blend lightly.  </li>
            <li>I have added their pro-x eye for the last 22 months at night which I think has helped keep the area smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is not irritating or drying to my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It does keep my eyes moisturized and feel very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>My wife spent a fortune on eye serums , but never was she so pleased with the look and feel of the skin around her eyes.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>did absolutely nothing for me</li>
            <li>People tell me that I look well rested and not tired</li>
            <li>Waiting to see if it really works or not on lifting and hiding lines/wrinkles</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really pay to close attention.  </li>
            <li>I was rather taken aback at the size of the bottle (and yes, I know how much .5 Fl Oz is)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I am very elderly and wrinkled around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a month straight and don&#x27;t really think it does anything.</li>
            <li>Very affordable eye serum to use before eye creme.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Its oily, and it runs into my eyes, even when I apply it very sparingly.  </li>
            <li>A tiny bit is all you need for each eye, smooth it on and the puffiness is diminished or just disappears.  </li>
            <li>Thanks you.</li>
            <li>As a girl of 23, I didn&#x27;t think its time to put on eye cream until I noticed there a light wrinkle under my left eye.</li>
            <li>This cream is very nourishing the skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any improvement of spots, as advertised.</li>
            <li>Only use fragrance free.</li>
            <li>When I have stopped and used something else is when I really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>It really hydrates the eye area well.</li>
            <li>which is really annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>does moisturize but lift not so much</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure till I ran out and didn&#x27;t use it for a while when I was told I looked tired so after that I ran out and bought more..</li>
            <li>I have tried several drugstore eye creams (Neutrogena, Loreal) as well as more expensive brands like Clinique, and this is by far the most effective.  </li>
            <li>It provides just enough moisture so my eyes look awake and young and wrinkle free!</li>
            <li>But ultimately went with love because I often receive comments about how young I look and how I have no wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I liked the pump container at first--no lid to unscrew--but it wastes a lot of the product.</li>
            <li>I have very normal skin</li>
            <li>Not greasy, not heavy, just right.</li>
            <li>but it also makes the eye area look younger; the transforming cream works right after applying for the &#x27;right now&#x27; affect, but if you don&#x27;t use it every day, the &#x27;brightness&#x27; is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Started noticing small wrinkles &amp; saw Consumer Reports had said the Olay Regenerist line was better or just as good as the more expensive products.  </li>
            <li>the product does NOT cause an allergic reaction; (with most other products my skin would become puffy and/or eyes</li>
            <li>I like this eye cream better than any other I&#x27;ve used, will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands as well, but none have come close to Olay Regenerist.</li>
            <li>It might work better on other types of skin.</li>
            <li>If only I&#x27;d been more proactive about these things in my 20&#x27;s when I felt invincible and apparently didn&#x27;t see the need for anti aging products...</li>
            <li>However, Olay Eye Lifting Serum has fulfilled my need for a gentle yet highly moisturising product that can be worn under make-up foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Eye Serum is very gentle &amp; didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive eyes at all.  </li>
            <li>But I like the new formula even better and expected to receive that, since it was featured in the photos and description.</li>
            <li>However, it goes on smoothly and adds much needed moisture to dry skin.</li>
            <li>The cream is specially formulated to be safe for use near your eyes, and to be light enough to absorb into that delicate skin.</li>
            <li>you want to try for few months and see the results, it maybe more positive than mine.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive, so was concerned that it didn&#x27;t say \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; but no problems.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s well worth it to do that, since people who talk to you are generally looking at your face and your eyes when they do</li>
            <li>Taking one star off for shady, but effective marketing claim - \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have inherently dark circles and no product will magically erase these no matter what they say.  </li>
            <li>I love Olay products, and this one did not let me down.</li>
            <li>Most beauty products make promises of less wrinkles, etc.  </li>
            <li>There was no indication on the order that I would be receiving the older Olay version.  </li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t prevent you from getting older.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be realistic people.  </li>
            <li>It is a decent product for its price.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is how quickly you run through the bottle.</li>
            <li>I get at least 2 weeks worth more by using a Q-tip to extract the remaining stuff.</li>
            <li>quick and convenient way to get personal items</li>
            <li>has proven to NOT be trustworthy with respect to production standards and safety, whether it is baby formula that killed many babies because it was bulked with melamine, toys that contain lead paint, or this eye cream - who knows what production standards and ingredients were REALLY used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m realistic.</li>
            <li>however, this particular one is not what I received.  </li>
            <li>I think what I received was an older packaging model?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for over 5 years and have found it to be better than the more expensive brands like Lancome &amp; Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ll let you know in a month if I look ten years younger :)&lt;</li>
            <li>so when i sleep, I was deprived of Oxygen, so I looks older than I should,</li>
            <li>This is slightly over 10 bucks, so I thought it&#x27;s pretty cheap, but now that I think about the cost-effectiveness, it is way too overpriced.     </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product to my friends.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li>It works for me and reccommed it highly.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye serum, and find it far more effective on my crepey upper eyelids than other more expensive products (e.g., Perricone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps the skin around my eyes soft and supple without large wrinkles or imperfections shining through.</li>
            <li>Not sure how effective it is around my eyes, I have only been using this product for less than a month, will wait &amp; see how effective it is before I make a judgment call.</li>
            <li>Picture shows new packaging, the item I received was the older packaging &amp; shape so clearly older stock.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but with Subscribe &amp; Save this is the cheapest I&#x27;ve been able to find it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying it consistently for 5 years and would be at a major loss if it were ever discontinued.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been more accustomed to the little tub-shaped containers of eye cream, but thought a pump might be</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like other brands, not a bad product at all!</li>
            <li>I am 22 years old, and wanted something that wasn&#x27;t necessarily meant for mature skin, but would still be affective on fine lines and the sleepy looking eyes.</li>
            <li>I am usually very satisfied with Olay products, but this one was a huge disappointment and harmful.</li>
            <li>However, Olay products are always gentle but effective and have never given me any trouble -- and this is no different.</li>
            <li>I have tried expensive eye creams, I&#x27;m so happy I found this it works for me and saves me money.</li>
            <li>Im 32 yrs old and used it for 6 months but didnt really see any changes.</li>
            <li>That is ok with me, as long as I am perhaps preventing deep lines or sagging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took a couple days for the skin to return to normal - Aveeno&#x27;s anti-itch cream</li>
            <li>Love it, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I found retinol cream to work just as well on the &#x27;normal&#x27; days of puffiness.</li>
            <li>Worth a try since everyone&#x27;s skin is different</li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped using the product my skin started returning to its normal state.</li>
            <li>yes it is cheaper than better brands, but at some point event $1 is a waste if it does not work.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cause me to get a rash, a concern I had, since most everything does give me a rash (I&#x27;m half Scottish!).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not 100% sure this product caused my eye infection, but I never get eye infections, and perhaps by being forced to open the container, I inadvertently introduced bacteria into this nutrient rich product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After prying off the top, however (I had to use a pliers because it doesn&#x27;t screw off), I determined that the mechanism had failed and that there was more than half of the original amount remaining.</li>
            <li>The tiny bottle comes secured in a box much too large for it.</li>
            <li>Within a week of using a combination of this product and other Olay Regenerist Products, I noticed a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I had been pleased with the product in the past, but the last 2 bottles did not pump properly, so I had to pull off the top(not easy), and just scrape the cream out manually.</li>
            <li>I absolutely can&#x27;t live without Regenerist night cream.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to Olay line and decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been using this for years but looking for something new without parabens.</li>
            <li>Dig that this in a tube, so there&#x27;s no using the new pumps which are showing up...</li>
            <li>Sometimes it works, buy a new one and it don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The new ingredient must be the culprit.  </li>
            <li>I also asked the rep if there was an Olay eye product I could use that didn&#x27;t have this new ingredient</li>
            <li>The new formula doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>However, the new formula caused chemical burn-like symptoms on my eye lids.  </li>
            <li>I bought this serum to help preventing new wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I will have to look for a new cream.</li>
            <li>dots really do work, they smooth out lines and firm the bags .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with my dark under eye circles or my wrinkles that are beginning to form (crows on sides, fine wrinkle underneath eye).  </li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t seen that kind of result, but intend to keep using for at least 12 weeks.</li>
            <li>The stuff works the same as Olay, doesn&#x27;t upset the skin, and comes in a larger package which is important for someone like me who needs it all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Olay is primarily the only facial product I use.  </li>
            <li>I am 45 years old an I have under-eye bags which to me, make me look much older.  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, I have developed what I would call bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>really much larger than expected:)  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Lets face it, with our central air/heating systems, our sun worshipping, (which I don&#x27;t do, but I do spend as much time outside as possible), our strong soaps, and cleaners, we do damage our skin.  </li>
            <li>I really can tell the difference, that my eyes look less tired, that the skin looks more healthy.</li>
            <li>I can see it is clearly working for me!</li>
            <li>without being shiny and greasy;&lt;br /&gt;4) reacts well with my make-up foundation/concealer and does not induce creasing;&lt;br /&gt;5) can be applied on both upper and lower eye lids (with most other products</li>
            <li>The bottle was small and cute.</li>
            <li>Some cost the consumers no more than the Olay products because the Olay products have much more marketing costs associated with them.</li>
            <li>Almost exactly the same price -- 22 bucks for 1 ounce (this Regenerist is 11 bucks for 1/2 ounce).</li>
            <li>My eyes still look the exact same!</li>
            <li>But I agree with other reviews on the pump, Olay should design a better pump for this tiny bottle.</li>
            <li>Since I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after the first, I decided to give another one a try - thinking I may not have given it enough time.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this really cheap for an eye cream, it is better than all the other brands i have used which are far more expensive.</li>
            <li>Not only is this really cheap for an eye cream, it is better than all the other brands i have used which are far more expensive.</li>
            <li>I bought it last night and used it exactly as the directions called for.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>, I uses this brand several years , and i will buy again, thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always pretty skeptical of these type of products, but I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, and my skin under my eyes looks noticeably better!</li>
            <li>This serum works very well, with nightly applications I have seen an improvement in the fine lines around my eyes over the past two months.  </li>
            <li>seriously - this is a good daily eye cream (I also apply at night).  </li>
            <li>Since it is priced very reasonably, I can buy several and keep one in purse for frequent use during the day.</li>
            <li>The latest one was the cashier at a big box store where I bought the only bottle they had left since I was almost completely out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll try it or opt for something from a more natural line of products.  </li>
            <li>What little fine lines I had, in all seriousness, increased.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for instant or pretty fast results, like within the week, or big repair results, I don&#x27;t think this product is going to do it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why so many beauty products, especially those for use around the eyes, are full of irritating perfumes.</li>
            <li>as good if not better than any more expensive and esoteric brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>The crow&#x27;s feet are definitely softened, the lip lines are looking better, AND the jowl area is tighter and less \\&quot;mushy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>My skin is extra dry around my eyes and this product seems to nurish the skin and keep it smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply but, so far after a few weeks, I have no results.</li>
            <li>(No one would buy it at that price if the box were just large enough to hold the bottle.)</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see any huge difference but there seems to be a little tightening of the lower lid.</li>
            <li>So, it general I use Olay products, because they do not test on animals, and have many of the same type of products that other (animal-tested) products do.</li>
            <li>I pay $14.99 for the store brand and to get the original brand for less than $10</li>
            <li>it is hard to be sure which of them is making the difference.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time getting it out, and sometimes I have to take the top off to get some out</li>
            <li>I had been applying it directly on the eyelid as they suggested.</li>
            <li>It keeps my eyelids soft looking, tightens the skin around the eyes and reduces puffiness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on my skin frequently and contribute them to Olay skin products.</li>
            <li>I am 41 years young and people still can&#x27;t belive it.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young (under 30)</li>
            <li>They sent me the old formula in the pump that contains ethyl-methyl-and proply PARABENS.  </li>
            <li>Those products are gentle but unfortunately simply do nothing to my eye area.</li>
            <li>out how much your beauty regimen is doing for you, or possibly against you!</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive eyes, so this product does not work for me.</li>
            <li>Really, I can&#x27;t tell yet, I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month, so</li>
            <li>My wife recently turned 40 and started really taking care of herself.  </li>
            <li>recommend to all women who want to keep their skin young</li>
            <li>We all get old and so does our skin.  </li>
            <li>and I guess I have been naive to believe that I could just use products I have been using most of my life with no consequences to animals...</li>
            <li>product keeps one&#x27;s eye area moist and soft, preventing that &amp;#34;crepy&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>However, I have not seen noticable benefits as it mentions a complete turnaround.  </li>
            <li>Also, my 94 yr old grandmother alwasy used OLAY</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and have not had problems with the cream accidently getting in my eyes, if I rub my eyes.</li>
            <li>Not just mature skin.</li>
            <li>My eye lines look so much smoother and younger.  </li>
            <li>I am a 68 year old Mother of 5.</li>
            <li>and it really works well especially the eye formula!  </li>
            <li>I am 69 years old and thought nothing could change the crinkly look around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I like the way when you are applying it, you can see you skin naturally lighten up.  </li>
            <li>It arrived early, too.</li>
            <li>There is so much product left in the bottle.</li>
            <li>its helped my skin and my adult acne</li>
            <li>I got this for my mom and from a few days after she started using it her eyes turned bright red; looked like she had pink eye in both eyes.</li>
            <li>I developed a rash on the area where the skin itched around one of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Product review summarized in the title complete a a a a a a a a a a  a a a a</li>
            <li>+ year old eyes look closer to 40, which is why I hope they keep making this.</li>
            <li>This has been my go to eye cream for nearly 8 years.</li>
            <li>The serum makes the skin feel soft, but it does not feel moisturized for some reason.</li>
            <li>Since I only use it at night I can&#x60;t really say.</li>
            <li>I do look young for my age.</li>
            <li>I have re-ordered it when I get near the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Complete Anti-Wrinkle &amp; Firming Moisturizer Eye Cream</li>
            <li>Do not pull on the sensitive skin around your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am not affiliate with Dermalogica or anyone, but I think I should do something for them to completely change my life.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and never had allergic reactions before.  </li>
            <li>It really does keep eyes looking younger and brighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just getting around to us it, but so far, it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li>but I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to start early.</li>
            <li>Try popping off the top and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.  </li>
            <li>You really DO need to take care of that skin area in a special way, since the skin is so delicate.</li>
            <li>But anything is better than nothing as long as it doesn&#x27;t make ur skin look/become worse, right?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comparable to the ridiculously priced department store brands at a much better price.</li>
            <li>This past year I have noticed I was starting to get the crepe like effect on my top lids.</li>
            <li>This was the main reason I stuck with it in the beginning, but obviously it&#x27;s helping to keep my skin moisturized and youthful looking.  </li>
            <li>Most alarming are the dark circles that seem to be returning under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, and I haven&#x27;t had any redness or irritation, and certainly no pimples.</li>
            <li>My eyes water a lot due to allergies, which dries out the skin right around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for the eye serum.   </li>
            <li>I definitely plan to continue using this product and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>and I have very few fine lines and no crows feet</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive eyes (apparently I do even though I never thought I did until this)</li>
            <li>Remember to dot cream around eyes and massage in with small, light circles.  </li>
            <li>I found this eye cream to be only OK as compared with other total effects products which I use regularly (daily moisturizer and night cream I give 5 stars).</li>
            <li>She stopped using this product and her eyes went back to normal.</li>
            <li>You hardly have to use any and it feels so soft and smooth on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it didn&#x27;t moisturize as much as I like, so a few minutes after applying the serum, I do put on a thin layer of L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect eye cream (in the little white jar), and the two products combined seem to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Olay Total Effects Eye Transforming Cream for years and was a bit leary about trying anything new.  </li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t penetrate my dry skin like I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>Lifestyle has a lot to do with your complexion so topical beauty products can only do so much.   </li>
            <li>When she tried this product several years ago we didn&#x27;t notice too much change, but this time was very different.  </li>
            <li>For around the same money, I recommend the Olay Pro-X eye serum since it works just as well and is a white cream which the skin absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li>soft - spreads well - tiny bit needed - appears to do the job so far.</li>
            <li>I have tried alot and when I come back to this I always see a difference in my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive eyes..</li>
            <li>It gives a definite lift, but in addition, it leaves a clean and tight surface to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li>I received the old formula in the old packaging:-(  Great formula.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how small this was, you just don&#x27;t think about how much .5 oz is, but it does cover very well.</li>
            <li>Its worth a try if you need a little lift in the area.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this and other products as my daily regiment for the past couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;It is effective, yet inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Sooo sooo sooo disappointed, especially since Olay&#x27;s products are very good.</li>
            <li>The products are priced very reasonably so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m sending money swirling down the drain every night when I wash.</li>
            <li>I noticed the skin around my eyes looked brighter and just generally healthier this morning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I have lowered my initial 2 star review to 1 star, because I developed eczema under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Have only used it 2,3 times so far</li>
            <li>At 50, I&#x27;ve developed some age spots, and the Total Effects is lightening them.</li>
            <li>Wow what a big difference.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the crepey appearance starting to set in and while it&#x27;s not gone completely, it is improved.  </li>
            <li>I alternate this product at night with the Olay triple action eye pods.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 30 year old female</li>
            <li>I like the Olay Regenerist line, especially the fragrance-free editions for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I prefer a non tinted cream because I want the product to actually work and restore my skins natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I developed a lower eyelid left eye</li>
            <li>This product also does not sting my eyes or make them red even though im usually sensitive to eye care products.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone wanting a moisturizer that can be worn under makeup and yet still sensitive enough for the eyes.</li>
            <li>Neatly packaged and once I use this product the first week, I noticed the dark circles and puffiness disappearing.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 2 is that it might work on someone whose eyes are not as sensitive as mine.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of days so far.</li>
            <li>I will finish the bottle, but then go back to my old ROC Retinol Correction eye cream, which I have been using for ages.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that my adult daughter keeps &#x27;borrowing&#x27; my face stuff</li>
            <li>, it has more to do with genetics, dehydration and poor diet.</li>
            <li>true gripe with this product is the dispensing mechanism of the small bottle.</li>
            <li>My skin type is dry with certain oily spots (t-zone) -- female in her 20s.</li>
            <li>Most eye creams that claim to diminish dark circles are actually TINTED (like a concealer, but less so).</li>
            <li>Most eye creams that claim to diminish dark circles are actually TINTED (like a concealer, but less so).</li>
            <li>I also make certain that my mom gets it for every gift giving occassion along with her other goodies.  </li>
            <li>have used for years, but was happy to find a less expensive way to purchase.  </li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time about half an hour ago</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 47 &amp; have the usual signs of aging (though I am lucky, not severe):</li>
            <li>The product itself is just fine - not too expensive although it emptied out really</li>
            <li>a good idea - boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li>It adds a subtle bit of light to the area and keeps my makeup from settling into any expression lines throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>the products I use are for my health, the environment and their social record.</li>
            <li>This cream doesn&#x27;t work, I am male, Asian 22 years old,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle worker like some of the more hardcore offerings out there, but it will tighten up tired looking eyes a bit and definitely helps with wrinkles over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pump mechanism on this little bottle clogged up on the first week of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do think it helped with bagginess and fine lines, and it may have slightly brightened my dark circles, but this product, advertised for sensitive skin, made my eyes water all day long.</li>
            <li>BTW, I&#x27;m certain it was this product as I eliminated every other possible product one by one.</li>
            <li>For the last few weeks, I have had to unscrew the top in order to dig out the product at the bottle because the pump doesn&#x27;t reach the bottom of the little bottle.  </li>
            <li>because if you don&#x27;t cut the top of (which is no easy feat), you waste A LOT of product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the one whose eyes will tear if our cat wanders next to me and rubs my shoulder, so my eyes are generally rather sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I do feel a general tightening in the overall eye area.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample not long ago of the eye serum with the eyelash lengthener serum.</li>
            <li>I am hoping long term use will help eliminate them completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-sixties and live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>The cream is well worth the price, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>(New bottles, without cap, weigh just under 0.8 ounces, (0.73 - 0.74) and an empty bottle without the cap weighs 0.2 ounces, so the volume of cream in the bottle is correct.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product but the bottle is too small and it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li>This is my 1st bottle so far, so I have limited comments on the effectiveness:  1.  </li>
            <li>The new version of this product has given me rough red itchy patches all around my eyes!</li>
            <li>I bought this product after researchin other similar eye creams and finding it highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>After 2 weeks,my lids were much firmer and less fragile looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46 years old and the area around my eyes was very dry.  </li>
            <li>much easier to use than the little pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have looked high and low for something for my dark circles and have come to the conclusion that nothing but concealer will help them.</li>
            <li>Though it is a small bottle (like most eye creams), a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I recently began using the goodguide.com to find out just how good (or bad)</li>

            <li> Good serum.  </li>
            <li> When I pumped it onto my finger, I loved that there was no scent.</li>
            <li> It is a good moisturizer for the eye area.</li>
            <li> For the price it is good buy.</li>
            <li> I saw good reviews on the product and also saw reviews saying that people had allergic reactions to it.</li>
            <li> This eye cream had good reviews</li>
            <li> eye cream works good and going through Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this eye serum and was so impressed!  </li>
            <li> May be a good moisturizer, but that wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Olay is a good name</li>
            <li> This product does a good job of reducing puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Amazon.com is a good source to turn to purchase this eye serum.</li>
            <li> I have a really good dermatologist, so I consulted him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is a product that can take all the wrinkles away,but this ones does a good job.</li>

            <li> Olay regenerist feels good when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Good price and good product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> Even though I cannot deny the fact that Olay did a good job on my eye, not to compare with L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist Eye serum does a good job of smoothing the crow feet of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The product is good, the packaging wasteful.</li>
            <li> Good price; shipped promptly; as advertised.</li>
            <li> ITS TRUE, ITS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE TRIED AND WILL CONTINUE.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that it&#x27;s in this squeeze tube instead of the stand up bottle that I could never get most of the product out of.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very glad it can still be ordered through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for awhile and love the lightness and the great job it does around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Even on the rare sale there-the best price is still Amazon.</li>
            <li> I Love It - very effective - not greasy - very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> Very good product - not greasy, but rich.  </li>
            <li> is a good brand with many many many awesome products, but dont be suckered into spending more money than you need to!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> So I purchased 3 more of the Regenerist products to try!  </li>
            <li> Love it and hope you do too!</li>
            <li> I always love my Olay products and use them faithfully!</li>
            <li> and I am receiving many compliments!  </li>
            <li> I used it for about a month and it made my eyes more puffy!</li>
            <li> Love the product!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m totally satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> I will update my review at the end of this bottle to let you know if I still love it or if anything has changed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye cream!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not excessively expensive but it smooths your skin and feels great!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Oil of Olay!  </li>
            <li> I use it on top of my makeup!  </li>
            <li> I Love it!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product!</li>
            <li> The item was exactly  what I ordered and was happy to receive it so promptly!  </li>
            <li> I tried it as soon as I  got it and love it!</li>
            <li> I am very particular about my eyes and making them look their best.</li>
            <li> and the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing serum.</li>
            <li> well it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I always liked Olay products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely effective for under the eye</li>
            <li> I started the regimen about two weeks ago, and I can honestly say that I see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> was nice.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice though</li>
            <li> Anytime you can provide a good moisturizer &amp; do it each and every day, you are going to have better looking skin than doing nothing all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always tried to take care of my skin, but I thought my age was catching up with me.</li>
            <li> The size of the lotion bottle kind of scared me given the cost</li>
            <li> No miracles but absorbs nicely and smooths wrinkles temporarily.</li>
            <li> This feels really nice to apply....</li>
            <li> these are both excellent, but neither is as good as ROC&#x27;s Retinol Correxion Sensitive Eye Cream.</li>
            <li> Product is nice.</li>
            <li> Nice product</li>
            <li> Nice eye cream - can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I found this serum to be nice and it does help.</li>
            <li> and I like that the serum is not greasy and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> It feels nice going on and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had estheticians comment about how nicely the skin around my over-50 eyes is retaining its tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are others just as good with easier to access product.</li>
            <li> What a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> I tried this Eye Lifting Serum because I read so many good reviews about it</li>
            <li> They offered a product I love at a really fair price.</li>
            <li> Regenerist series received many good reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to lift all of the wrinkles around my eyes at 58 yo, but it smoothed them out and gave my eyes a kind of glow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided that those reviewers must own stock in the company and are attempting to drum up sales.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> nice feel and seems to be showing results</li>
            <li> I have it on autoship and never have to worry about running out or catching a sale.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any effective results.</li>
            <li> Handy to travel with also</li>
            <li> Did a lot of research to find a good quality eye cream with acceptable price and found a video where it said that this cream was recommended by most dermatologists.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using this proactively (I&#x27;m 25), but I do have some wrinkles forming, but I don&#x27;t know if this product is honestly helping me at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use some retina-a around my eyes and a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is a nice consistency and has no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> will continue to have it automatically sent to my home with is great price and quick service.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and continue to be impressed with its quality and effect--very smooth and light; easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Pure 2 oz.]](not Olay but a really good deal!), the eye serum and</li>
            <li> I do see a visible improvement of very fine lines.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to start taking better care of my eyes and have read that Olay products are very good.  </li>
            <li> Bottle]]\\&quot; is a great choice as it is FRAGRANCE FREE and does a great job of keeping my face looking fresh and clean after a shave or after washing.</li>
            <li> have always been a fan of the Olay Regenerist line - they are excellent products that are generally quite affordable.</li>
            <li> I prefer the ProX Eye Cream, though this one felt very smooth  </li>
            <li> This serum makes my skin feel very smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes my skin feel nice.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, she was able to avoid the rash!</li>
            <li> Received super fast and great price!</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t tan which probably contributes, but I&#x27;ve started using the regenerist spf lotion on my hands and what a huge difference it has made!  </li>
            <li> I have been using Oil of Ulay &amp;#34;beauty fluid&amp;#34; since 1972 and continue to be a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I used this serum for many years, then changed to Pro-X at some point.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing this from Target-this is a much better price,</li>
            <li> My eyes are looking better every day.</li>
            <li> Product is OK.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, and has a nice, almost shiny look to it.  </li>
            <li> Much better products out there</li>
            <li> While there is no proof of a causal link, the EU has banned many of these ingredients.     </li>
            <li> I have signed up for Subscribe &amp; Save on all of these products, PLUS the Night Resurfacing Elixir and the Micro Sculpting Cream, more for my neck than my face, since I tend to break out with anything heavier than a lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold.  :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years now and find it to be the best even over department store products.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with Olay&#x27;s eye lifting serum.</li>
            <li> i love the way this feels when applied.  </li>
            <li> i still have more than 1/2 the bottle to use, so it may get better.  </li>
            <li> And the eye cream itself is quite nice, goes on smoothly, moisturizes and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> Consumer reports rated this over many, many top selling, name brand skin care</li>
            <li> Maybe a tube would be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist Eye Serum for about 3 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a twice a day moisturizer around my eyes, am &amp; pm, and still really love it.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, I love it.  </li>
            <li> Ladies, its maintenance, and if you want to look your best, than you gotta find a routine for a product, such as this.  </li>
            <li> I also LOVE getting this from Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save, as its saves me money and is always there when I run out.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love the product...</li>
            <li> I use this product daily, and it works great!!</li>
            <li> It is nice going on, it seems to smooth the eye area, help with lines and firms the eye area.  </li>
            <li> , when you can not pump any more out do not throw it away.  </li>
            <li> Just pull off the top and put the bottle on the side</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this since so many people seem to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I am using so many Olay products</li>
            <li> No, I don&#x27;t have the pump accidentally in the locked position. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ended up having to unscrew the pump top to get to the rest of the product in the bottle which defeats the convenience of the pump and purity of the product.</li>
            <li> There needs to be a better way to package the product so that one can use all without having to remove the top and try and get the cream out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the Olay roller, but I like this serum better.  </li>
            <li> All skin needs moisture to stay healthy.</li>
            <li> - I am glad to be able to save 150 bucks on one eye cream now</li>
            <li> &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> also love that the serum doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as I do have sensative</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I heart Amazon. :)</li>
            <li> but I have switched to Oil of Olay and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> Signed up for scheduled refills, to get an even better price than store sales.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I credit it to using this eye serum for many years.  </li>
            <li> I hope this helps people :-)</li>
            <li> As for giving a lift for your eye lids skin, I am not so sure of that.  </li>
            <li> After looking at many eye creams I stumbled upon this one.</li>
            <li> I really love it, and for a man..</li>
            <li> I can be sure that I will get carded.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, great product in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> but then most eye creams can&#x27;t take wrinkles away anyhow.  </li>
            <li> I just bought wrinkle twinkle and like it better.</li>
            <li> 2) most of the ingredients in their products are \\&quot;fillers\\&quot;, which have no benefits they just work to bulk up the cream.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t develop my sensitivity until my 30s, but I&#x27;m told that it&#x27;s something most people will eventually develop.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s obvious it works great!  </li>
            <li> I use this night and day and love the way it feels.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I was expecting more in the eyelid and area between eye and eyebrow.  </li>
            <li> They need to design a better bottle and/or dispenser.</li>
            <li> I love Oil of Olay products.  </li>
            <li> I make sure I never run out.  </li>
            <li> I did some research and this seems to be the most bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> love the product, do see a difference in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have to take the top off and scrape the insides to get product out.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It can take more than it says.</li>
            <li> just overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love the container, which is so much better than a pump bottle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;AND, if you buy more, you don&#x27;t want to risk.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> it seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li> I like the pump because one has better control  when applying the cream.</li>
            <li> want to order more from Olay like this</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d ever use an Olay product, but I&#x27;m finding more and more that the Regenerist line is great.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I tossed this in the trash and will think twice before buying more Olay products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok moisturizer, but I haven&#x27;t seen any firming or lifting effects at all.</li>
            <li> All you do is apply it around the eyes twice a day and the results were satisfying.</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum because it keeps my eyes looking youthful.</li>
            <li> I thought I would make more of an effort to look better</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for many years</li>
            <li> Love the product and the way it goes on.</li>
            <li> My lower eyelid experienced spasms from using it and my eyes also became very watery.</li>
            <li> okay there is still some</li>
            <li> Many can expect allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with it and think I will likely continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I use a bit more at night.</li>
            <li> Ladies, its maintenance, and if you want to look your best, than you gotta find a routine for a product, such as this.</li>
            <li> I also LOVE getting this from Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save, as its saves me money and is always there when I run out.</li>
            <li> What i liked about the product is that it was really light.</li>
            <li> Love this product it keeps the eye area</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores for a while.  </li>
            <li> A lot of the time I do not like the newer, better version of products and most companies are &amp;#34;upgrading&amp;#34; their products so rapidly.</li>
            <li> I love olay regenerist im 32 and</li>
            <li> Nice light under eye serum.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> this eye cream works better</li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I don&#x27;t like the packaging of the serum itself.  </li>
            <li> While some products can run close to a hundred dollars or more, for the price the product does deliver.  </li>
            <li> but now I am using Meaningful Beauty, which I believe is much better.  </li>
            <li> And with my Amazon subscription for regular deliveries, I get more before I run out, at the best price!</li>
            <li> Most of the anti-aging eye products are loaded with ingredients that burn the heck out of my eyelids.</li>
            <li> It is okay.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 12 months and am so impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li> Love the product..</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Most of them oil of olay.  </li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for the eye area, especially on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It does not cause any allergic reactions and helps aging skin look better, too.  </li>
            <li> this is my favorite eye</li>
            <li> cream!&lt;br /&gt;much much better than chanel, rancome, or estee</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> and I am way more satisfied with this than the creme.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs</li>
            <li> if it you already used it before or if you are sure that it will not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> I love oil of olay but not this one.</li>
            <li> I love the product but DON&#x27;T USE THE IMAGE OF THE SQUEEZE TUBE WHEN YOU SEND IT IN THE PUMP -</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t unscrew the top; it&#x27;s attached.  </li>
            <li> Worked ok.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye serum.</li>
            <li> Normally, I love Olay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lotion on my face for most of my life, but never an &amp;#34;eye cream&amp;#34</li>
            <li> (I suggest reapplying under-eye after an hour or so, for more prolonged moisturizing.)</li>
            <li> I can buy it cheaper and more conveniently at Walmart stores.</li>
            <li> I liked the smooth, creamy feel of this serum but saw no &#x27;lifting&#x27; or improvement under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The skin around the eyes is more taut.</li>
            <li> Better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I real.ly love this product</li>
            <li> I am in love with this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and can&#x27;t wait to see more</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my purchase, and plan to keep on purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> If I rub at my watery eyes and cause more darkness and inflammation kinda defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> Felt good on my eyes and helped the bags under them, seemed to brighten them right away.</li>
            <li> This eye cream despenses just the right amount and feels good going on.  </li>
            <li> Great for the dark circles under my eyes, great for reduced redness and puffiness-</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this great product.  </li>
            <li> It has a good consistency, goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Has a nice light, creamy feel (NOT oily, NOT greasy)...and absorbs quite easily into skin.</li>
            <li> I have to add that Olay products are excellent in the long run.  </li>
            <li> good buy for the money, and really works!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s about as good as any other nice eye cream out there, good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not at all happy and looking for a new product line.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, felt great, soft, hydrating from the get go.</li>
            <li> The cream comes out easily and does not put out more than one needs.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this one was perfect for me, didn&#x27;t dry me out or leave me too oily and that happens with a lot of products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So glad that Amazon makes it so easy to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I wanted this one with dropper top for easy application.  </li>
            <li> I had noticed that the fine lines in my face were becoming more prominent and that the L&#x27;Oreal products were not delivering anymore.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product love how you can subscribe and get even a better deal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely soft cream that leaves the area under my eyes feeling very nice.</li>
            <li> As for as lifting and fine line magic.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a remarkable difference in my eyes after the first use, which is rare for a lot of products!</li>
            <li> I love the silky smooth feel of the serum/cream.  </li>
            <li> Many are free of PEGs, EDTA, Parabens, phthalates and ureas (among others).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s available most places.</li>
            <li> , I shook it, I tried everything possible, but the pump was incredibly inconsistent (if it worked at all).  </li>
            <li> Although it is available at Walgreens and Target stores, the price is much better through the auto ship program.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed nicely around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> The container has a good pump (easy control on how much to pumo out).</li>
            <li> Not greasy, just perfect if you don&#x27;t mind paying a little more.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to carry in a make-up bag for raveling too.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and you can see the difference as soon as you put it on.  </li>
            <li> I read many great reviews about Olay&#x27;s product and this will be my last buy from them.</li>
            <li> I thought the cream had run out very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and I plan to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Olay products work well, are affordable, and are easy to get your hands on.  </li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed using Olay skin products, specially the Regenerist moisturizer for the face.</li>
            <li> Yes, I do see results--less fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> When looking in the mirror, I noticed the fine lines disappearing.</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to fine another product to undo (or hide)</li>
            <li> Found the serum smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice a reduction in fine lines (crows feet)</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes well while reducing puffiness and fine lines over time.</li>
            <li> did nothing for my under eye fine lines..</li>
            <li> I had previously used this product for years with excellent results until they changed the packaging AND the formula.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was a trial size, which was fine; since I was testing it out.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change with my fine lines and crows feet.  </li>
            <li> Fine lines diminished.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll make much more difference in terms of firming than this product.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and while the packaging is new, the results are just as great as with the original packaging.</li>
            <li> Super smooth going on and the resusts are fabulous!</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to get to the bottom of the product.&lt;br /&gt;But very satisfied and will purchase again! :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in wrinkles</li>
            <li> those darn crows feet are starting, and this Olay eye serum feel smooth going on, makes your eyes look great, even under make-up.</li>
            <li> Nothing will work miracles, but this has been the most effective remedy that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference (yet)</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan if all Olay products, this one included.  </li>
            <li> and it has made a huge difference in the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and can&#x27;t say I see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> This product has never made my eyes sting, and it just keeps on keeping my aging eyes sag and line free.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year, and it greatly improves the look of the upper eyelid</li>
            <li> It seemed shear and light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can turn the pump so that it locks into an open position, great for if you need to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have confirmed this.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy all of the Olay products.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great thing with all the shaving and scrubbing of my face on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, goes on light and absorbs in.</li>
            <li> This serum goes on smoothly and and apprears to be fragrance free (a fragrance is ALWAYS a deal breaker for me).  </li>
            <li> of course I cannot yet tell if I appear much younger, but it feels great, and I don&#x27;t worry about putting it on my eyelid</li>

            <li> but it does go on smooth and</li>
            <li> I had a lengthy conversation with Olay customer service today and the rep confirmed that in order to improve the formula they added &amp;#34;sodium peg seven olive oil carboxylate&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> and she recommended the Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Roller.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the moisture this product provides.</li>
            <li> This makes for a thoughtful gift just by itself as well.</li>
            <li> I have a great extra use for this eye serum -</li>
            <li> I agree with the majority of reviewers about this gentle but effective cream.  </li>
            <li> and honestly I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin or eyes.</li>
            <li> I tried this because Amazon made it so cheap; I had never used an eye lifting serum before.  </li>
            <li> Also, product goes on smoothly and does not sting.</li>

            <li> I use it anyway to help keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Light and non greasy.</li>
            <li> Works well if you are looking for light moisturizing.</li>
            <li> They are available just about everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I do like how light of a cream this is.  </li>
            <li> So far, it is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels on my eyes, better than any cream I&#x27;ve used but the dispenser as others have reported leaves much to be desired.  </li>
            <li> I have it on good authority that eye area serums, lotions, and creams are all gimmicks, and you are better off just using your regular moisturizer generously in your eye area.</li>
            <li> Good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the formula changed when the packaging changed, but I liked the &#x27;old&#x27; version better.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Super hydrating, goes right into skin and not oily!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results and certainly the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used excellent eye creams before, and they normally tighten your skin in the eye area instantly, but this serum is way too watery to tighten your skin...     </li>
            <li> The skins around my eyes is significantly tighter.</li>
            <li> SO, I must first say I typically LOVE Regenerist products.</li>
            <li> Well, yes, as I am a consistent user and never miss a day with this product, so that consistency is part of why I think my eyes and the skin around them remains more youthful than others my age.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li> and I received the Olay Regenerist Eye Listing Serum, but it was in a tube rather than the original pump container.</li>
            <li> J was.purchasing Olay original eye serum.</li>
            <li> I just wish I had ordered more because I like it so much!</li>
            <li> so the demand will keep Olay making this great product for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> Used it successfully for several years.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to get the last 1/4&amp;#34; or so of product out of the container without prying off the top and digging it out with some kind of implement that will fit the bottle&#x27;s opening.  </li>
            <li> The Original Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100%</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Did I always have this many fine lines and the product made it more apparent?</li>
            <li> I think alot of this has to do with this product, (and clean living of course, ) and I say give it a try.</li>
            <li> but I like the smooth feel of this serum and how quickly it soaks into my eye skin (eyelid and under eye).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special</li>
            <li> My swollen under-eye bags have gone down an amazing amount, I look like I did more than 5 years ago!  </li>
            <li> The serum isn&#x27;t anything special, but it&#x27;s also not a bad item either.  </li>
            <li> My thirsty skins soaks this right up, erasing fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I have used this eye serum for at least 10 years because it is the best eye product I have ever found.</li>
            <li> I bought it from reading the overall good reviews.      </li>
            <li> This product is full of PEGs, EDTA and parabens -- ingredients now banned in the EU because they are endocrine disruptors.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s doing a good job.</li>
            <li> These were the only good things about it for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We all get old sooner or later, yes, but if I could age more gracefully, which now I can, I am one happy woman.</li>
            <li> ; Stands true to claims.</li>
            <li> This serum is excellent around the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this product has transformed my eyes, but I suppose it&#x27;s not a bad product as eye creams/serums</li>
            <li> I saw the Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum here on Amazon and due to the great price, I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> the Amazon price is outstanding, particularly on the Subscribe and Save plan; and NO TAXES!&lt;br /&gt;10)</li>
            <li> the pump no longer dispenses any more), there&#x27;s still a lot more left inside.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wonderful - not greasy or heavy under my eyes, it absorbs really well.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I ordered it in the tube, and it came in the older pump bottle.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and gentle with my skin, but those are the only good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> I went by guidelines with getting adequate amounts of sleep, drinking water, staying away from sodium etc..</li>
            <li> The shipment was quick.</li>
            <li> Just know that this particular one is more of a sample size.</li>
            <li> If I put this on over the moisturizer, it&#x27;s super shiny.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was as ordered.</li>
            <li> Feels nice but really didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li> After a visit to the dermatologist for a botox consultation, and being informed that my particular set of wrinkles wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be alleviated by botox to the extent I was looking for, I thought I&#x27;d purchase some eye cream and see if that helped.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I highly recommend it to all.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see that it is any better than any other kind of eye cream.  </li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I think \\&quot;Shopper\\&quot; did a great job breaking down all the pros and cons</li>
            <li> Kind of a clever way to get you to buy the cream sooner than when it really runs out.</li>
            <li> I mean, it does the lifting around the eyes like it said it would, I&#x27;m impressed, fragrance-free, which is better for my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> My right eye looked much better than the left one, which means L&#x27;Oreal cream works better than Olay.</li>
            <li> Dermalogica Multiyitamin power firm eye cream is my savior, I looks incredibly handsome, before I couldn&#x27;t even look at me in the mirror, but now I am so happy and confident because of my face,  and it takes only 3 days for the difference.</li>
            <li> Never had contact dermatitis before, will be much more carefull trying a new product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to be frugal, but this is one of the areas where I think taking good care of yourself is worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> is highly moisturising (YEY!!!)</li>
            <li> Thank you SO MUCH Olay!!  </li>
            <li> It did pretty well!  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome buy for far less than the price at the store.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it does much to diminish my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> So far, I really enjoy this serum, it feels very smooth and silky, my skin absorbs it really fast without feeling oily and it does not set in the lines.</li>
            <li> Olay Reginerist Eye Lifting Serum is a great product, especially for fine wrinkles around the eyes (they will actually go away after faithful use).</li>
            <li> Will invest future purchases as this is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> The price is amazing especially on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product really made my eye area smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price, and fast shipping</li>
            <li> The product was easily absorbed, and there was no noticable fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin of anyone I know, and this product does not irritate it at all.  </li>
            <li> I am always told that I look way too young to have 8 grandchildren, &amp; most people assume that when I have any of my grandchildren with me that I am \\&quot;mom\\&quot;, not \\&quot;grandma\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth trying for yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth a try.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li> All in all, I don&#x27;t think this product is worth a penny.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> But then red, swollen and puffy wasn&#x27;t any kind of improvement.  </li>
            <li> , it was true when you made your first order.</li>
            <li> The serum did nothing to make my eyes look energetic, soft, or lessen the bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product because the price is well worth it</li>
            <li> It gives the skin around my eyes a very shiny look, and I imagine it must take some doing to make eye makeup actually look good with this shine going on.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on a .05 ounce bottle of magic potion about the size of a thumbnail.  </li>
            <li> Eating right and staying fit will keep you healthy, this product will help you look younger.</li>
            <li> I know that Olay continues to bring out new, more advanced products all the time, but I have sensitive skin and will react to new products more often than not.  </li>
            <li> I know that Olay continues to bring out new, more advanced products all the time, but I have sensitive skin and will react to new products more often than not.</li>
            <li> This particular one was voted the best value and test results were very positive and comparable to the more expensive competitors.  </li>
            <li> Ok,  I have used other products that seem to work better.</li>
            <li> Has a strong fragrance, too strong, in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> Good results, does not make the eyes puffy as some other eye creams do</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product (moisturises and tightens without causing allergies) and its price (product is long lasting and comes with Amazon discount, free delivery and no taxes).</li>
            <li> All other Amazon products I have ordered have been good, just not this one.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with its results, which have been better than more expensive creams.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, there were good reviews from my friends for L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s one of the pricier ones in the drug store -- but you can get the eye cream for right under $20.</li>
            <li> The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li> And was delivered right away</li>
            <li> If the proof weren&#x27;t right on my face, I wouldn&#x27;t believe it myself.</li>
            <li> but right now it is thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much every eye skin product available in the department and specialty store, including Clinique and Chanel.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products far more expensive, and have found this one to be the most effective at this stage of my life.  </li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve seen some wand type highlighting products for a pretty high price and I smile that I already have a perfect highlighter with reflective mica that is treating my eye area.  </li>
            <li> I started to weigh new bottles to make sure new bottles were full when purchased and this is not the problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect consistency, &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; pretty quickly for make up application and has just enough little gold highlights to make the eye area pop.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this one for the last half a year, so that&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li> all these new fine lines I&#x27;m stuck with.</li>
            <li> This eye serum, with slight tinted shade, is very smooth that gets absorbed easily.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more to get better quality.</li>
            <li> Look for a product that is hypoallergenic if you know you are sensitive; that your eyes become irritated easily.</li>
            <li> The smile lines around my eyes are noticeably lessened by quite a bit and, while I could be happier (a product that completely removed wrinkles and smile lines would be nice), this product far exceeded my expectations for what could be accomplished using a dedicated eye cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and smooth</li>
            <li> The product is contained in a nice little travel friendly pump bottle.  </li>
            <li> so I use this primarily for the moisturizer, but I figure it&#x27;s never to early to start anti-aging!</li>
            <li> This is a decent eye cream but nothing special.  </li>
            <li> In just 2 days I actually saw fine lines forming under my eyes!</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> (During the day I use Olay Eye Regenerating Cream With A Touch Of Concealer, which I like very much.)</li>
            <li> I like this eye lifting serum very much.</li>
            <li> i like it very much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t take care of with a little make-up, good sleeping habits, diet, exercise, sunblock, and water.</li>
            <li> Most of them don&#x27;t work and some actually make your eyes sting and burn.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> Works the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to go order more products from this line, because if this eye serum is any indication, I think the Olay commercials touting the benefits of their Regenerist line are actually telling the truth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sufficient by itself though, and needs a layer of the total effects eye cream on top.</li>
            <li> If it could actually do what it claims it would cost a ton more and be administered by a doctor.</li>
            <li> First, in case the name didn&#x27;t give it away, I&#x27;m a man.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it has varied results given everyone&#x27;s skin is different</li>
            <li> Be aware of this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks so no immediate results, but love the product.</li>
            <li> People look at your eyes all the time when they talk to you, so they notice that pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to be frugal, but this is one of the areas where I think taking good care of yourself is worth it in the long run.alk to you are generally looking at your face and your eyes when they do</li>
            <li> At first when I started using this product, it seemed to moisturize my under eye area well.</li>
            <li> I found Beautypedia last year, and not only are they free, but 100% of their info is backed by their own research and experimentation&lt;</li>
            <li> I bought this product first, before getting the Olay ProX eye lifting serum.  </li>
            <li> I love all Olay products but especially the Regenerist Serums and night cream.</li>
            <li> First time user of this product.  </li>
            <li> but it never lasts me long enough to feel like it&#x27;s a great price for the size.</li>
            <li> Finally, I had to pop the top off</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> But this product works very well for me!</li>
            <li> WHICH, AFTERALL, IS EXACTLY</li>
            <li> so I wish I would have bought it online first because it&#x27;s noticeably cheaper.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s not the fountain of youth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive and it works.  </li>
            <li> It lifts as much as a non-surgical method can do!</li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t expect miracle eye creams/serums, plenty of sleep + healthy life style is the key.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> I know that someday I&#x27;ll have to get an eye lift, but insurance is funny about approving surgery untl the lid interferes with my vision.</li>
            <li> same size, a bit more money</li>
            <li> Ordering through Amazon is a lot more convenient and actually cheaper (esp.</li>
            <li> Product seems to be working pretty well - my eyes seem litter and smoother every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> My under-eyes started looking really haggard and a bit puffy!</li>
            <li> At first use I saw the result.</li>
            <li> My only wish is for more in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and leaves my eye area soft.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It is not very expensive, but, still pricey and would be more worth the money if it came in a bigger size.  </li>
            <li> And this is when the bottle is new and supposedly full.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, this eye serum goes on very easily.</li>
            <li> but Amazon had it at a great price, though a very small container.</li>
            <li> and P.M. Feels rich, creamy, but not heavy.</li>
            <li> My concealer goes on nicely after applying this serum which is not always the case with other eye creams.  </li>
            <li> The product in this new packaging is inferior and not as creamy and absorbing as the original in the pump container.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product (moisturises and tightens without causing allergies) and its price (product is long lasting and comes with Amazon discount, free delivery and no taxes).</li>
            <li> For less than $20 you can have a more hydrated and toned eye area!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s very satisfied with the results the serum produced in just a few days of applying it.</li>
            <li> Works OK result cannot be seen until you use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> If we had seen those reviews first, she could have been spared much agony.</li>
            <li> has pretty much disappeared.</li>
            <li> So I stopped trying to find the miracle cream for dark circles and just wanted a nice moisturizer for around my eye area.</li>
            <li> This has effectively depuffed my eyes and lightened my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Not only does it feel good when I put it on, it also absorb quickly and after a bottle, my lines were reduced, my dark eye circle was a lot lighter.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy enough to just get it out with the tube and put it around your eyes.</li>
            <li> You can easily spend $50 and up for the same amount of eye cream at places like Sephora or Department stores.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Product came very quickly an is used daily.</li>
            <li> Garnier, Estee Lauder, and multiple other providers of similar (and sometimes superior) product are able to continue manufacturing their products in the US and Canada.    </li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s Regenerist has certainly &amp;#34;lifted&amp;#34; both my eyes and my appearance.  </li>
            <li> but it certainly does the job for what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> But, I think this stuff does make the skin around my eyes look smoother and lighter, and it certainly moisturizes without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I know with handmade lotions I make, the recipes say they&#x27;ll last a month at the most before you want to discard them and make a new batch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product seems to work well, the area around my eyes looks a bit more lively now than before with regular use of this product.</li>
            <li> The container is great - the little pump makes it easy to get out just the few drops you need.</li>
            <li> is fine line wrinkles starting to set in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product but not a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> Not so sure I see any progress/eye lifting, but no new lines!</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t do what these products have been doing, and in a much shorter time.  </li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s regenerist serum for the eyes hides wrinkles and is so gentle on the sensative eye area.  </li>
            <li> Do I really think this product is part of why this happens?  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon...you make my life easier.</li>
            <li> But unless you have a surgical procedure, nothing ever really makes them disappear.</li>
            <li> It suffices, but I wish products would stop claiming to absolutely \\&quot;lift\\&quot; the eye area.  </li>
            <li> It did not do much for wrinkles that I could tell</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product.</li>
            <li> visibly baggy, wrinkley, eyes and this stuff works better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> My eyes seems brighter now and much much tighter.  </li>
            <li> This is another one of Olay products that I really like.</li>
            <li> really like the Olay Regenerist eye cream.</li>
            <li> And really, it makes sense.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of nightly use, I really can&#x27;t tell any difference</li>
            <li> Gentle to put on</li>
            <li> I held the bottle to the light and saw that I had 3/4 left.  </li>
            <li> Really would not want to go without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and wears really well under makeup.</li>
            <li> Fast absorption, which helps if you plan on using an under-eye concealer or primer.</li>
            <li> It will depend on how much you use each time, and how often you apply it.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t noticed any real changes to my skin.  </li>
            <li> but the eye serum is very soothing.</li>
            <li> This eye lifting serum is non-greasy, it absorbs very well and it does refresh your eyes.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell that much about that.  </li>
            <li> The product is quality and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> really helped.  </li>
            <li> The ROC is a much stronger product and start with it once a day, use sparingly, go to morning and evening applications and you will see results.</li>
            <li> It absolutely works.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s really done much.</li>
            <li> Feels very oily and doesn&#x27;t really seem to have the &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; effect desired.  </li>
            <li> This used to be available locally</li>
            <li> It is , however, very mosturizing.</li>
            <li> Really seems to help with lines and puffiness . . . .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it really gets rid of my crow&#x27;s feet</li>
            <li> but it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> eye cream really feels moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that I really like this product.</li>
            <li> so I tried a real eye cream.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I guess the fact that I keep using it despite this inconvenience shows how much I like it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I see much difference</li>
            <li> it works,great condition, reasonable price, arrived on time, skin feels tighter</li>
            <li> i ran out in two weeks rather than the whole month.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 weeks and did not saw any real difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this and had it on my subscription</li>
            <li> thanks folks!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> If I put it on by itself, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Anytime one my age can find something that really works this</li>
            <li> I dab a tiny bit of regenerist eye serum under each eye and blend lightly.  </li>
            <li> I have added their pro-x eye for the last 22 months at night which I think has helped keep the area smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is not irritating or drying to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It does keep my eyes moisturized and feel very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> My wife spent a fortune on eye serums , but never was she so pleased with the look and feel of the skin around her eyes.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothing for me</li>
            <li> People tell me that I look well rested and not tired</li>
            <li> Waiting to see if it really works or not on lifting and hiding lines/wrinkles</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really pay to close attention.  </li>
            <li> I was rather taken aback at the size of the bottle (and yes, I know how much .5 Fl Oz is)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am very elderly and wrinkled around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a month straight and don&#x27;t really think it does anything.</li>
            <li> Very affordable eye serum to use before eye creme.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Its oily, and it runs into my eyes, even when I apply it very sparingly.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit is all you need for each eye, smooth it on and the puffiness is diminished or just disappears.  </li>
            <li> Thanks you.</li>
            <li> As a girl of 23, I didn&#x27;t think its time to put on eye cream until I noticed there a light wrinkle under my left eye.</li>
            <li> This cream is very nourishing the skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any improvement of spots, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Only use fragrance free.</li>
            <li> When I have stopped and used something else is when I really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> It really hydrates the eye area well.</li>
            <li> which is really annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> does moisturize but lift not so much</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure till I ran out and didn&#x27;t use it for a while when I was told I looked tired so after that I ran out and bought more..</li>
            <li> I have tried several drugstore eye creams (Neutrogena, Loreal) as well as more expensive brands like Clinique, and this is by far the most effective.  </li>
            <li> It provides just enough moisture so my eyes look awake and young and wrinkle free!</li>
            <li> But ultimately went with love because I often receive comments about how young I look and how I have no wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I liked the pump container at first--no lid to unscrew--but it wastes a lot of the product.</li>
            <li> I have very normal skin</li>
            <li> Not greasy, not heavy, just right.</li>
            <li> but it also makes the eye area look younger; the transforming cream works right after applying for the &#x27;right now&#x27; affect, but if you don&#x27;t use it every day, the &#x27;brightness&#x27; is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Started noticing small wrinkles &amp; saw Consumer Reports had said the Olay Regenerist line was better or just as good as the more expensive products.  </li>
            <li> the product does NOT cause an allergic reaction; (with most other products my skin would become puffy and/or eyes</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream better than any other I&#x27;ve used, will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands as well, but none have come close to Olay Regenerist.</li>
            <li> It might work better on other types of skin.</li>
            <li> If only I&#x27;d been more proactive about these things in my 20&#x27;s when I felt invincible and apparently didn&#x27;t see the need for anti aging products...</li>
            <li> However, Olay Eye Lifting Serum has fulfilled my need for a gentle yet highly moisturising product that can be worn under make-up foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Eye Serum is very gentle &amp; didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive eyes at all.  </li>
            <li> But I like the new formula even better and expected to receive that, since it was featured in the photos and description.</li>
            <li> However, it goes on smoothly and adds much needed moisture to dry skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is specially formulated to be safe for use near your eyes, and to be light enough to absorb into that delicate skin.</li>
            <li> you want to try for few months and see the results, it maybe more positive than mine.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive, so was concerned that it didn&#x27;t say \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; but no problems.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s well worth it to do that, since people who talk to you are generally looking at your face and your eyes when they do</li>
            <li> Taking one star off for shady, but effective marketing claim - \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have inherently dark circles and no product will magically erase these no matter what they say.  </li>
            <li> I love Olay products, and this one did not let me down.</li>
            <li> Most beauty products make promises of less wrinkles, etc.  </li>
            <li> There was no indication on the order that I would be receiving the older Olay version.  </li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t prevent you from getting older.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be realistic people.  </li>
            <li> It is a decent product for its price.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is how quickly you run through the bottle.</li>
            <li> I get at least 2 weeks worth more by using a Q-tip to extract the remaining stuff.</li>
            <li> quick and convenient way to get personal items</li>
            <li> has proven to NOT be trustworthy with respect to production standards and safety, whether it is baby formula that killed many babies because it was bulked with melamine, toys that contain lead paint, or this eye cream - who knows what production standards and ingredients were REALLY used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m realistic.</li>
            <li> however, this particular one is not what I received.  </li>
            <li> I think what I received was an older packaging model?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 5 years and have found it to be better than the more expensive brands like Lancome &amp; Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll let you know in a month if I look ten years younger :)&lt;</li>
            <li> so when i sleep, I was deprived of Oxygen, so I looks older than I should,</li>
            <li> This is slightly over 10 bucks, so I thought it&#x27;s pretty cheap, but now that I think about the cost-effectiveness, it is way too overpriced.     </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> It works for me and reccommed it highly.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye serum, and find it far more effective on my crepey upper eyelids than other more expensive products (e.g., Perricone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps the skin around my eyes soft and supple without large wrinkles or imperfections shining through.</li>
            <li> Not sure how effective it is around my eyes, I have only been using this product for less than a month, will wait &amp; see how effective it is before I make a judgment call.</li>
            <li> Picture shows new packaging, the item I received was the older packaging &amp; shape so clearly older stock.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but with Subscribe &amp; Save this is the cheapest I&#x27;ve been able to find it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying it consistently for 5 years and would be at a major loss if it were ever discontinued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been more accustomed to the little tub-shaped containers of eye cream, but thought a pump might be</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like other brands, not a bad product at all!</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old, and wanted something that wasn&#x27;t necessarily meant for mature skin, but would still be affective on fine lines and the sleepy looking eyes.</li>
            <li> I am usually very satisfied with Olay products, but this one was a huge disappointment and harmful.</li>
            <li> However, Olay products are always gentle but effective and have never given me any trouble -- and this is no different.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive eye creams, I&#x27;m so happy I found this it works for me and saves me money.</li>
            <li> Im 32 yrs old and used it for 6 months but didnt really see any changes.</li>
            <li> That is ok with me, as long as I am perhaps preventing deep lines or sagging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a couple days for the skin to return to normal - Aveeno&#x27;s anti-itch cream</li>
            <li> Love it, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I found retinol cream to work just as well on the &#x27;normal&#x27; days of puffiness.</li>
            <li> Worth a try since everyone&#x27;s skin is different</li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped using the product my skin started returning to its normal state.</li>
            <li> yes it is cheaper than better brands, but at some point event $1 is a waste if it does not work.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cause me to get a rash, a concern I had, since most everything does give me a rash (I&#x27;m half Scottish!).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not 100% sure this product caused my eye infection, but I never get eye infections, and perhaps by being forced to open the container, I inadvertently introduced bacteria into this nutrient rich product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After prying off the top, however (I had to use a pliers because it doesn&#x27;t screw off), I determined that the mechanism had failed and that there was more than half of the original amount remaining.</li>
            <li> The tiny bottle comes secured in a box much too large for it.</li>
            <li> Within a week of using a combination of this product and other Olay Regenerist Products, I noticed a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had been pleased with the product in the past, but the last 2 bottles did not pump properly, so I had to pull off the top(not easy), and just scrape the cream out manually.</li>
            <li> I absolutely can&#x27;t live without Regenerist night cream.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to Olay line and decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using this for years but looking for something new without parabens.</li>
            <li> Dig that this in a tube, so there&#x27;s no using the new pumps which are showing up...</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works, buy a new one and it don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The new ingredient must be the culprit.  </li>
            <li> I also asked the rep if there was an Olay eye product I could use that didn&#x27;t have this new ingredient</li>
            <li> The new formula doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> However, the new formula caused chemical burn-like symptoms on my eye lids.  </li>
            <li> I bought this serum to help preventing new wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I will have to look for a new cream.</li>
            <li> dots really do work, they smooth out lines and firm the bags .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with my dark under eye circles or my wrinkles that are beginning to form (crows on sides, fine wrinkle underneath eye).  </li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t seen that kind of result, but intend to keep using for at least 12 weeks.</li>
            <li> The stuff works the same as Olay, doesn&#x27;t upset the skin, and comes in a larger package which is important for someone like me who needs it all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Olay is primarily the only facial product I use.  </li>
            <li> I am 45 years old an I have under-eye bags which to me, make me look much older.  </li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, I have developed what I would call bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> really much larger than expected:)  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Lets face it, with our central air/heating systems, our sun worshipping, (which I don&#x27;t do, but I do spend as much time outside as possible), our strong soaps, and cleaners, we do damage our skin.  </li>
            <li> I really can tell the difference, that my eyes look less tired, that the skin looks more healthy.</li>
            <li> I can see it is clearly working for me!</li>
            <li> without being shiny and greasy;&lt;br /&gt;4) reacts well with my make-up foundation/concealer and does not induce creasing;&lt;br /&gt;5) can be applied on both upper and lower eye lids (with most other products</li>
            <li> The bottle was small and cute.</li>
            <li> Some cost the consumers no more than the Olay products because the Olay products have much more marketing costs associated with them.</li>
            <li> Almost exactly the same price -- 22 bucks for 1 ounce (this Regenerist is 11 bucks for 1/2 ounce).</li>
            <li> My eyes still look the exact same!</li>
            <li> But I agree with other reviews on the pump, Olay should design a better pump for this tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after the first, I decided to give another one a try - thinking I may not have given it enough time.  </li>
            <li> Not only is this really cheap for an eye cream, it is better than all the other brands i have used which are far more expensive.</li>
            <li> Not only is this really cheap for an eye cream, it is better than all the other brands i have used which are far more expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought it last night and used it exactly as the directions called for.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> , I uses this brand several years , and i will buy again, thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always pretty skeptical of these type of products, but I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, and my skin under my eyes looks noticeably better!</li>
            <li> This serum works very well, with nightly applications I have seen an improvement in the fine lines around my eyes over the past two months.  </li>
            <li> seriously - this is a good daily eye cream (I also apply at night).  </li>
            <li> Since it is priced very reasonably, I can buy several and keep one in purse for frequent use during the day.</li>
            <li> The latest one was the cashier at a big box store where I bought the only bottle they had left since I was almost completely out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll try it or opt for something from a more natural line of products.  </li>
            <li> What little fine lines I had, in all seriousness, increased.</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for instant or pretty fast results, like within the week, or big repair results, I don&#x27;t think this product is going to do it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why so many beauty products, especially those for use around the eyes, are full of irritating perfumes.</li>
            <li> as good if not better than any more expensive and esoteric brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> The crow&#x27;s feet are definitely softened, the lip lines are looking better, AND the jowl area is tighter and less \\&quot;mushy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extra dry around my eyes and this product seems to nurish the skin and keep it smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply but, so far after a few weeks, I have no results.</li>
            <li> (No one would buy it at that price if the box were just large enough to hold the bottle.)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see any huge difference but there seems to be a little tightening of the lower lid.</li>
            <li> So, it general I use Olay products, because they do not test on animals, and have many of the same type of products that other (animal-tested) products do.</li>
            <li> I pay $14.99 for the store brand and to get the original brand for less than $10</li>
            <li> it is hard to be sure which of them is making the difference.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting it out, and sometimes I have to take the top off to get some out</li>
            <li> I had been applying it directly on the eyelid as they suggested.</li>
            <li> It keeps my eyelids soft looking, tightens the skin around the eyes and reduces puffiness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my skin frequently and contribute them to Olay skin products.</li>
            <li> I am 41 years young and people still can&#x27;t belive it.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young (under 30)</li>
            <li> They sent me the old formula in the pump that contains ethyl-methyl-and proply PARABENS.  </li>
            <li> Those products are gentle but unfortunately simply do nothing to my eye area.</li>
            <li> out how much your beauty regimen is doing for you, or possibly against you!</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive eyes, so this product does not work for me.</li>
            <li> Really, I can&#x27;t tell yet, I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month, so</li>
            <li> My wife recently turned 40 and started really taking care of herself.  </li>
            <li> recommend to all women who want to keep their skin young</li>
            <li> We all get old and so does our skin.  </li>
            <li> and I guess I have been naive to believe that I could just use products I have been using most of my life with no consequences to animals...</li>
            <li> product keeps one&#x27;s eye area moist and soft, preventing that &amp;#34;crepy&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li> However, I have not seen noticable benefits as it mentions a complete turnaround.  </li>
            <li> Also, my 94 yr old grandmother alwasy used OLAY</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and have not had problems with the cream accidently getting in my eyes, if I rub my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not just mature skin.</li>
            <li> My eye lines look so much smoother and younger.  </li>
            <li> I am a 68 year old Mother of 5.</li>
            <li> and it really works well especially the eye formula!  </li>
            <li> I am 69 years old and thought nothing could change the crinkly look around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I like the way when you are applying it, you can see you skin naturally lighten up.  </li>
            <li> It arrived early, too.</li>
            <li> There is so much product left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> its helped my skin and my adult acne</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom and from a few days after she started using it her eyes turned bright red; looked like she had pink eye in both eyes.</li>
            <li> I developed a rash on the area where the skin itched around one of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Product review summarized in the title complete a a a a a a a a a a  a a a a</li>
            <li> + year old eyes look closer to 40, which is why I hope they keep making this.</li>
            <li> This has been my go to eye cream for nearly 8 years.</li>
            <li> The serum makes the skin feel soft, but it does not feel moisturized for some reason.</li>
            <li> Since I only use it at night I can&#x60;t really say.</li>
            <li> I do look young for my age.</li>
            <li> I have re-ordered it when I get near the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Complete Anti-Wrinkle &amp; Firming Moisturizer Eye Cream</li>
            <li> Do not pull on the sensitive skin around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am not affiliate with Dermalogica or anyone, but I think I should do something for them to completely change my life.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and never had allergic reactions before.  </li>
            <li> It really does keep eyes looking younger and brighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting around to us it, but so far, it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li> but I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to start early.</li>
            <li> Try popping off the top and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.  </li>
            <li> You really DO need to take care of that skin area in a special way, since the skin is so delicate.</li>
            <li> But anything is better than nothing as long as it doesn&#x27;t make ur skin look/become worse, right?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comparable to the ridiculously priced department store brands at a much better price.</li>
            <li> This past year I have noticed I was starting to get the crepe like effect on my top lids.</li>
            <li> This was the main reason I stuck with it in the beginning, but obviously it&#x27;s helping to keep my skin moisturized and youthful looking.  </li>
            <li> Most alarming are the dark circles that seem to be returning under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, and I haven&#x27;t had any redness or irritation, and certainly no pimples.</li>
            <li> My eyes water a lot due to allergies, which dries out the skin right around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for the eye serum.   </li>
            <li> I definitely plan to continue using this product and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> and I have very few fine lines and no crows feet</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive eyes (apparently I do even though I never thought I did until this)</li>
            <li> Remember to dot cream around eyes and massage in with small, light circles.  </li>
            <li> I found this eye cream to be only OK as compared with other total effects products which I use regularly (daily moisturizer and night cream I give 5 stars).</li>
            <li> She stopped using this product and her eyes went back to normal.</li>
            <li> You hardly have to use any and it feels so soft and smooth on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it didn&#x27;t moisturize as much as I like, so a few minutes after applying the serum, I do put on a thin layer of L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect eye cream (in the little white jar), and the two products combined seem to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Olay Total Effects Eye Transforming Cream for years and was a bit leary about trying anything new.  </li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t penetrate my dry skin like I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> Lifestyle has a lot to do with your complexion so topical beauty products can only do so much.   </li>
            <li> When she tried this product several years ago we didn&#x27;t notice too much change, but this time was very different.  </li>
            <li> For around the same money, I recommend the Olay Pro-X eye serum since it works just as well and is a white cream which the skin absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li> soft - spreads well - tiny bit needed - appears to do the job so far.</li>
            <li> I have tried alot and when I come back to this I always see a difference in my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive eyes..</li>
            <li> It gives a definite lift, but in addition, it leaves a clean and tight surface to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li> I received the old formula in the old packaging:-(  Great formula.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how small this was, you just don&#x27;t think about how much .5 oz is, but it does cover very well.</li>
            <li> Its worth a try if you need a little lift in the area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this and other products as my daily regiment for the past couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;It is effective, yet inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Sooo sooo sooo disappointed, especially since Olay&#x27;s products are very good.</li>
            <li> The products are priced very reasonably so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m sending money swirling down the drain every night when I wash.</li>
            <li> I noticed the skin around my eyes looked brighter and just generally healthier this morning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I have lowered my initial 2 star review to 1 star, because I developed eczema under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Have only used it 2,3 times so far</li>
            <li> At 50, I&#x27;ve developed some age spots, and the Total Effects is lightening them.</li>
            <li> Wow what a big difference.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the crepey appearance starting to set in and while it&#x27;s not gone completely, it is improved.  </li>
            <li> I alternate this product at night with the Olay triple action eye pods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old female</li>
            <li> I like the Olay Regenerist line, especially the fragrance-free editions for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I prefer a non tinted cream because I want the product to actually work and restore my skins natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I developed a lower eyelid left eye</li>
            <li> This product also does not sting my eyes or make them red even though im usually sensitive to eye care products.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone wanting a moisturizer that can be worn under makeup and yet still sensitive enough for the eyes.</li>
            <li> Neatly packaged and once I use this product the first week, I noticed the dark circles and puffiness disappearing.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 2 is that it might work on someone whose eyes are not as sensitive as mine.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of days so far.</li>
            <li> I will finish the bottle, but then go back to my old ROC Retinol Correction eye cream, which I have been using for ages.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that my adult daughter keeps &#x27;borrowing&#x27; my face stuff</li>
            <li> , it has more to do with genetics, dehydration and poor diet.</li>
            <li> true gripe with this product is the dispensing mechanism of the small bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin type is dry with certain oily spots (t-zone) -- female in her 20s.</li>
            <li> Most eye creams that claim to diminish dark circles are actually TINTED (like a concealer, but less so).</li>
            <li> Most eye creams that claim to diminish dark circles are actually TINTED (like a concealer, but less so).</li>
            <li> I also make certain that my mom gets it for every gift giving occassion along with her other goodies.  </li>
            <li> have used for years, but was happy to find a less expensive way to purchase.  </li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time about half an hour ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 &amp; have the usual signs of aging (though I am lucky, not severe):</li>
            <li> The product itself is just fine - not too expensive although it emptied out really</li>
            <li> a good idea - boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> It adds a subtle bit of light to the area and keeps my makeup from settling into any expression lines throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> the products I use are for my health, the environment and their social record.</li>
            <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t work, I am male, Asian 22 years old,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker like some of the more hardcore offerings out there, but it will tighten up tired looking eyes a bit and definitely helps with wrinkles over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pump mechanism on this little bottle clogged up on the first week of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do think it helped with bagginess and fine lines, and it may have slightly brightened my dark circles, but this product, advertised for sensitive skin, made my eyes water all day long.</li>
            <li> BTW, I&#x27;m certain it was this product as I eliminated every other possible product one by one.</li>
            <li> For the last few weeks, I have had to unscrew the top in order to dig out the product at the bottle because the pump doesn&#x27;t reach the bottom of the little bottle.  </li>
            <li> because if you don&#x27;t cut the top of (which is no easy feat), you waste A LOT of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the one whose eyes will tear if our cat wanders next to me and rubs my shoulder, so my eyes are generally rather sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I do feel a general tightening in the overall eye area.  </li>
            <li> I got a sample not long ago of the eye serum with the eyelash lengthener serum.</li>
            <li> I am hoping long term use will help eliminate them completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-sixties and live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> The cream is well worth the price, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (New bottles, without cap, weigh just under 0.8 ounces, (0.73 - 0.74) and an empty bottle without the cap weighs 0.2 ounces, so the volume of cream in the bottle is correct.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product but the bottle is too small and it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st bottle so far, so I have limited comments on the effectiveness:  1.  </li>
            <li> The new version of this product has given me rough red itchy patches all around my eyes!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after researchin other similar eye creams and finding it highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks,my lids were much firmer and less fragile looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 years old and the area around my eyes was very dry.  </li>
            <li> much easier to use than the little pump bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for something for my dark circles and have come to the conclusion that nothing but concealer will help them.</li>
            <li> Though it is a small bottle (like most eye creams), a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I recently began using the goodguide.com to find out just how good (or bad)</li>
            <li> The bottle size is pretty scary, it&#x27;s itty-bitty, but it really does only take a little bit to go around the eyes (but no matter how much you read about \\&quot;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Beats Vaseline, as well as the far more expensive products I used to use!</li>
            <li> Beats Vaseline, as well as the far more expensive products I used to use!</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is OK but the dispensing pump, based on multiple purchases over a long period of time, consistently fails to function properly, meaning I pump and pump and shake and shake nothing comes out.  </li>
            <li> It takes much longer to show lasting effect and with such a small bottle</li>
            <li> Yet, using the same amount of cream every day, a bottle does not last as long as it used to last</li>
            <li> It last a long time, because it only takes a dot or two under each eye, but those&lt;br /&gt;little</li>
            <li> The cream is a little heavy but absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is very misleading to people who know very little about skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly purchase again in the future and would recommend to anyone concerned with the dark circles and looking to tone down some of the aging around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I read in a magazine that this Olay product was highly recommended and thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon was also $5 less than at CVS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 6-8 weeks and have noticed the bags and dark circles have diminished considerably.</li>
            <li> I thought I had washed it off but apparently not because I woke up with swollen eyes that were still watery.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate it as of yet.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I just got this serum and haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell if it will work miracles or not (I&#x27;m hoping it will!).</li>
            <li> The amount in the bottle doesn&#x27;t last all that long.</li>
            <li> This is essentially the same product as the Olay Professional Prox &amp;#34;eye restoration complex) except that it costs half as much.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s my little secret weapon. :)</li>
            <li> This one is actually true to it&#x27;s word it firmed my eyes a little no more crows feet</li>
            <li> my dark circles are only minimal; when they intensify, it has more to do with genetics, dehydration and poor diet.</li>
            <li> My eye lids had a rash and later just became really dry.</li>
            <li> - you only use a few drops at a time, around your sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest buyers do this rather than throwing the bottle away when the pump fails to pump any cream out.</li>
            <li> My dark circles under my eyes are virtually gone, and it really lifts and tightens the skin a little above the eye, by the eyebrow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put it on before bed &amp; woke up to see improvement in eye wrinkles, and very soft, yet firm skin around my eyes that lasted all day.  </li>
            <li> Just after a single use I woke up in the morning with red, itchy, and puffy skin around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> making a considerable mess).  </li>
            <li> This was the first eye cream I used that wasn&#x27;t too thick or heavy for my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> With dry skin it didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying ditch the Olay- by all means, keep it around for the heaviest of days, but using the retinol cream regularly and the Olay only in extreme circumstances is working well for me.</li>
            <li> She is usually allergic to even the most delicate creams, but not to this serum !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if a previous reviewer&#x27;s theory is right, but I too received one &#x27;Made in China&#x27; and wonder if the product is ineffective because of it.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the lighter side as far as thickness</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well - a little to early to tell.</li>
            <li> We all want to do everything we can for our skin, but with all the marketing schemes out there it&#x27;s hard to tell what moisturizers are really</li>
            <li> This was probably one of the most infuriating products I&#x27;ve purchased from Oil of Olay; and I routinely buy their products.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea if the neutrogena equivalent (healthy skin eye cream) will work as well for me cosmetically, but I can say my eyes aren&#x27;t watering like crazy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a yellow color, which was almost too dark for my eyes, so I only used it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, in recent years, the 0.5 ounce bottle of cream does not last as long as it used to last a few years ago.</li>
            <li> However, the bottle was much smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Strange smell</li>
            <li> the reason for only 4 stars: i guess i expected it to make me look 25 again.  </li>
            <li> It is soothing after a long day in the garden &amp; it moisturizes after a long winter day with the drying heat on.  </li>
            <li> Have used Olay products for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does in the long run.</li>
            <li> She asked how long I&#x27;d been using it, and when I told her, she said, &amp;#34;Well</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for long</li>
            <li> This is one of the few moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all and keeps my skin soft and moist all day.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m waiting to see how it affects my face long term.</li>
            <li> only minus was the container.  </li>
            <li> I just do not have time to send empty bottle back ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used stupidly expensive eye products from department store counters (Clinique, Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder, etc) and this is as good if not superior to them at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 23 years old, but I have hereditary dark circles and slightly baggy eyes .</li>
            <li> mean, do we really need to slather on caviar onto our faces?</li>
            <li> And yes, you don&#x27;t need to use much at a time, but it still seems a little pricey for such a small bottle.  </li>
            <li> While it hasn&#x27;t exactly turned my eyes back to 22 it has made a dramatic difference.  </li>
            <li> All you need is a tiny dot, so just don&#x27;t press down hard on the pump or you&#x27;ll dispense too much.</li>
            <li> Trade in the ad budget for more expensive non-paraben preservatives!    </li>
            <li> - don&#x27;t know which yet, at this point it could be any brand, just as long as it doesn&#x27;t have a pump!</li>
            <li> My left eyelid was almost non-existant due to a childhood dog bite.</li>
            <li> have had a  allergy problem with similar products from other companies .</li>
            <li> AND ALSO RETAINS THAT DEW AROUND THE EYES FOR A VERY LONG TIME</li>
            <li> I went back to my old eye cream, and the skin smoothed back out after a few days and finally isn&#x27;t raw and sore anymore.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference yet, but my under eyes aren&#x27;t dry anymore...</li>
            <li> I just put the bottle in my pocket and dab on a drop of two when I&#x27;m feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be hydrating, but I find myself putting it on 3 times before bed, yet I still fell like my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay for years and regenerist for the last few yrs; I am now 48 and look 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> However recently, my last few times of using it, I woke up with red, puffy, itchy eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and am sensitive to smells and have never experienced any issues with this product.  </li>
            <li> After using it for few weeks now, I do feel my eyes look more refreshed and less tired.</li>
            <li> I found that, in addition to costing an arm and a leg, each of the creams either did not live up to its claims, and/or caused an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> the application is limited to lower eyelids</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure if their product actually works, because after just a few uses, the pump to the container fails and you can&#x27;t get to well over half of the remaining product inside.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and don&#x27;t usually get allergic reactions to skin products, but this one did it.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Olay products forever and never ever had any kind of reaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That skin beneath and around your eyes is extremely thin, so if any skin on your body is going to show dehydration first, it would be your eyes.</li>
            <li> Never chasing down a product, since I forgot it the last time I was out running errands...</li>
            <li> Never chasing down a product, since I forgot it the last time I was out running errands.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this eye cream ,a little goes a long way,she applies it daily and this bottle lasts approx.</li>
            <li> You only need a little drop so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way: half a squirt of pump is enough to cover the upper and lower lids of both eyes!</li>
            <li> (some other products are not very clear about this).</li>
            <li> does not last long enough for the price and any liquid left in bottle is hard to get out!</li>
            <li> - I have to dip product out with the other end of the pump - not exactly how it was designed, but that&#x27;s the only way I can use this stuff!    </li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks so don&#x27;t know about long term benefis.</li>
            <li> I did a brief experiment where I cut the bottle in half after I thought the product had run out (since the pump was just bringing up air)...</li>
            <li> I actually have noticed less lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> put Olay cream on my left eye due to its recommendation by dermatologists and L&#x27;Oreal cream on the other before I went to bed.</li>
            <li> It would work for a day or two and then, I&#x27;d have to pump it 30 times to get a little, tiny spit of product out!  </li>
            <li> I also have these little bumps under my eye which are starting to disappear.</li>
            <li> (Aveeno was my former favorite), and I was very unhappy when the bottle appeared to be empty so soon.</li>
            <li> When it stopped pumping again and sooner than I expected I got out a serrated knife and cut open the little bottle</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely sensitive skin -- I react to products that are supposed to be hypoallergenic, too -- and I have a hard time finding products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for the past week and my eye lids look higher and can hardly see any of the crepe texture I saw.      </li>
            <li> My complaint is that the pump on the last two bottles have mysteriously stopped working before all the product has been used.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, did not notice much of a difference, except I did not have to use the deep hydration regenerating cream in that area.</li>
            <li> Bought this a few months ago and have used it daily.  </li>
            <li> Also, the pump is not very well designed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found myself slicing the container apart so that I access the last few ounces.    </li>
            <li> Did not irritate my eyes, but did not really reduce puffiness or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a few weeks so if that changes I will let you know,....</li>
            <li> This product arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have enormous crows&#x27; feet - I&#x27;m fairly young, but they&#x27;re enough to make doing my eye makeup difficult sometimes.</li>
            <li> well, a few words of&lt;br /&gt;encouragement to the tiny tube before I squeezed it probably helped.  </li>
            <li> so would not really recommend this</li>
            <li> Just be careful when using.</li>
            <li> (I hate to fuss with too many products, especially when I travel);&lt;br /&gt;7)</li>
            <li> I used this everyday on my upper eyelids for a month or so, and saw absolutely no difference at all.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve recently started to see slight wrinkles around my eyes as well as dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Received product in a plain white envelope.</li>
            <li> I am in mid 30s and starting to develop some small lines around the eyes with occasional dark circles and tired look overall.</li>
            <li> However, I woke up in the morning with my eyelids all swelled up and red, and the skin felt so raw.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way too, so one bottle lasts me 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time because you use so little of it.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replenish my other eye serum.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, it doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes, which is another reason I bought it.    </li>
            <li> I then started to apply it to the brow bone like other creams and the yellowish gunk went away.    </li>
            <li> The bottle is by no means empty either!</li>
            <li> I have NEVER reacted this way to any other product before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m seeing a big difference or not.</li>
            <li> If I get lazy and do not use it one night, I can see the difference the next morning.</li>
            <li> Since all products were working so well, I decided to try this eye serum when I ran out of the other product I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> However, I have tried lots of other brands and this works as well as the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to point his out to other unsuspecting purchasers.  </li>
            <li> Over the past year, I&#x27;ve tried a number of different brands of eye moisturizers and none have worked.  </li>
            <li> I am done trying other products.</li>
            <li> Takes only a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Olay has other stronger products that this one.  </li>
            <li> I had tried other products, but they made my skin break out.  </li>
            <li> so I guess that&#x27;s why it cost what it did for such a small package.</li>
            <li> Each bottle lasts me 3-4 weeks of daily use (in the mornings usually.)</li>
            <li> ...I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s equal to say I overpaid</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t sting my eyes though, unlike other products.    </li>
            <li> Not sure why P&amp;G thinks it is necessary to manufacture this in China, then ship it all the way to the US.  </li>
            <li> So, yes, I give this 4 stars, it made me think about trying other serums as well.</li>
            <li> No magical changes or improvements, just a solid, reliable moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I also use other products (lotions) on my face.  </li>
            <li> Totally regret spending the money on it :/</li>
            <li> I recommend not wasting your money on this one it didn&#x27;t help, and it is such a small container for the amount of money.</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle like the other reviews claim.  </li>
            <li> ANYONE ELSE experiencing this shortsighted Amazon tactic with Olay and/or other products?</li>
            <li> I have also used some other products in between.  </li>
            <li> but you learn to become very careful with the amount.  </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re very minimal</li>
            <li> Have used others and this is not as harsh (dry flaky skin around eyes).&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li> Its just a bit pricey for such a small container, and when the cream runs low its hard to get it out of the pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m annoyed that Amazon offers you other choices with other prices</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any odd reactions to any of Olay&#x27;s products, including this one - and I usually have issues with products from companies such as Clinique, Elizabeth Arden, and Estee Lauder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Jeff&#x27;s braniacs took this VERY HIGHLY RATED product (and some other Olay items) off of Subscribe &amp; Save, cancelled my standing orders, and moved the products to PrimePantry.</li>
            <li> We investigated (too late, alas) and discovered that this product has one of the worst toxicity ratings in the entire industry -- full of chemicals that are banned from cosmetics in many countries.  </li>
            <li> What I really do not like is the little bottle.</li>
            <li> Even if the little tube doesn&#x27;t break off the dispenser (which may be my fault but seems to happen a lot), it stops dispensing product way before the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> The next morning I could see a dramatic change in the texture of my upper lids.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the local stores</li>
            <li> but I may switch to something else because it&#x27;s just too hard to use when the supply is low.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The downside of course is that eye cream is rather pricey - but again, for the above reasons, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as bad as it might seem at first.</li>
            <li> They cover the dark circle, they do not make it go away...</li>
            <li> They cover the dark circle, they do not make it go away...    </li>
            <li> It seems like the dark circles are lightened quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I had bags and dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> After a week of using this product, my husband notice my eyes looked brighter and that was the dark coloring of my bags going away.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the appearance of my inherited dark circles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth returning</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference almost immediately, and it seems to help with dark circles under my eyes too.</li>
            <li> This product provides enough moisture for the delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li> This product is expensive but it really does work well.  </li>
            <li> while this product does work in reducing puffiness below my eyes and reduce dark circles it also covered them up with a tint.  </li>
            <li> *a bit* of the puffiness and dark circle under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> (+10%)on the order just arrived or not, but at least I realized when it&#x27;s time for my next scheduled order I could be charged at any price...</li>
            <li> and there was at least 1/4 to 1/3 of the cream left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> only complaint about this product is the packaging.</li>
            <li> The puffiness under my eyes seems to be reducing, and the dark circles are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> It seems to be lighting my under eye dark blemishes, not covering them up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not liked similar products as well as this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> Ive used this for years, it has kept me from getting those dark circles under my eyes...</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of eye creams and they had all irritated either the delicate skin around my eyes or migrated into my eye and caused a burning sensation within my eyes.</li>
            <li> only complaint:  </li>
            <li> and I have to say the dark circles look as if they are diminishing.</li>
            <li> I save at least $10 from what it costs locally.</li>
            <li> So the only way you can get past the faulty pump is to try and cut away at the heavy plastic</li>
            <li> It did NOTHING for my dark circles either.</li>
            <li> I prefer the ROC products for undereye wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the bottle it comes in, I don&#x27;t like the pump.</li>
            <li> Even though my experiences had left me a sceptic, when I read an article in a fashion magazine extalling the virtues of Olay Eye Lifting Serum, I decided to give this grocery store brand a try in hopes of replacing the Vaseline I had been forced to use.</li>
            <li> The jaw muscles tightened up and caused pain when I bit down.</li>
            <li> keep in mind that this is a very small bottle ( despite a big box).  </li>
            <li> I actually end up putting this on in the morning under my makeup because at night I find that it feels a little thick and my eye lids distract me with it on.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if appearance has changed, after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> That is one \\&quot;hidden cost\\&quot; of buying an inexpensive skin care product.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!  </li>
            <li> crow&#x27;s feet, vertical lines between my eyebrows, some vertical lines around my mouth, plus slight sagging at the jowls.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a difference in my skin; it&#x27;s softer and less ruddy looking, especillay when used with the Olay cream scrub.</li>
            <li> one)and I can get it here for about $5-$7 less than at stores in my area.</li>
            <li> Nothing is going to remove your wrinkles, but they can be softer &amp; less noticeable and this products does that.</li>
            <li> I will say that I notified the Olay company and within less than a week they had returned my purchase price without me mentioning it.  </li>
            <li> You have to cut the bottle in half to get the remaining serum out.  </li>
            <li> absolutely horrible.. it actually makes my eyes more wrinkly.</li>
            <li> I am wearing less eye make up now</li>
            <li> She is still recovering from it after 2 and a half weeks.  </li>
            <li> This has become a typical move for me these days.  </li>
            <li> I had this odd reaction in my jaw.</li>
            <li> half after applying the product each night....</li>
            <li> I called Olay and received less than satisfactory service.  </li>
            <li> I find this product lifts my lids slightly, firms, and brightens.  </li>
            <li> Its been about two weeks since i&#x27;ve been using it, and i have seen a little lightening of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> and I was having trouble with dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this one for a few years and have tried a few other pricier eye cream and eventually decided to stick with this one.  </li>
            <li> Each bottle lasts a few months since you use so little, about half a pump, on each eye.</li>
            <li> be scared,\\&quot; you will until you realized how little you use).  </li>
            <li> After doing a little of research for eye serums that weighed quality AND quantity, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little runny and jelly-like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little bottle lasts me about 3-4 mos.</li>
            <li> (tried a MUCH more expensive one - to be disappointed and switch back to this</li>
            <li> Well, how aggressive can a little bottle of eye cream be, really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey in store --</li>
            <li> Its a little pricy for the size of the bottle, but its Olay</li>
            <li> fight with three quarter&#x27;s of it stuck in the little packet.</li>
            <li> It does give my lids a little lift .</li>
            <li> Masks little lines and moisturizes without being greasy.</li>
            <li> and I have one little wrinkle eye, which began to diminish.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, like other reviewers, is the ridiculous bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  a little pricey and the bottle is very small, but you only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li> and I have to keep hunting it down in her bathroom!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very small bottle, so if I&#x27;m out on dry days and want protection around my eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks now, and I feel like it does work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to finish a bottle for a few months now just scooping out the leftovers.</li>
            <li> The skin under my eye looked like crepe paper - all dried out and wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday  and twice a day.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to work a few times.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this eye serum because what I&#x27;d been using for a few years seemed to stop working</li>
            <li> Cannot help but feeling something is missing here.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a few vigorous shakes and</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Regenerist Eye Serum for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It ends up being a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the few eye creams that I can use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I do have &#x27;drooping&#x27; eyelids and hoped that this would firm and tighten this area with out surgery.  </li>
            <li> I always said I would never wear eye cream and that they were a waste of time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frustrating to not receive what you order, especially when they specifically give you the choice.  </li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> but it says that the shipping is not available in my country.</li>
            <li> so you waste an undetermined amount of the product.</li>
            <li> I see a few reviews that mention having an allergic reaction after using this product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the few products I have tried that doesn&#x27;t cause them to sting and water all</li>
            <li> not greasy and does not leave a heavy feeling</li>
            <li> If used in conjunction with Eye Derma Pod, the skin will improve drastically in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It has proven ingredients but nothing harsh like retinol or hydroxy acids which could be drying or cause peeling.  </li>
            <li> Adds moisture and masks the heavy lines from age and dryness; time will tell on its effectiveness</li>
            <li> Used this until it was gone just because I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money which I won&#x27;t repeat.</li>
            <li> It took me a few weeks to figure out that this is what was causing it.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;Until this company changes the container that they use to deliver this product, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> one day I lost my Dermalogica Multivitamin power firm  </li>
            <li> I have nasal trouble</li>
            <li> cream is a waste of money, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for few months already</li>
            <li> Doubly irritating because it&#x27;s too much trouble to return with no confidence that you will get the correct item next time.</li>
            <li> It actually made me look less tired and puffy!</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the packaging had been changed from the small pump bottle to the tube that is pictured because there is so much waste with the pump.</li>
            <li> I know of - the slightly dense, creamy, thick ones.</li>
            <li> Wife ordered noted product without realizing how little .5 ounces was!  </li>
            <li> I felt a little disappointed and even unbelievable since Olay cream was more expensive than L&#x27;Oreal one, and it was recommended as well.</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to this product because Pro-X is just so expensive.</li>
            <li> Something has happened to this serum since I used it in the past.</li>
            <li> It is small</li>
            <li> I also did not like the small pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m sold on this or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually use MaryKay products, but wanted to try this out.</li>
            <li> The serum isn&#x27;t the usual serum</li>
            <li> Not sure what others are seeing</li>
            <li> In theory, by having a small container, just about when the lotion starts to fade and age, you&#x27;ve run out of it.</li>
            <li> (I have two small children)</li>
            <li> not sure about the lifting though.  </li>
            <li> I was beginning to get some &#x27;crepe-iness&#x27; and my usual cream was not helping.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m not sure it does anything.  </li>
            <li> The pump bottle makes it difficult to actually use all of the product.</li>
            <li> : you thought you save 15% then you invisibly lose 10% if not more as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this yet says the results are visbible in 6 weeks</li>
            <li> This is do small tnat</li>
            <li> After applying makeup (usually mineral, but sometimes a touch of stick concealer)</li>
            <li> I use a small amount under my eyes to soften the wrinkles and it lasts all day, but I do not put any powder or make up over it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product is being discontinued or not,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will buy it again -</li>
            <li> The one thing that I find very annoying is that when the pump stops dispensing product there is at least two weeks worth of product left in the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I still have very, very few wrinkles around my eyes and I am using this for prevention rather than repair</li>
            <li> Woke up with ugly, puffy, red, dry, itchy spots all around both eyes!  </li>
            <li> I hope they redesign the bottle because I can see a lot of people wasting about a fifth or product at the bottle due to the poor design.</li>
            <li> But my eyes start to feel uncomfortable, hard to keep them open.</li>
            <li> These alternative products are usually free of artificial colors and artificial fragrances.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes and protects my eyes in cold winter weather!  </li>
            <li> Lifts, moisturizes, helps my eyes look less tired.</li>
            <li> The lid is hard to remove</li>
            <li> hard to get out...</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I like a couple of other Olay products, but was disappointed in it--first, with the tiny amount.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> At least for me.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and have been using this product for about three years.  </li>
            <li> so I was hoping for at least some tightening in that area.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> At least it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> but no longer is--at least in our area</li>
            <li> I like a product I can use without a struggle so needless to say, when this is empty</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s so I always get sucked into the &amp;#34;anti aging&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;stop wrinkles before they start&amp;#34; slogans.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for a skin care product, but I wanted to get the facts about whether we needed to spend a lot on fancy eye creams or not.</li>
            <li> Reading through the reviews it looks like this allergic reaction to this product is common.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s been about two weeks) but at least this is one eye cream I can continue to use to see if it will soften those lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my skin lately.</li>
            <li> The company either has terrible quality control or a total disregard for its customers, especially considering that this is not a cheap product.  </li>
            <li> Slow seeing results</li>
            <li> This product seems to be working although slowly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m often forced to pry off the cap, which doesn&#x27;t screw off, in order to use the product.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with the new formulation of this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical by nature, and I wonder if anyone notices the change produced by skin products like these other than the user.</li>
            <li> And when I say you can&#x27;t get to it, I mean it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it &#x27;lifted&#x27; or tightened my eye area, but given the fact that it is irritating to my eyes, I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Serious bummer right?.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> - are you serious?</li>
            <li> I am feeling very disappointed in an Olay product that is reasonably priced and was dependable in the past.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want a giant tub of cream going bad by your bed for months while you get through it.</li>
            <li> Expensive and small.</li>
            <li> However, similar to what other reviewers say, the packaging is terrible!</li>
            <li> No more wasteing money on expensive eye creams.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very hard to use</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so frustrating that the pump bottle stops working when there&#x27;s still a lot of the (expensive) serum in the small bottle.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the hype..not all that and very thick.</li>
            <li> It took me months to realize that the yellowish gunk in my eyes that I kept waking up with wasn&#x27;t from the dusty air or allergies, but from the eye serum.</li>
            <li> I am also very ware of all the nasty chemicals (urea, parabens, PEGs, etc) that are included for product shelf-life and distribution reasons, not for the health of the skin and body.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why these products are exclusively marketed to women when anyone with tired, sagging, eyes could use it.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of paying $55-60 for Lancome eye cream</li>
            <li> Irritating.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the product I received.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m addicted I want to give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s wasteful and irritating.</li>
            <li> I have problems with eye serums irritating my eye area.  </li>
            <li> ;, so I was initially doubtful at the benefits this would provide beyond my regular regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Alas, the picture is not that of the product.</li>
            <li> Not that being said I don&#x27;t see things getting worse</li>
            <li> Overall, I like it and it doesn&#x27;t smell annoying.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have false expectations.</li>
            <li> As I have reviewed other Oil of Olay products that I have purchased here and department stores I can never find anything bad to say.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is serious stuff!  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed because I see no real results.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my ugly dark circles.</li>
            <li> I still have over half the serum in there.&lt;br /&gt;Badly, badly designed.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see dramatic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic reduction of the lines and wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Also by moisturizing your eye area it will help slow the aging process but will not stop it!!  </li>
            <li> Spring and summer are difficult seasons for my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s not exorbitantly expensive</li>
            <li> It has a faint scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Sad to say but this product did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> No need to buy expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy expensive brands</li>
            <li> After buying expensive designer brands for 30+ years I am making a change.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I will no longer be buying any Olay products because 1) they test on animals and</li>
            <li> What a rip-off!</li>
            <li> In my quest to replace overly expensive department store skin care products with over the counter \\&quot;quality\\&quot; cosmetics, I discovered this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> but, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, haven&#x27;t noticed ANY change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> As someone who has sworn by the L&#x27;Oreal products, I was skeptical to change.  </li>
            <li> My eyes stung like crazy too.</li>
            <li> Afraid this day and time to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite frankly afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I am beginning to realize that you can&#x27;t go wrong with anything Oil of Olay!</li>
            <li> so that made me sad!</li>
            <li> It burns like mad, and I end up rubbing and wiping my eyes with tissue.  </li>
            <li> (nearly impossible without gashing the bottle, your fingers and the product inside...</li>
            <li> There is not anything bad to say but on the flip side, I did not notice any improvements ( yet )  </li>
            <li> Too bad I bought a two-pack!&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are so bad for the skin.</li>
            <li> At this point, I&#x27;m thinking my face ain&#x27;t so bad.  </li>
            <li> Now bad for the price, though.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t give the product a bad rating even though it will take some imagination to see any improvement.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, just not what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> My wife had a horrible reaction to this product -- terrible redness, tight skin,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference.  :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stupid.</li>
            <li> I hate products that have fragrance since I have allergies</li>
            <li> I HATE THE PUMP.  </li>
            <li> I find eye creams especially irritating (Clinique was AWFUL for me!)</li>
            <li> Very painful.</li>
            <li> Horrible bottle design.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that fragrances in face products make me insane..</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Just awful.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!</li>
            <li> skin is supersensitive, so finding nonirritating products is especially difficult for use around the eyes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good results, does not make the eyes puffy as some other eye creams do</li>
            <li> I have been using Oil of Ulay &amp;#34;beauty fluid&amp;#34; since 1972 and continue to be a satisfied customer. I have not found any product that works as well as Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in recent years, the 0.5 ounce bottle of cream does not last as long as it used to last a few years ago. I started to weigh new bottles to make sure new bottles were full when purchased and this is not the problem. (New bottles, without cap, weigh just under 0.8 ounces, (0.73 - 0.74) and an empty bottle without the cap weighs 0.2 ounces, so the volume of cream in the bottle is correct.) Yet, using the same amount of cream every day, a bottle does not last as long as it used to last and I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye serum for at least 10 years because it is the best eye product I have ever found. All eye products, of all prices, claim to work. Most of them don&#x27;t work and some actually make your eyes sting and burn. This product has never made my eyes sting, and it just keeps on keeping my aging eyes sag and line free. I use it twice a day, each time I wash my face.  Revised 7/16/15  I used this serum for many years, then changed to Pro-X at some point. I decided to go back to this product because Pro-X is just so expensive. Something has happened to this serum since I used it in the past. The serum now burns and irritates my eyes. I am feeling very disappointed in an Olay product that is reasonably priced and was dependable in the past.</li>
            <li> All Olay products in this line work great</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It has been very effective all around. I can definitely notice a difference. The skins around my eyes is significantly tighter. I was purchasing this from Target-this is a much better price, esp if u are a prime member-free shipping</li>
            <li> Spring and summer are difficult seasons for my eyes.  Olay&#x27;s Regenerist has certainly &amp;#34;lifted&amp;#34; both my eyes and my appearance.  I&#x27;m so grateful for it.  My eyes are looking better every day.</li>
            <li> I got a sample not long ago of the eye serum with the eyelash lengthener serum. Haven&#x27;t used up all the lengthener so I needed eye firming serum. Hard to find in the local stores but Amazon had it at a great price, though a very small container. You do not need a lot. It works well and has no odor. I hate products that have fragrance since I have allergies and I do not want issues around my eyes. This is a good product. I always liked Olay products. This is no different. It is small so it is easy to carry in a make-up bag for raveling too.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.  Product is OK.  Have not noticed any changes.  Do not like the pump dispenser.  One never gets all the product out.  Seems wasteful.</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much every eye skin product available in the department and specialty store, including Clinique and Chanel. I found that, in addition to costing an arm and a leg, each of the creams either did not live up to its claims, and/or caused an allergic reaction. Even though my experiences had left me a sceptic, when I read an article in a fashion magazine extalling the virtues of Olay Eye Lifting Serum, I decided to give this grocery store brand a try in hopes of replacing the Vaseline I had been forced to use. I realize no cream/serum can reverse, or even stop the progress of time. However, Olay Eye Lifting Serum has fulfilled my need for a gentle yet highly moisturising product that can be worn under make-up foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) the product does NOT cause an allergic reaction; (with most other products my skin would become puffy and/or eyes would water);&lt;br /&gt;2) absorbs well and does not travel into my cheeks and/or eyes;&lt;br /&gt;3) is highly moisturising (YEY!!!) without being shiny and greasy;&lt;br /&gt;4) reacts well with my make-up foundation/concealer and does not induce creasing;&lt;br /&gt;5) can be applied on both upper and lower eye lids (with most other products the application is limited to lower eyelids only);&lt;br /&gt;6) can be used morning AND night (I hate to fuss with too many products, especially when I travel);&lt;br /&gt;7) the pump application ensures bacteria will not be transfered from your eye to the product and vice versa;&lt;br /&gt;8) little goes a long way: half a squirt of pump is enough to cover the upper and lower lids of both eyes! The .5 oz size lasts a couple of months with twice a day use!&lt;br /&gt;9) the Amazon price is outstanding, particularly on the Subscribe and Save plan; and NO TAXES!&lt;br /&gt;10) I do not have pronouced wrinkles (yet), but I can tell you that the skin around my eyes is VISIBLY tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) it does not make my skin look the way it did when I was twenty, but then I did not expect it to... ;o)&lt;br /&gt;2) my dark circles are only minimal; when they intensify, it has more to do with genetics, dehydration and poor diet. No cream can combat that. Most eye creams that claim to diminish dark circles are actually TINTED (like a concealer, but less so). They cover the dark circle, they do not make it go away...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product (moisturises and tightens without causing allergies) and its price (product is long lasting and comes with Amazon discount, free delivery and no taxes). Beats Vaseline, as well as the far more expensive products I used to use! I hope it works for you, too!, it has more to do with genetics, dehydration and poor diet. No cream can combat that. Most eye creams that claim to diminish dark circles are actually TINTED (like a concealer, but less so). They cover the dark circle, they do not make it go away...    Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product (moisturises and tightens without causing allergies) and its price (product is long lasting and comes with Amazon discount, free delivery and no taxes). Beats Vaseline, as well as the far more expensive products I used to use! I hope it works for you, too!</li>
            <li> I have been using Regenerist for about 8 years and I would not be without.  You cannot beat the price at Amazon.  It&#x27;s extremely effective for under the eye and I am told that I don&#x27;t look my age, and Regenerist is definitely one of the reasons for that. Highly recommend this great product.  AMAZON ROCKS!</li>
            <li> This eye serum is serious stuff!  Super smooth going on and the resusts are fabulous!</li>
            <li> I just receive it 2-3 days ago. It is the greatest product for eye that I ever use. The bottle was small and cute. and you only need about 1 pump per eye. it doesn&#x27;t make your eye watery but at the same time it give you the moisture that you need. Also, when I wear the make up with this serum, it do help my eyeshadow to stay on longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks now, and I feel like it does work.  Goes on smooth, and has a nice, almost shiny look to it.  Maybe to brighten up the eyes.  However, the bottle was much smaller than I expected.  And yes, you don&#x27;t need to use much at a time, but it still seems a little pricey for such a small bottle.  Otherwise, very pleased!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replenish my other eye serum.  This is my first bottle.  I bought it from reading the overall good reviews.      This is my 1st bottle so far, so I have limited comments on the effectiveness:  1.  The product is contained in a nice little travel friendly pump bottle.  Makes it easier to control the amount dispensed.    2.  I love the silky smooth feel of the serum/cream.  It glides on my skin wonderfully.  It also has a great fragrant.    3.  As for effectiveness on wrinkle and puffiness, I have used it too short of a duration to commment.  But anything is better than nothing as long as it doesn&#x27;t make ur skin look/become worse, right?</li>
            <li> This was the first eye cream I used that wasn&#x27;t too thick or heavy for my sensitive eye area. And where I didn&#x27;t worry it would clog my pores. It has a good consistency, goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly. It moisturizes well, and it&#x27;s lightweight on so that you don&#x27;t feel it at all. As other reviewers have noted, it doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes, which is another reason I bought it.    However, though this doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes, it does still seep into them.  At least for me. It took me months to realize that the yellowish gunk in my eyes that I kept waking up with wasn&#x27;t from the dusty air or allergies, but from the eye serum. I had been applying it directly on the eyelid as they suggested. I then started to apply it to the brow bone like other creams and the yellowish gunk went away.    Though it is a small bottle (like most eye creams), a little goes a long way. And when you think you&#x27;re done (ie. the pump no longer dispenses any more), there&#x27;s still a lot more left inside. Try popping off the top and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.  I&#x27;ve been trying to finish a bottle for a few months now just scooping out the leftovers.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I hoped being regenerist. I use a lot of Olay products. But see no results from puffy eyes or any firming. In fact I have seen no improvement anywhere. Much better products out there</li>
            <li> This product is full of PEGs, EDTA and parabens -- ingredients now banned in the EU because they are endocrine disruptors. The parabens are included as inexpensive preservatives. But, parabens mimic estrogen, and have been found in low concentrations in breast cancer tumors. That is one \\&quot;hidden cost\\&quot; of buying an inexpensive skin care product. While there is no proof of a causal link, the EU has banned many of these ingredients.     Alternative \\&quot;non-toxic\\&quot; skin care products exist on the market. Many are free of PEGs, EDTA, Parabens, phthalates and ureas (among others). These alternative products are usually free of artificial colors and artificial fragrances. Some cost the consumers no more than the Olay products because the Olay products have much more marketing costs associated with them. For example, search Amazon for a product called \\&quot;refine\\&quot; -- none of those ingredients, and no animal testing. Almost exactly the same price -- 22 bucks for 1 ounce (this Regenerist is 11 bucks for 1/2 ounce). Trade in the ad budget for more expensive non-paraben preservatives!    Having researched skin care products for quite some time, I am convinced that ingredients like palmitoyl pentapeptide (polypeptides) work to help reduce wrinkles. I am also very ware of all the nasty chemicals (urea, parabens, PEGs, etc) that are included for product shelf-life and distribution reasons, not for the health of the skin and body.</li>
            <li> So no results whatsoever.  Strange smell</li>
            <li> ...but this stuff WORKS.  Holy cow!  I&#x27;ve been using it, plus the Daily Regenerating Serum, every morning, then the Eye Serum again plus the Micro Sculpting Serum at night. I started the regimen about two weeks ago, and I can honestly say that I see a difference in my skin. I&#x27;m 47 &amp; have the usual signs of aging (though I am lucky, not severe): crow&#x27;s feet, vertical lines between my eyebrows, some vertical lines around my mouth, plus slight sagging at the jowls.  Nothing \\&quot;scary\\&quot; but noticeable enough to make me want to address them. I had been using ROC eye &amp; face retinol treatments but they didn&#x27;t do what these products have been doing, and in a much shorter time.  I am truly impressed. The crow&#x27;s feet are definitely softened, the lip lines are looking better, AND the jowl area is tighter and less \\&quot;mushy\\&quot;.  I have signed up for Subscribe &amp; Save on all of these products, PLUS the Night Resurfacing Elixir and the Micro Sculpting Cream, more for my neck than my face, since I tend to break out with anything heavier than a lotion.  I&#x27;m sold.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: One caveat about the Eye Serum- I noticed that it didn&#x27;t moisturize as much as I like, so a few minutes after applying the serum, I do put on a thin layer of L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect eye cream (in the little white jar), and the two products combined seem to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> Great stuff at a great rpice</li>
            <li> SO, I must first say I typically LOVE Regenerist products. I absolutely can&#x27;t live without Regenerist night cream. I had such high hopes for the eye serum.   I used it the day I received it - application was nice. The product was easily absorbed, and there was no noticable fragrance. However, it wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I&#x27;d hoped. However, I woke up in the morning with my eyelids all swelled up and red, and the skin felt so raw. My eyes stung like crazy too. Figuring it had to be seasonal allergies, and not the eye serum, I continued to use it another 2 times. Finally, there was just no way to pretend that it wasn&#x27;t the eye serum. The skin under my eye looked like crepe paper - all dried out and wrinkled. I&#x27;m 27 - I didn&#x27;t have those wrinkles to start with! I went back to my old eye cream, and the skin smoothed back out after a few days and finally isn&#x27;t raw and sore anymore.</li>
            <li> This was a very good value. It is a little on the lighter side as far as thickness but it certainly does the job for what I paid for it.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a really tiny bottle but it has lasted me for about 4 months at this point. The pump is no longer of any use but it&#x27;s easy enough to just get it out with the tube and put it around your eyes. I definitely lost a lot of the sagging bags under my eyes and I would recommend this product to anyone looking to do the same.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years now and find it to be the best even over department store products.  Yes, I do see results--less fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s regenerist serum for the eyes hides wrinkles and is so gentle on the sensative eye area.  I have been using it for years and it does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with Olay&#x27;s eye lifting serum. I use it everyday  and twice a day. It as made a difference in my bags. I love it!</li>
            <li> There is not anything bad to say but on the flip side, I did not notice any improvements ( yet )  It goes on nice though</li>
            <li> Works great! Eyes feel refreshed!</li>
            <li> i love the way this feels when applied.  creamy &amp; light--not oily.  the reason for only 4 stars: i guess i expected it to make me look 25 again.  i still have more than 1/2 the bottle to use, so it may get better.  plus i don&#x27;t use it every day or night, that probably makes a difference.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this one for the last half a year, so that&#x27;s great!  And the eye cream itself is quite nice, goes on smoothly, moisturizes and absorbs well.  My only complaint, like other reviewers, is the ridiculous bottle.  For the last few weeks, I have had to unscrew the top in order to dig out the product at the bottle because the pump doesn&#x27;t reach the bottom of the little bottle.  I hope they redesign the bottle because I can see a lot of people wasting about a fifth or product at the bottle due to the poor design.</li>
            <li> Works the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> this is good stuff...and I marvel at the price.  Consumer reports rated this over many, many top selling, name brand skin care</li>
            <li> The serum isn&#x27;t anything special, but it&#x27;s also not a bad item either.  The container has a good pump (easy control on how much to pumo out).</li>
            <li> Web MD recommends the Olay Regenerist line so I tried it. This product is easy to apply but, so far after a few weeks, I have no results. I also did not like the small pump bottle. I couldn&#x27;t get it to work a few times. Maybe a tube would be better.</li>
            <li> I need blepharoplasty to aid my peripheral vision.  I have been using this product for about a year, and it greatly improves the look of the upper eyelid and (I think) helps my vision as well.</li>
            <li> I just got this product yesterday, and noticed results this morning after just one day of use. I noticed the skin around my eyes looked brighter and just generally healthier this morning. I look forward to seeing the results with long-term use. I&#x27;m about to go order more products from this line, because if this eye serum is any indication, I think the Olay commercials touting the benefits of their Regenerist line are actually telling the truth!</li>
            <li> I have used the serum for over a month now. I don&#x27;t think I am in the target age range, and therefore am not seeing results. That is ok with me, as long as I am perhaps preventing deep lines or sagging.&lt;br /&gt;My true gripe with this product is the dispensing mechanism of the small bottle. The product is too dense, so that it sticks to the walls, instead of settling on the bottom to be pumped out.&lt;br /&gt;I have had to shake and pound this tiny vessel and pry it open to redistribute the product, as well as just scoop it out. The bottle is by no means empty either! I still have over half the serum in there.&lt;br /&gt;Badly, badly designed. I will not be buying this again for that reason. Too bad I bought a two-pack!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have lowered my initial 2 star review to 1 star, because I developed eczema under my eyes. The only product I was using in that area of my face was the Eye Lifting Serum. I have NEVER reacted this way to any other product before. This is definitely a product with pitfalls.</li>
            <li> I would 100% recommend Olay Regenerist Eye.  I have the most sensitive skin of anyone I know, and this product does not irritate it at all.  Unlike others, I don&#x27;t think this product is that pricey.  You can easily spend $50 and up for the same amount of eye cream at places like Sephora or Department stores.  For less than $20 you can have a more hydrated and toned eye area! Definitely try this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist Eye Serum for about 3 years and love it.  It keeps my eyelids soft looking, tightens the skin around the eyes and reduces puffiness and wrinkles. I get compliments on my skin frequently and contribute them to Olay skin products. I also like that it&#x27;s not exorbitantly expensive and it&#x27;s available most places.</li>
            <li> Bought this a few months ago and have used it daily.  It seems like the dark circles are lightened quite a bit.  The bottle size is pretty scary, it&#x27;s itty-bitty, but it really does only take a little bit to go around the eyes (but no matter how much you read about \\&quot;don&#x27;t be scared,\\&quot; you will until you realized how little you use).  I&#x27;ve used the Olay Total Effects Eye Transforming Cream for years and was a bit leary about trying anything new.  But the texture/feel of the Eye Serum is weightless, almost like it&#x27;s smoother, not so &#x27;lotiony&#x27; once you put it on.  The effects are different - the serum doesn&#x27;t &#x27;illuminate&#x27; the eye area within seconds of putting it on, it seems like it works over time (days/weeks), but it also makes the eye area look younger; the transforming cream works right after applying for the &#x27;right now&#x27; affect, but if you don&#x27;t use it every day, the &#x27;brightness&#x27; is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the bottle is itty-bitty, the serum packs a big punch.  I&#x27;ll certainly purchase again in the future and would recommend to anyone concerned with the dark circles and looking to tone down some of the aging around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I am 41 years young and people still can&#x27;t belive it.  I swear by any Olay products. Within a week of using a combination of this product and other Olay Regenerist Products, I noticed a huge difference in my skin.  When looking in the mirror, I noticed the fine lines disappearing.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see any huge difference but there seems to be a little tightening of the lower lid.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to Olay line and decided to give this one a try. I am in mid 30s and starting to develop some small lines around the eyes with occasional dark circles and tired look overall. So far, I really enjoy this serum, it feels very smooth and silky, my skin absorbs it really fast without feeling oily and it does not set in the lines. After using it for few weeks now, I do feel my eyes look more refreshed and less tired. I would definitely go back to it.</li>
            <li> Just after a single use I woke up in the morning with red, itchy, and puffy skin around the eyes.  I was diagnosed with an allergic contact dermatitis, and it took almost a week before it cleared up.  Never had contact dermatitis before, will be much more carefull trying a new product.</li>
            <li> I have used the Olay Regenerist Eye Serum, 0.5 Ounce for over two decades now.  I know that Olay continues to bring out new, more advanced products all the time, but I have sensitive skin and will react to new products more often than not.  I use this as a twice a day moisturizer around my eyes, am &amp; pm, and still really love it.  It is soothing after a long day in the garden &amp; it moisturizes after a long winter day with the drying heat on.  I am always told that I look way too young to have 8 grandchildren, &amp; most people assume that when I have any of my grandchildren with me that I am \\&quot;mom\\&quot;, not \\&quot;grandma\\&quot;.  Yeah, I love it.  I can&#x27;t lie.  Do I really think this product is part of why this happens?  Well, yes, as I am a consistent user and never miss a day with this product, so that consistency is part of why I think my eyes and the skin around them remains more youthful than others my age.  Anytime you can provide a good moisturizer &amp; do it each and every day, you are going to have better looking skin than doing nothing all.  Lets face it, with our central air/heating systems, our sun worshipping, (which I don&#x27;t do, but I do spend as much time outside as possible), our strong soaps, and cleaners, we do damage our skin.  Ladies, its maintenance, and if you want to look your best, than you gotta find a routine for a product, such as this.  I also LOVE getting this from Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save, as its saves me money and is always there when I run out.  What a convenience for me.  Never chasing down a product, since I forgot it the last time I was out running errands...Thanks, Amazon...you make my life easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m sold on this or not. I&#x27;m usually use MaryKay products, but wanted to try this out. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple months now....it&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m seeing a big difference or not. I think I might be, but I also just might need botox.:) It&#x27;s worth trying for yourself.</li>
            <li> Good serum.  Have only used it 2,3 times so far but it feels silky and it absorbs well.  It&#x27;s not sufficient by itself though, and needs a layer of the total effects eye cream on top.</li>
            <li> The cream is a little heavy but absorbs quickly.  It has a faint scent that is not overpowering. It really moisturizes and protects my eyes in cold winter weather!  Excellent eye cream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay for years and regenerist for the last few yrs; I am now 48 and look 10 years younger.  I also don&#x27;t tan which probably contributes, but I&#x27;ve started using the regenerist spf lotion on my hands and what a huge difference it has made!  My hands were looking my 48 yrs but after a week or so using the regenerist they look so much younger now.  Will always use Olay products and regenerist is perfect!</li>
            <li> I love the product...I&#x27;ve purchased it before...but the pump doesn&#x27;t work. It isn&#x27;t working properly. The last one I bought did......</li>
            <li> After doing a little of research for eye serums that weighed quality AND quantity, I decided to give it a try. The serum isn&#x27;t the usual serum I know of - the slightly dense, creamy, thick ones. It&#x27;s a little runny and jelly-like. I&#x27;ve tried it for two weeks now, and I haven&#x27;t seen any difference. I feel like it has the same function as a standard moisturizer. Furthermore, the product leaves your skin feeling sticky, which I can&#x27;t stand. My skin type is dry with certain oily spots (t-zone) -- female in her 20s. I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this eye serum because what I&#x27;d been using for a few years seemed to stop working and I was having trouble with dark circles under my eyes. Overall, it&#x27;s doing a good job. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6-8 weeks and have noticed the bags and dark circles have diminished considerably. The crow&#x27;s feet that seem to grow longer each year are still there, but not as noticeable. But unless you have a surgical procedure, nothing ever really makes them disappear. Some say they do not like the pump, but I don&#x27;t have any problem with it. All you need is a tiny dot, so just don&#x27;t press down hard on the pump or you&#x27;ll dispense too much. I also switched several months ago to Olay Total Effects for a daily moisturizer, and the Night Refirming Cream for overnight. Both work quite well. At 50, I&#x27;ve developed some age spots, and the Total Effects is lightening them. The Refirming Cream is great. If I get lazy and do not use it one night, I can see the difference the next morning.I have seen a difference in my skin; it&#x27;s softer and less ruddy looking, especillay when used with the Olay cream scrub. Since all products were working so well, I decided to try this eye serum when I ran out of the other product I&#x27;d been using.I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. I&#x27;ve always tried to take care of my skin, but I thought my age was catching up with me. But people still say I look 40, so.... I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth a try.</li>
            <li> The oil of olay eye serum that my wife is using is very effective.  After a couple of weeks, a drastic improvement has been noted around the eye.  This is a very effective product and I fully recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product gave me stye on my eye lid. I switched my eye cream to this one and I got disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I can&#x27;t wear eye make up and my contact lenses for a week!&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and seems to work pretty well. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality eye moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily, and it works great!!</li>
            <li> FYI this product does not lift or reduce wrinkles around your eyes--no one but a doctor can do that.  What it does do is moisturize your eye area--remember moisturized skin reduced the harshness of wrinkles.  Also by moisturizing your eye area it will help slow the aging process but will not stop it!!  It suffices, but I wish products would stop claiming to absolutely \\&quot;lift\\&quot; the eye area.  It is very misleading to people who know very little about skin.  If it could actually do what it claims it would cost a ton more and be administered by a doctor.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and have been using this product for about three years.  I have seen a visible improvement around my eyes, especially the crow&#x27;s feet area.  The texture is smooth and easy to apply.  I use it morning and evening, and find that it lasts 2-3 months.  I have tried many products far more expensive, and have found this one to be the most effective at this stage of my life.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is one of the only products in the eye line to actually work.. I wasn&#x27;t sure till I ran out and didn&#x27;t use it for a while when I was told I looked tired so after that I ran out and bought more..</li>
            <li> I use this and pat it around my eyes several times a day.  It is nice going on, it seems to smooth the eye area, help with lines and firms the eye area.  Great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Also, when you can not pump any more out do not throw it away.  Just pull off the top and put the bottle on the side and you can use the cream that is still in the bottle (from the straw like piece inside) for another 3 or 4 weeks.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this since so many people seem to use it. When I pumped it onto my finger, I loved that there was no scent. It seemed shear and light. These were the only good things about it for me.&lt;br /&gt;After I put this on- it took about a minute for the redness and burning to start. I thought I had washed it off but apparently not because I woke up with swollen eyes that were still watery. On the corners of my eyes, there was redness and peeling. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Olay products forever and never ever had any kind of reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have sensitive eyes (apparently I do even though I never thought I did until this) I would stay away from it.</li>
            <li> * I prefer the ProX Eye Cream, though this one felt very smooth  * It did not do much for wrinkles that I could tell</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and my eyes have gone through lots of wear and tear over the years. This past year I have noticed I was starting to get the crepe like effect on my top lids. I tried Avon eye cream (made my lids break out no change in texture,) Olay x (no change and bumps.)     This product works. The next morning I could see a dramatic change in the texture of my upper lids. I have been using the product for the past week and my eye lids look higher and can hardly see any of the crepe texture I saw.      So happy I found this!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product. So what did I have to lose in trying it. I had bags and dark circles under my eyes and I could not stand it. After a week of using this product, my husband notice my eyes looked brighter and that was the dark coloring of my bags going away. Also my skin was tighter. Wow what a big difference. I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> First, in case the name didn&#x27;t give it away, I&#x27;m a man.  I don&#x27;t know why these products are exclusively marketed to women when anyone with tired, sagging, eyes could use it.  Well I&#x27;ve been using Regenerist for only 3 days now and the difference is amazing.  I&#x27;m 43 with visibly baggy, wrinkley, eyes and this stuff works better than I expected.  I use it before bed and in the morning.  While it hasn&#x27;t exactly turned my eyes back to 22 it has made a dramatic difference.  My eyes seems brighter now and much much tighter.  I do look younger and again this is only after 3 days! Absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eye serum in January and have been using it for about 3 months now.  I have saggy upper eyelids so I was hoping for at least some tightening in that area.  I am disappointed because I see no real results. However, I have tried lots of other brands and this works as well as the others I&#x27;ve tried. It is a good moisturizer for the eye area.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate it as of yet.  So far, it is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is another one of Olay products that I really like. It last a long time, because it only takes a dot or two under each eye, but those&lt;br /&gt;little dots really do work, they smooth out lines and firm the bags . Just an excellent product!</li>
            <li> Sad to say but this product did not work for me.  I have used it every day for a week and have not seen any difference under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am using so many Olay products it is hard to be sure which of them is making the difference.  I would recommend this product.  I have used Oil of Olay since I was 19 and that is 40 years now. For the money, it is the best product out there.  Lifestyle has a lot to do with your complexion so topical beauty products can only do so much.   I definitely recommend Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> This works great for softening lines around your eyes. My skin is pretty sensitive, so was concerned that it didn&#x27;t say \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; but no problems.</li>
            <li> The seller did not tell the buyers the product that was made in China.  I found the same product made in America sold in the department stores.  Why the seller sold me the product that was made in China?  How to contact the seller?  Where can I complain about it?</li>
            <li> but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the appearance of my inherited dark circles.  I didn&#x27;t even buy it for that reason so it&#x27;s an amazing perk!  The texture of my eye skin has improved greatly.  I bought it for the crepey appearance starting to set in and while it&#x27;s not gone completely, it is improved.  The size of the lotion bottle kind of scared me given the cost but you learn to become very careful with the amount.  I use about 1/2 a pump per eye.  I&#x27;m sure it has varied results given everyone&#x27;s skin is different but I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I alternate this product at night with the Olay triple action eye pods. The eye serum is moisturizing, but not greasy, and since I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and am happy with the performance of the product it frustrates me that the packaging is the problem. My complaint is that the pump on the last two bottles have mysteriously stopped working before all the product has been used. No, I don&#x27;t have the pump accidentally in the locked position. :-) I could just hear some of you making that suggestion. I&#x27;ve ended up having to unscrew the pump top to get to the rest of the product in the bottle which defeats the convenience of the pump and purity of the product. It isn&#x27;t that the product is below the pump line. It&#x27;s that the pump just stops working. I end up dipping the pump tube into the bottle and dabbing it on my fingertip.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  It&#x27;s the only eye cream that works!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels on my eyes, better than any cream I&#x27;ve used but the dispenser as others have reported leaves much to be desired.  There needs to be a better way to package the product so that one can use all without having to remove the top and try and get the cream out of the bottle.  The last container lasted only two weeks before having to take it apart.</li>
            <li> I have tried several drugstore eye creams (Neutrogena, Loreal) as well as more expensive brands like Clinique, and this is by far the most effective.  The lotion absorbs instantly and the skin around my eyes feels supple and hydrated all day/night afterwards.  I am in my late 20&#x27;s so I use this primarily for the moisturizer, but I figure it&#x27;s never to early to start anti-aging! I use it in the morning and at night - it works great alone as well as under make up.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but with Subscribe &amp; Save this is the cheapest I&#x27;ve been able to find it.  A little bit goes a long way too, so one bottle lasts me 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> Not sure what others are seeing but this product did nothing for me. My eyes still look the exact same! I&#x27;m young (under 30) so maybe that&#x27;s why? I have some wrinkles around my eyes though and from the reviews about this product, I figured SOMETHING would change, but nothing. So either this product doesn&#x27;t work, or I just don&#x27;t actually need it!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using this for years but looking for something new without parabens. I tried the formula in the tube, it does not have the parabens so I thought that&#x27;s what I was ordering.  I received mine today. They sent me the old formula in the pump that contains ethyl-methyl-and proply PARABENS.  I&#x27;m annoyed that Amazon offers you other choices with other prices but they changed the product as well.  Be aware of this. There was no indication on the order that I would be receiving the older Olay version.  It&#x27;s not worth returning but I wanted to point his out to other unsuspecting purchasers.  If you choose a different option, it might not be the product you intended to get.  Otherwise I would give this 4 to 5 stars instead of a 1.  I&#x27;m going to contact Amazon to see what they can do for me.</li>
            <li> Have used Olay products for a long time.</li>
            <li> Horrible bottle design.  I used it for 4 days before the pump mechanism stopped working.</li>
            <li> The cream is well worth the price, a little goes a long way. But I agree with other reviews on the pump, Olay should design a better pump for this tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> My wife still uses this.</li>
            <li> Before applying makeup it&#x27;s wonderful - not greasy or heavy under my eyes, it absorbs really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old female and I&#x27;ve recently started to see slight wrinkles around my eyes as well as dark circles.  In addition, I&#x27;ve also had quite a bit of dryness around my eyes.  Over the past year, I&#x27;ve tried a number of different brands of eye moisturizers and none have worked.  Until now, that is.  I wish I would&#x27;ve tried the Olay Regenerist Eye Serum from the start.  All of the above problems have been solved, and my skin just seems brighter than it used to be.  I definitely plan to continue using this product and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Olay roller, but I like this serum better.  It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks so no immediate results, but love the product.</li>
            <li> All eye creams seem to come in tiny .5oz / 15ml containers. I supopse in a way it makes sense - you only use a few drops at a time, around your sensitive eyes. You don&#x27;t want a giant tub of cream going bad by your bed for months while you get through it. In theory, by having a small container, just about when the lotion starts to fade and age, you&#x27;ve run out of it. I know with handmade lotions I make, the recipes say they&#x27;ll last a month at the most before you want to discard them and make a new batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Olay Regenerist eye cream. The container is great - the little pump makes it easy to get out just the few drops you need. You put a few along your lower lid and then gently rub them into the area. The lotion stays put, and doesn&#x27;t get into my eyes. It also doesn&#x27;t have any fumes or aromas to make my eyes water. I&#x27;m the one whose eyes will tear if our cat wanders next to me and rubs my shoulder, so my eyes are generally rather sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can turn the pump so that it locks into an open position, great for if you need to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this each morning and evening. I really can tell the difference, that my eyes look less tired, that the skin looks more healthy. And really, it makes sense. All skin needs moisture to stay healthy. That skin beneath and around your eyes is extremely thin, so if any skin on your body is going to show dehydration first, it would be your eyes. People look at your eyes all the time when they talk to you, so they notice that pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of course is that eye cream is rather pricey - but again, for the above reasons, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as bad as it might seem at first. You use tiny amounts. The cream is specially formulated to be safe for use near your eyes, and to be light enough to absorb into that delicate skin. You really DO need to take care of that skin area in a special way, since the skin is so delicate. And it&#x27;s well worth it to do that, since people who talk to you are generally looking at your face and your eyes when they do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to be frugal, but this is one of the areas where I think taking good care of yourself is worth it in the long run.alk to you are generally looking at your face and your eyes when they do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to be frugal, but this is one of the areas where I think taking good care of yourself is worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> At first when I started using this product, it seemed to moisturize my under eye area well. However recently, my last few times of using it, I woke up with red, puffy, itchy eyes. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and don&#x27;t usually get allergic reactions to skin products, but this one did it. I do not recommend this product at all. I am usually very satisfied with Olay products, but this one was a huge disappointment and harmful. Spend a little more to get better quality.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome buy for far less than the price at the store. I love Olay products, and this one did not let me down. I am 22 years old, and wanted something that wasn&#x27;t necessarily meant for mature skin, but would still be affective on fine lines and the sleepy looking eyes. (I have two small children) This is the product. Each bottle lasts a few months since you use so little, about half a pump, on each eye. Very happy and you can&#x27;t beat the price. And it arrived the DAY AFTER I ordered it!! AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after seeing a favorable review for it on a morning news show. It&#x27;s spendy for only .5 oz., but the reviewers claimed it did work to reduce wrinkles around the eyes. After two weeks of nightly use, I really can&#x27;t tell any difference (Aveeno was my former favorite), and I was very unhappy when the bottle appeared to be empty so soon. After prying off the top, however (I had to use a pliers because it doesn&#x27;t screw off), I determined that the mechanism had failed and that there was more than half of the original amount remaining. I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer for around the eyes...not sure about the lifting though.  Can&#x27;t recommend for that, although it may work for others.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams from expensive Sisleya to lower priced Neutrogena. Those products are gentle but unfortunately simply do nothing to my eye area. I tried Olay after reading some cosmetic reports and gave it a try. I can see it is clearly working for me! Gentle to put on and it makes my eye area hydrate and fresh-looking the entire day. Since it is priced very reasonably, I can buy several and keep one in purse for frequent use during the day. Very nice value - I am glad to be able to save 150 bucks on one eye cream now that I find this product to replace Sisleya!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this does what it claims to do. At least it did nothing for me. And the bottle is tiny like a sample. This is slightly over 10 bucks, so I thought it&#x27;s pretty cheap, but now that I think about the cost-effectiveness, it is way too overpriced.     I&#x27;d also say that the gold pearl in the cream serum may clog pores. I&#x27;ve used excellent eye creams before, and they normally tighten your skin in the eye area instantly, but this serum is way too watery to tighten your skin...     All in all, I don&#x27;t think this product is worth a penny. Sorry. but I&#x27;m disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum since I got it 2 months ago.  Cannot help but feeling something is missing here.  It does hydrate the skin around my eyes a bit, but over all I am not seeing the desired results.  Since this is called a serum, maybe it&#x27;s meant to be paired with an eye cream?  If someone knows the answer please share with the class!  Also, the pump is not very well designed.  One night I tried to use it.  After several pumps nothing came out.  I held the bottle to the light and saw that I had 3/4 left.  So why was nothing coming out?  I gave it a few vigorous shakes and the pump started working again.  Tricky!&lt;br /&gt;For the same amount of money, I recommend Olay Definity Eye Illuminator.  It tightens, lifts, and brightens my eyes visibly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye product for quite awhile &amp; I love it. It definitely has made an improvement in the overall appearance of my eyes. Really would not want to go without it.</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for something for my dark circles and have come to the conclusion that nothing but concealer will help them. So I stopped trying to find the miracle cream for dark circles and just wanted a nice moisturizer for around my eye area. This is definitely it. It&#x27;s not greasy and wears really well under makeup. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used several products to reduce lines and crepe-iness of the eyelids. I came back to Olay. It works for me. I use at night and during the day. I am done trying other products. I will continue to use Olay Regenerist products.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye serum. I&#x27;m only 23 years old, but I have hereditary dark circles and slightly baggy eyes . This has effectively depuffed my eyes and lightened my dark circles. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Seems to work. No miracles but absorbs nicely and smooths wrinkles temporarily. Did not lose 10 yrs! For the price it is good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if a previous reviewer&#x27;s theory is right, but I too received one &#x27;Made in China&#x27; and wonder if the product is ineffective because of it. What little fine lines I had, in all seriousness, increased. Did I always have this many fine lines and the product made it more apparent? Or did the product actually cause the increase in lines? To add on, I noticed a couple tiny red bumps appear a couple weeks after using this product. I&#x27;ve never had red bumps appear under my eyes in my life. The red bumps disappeared after a week of not using, but flustered because the additional lines are still there and visible. Now I have to fine another product to undo (or hide) all these new fine lines I&#x27;m stuck with. Sooo sooo sooo disappointed, especially since Olay&#x27;s products are very good.</li>
            <li> Works great will by again.</li>
            <li> I have it on good authority that eye area serums, lotions, and creams are all gimmicks, and you are better off just using your regular moisturizer generously in your eye area. Try Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find out how much your beauty regimen is doing for you, or possibly against you! I found Beautypedia last year, and not only are they free, but 100% of their info is backed by their own research and experimentation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;Olay is a good brand with many many many awesome products, but dont be suckered into spending more money than you need to!</li>
            <li> This eye cream has helped reduce the \\&quot;appearance\\&quot; (as they say) of wrinkles around my eyes. I did notice a difference almost immediately, and it seems to help with dark circles under my eyes too. Its just a bit pricey for such a small container, and when the cream runs low its hard to get it out of the pump.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, felt great, soft, hydrating from the get go. Felt good on my eyes and helped the bags under them, seemed to brighten them right away. I like this eye cream better than any other I&#x27;ve used, will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, non-greasy. Fast absorption, which helps if you plan on using an under-eye concealer or primer. I like the Olay Regenerist line, especially the fragrance-free editions for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the effect is very obvious</li>
            <li> Update 4-7-2012&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the serum for about 8 months and I love this stuff!  I apply about a pea size below each eye and around the eye brow area at night.  (I wash my face, and then apply the serum).  I started noticing a difference after about 3 weeks.  My dark circles under my eyes are virtually gone, and it really lifts and tightens the skin a little above the eye, by the eyebrow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that the serum doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as I do have sensative skin.&lt;br /&gt;The little bottle lasts me about 3-4 mos. It will depend on how much you use each time, and how often you apply it.</li>
            <li> This product is great for firming the eyelids...I was beginning to get some &#x27;crepe-iness&#x27; and my usual cream was not helping. After 2 weeks,my lids were much firmer and less fragile looking.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday on my upper eyelids for a month or so, and saw absolutely no difference at all.  I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Super hydrating, goes right into skin and not oily!!</li>
            <li> This feels really nice to apply.... but I haven&#x27;t noticed any real changes to my skin.  In fact, I&#x27;m not sure it does anything.  That being said, I do like to use it b/c of the way it feels.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I think \\&quot;Shopper\\&quot; did a great job breaking down all the pros and cons so I won&#x27;t repeat her...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is the only eye cream I will use (tried a MUCH more expensive one - to be disappointed and switch back to this one)and I can get it here for about $5-$7 less than at stores in my area. I heart Amazon. :)</li>
            <li> I was tearing up every time I put it on. I have somewhat sensitive eyes, so this product does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Regenerist Eye Serum for a few years.  Occasionally I try another product, but I always return to Olay. Nothing is going to remove your wrinkles, but they can be softer &amp; less noticeable and this products does that. Takes only a small amount.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I do like the Olay Products</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream.  No need to buy expensive brands.  This product provides enough moisture for the delicate eye area.  I used to buy expensive brands but I have switched to Oil of Olay and I love it.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This olay eye serum is the best I have ever used. It provides just enough moisture so my eyes look awake and young and wrinkle free! It&#x27;s truly the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love it....just need larger sizes. OLAY REGENERIST is all I use now. Its great and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and leg!</li>
            <li> This is the second \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; of Olay Regenerist Eye Serum.  Since I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after the first, I decided to give another one a try - thinking I may not have given it enough time.  Well, have been using it faithfully each day; and, no signs of improvement.  Although I like almost all of the Olay Regenerist products I use, will definitely give this one a pass in the future.</li>
            <li> After buying expensive designer brands for 30+ years I am making a change. I like the convenient dispensing - the product doesn&#x27;t become contaminated by fingers; it goes on smooth, not oily - doesn&#x27;t interfere with contact lenses. I use it A.M and P.M. Feels rich, creamy, but not heavy. Hard to tell if appearance has changed, after only a few weeks. Signed up for scheduled refills, to get an even better price than store sales.</li>
            <li> Really, I can&#x27;t tell yet, I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month, so I don&#x27;t see any difference yet, but my under eyes aren&#x27;t dry anymore...</li>
            <li> I was torn between I like it and I love it.  But ultimately went with love because I often receive comments about how young I look and how I have no wrinkles.  I credit it to using this eye serum for many years.  I&#x27;m so happy that it&#x27;s in this squeeze tube instead of the stand up bottle that I could never get most of the product out of.  This tube allows you to get every last drop of serum out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and am sensitive to smells and have never experienced any issues with this product.  This was the main reason I stuck with it in the beginning, but obviously it&#x27;s helping to keep my skin moisturized and youthful looking.  A mainstay in my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> As advertised and on time</li>
            <li> Started noticing small wrinkles &amp; saw Consumer Reports had said the Olay Regenerist line was better or just as good as the more expensive products.  So decided to try the Eye Serum.  I put it on before bed &amp; woke up to see improvement in eye wrinkles, and very soft, yet firm skin around my eyes that lasted all day.  So I purchased 3 more of the Regenerist products to try!  The Eye Serum is very gentle &amp; didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive eyes at all.  Highly recommended.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does in the long run.</li>
            <li> I had been pleased with the product in the past, but the last 2 bottles did not pump properly, so I had to pull off the top(not easy), and just scrape the cream out manually. I am going to have to try another eye lifting product that has a non-pump type package. It ends up being a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive but it really does work well.  It is easy to apply and you can see the difference as soon as you put it on.  Not greasy, just perfect if you don&#x27;t mind paying a little more.</li>
            <li> My wife recently turned 40 and started really taking care of herself.  I ordered this product based on a Consumer&#x27;s Report article several years ago.  They compared several products and tested their claims.  This particular one was voted the best value and test results were very positive and comparable to the more expensive competitors.  When she tried this product several years ago we didn&#x27;t notice too much change, but this time was very different.  She is definitely seeing the benefits of this serium and will be complementing her more expensive lifting products as a way to manage the increasing costs that come with looking younger.  Eating right and staying fit will keep you healthy, this product will help you look younger. Taking one star off for shady, but effective marketing claim - \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot;.  This product only masks the problem, doesn&#x27;t prevent you from getting older.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this product first, before getting the Olay ProX eye lifting serum.  While this product dis work for me, as well as the Pro-X product, this one is tinted.  I prefer a non tinted cream because I want the product to actually work and restore my skins natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while this product does work in reducing puffiness below my eyes and reduce dark circles it also covered them up with a tint.  For around the same money, I recommend the Olay Pro-X eye serum since it works just as well and is a white cream which the skin absorbs very well.  IF you do want a tinted cream to help conceal though, this product does work quite well.  I hope this helps people :-)</li>
            <li> I bought four products from this line--the Regenerating Lotion with UV, Daily Regenerating Serum, Night Recovery Moisturizing, and the Eye Serum. After two weeks of use, I&#x27;m pretty pleased. I&#x27;m skeptical by nature, and I wonder if anyone notices the change produced by skin products like these other than the user. But, I think this stuff does make the skin around my eyes look smoother and lighter, and it certainly moisturizes without being greasy. I have pretty sensitive skin, and I haven&#x27;t had any redness or irritation, and certainly no pimples. I also don&#x27;t notice any scent. I find eye creams especially irritating (Clinique was AWFUL for me!) but the eye serum is very soothing. I&#x27;m pleased with the results and certainly the price!</li>
            <li> have used for years, but was happy to find a less expensive way to purchase.  recommend to all women who want to keep their skin young</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to try this product after hearing of its eye enhancing potential. She&#x27;s very satisfied with the results the serum produced in just a few days of applying it.</li>
            <li> This eye lifting serum is non-greasy, it absorbs very well and it does refresh your eyes.  I do think it alleviates *a bit* of the puffiness and dark circle under my eyes.  As for giving a lift for your eye lids skin, I am not so sure of that.  I still have very, very few wrinkles around my eyes and I am using this for prevention rather than repair so I can&#x27;t tell that much about that.  Since I use it for maintenance I don&#x27;t put it on at night so it may not be doing the fullest it can do for me.  But if you are looking for instant or pretty fast results, like within the week, or big repair results, I don&#x27;t think this product is going to do it.  No miracles here.  I have to add that Olay products are excellent in the long run.  I have confirmed this.  So I will continue using Olay products.  Olay has other stronger products that this one.  So shop around depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> it did help reduce the lines that were beginning to form.  I mean, it does the lifting around the eyes like it said it would, I&#x27;m impressed, fragrance-free, which is better for my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference.  :(</li>
            <li> my wife loves this eye cream ,a little goes a long way,she applies it daily and this bottle lasts approx. two plus months.</li>
            <li> After looking at many eye creams I stumbled upon this one. I saw good reviews on the product and also saw reviews saying that people had allergic reactions to it. I thought, \\&quot;that won&#x27;t happen to me\\&quot;. Well, it did happen. My eye lids had a rash and later just became really dry. There is some ingredient in this eye serum that made me hypersensitive so buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results and the price of this product.  I could see a difference within 24 hours.  Love it and hope you do too!</li>
            <li> I enjoy all of the Olay products.  They are a very good value.  The product is quality and the price is reasonable.  You cannot stop the aging process, nor can you expect miracles, but you can take care of the skin you have.  Let&#x27;s be realistic people.  We all get old and so does our skin.  I have been purchasing the Olay products, after using more expensive brands for about 2 years.  I will continue with the Olay brand.</li>
            <li> I have to say that fragrances in face products make me insane.. I have been a fan of Olay, since I was about 20. I really love it, and for a man.. it&#x27;s a great thing with all the shaving and scrubbing of my face on a regular basis. I find that this \\&quot;[[ASIN:B000EBZ7XK Olay Regenerist Eye Serum, .5-Ounce Bottle]]\\&quot; is a great choice as it is FRAGRANCE FREE and does a great job of keeping my face looking fresh and clean after a shave or after washing. I am in my mid thirty&#x27;s now and get I&#x27;D&#x27;d at the store, and if I&#x27;m on a bar.. I can be sure that I will get carded. I think alot of this has to do with this product, (and clean living of course, ) and I say give it a try. I use it after I shower in the daytime, and again after I shower at night. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, goes on light and absorbs in. Good stuff, great product in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> This eye cream had good reviews so I tried it.  It&#x27;s nothing special but then most eye creams can&#x27;t take wrinkles away anyhow.  I just bought wrinkle twinkle and like it better.</li>
            <li> The pump mechanism on this little bottle clogged up on the first week of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I unscrewed the cap to get to the contents inside the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for  a couple of days in this manner, I developed a lower eyelid left eye infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not 100% sure this product caused my eye infection, but I never get eye infections, and perhaps by being forced to open the container, I inadvertently introduced bacteria into this nutrient rich product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am not going to purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I recently began using the goodguide.com to find out just how good (or bad) the products I use are for my health, the environment and their social record. I was saddened to find that Olay is still testing on animals.  I have been a vegetarian for 12+ years and I guess I have been naive to believe that I could just use products I have been using most of my life with no consequences to animals...boy was I wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream works good and going through Subscribe &amp; Save this price is unbeatable...unfortunately I will no longer be buying any Olay products because 1) they test on animals and 2) most of the ingredients in their products are \\&quot;fillers\\&quot;, which have no benefits they just work to bulk up the cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this because one of the blogs that i read recommended this. I apply this eye serum  religiously day and night. Not only is this really cheap for an eye cream, it is better than all the other brands i have used which are far more expensive. Not only does it feel good when I put it on, it also absorb quickly and after a bottle, my lines were reduced, my dark eye circle was a lot lighter.  definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this is one of the few eye creams that I can use. it&#x27;s a great product--I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for years.  I liked the pump container at first--no lid to unscrew--but it wastes a lot of the product. I&#x27;ve found myself slicing the container apart so that I access the last few ounces.    I can&#x27;t understand why so many beauty products, especially those for use around the eyes, are full of irritating perfumes. They are so bad for the skin. i didn&#x27;t develop my sensitivity until my 30s, but I&#x27;m told that it&#x27;s something most people will eventually develop. It&#x27;s just a matter of time.</li>
            <li> This item is so tiny, it looks like it&#x27;s a sample! Are you kidding me? What a joke! What a rip-off!</li>
            <li> I have very normal skin and I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to anything else before, but after one application it appeared that red ants had attacked the skin surrounding my eyes.  It took a couple days for the skin to return to normal - Aveeno&#x27;s anti-itch cream really helped.  I will say that I notified the Olay company and within less than a week they had returned my purchase price without me mentioning it.  So I&#x27;m impressed with the company itself, just not this product.  At this point, I&#x27;m thinking my face ain&#x27;t so bad.  But then red, swollen and puffy wasn&#x27;t any kind of improvement.  Users beware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product non-stop for a while now and with great results. Not only is this really cheap for an eye cream, it is better than all the other brands i have used which are far more expensive. This product also does not sting my eyes or make them red even though im usually sensitive to eye care products. It keeps the skin around my eyes soft and supple without large wrinkles or imperfections shining through. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Olay Reginerist Eye Lifting Serum is a great product, especially for fine wrinkles around the eyes (they will actually go away after faithful use). It&#x27;s a very small bottle, so if I&#x27;m out on dry days and want protection around my eyes I just put the bottle in my pocket and dab on a drop of two when I&#x27;m feeling dry. This is essentially the same product as the Olay Professional Prox &amp;#34;eye restoration complex) except that it costs half as much. It has a great consistence and I think you&#x27;d like it.  FYI these are both excellent, but neither is as good as ROC&#x27;s Retinol Correxion Sensitive Eye Cream. The ROC is a much stronger product and start with it once a day, use sparingly, go to morning and evening applications and you will see results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. After several bottles, all is the same. Don&#x27;t lose the time or money on this product. Keep looking</li>
            <li> which would be around 20 years.  It absolutely works.  I know this how? you ask.... Because I have had numerous people (probably close to a hundred over the years, and three in the last month alone) assume I&#x27;m 25 years younger than I am.  The latest one was the cashier at a big box store where I bought the only bottle they had left since I was almost completely out.  She asked how long I&#x27;d been using it, and when I told her, she said, &amp;#34;Well it&#x27;s obvious it works great!  I will be buying it myself from now on.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product keeps one&#x27;s eye area moist and soft, preventing that &amp;#34;crepy&amp;#34; look.  I&#x27;ve never had any odd reactions to any of Olay&#x27;s products, including this one - and I usually have issues with products from companies such as Clinique, Elizabeth Arden, and Estee Lauder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY good buy for the money, and really works!</li>
            <li> In my quest to replace overly expensive department store skin care products with over the counter \\&quot;quality\\&quot; cosmetics, I discovered this product.  I like it very much.  The key is to keep the eye hydrated.  Nothing is going to reverse the signs of time unless you opt to go under the knife which is not my thing. I have inherently dark circles and no product will magically erase these no matter what they say.  It&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t take care of with a little make-up, good sleeping habits, diet, exercise, sunblock, and water. This serum goes on smoothly and and apprears to be fragrance free (a fragrance is ALWAYS a deal breaker for me).  I use this night and day and love the way it feels.  My concealer goes on nicely after applying this serum which is not always the case with other eye creams.  This is a great product and does what it should.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Olay seems to not work for my asian medium olive skin tone. I read many great reviews about Olay&#x27;s product and this will be my last buy from them. I see no difference and don&#x27;t feel any difference.</li>
            <li> Product is nice. of course I cannot yet tell if I appear much younger, but it feels great, and I don&#x27;t worry about putting it on my eyelid (some other products are not very clear about this). So, it general I use Olay products, because they do not test on animals, and have many of the same type of products that other (animal-tested) products do.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying $55-60 for Lancome eye cream so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I&#x27;m not impressed.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate into my skin well and I don&#x27;t think it does much to diminish my fine lines.  Most alarming are the dark circles that seem to be returning under my eyes.  I guess you do get what you pay for with under eye creams and I&#x27;ll be returning to Lancome eye cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Eye Lifting Serum for about a month.  I like the non-greasy formula and the ease of application.  However, I have not seen noticable benefits as it mentions a complete turnaround.  Perhaps I was expecting more in the eyelid and area between eye and eyebrow.  I do have &#x27;drooping&#x27; eyelids and hoped that this would firm and tighten this area with out surgery.  So far, I haven&#x27;t seen that kind of result, but intend to keep using for at least 12 weeks.</li>
            <li> Did not irritate my eyes, but did not really reduce puffiness or wrinkles. It is a decent product for its price.</li>
            <li> Nice product but it&#x27;s so frustrating that the pump bottle stops working when there&#x27;s still a lot of the (expensive) serum in the small bottle.  You have to cut the bottle in half to get the remaining serum out.  They need to design a better bottle and/or dispenser.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream/serum I plan on wearing.  It does not swell my eyes out and drift into them as I sleep.  I always said I would never wear eye cream and that they were a waste of time.  Once I found Regenerist Eye Serum, I was hooked.</li>
            <li> Found the serum smooth and easy to apply. Have used others, but this I found to be the best.  Would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I love Oil of Olay products.  I have been using their facial wash and regular moisturizer for years.      I received a free sample of this eye serum and was so impressed!  I&#x27;m 46 years old and the area around my eyes was very dry.  I had tried other products, but they made my skin break out.  This serum makes my skin feel very smooth and silky.  People are always guessing me to be years younger and I think I owe it to Oil of Olay.      It&#x27;s  a little pricey and the bottle is very small, but you only need a small amount.  It lasts me about 8 months.  I make sure I never run out.  This is good stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a great eye serum. I am beginning to realize that you can&#x27;t go wrong with anything Oil of Olay!</li>
            <li> Great product! I have used it for years and am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way smaller than I thought it would be. However, my mom says it works great so I guess that&#x27;s why it cost what it did for such a small package.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s really done much.</li>
            <li> I have noticed quite a difference since using the Eye lifting serum by Olay.  I am 68 and my eyelids are drooping.  This seems to be helping quite a bit. I have only had this for a few weeks so if that changes I will let you know,....</li>
            <li> Feels very oily and doesn&#x27;t really seem to have the &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; effect desired.  May be a good moisturizer, but that wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> This used to be available locally but no longer is--at least in our area so I&#x27;m very glad it can still be ordered through Amazon. Great moisturizer for area around eyes, doesn&#x27;t blur vision, also works well for removing eye make-up. Good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Received product in a plain white envelope. Nothing was in envelope but product. There was no seal, no box, no plastic wrapingon the bottle, bottle read follow instructions on box (NO BOX). Afraid this day and time to use it. Tried to return it but there are NO RETURNS on this.  All other Amazon products I have ordered have been good, just not this one.</li>
            <li> Nice eye cream - can&#x27;t beat the price. Seems to be working well - a little to early to tell. I did some research and this seems to be the most bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> love the product, do see a difference in my eyes.  I&#x27;ve notice a reduction in fine lines (crows feet)</li>
            <li> Nothing amazing....Don&#x27;t see any difference when using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this since it contained excellent ingredients. Also, my 94 yr old grandmother alwasy used OLAY and she did nto have wrinkles.SHe looked 67, and olay is all she ever usd sicne she was younger. I feel firnming and see lesseing of lines around my eyes!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I highly recommend it to all.  I love all Olay products but especially the Regenerist Serums and night cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in wrinkles but it&#x27;s about as good as any other nice eye cream out there, good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> First time user of this product.  Not sure how effective it is around my eyes, I have only been using this product for less than a month, will wait &amp; see how effective it is before I make a judgment call.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Hoping to find an eye cream that would not irritate my eyes. Olay is a good name so I tied it. Irritating. Now I just use it as face cream</li>
            <li> Love it, but doesn&#x27;t last long. There&#x27;s not a lot in here, very tiny. I have to take the top off and scrape the insides to get product out.</li>
            <li> I found this serum to be nice and it does help. It takes much longer to show lasting effect and with such a small bottle&lt;br /&gt;It can take more than it says. With dry skin it didn&#x27;t last long but I did like the serum.</li>
            <li> Not so sure I see any progress/eye lifting, but no new lines!</li>
            <li> This is great eye cream.. I have tried alot and when I come back to this I always see a difference in my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive eyes..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like other brands, not a bad product at all!</li>
            <li> I have this on auto-ship, LOVE IT!!!!  This is the best price around and the eye serum is the best!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I ordered it in the tube, and it came in the older pump bottle. It&#x27;s frustrating to not receive what you order, especially when they specifically give you the choice.  Doubly irritating because it&#x27;s too much trouble to return with no confidence that you will get the correct item next time. The pump bottle makes it difficult to actually use all of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to this product. However, it goes on smoothly and adds much needed moisture to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Olay hit the nail on the head with this one! Great for the dark circles under my eyes, great for reduced redness and puffiness- just overall an excellent product. The only downfall is how quickly you run through the bottle. It&#x27;s great but it never lasts me long enough to feel like it&#x27;s a great price for the size. I found retinol cream to work just as well on the &#x27;normal&#x27; days of puffiness. For about 60% of the price, too! ([[ASIN:B009WK0M6G Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 oz. + FREE St. Ives Renewing Collagen Elastin Advanced Body Moisturizer Gift Set]]). The stuff works the same as Olay, doesn&#x27;t upset the skin, and comes in a larger package which is important for someone like me who needs it all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying ditch the Olay- by all means, keep it around for the heaviest of days, but using the retinol cream regularly and the Olay only in extreme circumstances is working well for me. The combo saves my skin and my wallet!</li>
            <li> Great product! I always love my Olay products and use them faithfully! I am very particular about my eyes and making them look their best. This works for me!</li>
            <li> absolutely horrible.. it actually makes my eyes more wrinkly. waste of money</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect miracles to happen when it comes to eye cream, and this is no exception. It is , however, very mosturizing. I put it on morning and night. Does not sting or irritate my eyes or surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> Very good product - not greasy, but rich.  I love the container, which is so much better than a pump bottle.  It allows me to use all of the product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for long but I am noticing a difference.  I wish the bottle was bigger considering the price tag.  But, it does seem to be making a difference and I like that the serum is not greasy and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> this product seems to work well, the area around my eyes looks a bit more lively now than before with regular use of this product.</li>
            <li> I tried product after product until I found this one. I buy it on Amazon to save money -- it&#x27;s $22 at Target and grocery stores. I&#x27;ve been buying it consistently for 5 years and would be at a major loss if it were ever discontinued. I wish they sold larger bottles though. Each bottle lasts me 3-4 weeks of daily use (in the mornings usually.)</li>
            <li> The product itself is just fine - not too expensive although it emptied out really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, since I used the \\&quot;Subscribe&amp;Save\\&quot;, and I thought this could SAVE me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it was true when you made your first order. Then, unlike what I thought that I locked the price of the item, NO WAY.  When my 2nd subscription came (the price charges went up), and then 2 days AFTER I received my pack the price wend down(-10%)...I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s equal to say I overpaid (+10%)on the order just arrived or not, but at least I realized when it&#x27;s time for my next scheduled order I could be charged at any price...Think of that! You&#x27;ll be out of control on those charges going forward once you placed a \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; unless you keep tracking it closely and constantly change your delivery time or cancel your subscription... If you have the time it might be a deal!!! But so the opposite: you thought you save 15% then you invisibly lose 10% if not more as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND, if you buy more, you don&#x27;t want to risk.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and gentle with my skin, but those are the only good things about this product.  The serum did nothing to make my eyes look energetic, soft, or lessen the bags under my eyes.  I went by guidelines with getting adequate amounts of sleep, drinking water, staying away from sodium etc.. no change.</li>
            <li> Really seems to help with lines and puffiness . . . . I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!!!  I alternate between this and the red ProX by Olay!!  They both do the job . . .</li>
            <li> Olay is primarily the only facial product I use.  The eye lifting serum works great, I use this product in the morning and at night before bedtime.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this yet says the results are visbible in 6 weeks so I am only 2 into it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin. This product moisturizes well while reducing puffiness and fine lines over time. It doesn&#x27;t smear into your eyes either. I would recommend this for anyone wanting a moisturizer that can be worn under makeup and yet still sensitive enough for the eyes. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this product has transformed my eyes, but I suppose it&#x27;s not a bad product as eye creams/serums go - it seems to work ok.  My beef if with the packaging.  I&#x27;d been more accustomed to the little tub-shaped containers of eye cream, but thought a pump might be a good idea - boy was I wrong!  It would work for a day or two and then, I&#x27;d have to pump it 30 times to get a little, tiny spit of product out!  I turned the nozzle every which way, I shook it, I tried everything possible, but the pump was incredibly inconsistent (if it worked at all).  Finally, I had to pop the top off - I have to dip product out with the other end of the pump - not exactly how it was designed, but that&#x27;s the only way I can use this stuff!    I like a product I can use without a struggle so needless to say, when this is empty I&#x27;m going to try another eye cream - don&#x27;t know which yet, at this point it could be any brand, just as long as it doesn&#x27;t have a pump!</li>
            <li> I found this eye cream to be only OK as compared with other total effects products which I use regularly (daily moisturizer and night cream I give 5 stars). What I really do not like is the little bottle. When the bottle stopped pumping I thought the cream had run out very quickly. It turned out there was still plenty of cream in the bottle. I had to pound the bottle on the counter to make the cream drop to the bottom so the pump pumped. That worked for a while. When it stopped pumping again and sooner than I expected I got out a serrated knife and cut open the little bottle and there was at least 1/4 to 1/3 of the cream left in the bottle. Kind of a clever way to get you to buy the cream sooner than when it really runs out. I no longer buy this cream.</li>
            <li> I like the design of the container. I like the pump because one has better control  when applying the cream.The cream comes out easily and does not put out more than one needs.I have sensitive eyes and have not had problems with the cream accidently getting in my eyes, if I rub my eyes.I don&#x27;t really know if it really gets rid of my crow&#x27;s feet but it moisturizes very well. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I like Olay products. It&#x27;s proven. I recommend this product to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I want to order more from Olay like this but it says that the shipping is not available in my country.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the formula changed when the packaging changed, but I liked the &#x27;old&#x27; version better.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to give me enough moisturizing elements to keep my under eye area hydrated.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ahhhhh. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d ever use an Olay product, but I&#x27;m finding more and more that the Regenerist line is great.&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream really feels moisturizing.Being over (mumble mumble) those darn crows feet are starting, and this Olay eye serum feel smooth going on, makes your eyes look great, even under make-up. Dig that this in a tube, so there&#x27;s no using the new pumps which are showing up... so you waste an undetermined amount of the product. Serious bummer right?.&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is the best eye product I&#x27;ve tried. Believe me, I DO have a facial products graveyard heh. This Olay eye serum will never be resigned t that fate.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for any age. Not just mature skin.</li>
            <li> I see a few reviews that mention having an allergic reaction after using this product.  I bought it last night and used it exactly as the directions called for.  Woke up with ugly, puffy, red, dry, itchy spots all around both eyes!  Terrible. I tossed this in the trash and will think twice before buying more Olay products.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job of reducing puffiness under my eyes.  I use it morning and night and can see the difference in the morning.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference in the skin around my eyes - I&#x27;ve been using this at night for five months now... It&#x27;s an ok moisturizer, but I haven&#x27;t seen any firming or lifting effects at all.</li>
            <li> Did not work. did nothing for my under eye fine lines.. Don&#x27;t waste your money. the  formula is different each time you get it. Sometimes it works, buy a new one and it don&#x27;t work. some formulas are stronger than the others</li>
            <li> Slow seeing results but I like it.</li>
            <li> This product arrived as expected.  Neatly packaged and once I use this product the first week, I noticed the dark circles and puffiness disappearing.  I also am happy that this product gives my eyes a youthful appearance.  I am very satisfied with this product.  Will invest future purchases as this is an amazing product.  All you do is apply it around the eyes twice a day and the results were satisfying.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks so don&#x27;t know about long term benefis. It feels nice going on and absorbs well. Time will tell if I buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum because it keeps my eyes looking youthful. Amazon.com is a good source to turn to purchase this eye serum. I found that the price was almost the same as buying it in a retail store. The shipment was quick. Will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that I really like this product. I never had much use for eye creams except to keep the corners of my eyes from drying out, but a few months ago I thought I would make more of an effort to look better so I tried a real eye cream. Wow! It actually made me look less tired and puffy! Also, I have very sensitive eyes and this is one of the few products I have tried that doesn&#x27;t cause them to sting and water all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is the packaging. Even if the little tube doesn&#x27;t break off the dispenser (which may be my fault but seems to happen a lot), it stops dispensing product way before the bottle is empty. I get at least 2 weeks worth more by using a Q-tip to extract the remaining stuff. Anyway, I guess the fact that I keep using it despite this inconvenience shows how much I like it.</li>
            <li> Olay a great product.</li>
            <li> I use this morning and night. Can&#x27;t say I see much difference but it does go on smooth and a little does go a long way. It&#x27;s a decent product but not a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and continue to be impressed with its quality and effect--very smooth and light; easy to apply.</li>
            <li> quick and convenient way to get personal items</li>
            <li> Good buy &amp; nice product....thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum. You hardly have to use any and it feels so soft and smooth on my eyes. It works great!</li>
            <li> it works,great condition, reasonable price, arrived on time, skin feels tighter</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my ugly dark circles. It didn&#x27;t sting my eyes though, unlike other products.    Has a strong fragrance, too strong, in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> This was a great price on Olay Regenerist Eye Serum.  I pay $14.99 for the store brand and to get the original brand for less than $10 is truly great.  The product is great too.  My eye lines look so much smoother and younger.  I highly recommended this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommends this product so I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  The price is amazing especially on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not sure why P&amp;G thinks it is necessary to manufacture this in China, then ship it all the way to the US.  Garnier, Estee Lauder, and multiple other providers of similar (and sometimes superior) product are able to continue manufacturing their products in the US and Canada.    I&#x27;ll find another product that isn&#x27;t made in a country that time and time again has proven to NOT be trustworthy with respect to production standards and safety, whether it is baby formula that killed many babies because it was bulked with melamine, toys that contain lead paint, or this eye cream - who knows what production standards and ingredients were REALLY used.  I&#x27;m quite frankly afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> I like the product. This is do small tnat i ran out in two weeks rather than the whole month. I will not re-order. Expensive and small.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars but the pump went out before the product was out. I use it for upper lid as well as below the eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright.&lt;br /&gt;I think it helped but I didn&#x27;t see dramatic change.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it should be used a lot longer than just one bottle but I don&#x27;t want to have something as a daily routine for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try for few months and see the results, it maybe more positive than mine. ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had estheticians comment about how nicely the skin around my over-50 eyes is retaining its tone. This product really works.</li>
            <li> Ok,  I have used other products that seem to work better.</li>
            <li> I like this, it&#x27;s my little secret weapon. :)</li>
            <li> I am a 68 year old Mother of 5. I have very good skin for my age. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old an I have under-eye bags which to me, make me look much older.  If I had the money, I would have considered  cosmetic surgery to have them removed.  I have always trusted Olay products since my mother used them who is now in her mid sixties.  I saw the Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum here on Amazon and due to the great price, I bought it.  I can&#x27;t believe my eyes!  Literally!  My swollen under-eye bags have gone down an amazing amount, I look like I did more than 5 years ago!  I am wearing less eye make up now and I am receiving many compliments!  I would not think of cosmetic surgery now, I don&#x27;t need anything else for my eye problem.  Thank you SO MUCH Olay!!  We all get old sooner or later, yes, but if I could age more gracefully, which now I can, I am one happy woman. :)  Thank You!</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the product I received.  I have been buying this product for many years and I received the Olay Regenerist Eye Listing Serum, but it was in a tube rather than the original pump container. And the listed ingredients were not the same.  The product in this new packaging is inferior and not as creamy and absorbing as the original in the pump container.  I feel like I was &amp;#34;switched and baited&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 3 weeks ago and my expectations were rather low. But this product works very well for me!</li>
            <li> Works OK result cannot be seen until you use it for a long time. I used it for 3 weeks and did not saw any real difference.</li>
            <li> Always like the Olay Regenerist product line and recommend it. It&#x27;s comparable to the ridiculously priced department store brands at a much better price.</li>
            <li> just started using this. Love the product and the way it goes on. Time will tell!!! not greasy and does not leave a heavy feeling</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product...both times hoping.J was.purchasing Olay original eye serum. Both times it has dried.and irritated.the area around my eyes and on the lids. This.isthe. second product.olay has changed. I have resorted to going.to another linr since.I can no longer rely on Olay.</li>
            <li> My eyes water a lot due to allergies, which dries out the skin right around my eyes. This is one of the few moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all and keeps my skin soft and moist all day. I apply it after each time I wash my face -- once in the morning and once before bed.</li>
            <li> I really like this and had it on my subscription but now they have taken it off of the subscription list so that made me sad!</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist Recommended a Drug Store Eye Cream!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s so I always get sucked into the &amp;#34;anti aging&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;stop wrinkles before they start&amp;#34; slogans. We all want to do everything we can for our skin, but with all the marketing schemes out there it&#x27;s hard to tell what moisturizers are really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, do we really need to slather on caviar onto our faces? I&#x27;m a sucker for a skin care product, but I wanted to get the facts about whether we needed to spend a lot on fancy eye creams or not. I have a really good dermatologist, so I consulted him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He told me that Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum was one of the best out there. Now, it&#x27;s one of the pricier ones in the drug store -- but you can get the eye cream for right under $20. I put it on and it feels awesome. I&#x27;d say it was a relief to know that my dermatologist recommended this, and not one of the $50+ eye creams that you see in Sephora with all those fancy ingredients.</li>
            <li> Well, how aggressive can a little bottle of eye cream be, really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(ba-dum-PSSHhhhh! thanks folks!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously - this is a good daily eye cream (I also apply at night).  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker like some of the more hardcore offerings out there, but it will tighten up tired looking eyes a bit and definitely helps with wrinkles over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I&#x27;m a guy.  See also my review for &amp;#34;Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream Facial Moisturizer&amp;#34; - these two are my regimen, and they seem to work.</li>
            <li> ITS TRUE, ITS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE TRIED AND WILL CONTINUE.  ITS DEWY AND ALSO RETAINS THAT DEW AROUND THE EYES FOR A VERY LONG TIME WHICH, AFTERALL, IS EXACTLY WHAT WE AS FEMALES WANT...NO MATTER THE AGE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only speaking from my personal experience of using this product. I used it for about a month and it made my eyes more puffy! My lower eyelid experienced spasms from using it and my eyes also became very watery.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, I have developed what I would call bags under my eyes. I have tried a number of products to reduce the swelling and discoloration. This product seems to be working although slowly. The puffiness under my eyes seems to be reducing, and the dark circles are getting lighter. Nothing will work miracles, but this has been the most effective remedy that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I use this as my daytime moisturizer. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency, &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; pretty quickly for make up application and has just enough little gold highlights to make the eye area pop. I hope Olay makes this forever and ever.....</li>
            <li> Love the product! Just started using it a week ago and I&#x27;m addicted I want to give it 5 stars but I&#x27;m waiting to see how it affects my face long term. I noticed a remarkable difference in my eyes after the first use, which is rare for a lot of products! I have combination skin and this one was perfect for me, didn&#x27;t dry me out or leave me too oily and that happens with a lot of products I&#x27;ve tried. This one is actually true to it&#x27;s word it firmed my eyes a little no more crows feet ... okay there is still some but they&#x27;re very minimal and they were hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;ve only been using this product for one week and i&#x27;m totally satisfied with it! It&#x27;s a little pricey in store -- so I wish I would have bought it online first because it&#x27;s noticeably cheaper. I will update my review at the end of this bottle to let you know if I still love it or if anything has changed! So far, so good. I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after researchin other similar eye creams and finding it highly recommended.  I have been very pleased with its results, which have been better than more expensive creams.  I don&#x27;t think there is a product that can take all the wrinkles away,but this ones does a good job.</li>
            <li> My wife had a horrible reaction to this product -- terrible redness, tight skin, almost shell-like.  She is still recovering from it after 2 and a half weeks.  We investigated (too late, alas) and discovered that this product has one of the worst toxicity ratings in the entire industry -- full of chemicals that are banned from cosmetics in many countries.  We discovered that there were literally hundreds of similar experiences and posts over the Internet.  If we had seen those reviews first, she could have been spared much agony.</li>
            <li> No where on the label or box is this product listed as hypoallergenic.  Many can expect allergic reactions.  Look for a product that is hypoallergenic if you know you are sensitive; that your eyes become irritated easily.</li>
            <li> Amazing serum. Received super fast and great price!</li>
            <li> The new version of this product has given me rough red itchy patches all around my eyes! I had previously used this product for years with excellent results until they changed the packaging AND the formula.  I had a lengthy conversation with Olay customer service today and the rep confirmed that in order to improve the formula they added &amp;#34;sodium peg seven olive oil carboxylate&amp;#34;.  The new ingredient must be the culprit.  I also asked the rep if there was an Olay eye product I could use that didn&#x27;t have this new ingredient and she recommended the Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Roller. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll try it or opt for something from a more natural line of products.  BTW, I&#x27;m certain it was this product as I eliminated every other possible product one by one.</li>
            <li> The right product at the right time. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Ordered the tube and received a bottle but same product. I will order again it is a wonderful product I like it.</li>
            <li> very nice! I love it!</li>
            <li> This product, along with every Olay product, works as promised. I am very happy with it and think I will likely continue to use it! I have always had extremely sensitive skin -- I react to products that are supposed to be hypoallergenic, too -- and I have a hard time finding products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin. However, Olay products are always gentle but effective and have never given me any trouble -- and this is no different. Just know that this particular one is more of a sample size. I didn&#x27;t realize that when I was ordering, but that was my fault. I just wish I had ordered more because I like it so much! I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The new formula doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the moisture this product provides. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not the fountain of youth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll finish out the tube but I&#x27;ll probably ask for my money back on this one.  The recommendation is to do all of your moisturizing and then your serums.  If I put this on over the moisturizer, it&#x27;s super shiny.  If I put it on by itself, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very moisturizing.  If I put it on under my moisturizer, the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t sink in.</li>
            <li> My thirsty skins soaks this right up, erasing fine lines.  I use a bit more at night.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye cream! I&#x27;m in my mid-sixties and live in a very dry climate. This cream is emollient without being greasy. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> soft - spreads well - tiny bit needed - appears to do the job so far.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference (yet) but I like the smooth feel of this serum and how quickly it soaks into my eye skin (eyelid and under eye).  I&#x27;ve read very good reviews and reports on this product, so I will keep using it.  What&#x27;s not to like?  It&#x27;s not excessively expensive but it smooths your skin and feels great!!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan if all Olay products, this one included.  This product really made my eye area smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> But stars off because of the packaging.  There is plenty of fluid left in the container when it ceases to pump.  The lid is hard to remove so it&#x27;s very hard to use all the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works for me but I may switch to something else because it&#x27;s just too hard to use when the supply is low.  I&#x27;m sure there are others just as good with easier to access product.</li>
            <li> I would say this is a good product.  I use it twice a day and I do feel a general tightening in the overall eye area.  Also an improved softness in the upper lids.  Its worth a try if you need a little lift in the area.  If used in conjunction with Eye Derma Pod, the skin will improve drastically in a few weeks.  Its a little pricy for the size of the bottle, but its Olay so that&#x27;s not a surprise.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Oil of Olay!  I use it and it really works well especially the eye formula!  I also make certain that my mom gets it for every gift giving occassion along with her other goodies.  This makes for a thoughtful gift just by itself as well.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at the look and feel of the skin around my eyes.  I am 69 years old and thought nothing could change the crinkly look around my eyes.  What a nice surprise. This eye serum is wonderful.  Anytime one my age can find something that really works this well it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Works great!! And was delivered right away</li>
            <li> Have been using this for awhile and love the lightness and the great job it does around my eyes. My skin is extra dry around my eyes and this product seems to nurish the skin and keep it smooth. Lasts a long time because you use so little of it.</li>
            <li> I like the way when you are applying it, you can see you skin naturally lighten up.  The bottle was a trial size, which was fine; since I was testing it out.  It seems to be lighting my under eye dark blemishes, not covering them up.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Good quality. Good bargain. Would recommend and do business with again.</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup person.  This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> I tried this Eye Lifting Serum because I read so many good reviews about it and it would help with crows feet; but, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I didn&#x27;t see any change with my fine lines and crows feet.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I know that Olay continues to bring out new, more advanced products all the time, but I have sensitive skin and will react to new products more often than not.Ladies, its maintenance, and if you want to look your best, than you gotta find a routine for a product, such as this. I also LOVE getting this from Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save, as its saves me money and is always there when I run out. What a convenience for me. Never chasing down a product, since I forgot it the last time I was out running errands.</li>
            <li> What i liked about the product is that it was really light. Its been about two weeks since i&#x27;ve been using it, and i have seen a little lightening of my dark circles. I am hoping long term use will help eliminate them completely.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. blends in nicely and lasts all day, Great price too, quite affordable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this one for a few years and have tried a few other pricier eye cream and eventually decided to stick with this one.  It&#x27;s not expensive and it works.  No miracle but it does help my eyes look younger by lifting the eye lids.</li>
            <li> Love this product it keeps the eye area moisturized and I could see a difference in the firmness around the eye. Also worked great with my makeup . I have tried expensive eye creams, I&#x27;m so happy I found this it works for me and saves me money.</li>
            <li> I have a great extra use for this eye serum - I use it on top of my makeup!  Lately I&#x27;ve seen some wand type highlighting products for a pretty high price and I smile that I already have a perfect highlighter with reflective mica that is treating my eye area.  After applying makeup (usually mineral, but sometimes a touch of stick concealer) I dab a tiny bit of regenerist eye serum under each eye and blend lightly.  It adds a subtle bit of light to the area and keeps my makeup from settling into any expression lines throughout the day.  I&#x27;m 48 and I have very few fine lines and no crows feet and I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  (Along with sunscreen)  I need almost no concealer and I used to carry it with me.  I agree with the majority of reviewers about this gentle but effective cream.  It has proven ingredients but nothing harsh like retinol or hydroxy acids which could be drying or cause peeling.  I intend to keep using it and have a subscribe &amp; save for it.  I&#x27;m sharing this review so the demand will keep Olay making this great product for a long time to come.  I have added their pro-x eye for the last 22 months at night which I think has helped keep the area smooth.  Now if I could find something this good for the &#x27;11&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount under my eyes to soften the wrinkles and it lasts all day, but I do not put any powder or make up over it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it&#x27;s too expensive on the grocery shelf. They offered a product I love at a really fair price. It arrived early, too.</li>
            <li> I received the old formula in the old packaging:-(  Great formula. Used it successfully for several years. But I like the new formula even better and expected to receive that, since it was featured in the photos and description.</li>
            <li> If the proof weren&#x27;t right on my face, I wouldn&#x27;t believe it myself. I just used this for the first time about half an hour ago and I can&#x27;t see my crows&#x27; feet anymore. I don&#x27;t have enormous crows&#x27; feet - I&#x27;m fairly young, but they&#x27;re enough to make doing my eye makeup difficult sometimes. I can&#x27;t wait to see how this works on the bigger lines on my lower lids. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now, and it works!!!  It lifts as much as a non-surgical method can do!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the hype..not all that and very thick. .u fight with three quarter&#x27;s of it stuck in the little packet. ..hard to get out...save it on something else.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised.  I would recommend it to my frirends.  Service was excellent. Product arrived quickly and was as ordered.</li>
            <li> I am using this as a preventative maintenance, as I do not have wrinkles. However, similar to what other reviewers say, the packaging is terrible! There is so much product left in the bottle. I did a brief experiment where I cut the bottle in half after I thought the product had run out (since the pump was just bringing up air)...interestingly enough, there was still a ton of eye serum left in the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also tinted, which I didn&#x27;t realize when buying. It&#x27;s a yellow color, which was almost too dark for my eyes, so I only used it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be cautious when buying this product! It might work great for others though!</li>
            <li> Since I started using the Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic reduction of the lines and wrinkles around my eyes.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.  Thank you Amazon.com and your partners for offering a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> The product is good. I agree with another review, that said the price is a bit steep for the amount you get, considering it isn&#x27;t an awesome product. Would order again though.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product is being discontinued or not, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores for a while.  I&#x27;ve not liked similar products as well as this eye cream.  This is not irritating or drying to my eyes.  Will order online until I can&#x27;t find it anymore.  This has become a typical move for me these days.  A lot of the time I do not like the newer, better version of products and most companies are &amp;#34;upgrading&amp;#34; their products so rapidly.</li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t expect miracle eye creams/serums, plenty of sleep + healthy life style is the key. I do, however, believe in prevention. I have been using eye cream since my 20s.&lt;br /&gt;Olay Regenerist series received many good reviews. That&#x27;s why I bought it in the first place.This eye serum, with slight tinted shade, is very smooth that gets absorbed easily. I applied it twice in the morning and before bedtime. It does keep my eyes moisturized and feel very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I like the packaging as well, do not have to worry about it being oxidized after opening like those stored in a jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and honestly I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin or eyes.</li>
            <li> As I have reviewed other Oil of Olay products that I have purchased here and department stores I can never find anything bad to say. Good products and good prices. This does the job for me and I don&#x27;t expect any product to restore me back to what my skin was like in my 20&#x27;s. I&#x27;m realistic. Oil of Olay products are my favorites.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Have been using 1 week and see an improvement for such a short time period</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to lose 25 years on my face.  Just wanted the product to do what it&#x27;s name implies.  It didn&#x27;t.  I know that this type of product is going to react differently on each person. Maybe you&#x27;ll have a different experience with it.  it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 2 is that it might work on someone whose eyes are not as sensitive as mine.  I&#x27;m not sure that it &#x27;lifted&#x27; or tightened my eye area, but given the fact that it is irritating to my eyes, I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin. Over the years nothing worked well This product is great.  I Love it! Not greasy and conditions eye area.</li>
            <li> Wife ordered noted product without realizing how little .5 ounces was!  Appears as though she likes the item and if it works, future orders might be initiated.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time and it seems to help with the sagging of my eyes, I like this product and would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love olay regenerist im 32 and its helped my skin and my adult acne has pretty much disappeared. I got this for my mom and from a few days after she started using it her eyes turned bright red; looked like she had pink eye in both eyes. She stopped using this product and her eyes went back to normal. She gave it to me to use but after looking into all the allergic reactions- i am going to toss it in the trash!!</li>
            <li> very good for the eyes..</li>
            <li> Nice light under eye serum.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  I love it.  I can definitely tell a difference when I use it.  My crows feet seem diminished.</li>
            <li> I used this product and it caused swelling, redness, and itching in the area around my eyes that it was used. I gave the product a break and then tried it again to see if it was the cream or another issue, and the issues resumed when I went back to using the cream. I developed a rash on the area where the skin itched around one of my eyes. My mother also tried using this cream and experienced the itching. Fortunately, she was able to avoid the rash! I&#x27;m still waiting for the swelling, rash, and itching to go away. Reading through the reviews it looks like this allergic reaction to this product is common. Avoid.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product! I have very dry skin, this eye serum goes on very easily. So glad that Amazon makes it so easy to purchase it.</li>
            <li> this eye cream works better then the department brand eye cream! I actually have noticed less lines around my eyes. No more wasteing money on expensive eye creams.</li>
            <li> Love this product...however, this particular one is not what I received.  I wanted this one with dropper top for easy application.  I think what I received was an older packaging model?  Disappointed.  But found what I wanted in a local Walmart.</li>
            <li> Adds moisture and masks the heavy lines from age and dryness; time will tell on its effectiveness but right now it is thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Ive used this for years, it has kept me from getting those dark circles under my eyes...the rest of my family has them because our eyes are deep set. I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> This product works as well or better than the expensive creams.  Stop paying for their advertising.  Don&#x27;t expect a miracle, but it beats a face lift!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I don&#x27;t like the packaging of the serum itself.  There&#x27;s no way to get the last 1/4&amp;#34; or so of product out of the container without prying off the top and digging it out with some kind of implement that will fit the bottle&#x27;s opening.  That&#x27;s wasteful and irritating.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of eye creams and they had all irritated either the delicate skin around my eyes or migrated into my eye and caused a burning sensation within my eyes. Olay doesn&#x27;t cause either of those issues. A little bit goes a long way. I can&#x27;t say that I have seen any results yet (it&#x27;s been about two weeks) but at least this is one eye cream I can continue to use to see if it will soften those lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I tried this because Amazon made it so cheap; I had never used an eye lifting serum before.  It did pretty well!  It&#x27;s not going to lift all of the wrinkles around my eyes at 58 yo, but it smoothed them out and gave my eyes a kind of glow I never had before.  It didn&#x27;t cause me to get a rash, a concern I had, since most everything does give me a rash (I&#x27;m half Scottish!).  So, yes, I give this 4 stars, it made me think about trying other serums as well.</li>
            <li> Lives up to the promise.</li>
            <li> Used this until it was gone just because I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money.  I&#x27;m only 29 and decided I would start looking for an eye cream to use for the rest of my life.  This is not the one.</li>
            <li> As a woman in my upper 30s I&#x27;ve noticed dryness around the eyes as well is fine line wrinkles starting to set in.  Oil of Olay regenerist eye serum has helped by moisturizing the skin around the eyes, tightening and diminishing the wrinkles.  While some products can run close to a hundred dollars or more, for the price the product does deliver.  Also, product goes on smoothly and does not sting.</li>
            <li> Im 32 yrs old and used it for 6 months but didnt really see any changes. I dont know if immsupposed to use it longer or i have to be in my 40s to use this.</li>
            <li> My wife spent a fortune on eye serums , but never was she so pleased with the look and feel of the skin around her eyes.She is usually allergic to even the most delicate creams, but not to this serum !&lt;br /&gt;We highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Was good while I used it but now I am using Meaningful Beauty, which I believe is much better.  Now bad for the price, though.</li>
            <li> Most beauty products make promises of less wrinkles, etc.  This eye serum can truly make those claims.  After years of using this product I have fewer visible lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes and does not leave a greasy feeling.  You only need a little drop so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Product review summarized in the title complete a a a a a a a a a a  a a a a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 5 years and have found it to be better than the more expensive brands like Lancome &amp; Estee Lauder. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands as well, but none have come close to Olay Regenerist. It&#x27;s not only helpful in reducing lines and wrinkles around my eyes, it&#x27;s soothing and helps to get rid of puffiness too. My 50+ year old eyes look closer to 40, which is why I hope they keep making this. And with my Amazon subscription for regular deliveries, I get more before I run out, at the best price!</li>
            <li> Fantastic price, and fast shipping</li>
            <li> great product, smoothes the lines around the eyes and mouth.  only complaint:  does not last long enough for the price and any liquid left in bottle is hard to get out!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I like a couple of other Olay products, but was disappointed in it--first, with the tiny amount. The tiny bottle comes secured in a box much too large for it. (No one would buy it at that price if the box were just large enough to hold the bottle.) Second, after using all of the product, I couldn&#x27;t tell I&#x27;d used it.  Waste of money which I won&#x27;t repeat.</li>
            <li> Most of the anti-aging eye products are loaded with ingredients that burn the heck out of my eyelids. My left eyelid was almost non-existant due to a childhood dog bite. I know that someday I&#x27;ll have to get an eye lift, but insurance is funny about approving surgery untl the lid interferes with my vision. So, I&#x27;m using this. keep in mind that this is a very small bottle ( despite a big box).  I ran out for a week. ACK, and am now keeping an extra on hand.  I never want to run out again.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to this stuff. It took me a few weeks to figure out that this is what was causing it. I had this odd reaction in my jaw. The jaw muscles tightened up and caused pain when I bit down.</li>
            <li> Picture shows new packaging, the item I received was the older packaging &amp; shape so clearly older stock.</li>
            <li> I was swayed by the rave reviews regarding this product.  I&#x27;ve decided that those reviewers must own stock in the company and are attempting to drum up sales.&lt;br /&gt;This did absolutely nothing for me and it didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> really much larger than expected:)  What a great deal!</li>
            <li> I have used this product as a regular item in my skin care regime for years.  It is okay.  No magical changes or improvements, just a solid, reliable moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product helps to take away the wrinkles around the eyes and on the eyelids.  It is a great product and I plan to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 12 months and am so impressed with the results.  Eye area is smooth and hydrated.  Fine lines diminished.  Will use again.</li>
            <li> have been using this for two months, the skin around my eyes hasn&#x27;t changed. But my eyes start to feel uncomfortable, hard to keep them open. Went to see a doctor, my tear gland got blocked by using this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product love how you can subscribe and get even a better deal this is a very good product will continue to have it automatically sent to my home with is great price and quick service.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with the new formulation of this eye cream. I had it on auto ship. I had no idea the packaging was changing, let alone the formulation!  This has been my go to eye cream for nearly 8 years. I don&#x27;t know what happened when they redesigned this, but it&#x27;s junk now!  Just awful. It almost feels like an eye shadow primer, not a cream! It is supposed to be hydrating, but I find myself putting it on 3 times before bed, yet I still fell like my skin is dry. AWFUL!</li>
            <li> I Love It - very effective - not greasy - very pleased with the results and I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of days so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye serum before on Amazon and it did wonders for me. People tell me that I look well rested and not tired like I used too. I also use it before I go to bed and I have to say the dark circles look as if they are diminishing. I will continue to buy this product because the price is well worth it and it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used stupidly expensive eye products from department store counters (Clinique, Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder, etc) and this is as good if not superior to them at a fraction of the price. Although it is available at Walgreens and Target stores, the price is much better through the auto ship program. I save at least $10 from what it costs locally.</li>
            <li> Love the product.. Great Price</li>
            <li> It does give my lids a little lift . Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t sting like some do .</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two weeks now, and only at night. (During the day I use Olay Eye Regenerating Cream With A Touch Of Concealer, which I like very much.) The serum makes the skin feel soft, but it does not feel moisturized for some reason. Rather somehow crepy. It gives the skin around my eyes a very shiny look, and I imagine it must take some doing to make eye makeup actually look good with this shine going on. Since I only use it at night I can&#x60;t really say. I will finish the bottle, but then go back to my old ROC Retinol Correction eye cream, which I have been using for ages. I don&#x60;t have any wrinkles around my eyes, which speaks for itself I think.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I ordered based on reviews after buying another Olay product.  It does what it says.  I have problems with eye serums irritating my eye area.  This doesn&#x27;t do that.  Got my sister hooked on this now too.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes my skin feel nice.  Waiting to see if it really works or not on lifting and hiding lines/wrinkles</li>
            <li> I use this product morning and evening.  Sometimes I skip the evening.  I believe this product helps me.  I don&#x27;t really pay to close attention.  I also use other products (lotions) on my face.  Most of them oil of olay.  I do look young for my age. People comment on my skin looking good.  Olay regenerist feels good when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Good price and good product!&lt;br /&gt;I have had a  allergy problem with similar products from other companies . This one works well and does not cause a allergy problem.</li>
            <li> nice feel and seems to be showing results</li>
            <li> I just got this serum and haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell if it will work miracles or not (I&#x27;m hoping it will!). I was rather taken aback at the size of the bottle (and yes, I know how much .5 Fl Oz is) - it&#x27;s smaller than the sample bottles I used to get with Shiseido products. Of course, you pay through the nose for those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a fan of the Olay Regenerist line - they are excellent products that are generally quite affordable. So, I&#x27;ll let you know in a month if I look ten years younger :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update March 9 2014***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I said I&#x27;d let you know if this miracle serum works miracles. It&#x27;s a lovely soft cream that leaves the area under my eyes feeling very nice. I wish I could say I look ten years younger, but sadly that is not the case (ok, maybe FIVE years younger!). The teensy bottle I got a couple of months ago won&#x27;t pump out drops anymore, but I can pull off the cap and get enough to work - probably for another couple of weeks. I&#x27;m not sure I will buy it again - I was thinking of getting [[ASIN:B003RF82RI Garnier Skin Renew Anti-Dark Circle Eye Roller, 0.50-Fluid Ounce]]....same size, a bit more money though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wanted to say though is that for me, the Olay Regenerist line is wonderful - I  have been using this combo: [[ASIN:B002UUT39M Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Micro-Purifying Foaming Cleanser 6.7 Fl Oz, (Pack of 2)]], [[ASIN:B001F51TR2 Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub 6.5 Fl Oz (Pack of 2)]], [[ASIN:B003MJ7Z0O The Original Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz.]](not Olay but a really good deal!), the eye serum and [[ASIN:B0000536P3 Olay Total Effects 7-In-1 Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer 1.7 Fl. Oz., 1.700-Fluid Ounce]]- and it has made a huge difference in the look and feel of my skin. It&#x27;s very soft and smooth - I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my skin lately. The products are priced very reasonably so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m sending money swirling down the drain every night when I wash. The only problem is that my adult daughter keeps &#x27;borrowing&#x27; my face stuff and I have to keep hunting it down in her bathroom!</li>
            <li> The item was exactly  what I ordered and was happy to receive it so promptly!  I tried it as soon as I  got it and love it!</li>
            <li> I like this eye lifting serum very much.; Stands true to claims. Does make my skin under my eyes moisturized and reduces looks of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Have used for several years.Pricing is very good. I have it on autoship and never have to worry about running out or catching a sale.Cheapest place to buy where I am is Wallyworld. Even on the rare sale there-the best price is still Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for the eye area, especially on sensitive skin.  It does not cause any allergic reactions and helps aging skin look better, too.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am very elderly and wrinkled around my eyes.  That was distressing....&amp;#34;was&amp;#34; because Olay&#x27;s eye regenerist product has&lt;br /&gt;cleared away all of that!  I no longer have crows&#x27; feet at my temples, no under-eye circles, no eye-lid redness.  A week and&lt;br /&gt;one half after applying the product each night....and, again each morning was all I had to do....well, a few words of&lt;br /&gt;encouragement to the tiny tube before I squeezed it probably helped.  Happy lady!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite eye cream!&lt;br /&gt;much much better than chanel, rancome, or estee lauder.&lt;br /&gt;will purchase this again in the future!</li>
            <li> I use this serum twice a day.  Before applying my makeup and at bedtime.  The serum is a bit greasy so it takes awhile to absorb into the skin.  It is not very expensive, but, still pricey and would be more worth the money if it came in a bigger size.  The amount in the bottle doesn&#x27;t last all that long. I do see a visible improvement of very fine lines. I ordered two and when I&#x27;m finished, might go with neutrogena eye serum instead.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  It gives a definite lift, but in addition, it leaves a clean and tight surface to apply makeup.  Product came very quickly an is used daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a month straight and don&#x27;t really think it does anything. Maybe I have false expectations.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any effective results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see that it is any better than any other kind of eye cream.  I use it anyway to help keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Yes! i like it very much , I uses this brand several years , and i will buy again, thanks!</li>
            <li> Been using this for over a month, night and day. Unfortunately, haven&#x27;t noticed ANY change whatsoever. Totally regret spending the money on it :/</li>
            <li> I really like this eye serum, and find it far more effective on my crepey upper eyelids than other more expensive products (e.g., Perricone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is supersensitive, so finding nonirritating products is especially difficult for use around the eyes. This one never bothers me -- thank goodness! When applying, you might want to keep well away from the edge of the lid, both to avoid getting it into your eye and to keep your mascara and eyeliner smude-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay is sold in drugstores, but often they are sold out or have it in a locked cabinet you need to find a clerk to open for you. Ordering through Amazon is a lot more convenient and actually cheaper (esp. if using Prime).</li>
            <li> Very affordable eye serum to use before eye creme.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this with the Olay microsculpting creme and I am way more satisfied with this than the creme.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs really well and I could tell the difference in my skin color aroun the eyes when used with eye creme.&lt;br /&gt;The only minus was the container.  I hope this came in a tube or a pot.  Kind of hard to get to the bottom of the product.&lt;br /&gt;But very satisfied and will purchase again! :)</li>
            <li> Caused irritation and swelling around eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Buy if it you already used it before or if you are sure that it will not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this and other products as my daily regiment for the past couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;It is effective, yet inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I recommend not wasting your money on this one it didn&#x27;t help, and it is such a small container for the amount of money. I love oil of olay but not this one.</li>
            <li> I love the product but DON&#x27;T USE THE IMAGE OF THE SQUEEZE TUBE WHEN YOU SEND IT IN THE PUMP - I HATE THE PUMP.  With the pump, after you use about 1/3 you have to bust it open and get out the rest with a Q-tip. It&#x27;s stupid. The squeeze tube is perfect. When you use the squeeze tube image for the product SENT IT IN THE SQUEEZE TUBE!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to start taking better care of my eyes and have read that Olay products are very good.  Product seems to be working pretty well - my eyes seem litter and smoother every time I use it.  However, you have to use it every day to see the effects.  Overall, very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Regenerist Eye Serum for years with great results.  However, the new formula caused chemical burn-like symptoms on my eye lids.  Swelling, peeling, itching, redness.  Very painful. I called Olay and received less than satisfactory service.  Not at all happy and looking for a new product line.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Have used others and this is not as harsh (dry flaky skin around eyes).&lt;br /&gt;Need to use every day for results</li>
            <li> This was probably one of the most infuriating products I&#x27;ve purchased from Oil of Olay; and I routinely buy their products.  I&#x27;m not even sure if their product actually works, because after just a few uses, the pump to the container fails and you can&#x27;t get to well over half of the remaining product inside.  And when I say you can&#x27;t get to it, I mean it.  You can&#x27;t unscrew the top; it&#x27;s attached.  So the only way you can get past the faulty pump is to try and cut away at the heavy plastic (nearly impossible without gashing the bottle, your fingers and the product inside...making a considerable mess).  This happened to me on 3 separate containers (I kept wondering if it was just the \\&quot;one\\&quot; bottle...it wasn&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;Until this company changes the container that they use to deliver this product, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Been using faithfully since 03/16/2013 and no improvement.  The box did say I would notice a change in two weeks and I am not seeing it, so would not really recommend this</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle like the other reviews claim.  Its oily, and it runs into my eyes, even when I apply it very sparingly.  It burns like mad, and I end up rubbing and wiping my eyes with tissue.  Not a lot of fun.  I&#x27;ve stopped using it.</li>
            <li> This eye cream despenses just the right amount and feels good going on.  Does it do what it says; who knows?  Product arrived timely and as described.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Like this product and as stated I feel it does softens lines around the eyes.  I would probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> It just did not do nothing for as discribed.... I will never order it again!!! I just do not have time to send empty bottle back ..</li>
            <li> This eye lifting serum truly works. You will see and feel a difference in your skin about 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m working on this one.  At my age it&#x27;s going to take a miracle to do any eye lifting so I can&#x27;t give the product a bad rating even though it will take some imagination to see any improvement.</li>
            <li> This is a decent eye cream but nothing special.  The one thing that I find very annoying is that when the pump stops dispensing product there is at least two weeks worth of product left in the bottom of the bottle.  Just remove the cap and scoop what you need with a cotton swab.  Can&#x27;t help but wonder if this is deliberate on the part of the company to make customers replace the product sooner!  Hmmm....</li>
            <li> Worked ok. Feels nice but really didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li> For me the Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum works immediately.  For under eye puffiness it works!  I don&#x27;t know how it works but just know that it does.  I have re-ordered it when I get near the bottom of the bottle.  A tiny bit is all you need for each eye, smooth it on and the puffiness is diminished or just disappears.  It works for me and reccommed it highly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
            <li> It is perfect. Light and non greasy. It does the job.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and while the packaging is new, the results are just as great as with the original packaging.</li>
            <li> I had great expecations for the product, but after application, my eyes itched.  Thus I had an aleregic reaction to the product.  Just be careful when using.</li>
            <li> much easier to use than the little pump bottle.  Handy to travel with also</li>
            <li> My favorite eye serum. Masks little lines and moisturizes without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Thanks you. A great product. I have always enjoyed using Olay skin products, specially the Regenerist moisturizer for the face.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum to help preventing new wrinkles. As a girl of 23, I didn&#x27;t think its time to put on eye cream until I noticed there a light wrinkle under my left eye. Did a lot of research to find a good quality eye cream with acceptable price and found a video where it said that this cream was recommended by most dermatologists. On the other hand, there were good reviews from my friends for L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift Complete Anti-Wrinkle &amp; Firming Moisturizer Eye Cream, so I decided just buy both of them and compare the result afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put Olay cream on my left eye due to its recommendation by dermatologists and L&#x27;Oreal cream on the other before I went to bed. In the next morning, I noticed there was a difference between the two eyes. My right eye looked much better than the left one, which means L&#x27;Oreal cream works better than Olay. I felt a little disappointed and even unbelievable since Olay cream was more expensive than L&#x27;Oreal one, and it was recommended as well. Even though I cannot deny the fact that Olay did a good job on my eye, not to compare with L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT work. Do not waste your money on a .05 ounce bottle of magic potion about the size of a thumbnail.  Normally, I love Olay.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the best product I have ever used, but it isn&#x27;t the worst product I have use either.  Worth a try since everyone&#x27;s skin is different</li>
            <li> After a visit to the dermatologist for a botox consultation, and being informed that my particular set of wrinkles wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be alleviated by botox to the extent I was looking for, I thought I&#x27;d purchase some eye cream and see if that helped. I&#x27;ve used lotion on my face for most of my life, but never an &amp;#34;eye cream&amp;#34;, so I was initially doubtful at the benefits this would provide beyond my regular regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 5 days of using this product, I can say that I will continue using it indefinitely. The smile lines around my eyes are noticeably lessened by quite a bit and, while I could be happier (a product that completely removed wrinkles and smile lines would be nice), this product far exceeded my expectations for what could be accomplished using a dedicated eye cream.</li>
            <li> This product exceded my expectations.  As someone who has sworn by the L&#x27;Oreal products, I was skeptical to change.  I had noticed that the fine lines in my face were becoming more prominent and that the L&#x27;Oreal products were not delivering anymore.  I read in a magazine that this Olay product was highly recommended and thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon was also $5 less than at CVS!</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT: Works well if you are looking for light moisturizing. Has a nice light, creamy feel (NOT oily, NOT greasy)...and absorbs quite easily into skin. (I suggest reapplying under-eye after an hour or so, for more prolonged moisturizing.) DELIVERY &amp; PRICING: I had this ordered through Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save...ordering 10-12 per year! Unfortunately, Jeff&#x27;s braniacs took this VERY HIGHLY RATED product (and some other Olay items) off of Subscribe &amp; Save, cancelled my standing orders, and moved the products to PrimePantry. I&#x27;m not about to pay $99 for Prime per year, PLUS another $5.99 per PrimePantry shipment. I can buy it cheaper and more conveniently at Walmart stores. ANYONE ELSE experiencing this shortsighted Amazon tactic with Olay and/or other products?</li>
            <li> This serum works very well, with nightly applications I have seen an improvement in the fine lines around my eyes over the past two months.  I always buy Olay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles but I got this serum to hydrate the under-eye area. In just 2 days I actually saw fine lines forming under my eyes! Thinking it was something else, I used the product for another 2 days. My under-eyes started looking really haggard and a bit puffy! As soon as I stopped using the product my skin started returning to its normal state. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just make you shine and swell for sometime. I through mine in my unused item box to give away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using this proactively (I&#x27;m 25), but I do have some wrinkles forming, but I don&#x27;t know if this product is honestly helping me at all.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with my dark under eye circles or my wrinkles that are beginning to form (crows on sides, fine wrinkle underneath eye).  I&#x27;ll probably be trying another product to see if I can see a difference.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 years and am currently age 63.  I have also used some other products in between.  Olay products work well, are affordable, and are easy to get your hands on.  They are available just about everywhere.  I use the eye serum at night before bed and in the morning before leaving for work.  I find this product lifts my lids slightly, firms, and brightens.  It is absorbed nicely around the eyes.  Remember to dot cream around eyes and massage in with small, light circles.  Do not pull on the sensitive skin around your eyes.  I also include any crows feet when I moisturize around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, did not notice much of a difference, except I did not have to use the deep hydration regenerating cream in that area.</li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist Eye serum does a good job of smoothing the crow feet of my eyes.  It also keeps some of the puffiness away, but not altogether.</li>
            <li> I liked the smooth, creamy feel of this serum but saw no &#x27;lifting&#x27; or improvement under my eyes. I have tiny wrinkles/creases under my eyes and this product did nothing to reduce or &#x27;lift&#x27; the lines. It did NOTHING for my dark circles either. I had to cut the pump with a knife when it was getting low. I strongly suggest buyers do this rather than throwing the bottle away when the pump fails to pump any cream out. There&#x27;s TONS of cream on the bottom that the pump simply can&#x27;t reach. Olay needs to change this feature because if you don&#x27;t cut the top of (which is no easy feat), you waste A LOT of product. I prefer the ROC products for undereye wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is OK but the dispensing pump, based on multiple purchases over a long period of time, consistently fails to function properly, meaning I pump and pump and shake and shake nothing comes out.  And this is when the bottle is new and supposedly full.  I&#x27;m often forced to pry off the cap, which doesn&#x27;t screw off, in order to use the product.  The company either has terrible quality control or a total disregard for its customers, especially considering that this is not a cheap product.  I will have to look for a new cream.</li>
            <li> Bought this for like 2 months and I don&#x27;t see any changes on my crows feet ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always pretty skeptical of these type of products, but I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, and my skin under my eyes looks noticeably better! Will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> No difference. I&#x27;d rather use some retina-a around my eyes and a nice moisturizer. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll make much more difference in terms of firming than this product.</li>
            <li> NO effect at all. come one - are you serious? NO effect at all. yes it is cheaper than better brands, but at some point event $1 is a waste if it does not work.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the packaging had been changed from the small pump bottle to the tube that is pictured because there is so much waste with the pump. Alas, the picture is not that of the product. The product is good, the packaging wasteful. I would have bought it from my regular drug store if I had known.</li>
            <li> The product of this brand, I ordered a second time and I&#x27;m not disappointed. At first use I saw the result. My skin around the eye began as a child. This cream is very nourishing the skin. I&#x27;m 42 and I have one little wrinkle eye, which began to diminish. The skin around the eyes is more taut. I recommend to all.</li>
            <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t work, I am male, Asian 22 years old, one day I lost my Dermalogica Multivitamin power firm  so I bought this cream, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything, my handsomeness suddenly gone,  . I have nasal trouble so when i sleep, I was deprived of Oxygen, so I looks older than I should, Dermalogica Multiyitamin power firm eye cream is my savior, I looks incredibly handsome, before I couldn&#x27;t even look at me in the mirror, but now I am so happy and confident because of my face,  and it takes only 3 days for the difference. I am not affiliate with Dermalogica or anyone, but I think I should do something for them to completely change my life.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is a waste of money, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This serum is excellent around the delicate eye area. Not greasy, not heavy, just right. Prevents lines, premature aging, and dryness. My go-to beauty product. I use one per month. My only wish is for more in the bottle. I use two pumps per night, and by the end of the month I run out!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any improvement of spots, as advertised. If anything I used it as a daily under-eye moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I do like how light of a cream this is.  Goes on smooth and leaves my eye area soft.  As for as lifting and fine line magic.  Well I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and can&#x27;t say I see a huge difference.  Not that being said I don&#x27;t see things getting worse either LOL  If only I&#x27;d been more proactive about these things in my 20&#x27;s when I felt invincible and apparently didn&#x27;t see the need for anti aging products...</li>
            <li> Better than nothing.  It really didn&#x27;t penetrate my dry skin like I had hoped.  It wasn&#x27;t bad, just not what I was hoping for.  It is a nice consistency and has no fragrance.  It might work better on other types of skin.</li>
            <li> When they changed the packaging, did they change the formula???  I have pinpointed my swollen, red, itchy skin around my eyes to this product.  I do not have sensitive skin and never had allergic reactions before.  This product is definitely going into the trash!</li>
            <li> as good if not better than any more expensive and esoteric brands I have tried. Only use fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Good price; shipped promptly; as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love it and I&#x27;ve been using it for few months already... is a must have! Acquired it in Bjs before but at the end this product is shipper here. I will definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.  I real.ly love this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. When I have stopped and used something else is when I really noticed a difference. It really does keep eyes looking younger and brighter.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this eye cream. It really hydrates the eye area well. I have only been using this product for about a week, and have started noticing a difference. I also have these little bumps under my eye which are starting to disappear. I will continue to use this product and can&#x27;t wait to see more results.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the bottle it comes in, I don&#x27;t like the pump. I have a hard time getting it out, and sometimes I have to take the top off to get some out which is really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great eye cream, try this one. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product but the bottle is too small and it&#x27;s too expensive. Overall though, I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day. Goes on like a charm and has really worked to brighten the skin under my eyes in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> does moisturize but lift not so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting around to us it, but so far, it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my purchase, and plan to keep on purchasing this item. It has already shown some improvement in the wrinkles I&#x27;m trying to get rid of, and with continued use, I am hoping to get the maximum results!!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff before my day and at the end of it.  It does indeed work.  Nothing is a miracle cream, but it does what is says:  Lifts, moisturizes, helps my eyes look less tired.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how small this was, you just don&#x27;t think about how much .5 oz is, but it does cover very well. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see a difference because I am in my 20&#x27;s, but I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to start early. I actually end up putting this on in the morning under my makeup because at night I find that it feels a little thick and my eye lids distract me with it on. Overall, I like it and it doesn&#x27;t smell annoying. Also, I have gotten some in my eyes and haven&#x27;t had any reactions.</li>
            <li> I do think it helped with bagginess and fine lines, and it may have slightly brightened my dark circles, but this product, advertised for sensitive skin, made my eyes water all day long. If I rub at my watery eyes and cause more darkness and inflammation kinda defeats the purpose. I have no idea if the neutrogena equivalent (healthy skin eye cream) will work as well for me cosmetically, but I can say my eyes aren&#x27;t watering like crazy.</li>
