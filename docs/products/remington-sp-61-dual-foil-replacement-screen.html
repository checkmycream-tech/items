            <li>Arrived before it was expected&lt;br /&gt;Installed easily and works perfectly</li>

            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better!</li>
            <li>excellent price and the product came exactly as described</li>
            <li>So glad I found these!</li>
            <li>I am going to order more!</li>
            <li>Now I just have to make sure the foil does not get punctured again!</li>
            <li>my screen broke before the blades were worn, and this fit my Remington and has worked great since, a quality product.</li>
            <li>screen quality is as good as Remingtons and maybe better.</li>
            <li>The price was fair and it shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and arrived in good order, so I am happy to purchase them again if they are available.</li>
            <li>This screen is cost-effective and it works perfectly in my trusty old Remington DA-307 shaver.</li>
            <li>and I think this is a good as the original.  </li>
            <li>The Foil fit my remington shaver perfectly, and works very well.  </li>
            <li>, happy it was a reasonable price . . .</li>
            <li>so I will be returning from time to time to get more when needed.</li>
            <li>This one replaced my last one perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love that amazon carries parts for things.  </li>
            <li>I will defenity purchace more in the furture.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite razor ever.</li>
            <li>Buying the SP-61 replacement screen is the better way to purchase the replacement parts for a Remington razor.</li>
            <li>it did just what i thought it would do, nice smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li>Of course they don&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li>Like this one better than the one that I was buying  the foils for.</li>
            <li>He loves the shaver all the more now.  </li>
            <li>It fits great and was a lot cheaper than buying a brand new electric shaver.</li>
            <li>means that I get a closer and more comfortable shave with&lt;br /&gt;existing razor heads.</li>
            <li>This screen might even be a bit better (smoother) than the original that came with the razor.</li>
            <li>Foil works/shaves fine.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>This was a quick replacement, no brainer!  </li>
            <li>Fits my razor just nicely and made the shaving experience much better than with the old worn out foil</li>
            <li>Cutters\\&quot; for $18.29 sold by: Amazon.com, LLC with free shipping, but even though it said on Amazon and on the package itself that it fits</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t totally fit my razor, and it pulls the hair out of my face.</li>
            <li>iT IS SUPPOSED TO FIT</li>
            <li>- IT DID FIT -</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit like a glove</li>
            <li>Fit the foil holder and clicked in.</li>
            <li>What I needed at a cheap price..</li>
            <li>The Remington Dual Foil Replacement Screen fit precisely on my shaver.  </li>
            <li>This replacement did feel a bit cheaper in the hand, but it works just fine as the original.</li>
            <li>Firstly let me say the seller was excellent - product arrived right away earlier than stated.  </li>
            <li>This appears to be an after market foil and not an original Remington foil.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very satisfied with my purchase and the price.</li>
            <li>It fits the shaver and works, though not quite as well as the original.</li>
            <li>It has returned the shaver to its original condition.</li>
            <li>When I mounted the screen on the frame, it was perhaps 1/20&amp;#34; shorter than the original ones I had,making it not click snugly into position, and slips inward when pressure is applied by the face to the mesh.</li>
            <li>Found this foil/ screen cheap, came quickly and it was just what I needed.</li>
            <li>Foil does not clip into head of shaver very well but otherwise works ok.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not bad once you understand this is where Remington makes it&#x27;s margin, and it&#x27;s designed as a disposable product.</li>
            <li>Part fit just right</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly, and are just what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Blades are flimsy, deteriorate quickly</li>
            <li>It is the exact fit for my razor.</li>
            <li>The shave now works as good as new at a fraction of the price of replacing the complete head assy.</li>
            <li>but when I first tried installing them they didn&#x27;t seem to fit quite right</li>
            <li>Most replacements cost much more, this just came in a small white box and it did the job so this a good cheap replacement.</li>
            <li>It slipped right in and just works.  </li>
            <li>I love my electric razor, looked for a foil/ screen replacement and wasn&#x27;t able to find one for anything less than $30, which was the cost of the electric razor.</li>
            <li>and I now again have a smooth shave and the shaver has a new lease on life.</li>
            <li>very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I do not know if it was an after-market model or OEM, but it fit and worked as well as any original I had purchased from a local store.</li>
            <li>I first ordered the:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was sent through the post office, first class mail</li>
            <li>They did fit and old micro 1 that I bought in 2001</li>
            <li>These fit my brand of shaver and have lasted over 3 years so far.</li>
            <li>Remington web site was much higher.</li>
            <li>i should have bought two more for back up</li>
            <li>Must be a cheap imitation of the original, likely offshore of the good old USA.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my first order for this replacement foil, and saved so much money.</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Although Remington does not tell you that the SP-61 can be used on the SP-62 razor, it certainly does.  </li>
            <li>The closeness of my shave before my last screen wore out was much better than this in new condition.  </li>
            <li>I have used one of these for a couple of months now and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li>this product came without any trouble and it came in a very neat and tidy package-will use in a shaver very well</li>
            <li>thanks&#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27;</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast by the way.</li>
            <li>This product is the real \\&quot;Remington\\</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It saved this razor from the landfill, at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I like them so much I have 4 extra.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I will buy more if needed in the future for my old razor.</li>
            <li>I do feel it takes a little bit longer to shave with this than with the original screen, but given the cost of the original manufacturer&#x27;s replacement part, that&#x27;s not a problem at all.</li>
            <li>I rated it as high as I did because it shipped amazingly fast</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more of them in the future.</li>
            <li>This screen was for an older Remington</li>
            <li>I think the cost is a bit high</li>
            <li>Such a relief after my original foil, which had developed holes and was letting the blades hit my skin.</li>
            <li>foil tearing?this is a great replacement.when mine fails im buying here again.</li>
            <li>As opposed to having to pay for the cutters when they normally don&#x27;t need replaced as soon as the screen.</li>
            <li>it is exactly the same screen i bought from cvs or walmart or whatever for around 20 bucks in the old days...fits like a glove and is most likely the very same mfg company as the &amp;#34;high priced&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I did not have to buy a new razor, and saved a bunch of cash.</li>
            <li>Made my shaver like new.</li>
            <li>Why pay for replacement cutter and screen when all you need are new screens.</li>
            <li>the tabs that snap in place to hold it in, didn&#x27;t work until I bent them with a small pliers, stays in now and shaves  OK</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with this new screen for a few months now and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Old Remington shavers never die.</li>
            <li>I wouldnt hesitate ordering again fast shipping overall</li>
            <li>It did not fit will I had to make it fit.</li>
            <li>This is a considerable savings.</li>
            <li>I checked the local suppliers and they wanted almost as much for the foil as I paid for the razor.</li>
            <li>Specifically, it works very well, and the cost of the SP-61 is only one-quarter the cost of a SP-62 foil or screen.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, the head snaps down to hold it to the body, but the cutter will probably wear it out soon from having contact.</li>
            <li>Whether you pay $20 or $120 for the shaver they all work about the same, and someday they will need new foil screens.</li>
            <li>you are not careful.</li>
            <li>It did not fit in to the head right.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to have pay for a complete head assembly since I&#x27;ve only had this shaver for about a year and only the screen was worn through.  </li>
            <li>Hard to get excited over this, but ....why can&#x27;t we buy stuff like this locally??</li>
            <li>It pulls, skips and takes me twice as long to complete my shave.  </li>
            <li>It was slightly different in design then the original which may mean they had a problem with the OEM foils and had to modify them.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous that these might not be the right screens for my razor since my particular model was not listed, although other models of shavers that were listed in other online stores shared the same complete head assembly part number.  </li>
            <li>Not sure which other razors it would fit.</li>
            <li>…but I think it will soon be time to get a new razor for these parts seem to be getting harder to find!</li>

            <li> I would certainly buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Although Remington does not tell you that the SP-61 can be used on the SP-62 razor, it certainly does.  </li>
            <li> The closeness of my shave before my last screen wore out was much better than this in new condition.  </li>
            <li> I have used one of these for a couple of months now and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li> this product came without any trouble and it came in a very neat and tidy package-will use in a shaver very well</li>
            <li> thanks&#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27;</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast by the way.</li>
            <li> This product is the real \\&quot;Remington\\</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It saved this razor from the landfill, at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I like them so much I have 4 extra.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I will buy more if needed in the future for my old razor.</li>
            <li> I do feel it takes a little bit longer to shave with this than with the original screen, but given the cost of the original manufacturer&#x27;s replacement part, that&#x27;s not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> I rated it as high as I did because it shipped amazingly fast</li>
            <li> Definitely will buy more of them in the future.</li>
            <li> This screen was for an older Remington</li>
            <li> I think the cost is a bit high</li>
            <li> Such a relief after my original foil, which had developed holes and was letting the blades hit my skin.</li>
            <li> foil tearing?this is a great replacement.when mine fails im buying here again.</li>
            <li> As opposed to having to pay for the cutters when they normally don&#x27;t need replaced as soon as the screen.</li>
            <li> it is exactly the same screen i bought from cvs or walmart or whatever for around 20 bucks in the old days...fits like a glove and is most likely the very same mfg company as the &amp;#34;high priced&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I did not have to buy a new razor, and saved a bunch of cash.</li>
            <li> Made my shaver like new.</li>
            <li> Why pay for replacement cutter and screen when all you need are new screens.</li>
            <li> the tabs that snap in place to hold it in, didn&#x27;t work until I bent them with a small pliers, stays in now and shaves  OK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this new screen for a few months now and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Old Remington shavers never die.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt hesitate ordering again fast shipping overall</li>
            <li> It did not fit will I had to make it fit.</li>
            <li> This is a considerable savings.</li>
            <li> I checked the local suppliers and they wanted almost as much for the foil as I paid for the razor.</li>
            <li> Specifically, it works very well, and the cost of the SP-61 is only one-quarter the cost of a SP-62 foil or screen.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, the head snaps down to hold it to the body, but the cutter will probably wear it out soon from having contact.</li>
            <li> Whether you pay $20 or $120 for the shaver they all work about the same, and someday they will need new foil screens.</li>
            <li> you are not careful.</li>
            <li> It did not fit in to the head right.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to have pay for a complete head assembly since I&#x27;ve only had this shaver for about a year and only the screen was worn through.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get excited over this, but ....why can&#x27;t we buy stuff like this locally??</li>
            <li> It pulls, skips and takes me twice as long to complete my shave.  </li>
            <li> It was slightly different in design then the original which may mean they had a problem with the OEM foils and had to modify them.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous that these might not be the right screens for my razor since my particular model was not listed, although other models of shavers that were listed in other online stores shared the same complete head assembly part number.  </li>
            <li> Not sure which other razors it would fit.</li>
            <li> …but I think it will soon be time to get a new razor for these parts seem to be getting harder to find!</li>
            <li> Besides, you can&#x27;t buy a new quality electric razor for less than $10 anyway.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a new Remington electric razor and after only 2 weeks I noticed there was a big chunk of the foil missing.</li>
            <li> These foils last a long time, i have been using mine for about 4 years and had to replace it when i dropped it and broke the foil piece.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll last so buy extras like I did.</li>
            <li> They dent too easily and they are a bit too expensive as replacements, but it beats throwing the razor away.</li>
            <li> Sadly the commercial market caters only to full product sales rather than product support through replacement parts</li>
            <li> and I was not very satisfied with it when Modifications were complete.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it to clip into the head because the aftermarket is just shy of engaging the side clips</li>
            <li> It took a few tries though and finally after pulling of the cutter blades and pushing them back on again the head finally clicked back in place.  </li>
            <li> Thought I only paid less than $3.00 a piece bought 3 or 4.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how long it would last since I have been using it for only less than a week.</li>
            <li> the DA-407, it did not fit, it was very different.</li>
            <li> If the foil tears your face is in deep trouble.</li>
            <li> It is a lot less expensive to replace this part than to buy new razors -- especially when you have multiple razors to replace!</li>
            <li> DOES NOT SNAP IN TIGHTLY</li>
            <li> Screen was tight to get in the cover.</li>
            <li> Made it though w/black bar bowed a little.</li>
            <li> It was either defective or cracked from the factory and broke away after a little use.</li>
            <li> I received foils which did not fit the razor.</li>
            <li> If you own a Remington shaver these things are a necessaru evil.</li>
            <li> It did not fit my razor well</li>
            <li> May have trouble getting it out.</li>
            <li> I returned it to Amazon, and was getting desperate for the replacement screen, since the old one was scratching my husband&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &quot; Screen--not the imitations I have been duped into buying from others in the past.</li>
            <li> I  think the real problem is that the the shaver is the problem - its crap.</li>
            <li> The shavers are no good without it.</li>
            <li> The foil part of any electric razor is very delicate.</li>
            <li> I guess it could be worse.</li>
            <li> I bought a Remington swivel head not happy at all with that.</li>
            <li> The foil of my shaver was broken, which made me to buy another shaver before I found this replacement screen.  </li>
            <li> I threw my razor away even though there was nothing else wrong with it.</li>
            <li> My shaver uses the foil as the cutting surface so this thin piece of metal as it wears could cut your face</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my father who loves the shaver but the foil was in bad shape.  </li>

            <li> Old Remington shavers never die. They just wear out their foil screens. Whether you pay $20 or $120 for the shaver they all work about the same, and someday they will need new foil screens. I&#x27;ve been shaving with this new screen for a few months now and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Hard to get excited over this, but ....why can&#x27;t we buy stuff like this locally??</li>
            <li> Foil works/shaves fine. Foil does not clip into head of shaver very well but otherwise works ok. This appears to be an after market foil and not an original Remington foil.</li>
            <li> They dent too easily and they are a bit too expensive as replacements, but it beats throwing the razor away.</li>
            <li> What can I say . . . . it works.  Gives me the shave I have always gotten using my Remington, happy it was a reasonable price . . . very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The Foil fit my remington shaver perfectly, and works very well.  I would purchase this product again, if I needed too.</li>
            <li> I first ordered the:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington SP-62 Foils and Cutters\\&quot; for $18.29 sold by: Amazon.com, LLC with free shipping, but even though it said on Amazon and on the package itself that it fits the DA-407, it did not fit, it was very different. I returned it to Amazon, and was getting desperate for the replacement screen, since the old one was scratching my husband&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this one, and even though the price plus shipping seemed steep, the package arrived in 3 days!!  I ordered it on Sat. morning, and it came on Mon. afternoon. It was sent through the post office, first class mail but they must have mailed it as soon as I ordered, and I am so happy with this company. I will order from eOutlets again.</li>
            <li> I ordered several of these, as I have two shavers which use these.  They arrived quickly, and are just what I ordered.  Great value,great price and service.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better!</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive replacement screen for my hubby&#x27;s razor!  Works great and so does having it sent periodically through Amazon so that he has a replacement waiting in case if he drops his razor and tears the screen.</li>
            <li> This replacement did feel a bit cheaper in the hand, but it works just fine as the original. These foils last a long time, i have been using mine for about 4 years and had to replace it when i dropped it and broke the foil piece. Most replacements cost much more, this just came in a small white box and it did the job so this a good cheap replacement.</li>
            <li> Item received as advertised</li>
            <li> I have used one of these for a couple of months now and it has worked very well. I do not know if it was an after-market model or OEM, but it fit and worked as well as any original I had purchased from a local store. It shipped quickly and arrived in good order, so I am happy to purchase them again if they are available. Sadly the commercial market caters only to full product sales rather than product support through replacement parts so I will be returning from time to time to get more when needed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> this product came without any trouble and it came in a very neat and tidy package-will use in a shaver very well</li>
            <li> The closeness of my shave before my last screen wore out was much better than this in new condition.  It pulls, skips and takes me twice as long to complete my shave.  Must be a cheap imitation of the original, likely offshore of the good old USA.  I didn&#x27;t get what I paid for.</li>
            <li> excellent price and the product came exactly as described I wouldnt hesitate ordering again fast shipping overall I give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> this is just what I needed&#x27; &#x27; &#x27;  thanks&#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; in the future I may ever need to order this again. . .</li>
            <li> DOES NOT SNAP IN TIGHTLY AS ORIGINAL.&lt;br /&gt;STAYS IN PLACE WHEN HEAD SNAPPED ON RAZOR, SO IT SEEMS TO WORK FINE.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE USED ALMOST DAILY SINCE PURCHASED. ALTERNATE SOMETIMES WITH ROTARY.</li>
            <li> I love my electric razor, looked for a foil/ screen replacement and wasn&#x27;t able to find one for anything less than $30, which was the cost of the electric razor. Found this foil/ screen cheap, came quickly and it was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t totally fit my razor, and it pulls the hair out of my face. I use it as my travel razor now. I guess it could be worse.</li>
            <li> I received foils which did not fit the razor. They did fit and old micro 1 that I bought in 2001 so I will probably see if I can get it running again.</li>
            <li> It did not fit will I had to make it fit. It did not fit in to the head right.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement.  Did not snap in and reinforcing, plastic divider bowed out.  Screen had holes in it in one week.</li>
            <li> My last screen was damaged during trasport. This one replaced my last one perfectly. It fits great and was a lot cheaper than buying a brand new electric shaver. Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> It is a good foil but it won&#x27;t stay fastened on the razor. I just have to put it back on each time I shave.</li>
            <li> The foil part of any electric razor is very delicate. The razor was dropped and the foil cracked.  I sent for a replacement as the razor works well but the replacemnt foil is 50% of the cost of the razor itself and is supposed to be replaced every six month.  I would think twice before buying another electric razor because of this.</li>
            <li> If you own a Remington shaver these things are a necessaru evil. The shavers are no good without it. I think the cost is a bit high but what can you say. Its either buy this product or another shaver. I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll last so buy extras like I did. It does the job</li>
            <li> Great product at a very good price!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. I do feel it takes a little bit longer to shave with this than with the original screen, but given the cost of the original manufacturer&#x27;s replacement part, that&#x27;s not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> iT IS SUPPOSED TO FIT - IT DID FIT - WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?</li>
            <li> Part fit just right and I now again have a smooth shave and the shaver has a new lease on life.</li>
            <li> I love that amazon carries parts for things.  It is a lot less expensive to replace this part than to buy new razors -- especially when you have multiple razors to replace!</li>
            <li> Excellent service. It is the exact fit for my razor. Now I can shave again and my wife is happy that I don&#x27;t look like a bum...</li>
            <li> Great transaction. Just as promised. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first order for this replacement foil, and saved so much money. I will defenity purchace more in the furture. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This screen is cost-effective and it works perfectly in my trusty old Remington DA-307 shaver. Definitely will buy more of them in the future. Delivery was fast by the way.</li>
            <li> Used this on my F2 and I think this is a good as the original.  Didn&#x27;t fit like a glove but it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li> Installation was a snap, and it fits and works perfectly on my Remington DA-307 razor. This screen might even be a bit better (smoother) than the original that came with the razor. I did not have to buy a new razor, and saved a bunch of cash.</li>
            <li> The foil is not a genuine Remington product, but it is just performing like the real one. I am not sure how long it would last since I have been using it for only less than a week. The delivery was on time. So far, I am very satisfied with my purchase and the price.</li>
            <li> Blades are flimsy, deteriorate quickly</li>
            <li> It fits the shaver and works, though not quite as well as the original.</li>
            <li> This item has the Remington name etched on the side same as the one I replaced. Fit the foil holder and clicked in. Gave a great shave. Made my shaver like new.</li>
            <li> These fit my brand of shaver and have lasted over 3 years so far. I would recommend these for the Remington shaver</li>
            <li> This product is the real \\&quot;Remington\\&quot; Screen--not the imitations I have been duped into buying from others in the past.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous that these might not be the right screens for my razor since my particular model was not listed, although other models of shavers that were listed in other online stores shared the same complete head assembly part number.  I didn&#x27;t want to have pay for a complete head assembly since I&#x27;ve only had this shaver for about a year and only the screen was worn through.  These screens looked almost identical but when I first tried installing them they didn&#x27;t seem to fit quite right and the head wouldn&#x27;t go back on.  It took a few tries though and finally after pulling of the cutter blades and pushing them back on again the head finally clicked back in place.  The shave now works as good as new at a fraction of the price of replacing the complete head assy. which seemed to be my only option.  The price was fair and it shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> works as it is supposed to. Fits my razor just nicely and made the shaving experience much better than with the old worn out foil</li>
            <li> So glad I found these! They work perfect. This is my favorite razor ever. I am going to order more!</li>
            <li> Buying the SP-61 replacement screen is the better way to purchase the replacement parts for a Remington razor. As opposed to having to pay for the cutters when they normally don&#x27;t need replaced as soon as the screen. This is a considerable savings.</li>
            <li> What I needed at a cheap price.. Remington web site was much higher. Received in minumun amount of time.. Good service.</li>
            <li> it did just what i thought it would do, nice smooth and close shave. i would definitely recomend this item to a friend</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t remember paying $12.95. Thought I only paid less than $3.00 a piece bought 3 or 4. I was only paying $20 for the shaver at Wal-Mart. Of course they don&#x27;t carry it any more. The foils did work. lasted about 6 months each. I bought a Remington swivel head not happy at all with that. Now using a battery (AA) travel shaver. Like this one better than the one that I was buying  the foils for.</li>
            <li> Why pay for replacement cutter and screen when all you need are new screens. Would buy this product again as needed.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  Such a relief after my original foil, which had developed holes and was letting the blades hit my skin.</li>
            <li> It does its job as intended. I can&#x27;t get it to clip into the head because the aftermarket is just shy of engaging the side clips (others have commented on this as well). Luckily, the head snaps down to hold it to the body, but the cutter will probably wear it out soon from having contact. I rated it as high as I did because it shipped amazingly fast and it basicly does what it should, but doubt the durability.</li>
            <li> It did not fit my razor well, I had to modify it some for it to work and I was not very satisfied with it when Modifications were complete.I threw my razor away even though there was nothing else wrong with it.</li>
            <li> foil tearing?this is a great replacement.when mine fails im buying here again. i should have bought two more for back up</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect.</li>
            <li> My shaver uses the foil as the cutting surface so this thin piece of metal as it wears could cut your face&lt;br /&gt;if you are not careful. If the foil tears your face is in deep trouble.</li>
            <li> This screen fits my electric shaver perfectly.  I already have a cutter so this saves me some money by buying the screen separately.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my father who loves the shaver but the foil was in bad shape.  He loves the shaver all the more now.  Shipment came as promised and in good shape.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and replacement for my razor. I will buy more if needed in the future for my old razor.</li>
            <li> The SP-61 Dual Foil Screen fits the Remington DA-307 razor perfectly.  It seems to be of very good quality.  It slipped right in and just works.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Screen was tight to get in the cover. Made it though w/black bar bowed a little. May have trouble getting it out. Hope not.</li>
            <li> Fit my R3mington DA-307 perfectly.  It saved this razor from the landfill, at a reasonable price.  Besides, you can&#x27;t buy a new quality electric razor for less than $10 anyway.</li>
            <li> This was a quick replacement, no brainer!  worked great no problem.  Now I just have to make sure the foil does not get punctured again!</li>
            <li> I bought this 6 months ago, but held off writing a review because I wanted to see if it lasts.  It did.  Get it.</li>
            <li> I like this product it was just what I needed I would recommend this for anyone I was really happy</li>
            <li> . The DA-307 was a disaster. This screen was for an older Remington</li>
            <li> I like them so much I have 4 extra.&lt;br /&gt;The screen quality is as good as Remingtons and maybe better.</li>
            <li> …but I think it will soon be time to get a new razor for these parts seem to be getting harder to find!</li>
            <li> As advertized.  That&#x27;s all I have to say but this fricki&#x27; site insists on a minimum number of words so here they are!</li>
            <li> Replacement Screen seems to be thinner and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;This means that I get a closer and more comfortable shave with&lt;br /&gt;existing razor heads.</li>
            <li> very good- quick delivery! thanks</li>
            <li> The Remington Dual Foil Replacement Screen fit precisely on my shaver.  It has returned the shaver to its original condition.</li>
            <li> Firstly let me say the seller was excellent - product arrived right away earlier than stated.  When I mounted the screen on the frame, it was perhaps 1/20&amp;#34; shorter than the original ones I had,making it not click snugly into position, and slips inward when pressure is applied by the face to the mesh.</li>
            <li> my screen broke before the blades were worn, and this fit my Remington and has worked great since, a quality product.</li>
            <li> The foil of my shaver was broken, which made me to buy another shaver before I found this replacement screen.  It works just fine.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a new Remington electric razor and after only 2 weeks I noticed there was a big chunk of the foil missing. It was either defective or cracked from the factory and broke away after a little use. I checked the local suppliers and they wanted almost as much for the foil as I paid for the razor. I checked on Amazon and found this seller who had a greatly discounted price and delivered it in good time. It was slightly different in design then the original which may mean they had a problem with the OEM foils and had to modify them. Regardless, the razor is working once again and I have had no further problems with the foil. I would certainly buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Arrived before it was expected&lt;br /&gt;Installed easily and works perfectly</li>
            <li> I buy these for my father-in-law.  They&#x27;re not bad once you understand this is where Remington makes it&#x27;s margin, and it&#x27;s designed as a disposable product.</li>
            <li> This screen fits my Remington DA 307 perfectly. I can only recommend it for that razor. Not sure which other razors it would fit. Sometimes the product description will say it fits your razor but it does not.</li>
            <li> Although Remington does not tell you that the SP-61 can be used on the SP-62 razor, it certainly does.  Specifically, it works very well, and the cost of the SP-61 is only one-quarter the cost of a SP-62 foil or screen.  That is like replacing a $24 dollar item with a $6 dollar one-an $18 dollar saving!</li>
            <li> this is the third screen i have burned thru.  it is exactly the same screen i bought from cvs or walmart or whatever for around 20 bucks in the old days...fits like a glove and is most likely the very same mfg company as the &amp;#34;high priced&amp;#34; days.</li>
            <li> the tabs that snap in place to hold it in, didn&#x27;t work until I bent them with a small pliers, stays in now and shaves  OK</li>
            <li> These only lasted 6 months.  I  think the real problem is that the the shaver is the problem - its crap.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed at a good price.</li>
    </ol>
