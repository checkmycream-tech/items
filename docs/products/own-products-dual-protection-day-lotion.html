    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>this moisturizer is what I have been looking for and is great!</li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>I then took it to my dermatologist and she was very impressed with the quality of sun protection.</li>
            <li>Very good for your skin--</li>
            <li>This is probably great for those with oily to combination skin, but if you&#x27;re skin is drier, you&#x27;ll probably need something else.</li>
            <li>I purchased the day lotion because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels amazing!</li>
            <li>excellent product, plan to try more of this brand.</li>
            <li>I tried it and loved the coverage of it.</li>
            <li>Own products makes a great mineral sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased to &amp;#34;OWN&amp;#34; me.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>&quot; The products are never greasy, never drying, just kind of nourishing feeling.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t think this was an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the idea of the product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>this is a terrific,non greasy, non pasty formula that is great under make up and offers truly what it promises- moisturizes and softens and benefits skin texture</li>
            <li>This is nice, light, effective, and so reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I love the consistency of this day lotion - smooth &amp; silky.  </li>
            <li>But Own products have consistently amazed me.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg, it contains no scary chemicals, and it smells subtly nice but not perfume-y.</li>
            <li>This does not and is perfect  with shea butter as the other reviews said, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well on its own.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for an spf moisturizer that is light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and spread smoothly on my face.  </li>
            <li>I use it after washing my face and applying serum/argon oil and the lotion clumps and takes awhile to smooth out.</li>
            <li>Such a great product, I use it every day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I switched to this product after trying the full range available for the face by Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this product and hopeful with the reviews.</li>
            <li>It is not real oily which is great for me because I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>And though I haven&#x27;t taken \\&quot;before and after\\&quot; pictures to compare, I really do think my skin looks better too.</li>
            <li>I would love for Own to come out with an even higher SPF version for those extra sunny days.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs into the skin, leaving it hydrated and healthy for the day - with all natural formulas to boot!  </li>
            <li>I love that this is a all mineral natural sunscreen but absorbs so quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a toothpaste feel like most natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li>leaves it feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>and though I thought it was nice, I didn&#x27;t think it was really noticeably better than other things I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My face really loves this stuff!</li>
            <li>I first received this product as a gift.</li>
            <li>This product actually appears to be making a difference in protecting my skin in more than one way.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion with SPF, but I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t do enough to moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li>so I pretty much use it when I&#x27;m going to be outside for any length of time; if I&#x27;m inside most of the day I use the night cream insteadâ€”which</li>
            <li>I am very particular about what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li>The whole thing needs improvement.</li>
            <li>The pump does not work very well.</li>
            <li>This is so much lighter and</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and protective --- but non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It does a very thorough job of getting all my makeup off, but is gentle with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The best way that I can describe it is that my skin feels like it&#x27;s had a badly needed \\&quot;drink.\\</li>
            <li>I love that it is organic, and although this product is wonderful, and I am addicted, I wish it were not so expensive.</li>
            <li>At first it required several pumps to get out some lotion; subsequently the narrow tube that connects to the dispenser top has disconnected so the only way I can get the lotion out is to remove the dispenser top and squeeze out the lotion.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more of a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I wear sunscreen everyday and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who always thought that there&#x27;s really no difference between skin care products, except in marketing, and maybe if you compare the quality of the very high-end ones to the very cheapest.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals snuck in -----</li>
            <li>I also really love the size of this product - small enough to travel with but</li>
            <li>It is more expensive than a lot of sunscreens, and I am very frugal --- but if your skin dislikes your sunscreen, you ultimately won&#x27;t put it on.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in my sunscreens as they are so effective, but they are so expensive.  </li>
            <li>Not horribly dry but definitely drier around my eyes and mouth.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been looking for an spf moisturizer that is light and not greasy. this moisturizer is what I have been looking for and is great!</li>
            <li> I like what is NOT in this day lotion:  parabens, sulfates, retinol, etc.  Like almost all lotions I&#x27;ve tried that contain SPF it&#x27;s heavier on my facethan I prefer, and so I pretty much use it when I&#x27;m going to be outside for any length of time; if I&#x27;m inside most of the day I use the night cream insteadâ€”which I LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is the tube and dispenser.  At first it required several pumps to get out some lotion; subsequently the narrow tube that connects to the dispenser top has disconnected so the only way I can get the lotion out is to remove the dispenser top and squeeze out the lotion.  The whole thing needs improvement.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Not greasy and spread smoothly on my face.  I like SPF 30 content as I use this as day lotion.</li>
            <li> I like the product but the packaging needs to improve.  The pump does not work very well.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion with SPF, but I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t do enough to moisturize my dry skin. This is probably great for those with oily to combination skin, but if you&#x27;re skin is drier, you&#x27;ll probably need something else.</li>

But Own products have consistently amazed me. The best way that I can describe it is that my skin feels like it&#x27;s had a badly needed \\&quot;drink.\\&quot; The products are never greasy, never drying, just kind of nourishing feeling. And though I haven&#x27;t taken \\&quot;before and after\\&quot; pictures to compare, I really do think my skin looks better too. I get compliments, anyway. On a whim, I once tried that super expensive \\&quot;de la mer\\&quot; stuff, and though I thought it was nice, I didn&#x27;t think it was really noticeably better than other things I&#x27;ve tried. This is. And it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg, it contains no scary chemicals, and it smells subtly nice but not perfume-y. Now I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need anything else.</li>
            <li> My face hates sunscreens, and I have tried them all. My face really loves this stuff! No harsh chemicals snuck in ----- Very moisturizing and protective --- but non-greasy. Leaves no shiny or opaque white film on your face  like almost all of them. It is more expensive than a lot of sunscreens, and I am very frugal --- but if your skin dislikes your sunscreen, you ultimately won&#x27;t put it on. That&#x27;s more of a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling so dry and it is not soothing at all.  This is not a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this is a terrific,non greasy, non pasty formula that is great under make up and offers truly what it promises- moisturizes and softens and benefits skin texture</li>
            <li> I like this product because it functions as a moisturizer and sunscreen. It is not real oily which is great for me because I have oily skin. Additionally, it is reasonably priced.</li>

            <li> excellent product, plan to try more of this brand.</li>
            <li> I first received this product as a gift. I tried it and loved the coverage of it. This product actually appears to be making a difference in protecting my skin in more than one way. I was so tickled with it that I purchased it before running out as not to have to be without it. Very pleased to &amp;#34;OWN&amp;#34; me.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a all mineral natural sunscreen but absorbs so quickly and evenly. Doesn&#x27;t have a toothpaste feel like most natural sunscreens. Such a great product, I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for several months.  It does a very thorough job of getting all my makeup off, but is gentle with natural ingredients.  Very good for your skin--leaves it feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> My skin in bordering on oily/combination skin, and this product dried out my face! Not horribly dry but definitely drier around my eyes and mouth. I just didn&#x27;t think this was an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I use 3 pumps to cover my face, neck and upper chest that is exposed to the sun. It goes on thick, as it should considering the sunscreen ingredient used is zinc and NON-toxic. (Cheaper harmful toxic sunscreens go on nice and thin, but are so terrible for you.) BUT it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy AT ALL once it is on your face. Amazing. I love that it is organic, and although this product is wonderful, and I am addicted, I wish it were not so expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Too often mineral based sun blocks leave your skin shiny and white or dry and white.  This does not and is perfect  with shea butter as the other reviews said, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well on its own.</li>

I also really love the size of this product - small enough to travel with but enough product to last me for quite a while (and I use it every day).  I would love for Own to come out with an even higher SPF version for those extra sunny days.</li>
            <li> Own products makes a great mineral sunscreen.  SPF 30 protection that has zinc and titanium in the formula and it doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue.  It&#x27;s light without feeling greasy.</li>
