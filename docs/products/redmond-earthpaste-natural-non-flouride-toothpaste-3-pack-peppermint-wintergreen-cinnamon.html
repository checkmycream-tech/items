            <li>This is the absolute best toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Have finished the first of three tubes and am happy to report that this is a good product.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Makes your mouth feel good and clean.</li>
            <li>all that I know what they are, and the clay used is right out of Utah&#x27;s very own backyard per se.  </li>
            <li>Great product that the whole family enjoys!</li>
            <li>I just had a dental checkup for the first time in over a year - and I&#x27;d been using earthpaste for about 6 months - and the dentist said everything looked great.</li>
            <li>packaged with care, received package VERY FAST!!!</li>
            <li>I am weirdly in love with Earthpaste.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who says on the package that I can swallow my toothpaste is OK in my book..</li>
            <li>Upstanding product with outstanding goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as i said before if u want a safe and healthy product</li>
            <li>Our favorite is peppermint and wintergreen.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon was ok, it just made me feel nauseous.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s just me :-)</li>
            <li>I started getting calcification of my teeth according to my dentist who told me to use more fluoride.</li>
            <li>and I switched to a holistic dentist :)</li>
            <li>It’s “safe to eat,” made of “food grade Redmond clay.”</li>
            <li>Texture took some time to get used to, but love the fact it has no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love that this toothpaste is so non-toxic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad a friend recommended this.</li>
            <li>My kids even love them</li>
            <li>LOVE THE PRODUCT,VERY PLEASE WITH MY ORDER</li>
            <li>Feel free to do your own research, but to me that warning is a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clay provides abrasive effects, and also feels interesting in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that fewer ingredients could bring better results.</li>
            <li>I love earthpaste.</li>
            <li>Also, the company that produces this product is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love their customer service and business practices.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it is great and not a complaint from anyone in the house!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to make my own homemade toothpaste out of Coconut oil, but I just wasn&#x27;t getting a clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Cinnamon is a warm spice and it makes your mouth warm, but I like a cool fresh feeling after brushing so the wintergreen was the most refreshing.</li>
            <li>Great product, very natural.</li>
            <li>Love it and leaves a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>He and I both love how clean it leaves our teeth.  </li>
            <li>I love how clean my teeth feel after I use it.</li>
            <li>the flavors aren&#x27;t artificially strong.</li>
            <li>i find that I have to clean it more often, but so worth it!</li>
            <li>It cleans great without leaving a gritty feeling.  </li>
            <li>All three flavors are a light tan color, and need a bit of a rinse in the sink.  </li>
            <li>am looking to ditch all the chemicals and floride as much as I can...without having to make my own...</li>
            <li>For now, it&#x27;s a big win.</li>
            <li>Even better, I&#x27;ve found it useful for skin issues because it seems to pull out toxins.</li>
            <li>Plus it is a light brown color, so when it spits, the mirror and clothes can suffer.</li>
            <li>I really loved the natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Of the three only one does not have a lead warning which makes it unusable for children, and the one that is safe for children isn&#x27;t very refreshing and didn&#x27;t seem to freshen breath at all</li>
            <li>It is a nice change of taste over highly commercialized toothpaste that has no telling what harmful things in it.  </li>
            <li>I can bite into ice cream and sip hot tea with NO pain :)  </li>
            <li>and no artificial cr*p!</li>
            <li>since I have been using this product I have re-mineralized my enamel and after the first week my tooth sensitivity went away for the first time in 25 yrs!!!</li>
            <li>Then this is the toothpaste to get.&lt;br /&gt;Great taste, clean feeling,</li>
            <li>While using this toothpaste my hygienist was having problems keeping my teeth clean</li>
            <li>clean</li>
            <li>clean organic toothpaste</li>
            <li>Leaves teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves mouth clean and refreshed  </li>
            <li>Everyone in the home uses it, and it safe for the whole family.</li>
            <li>I did some research on the web and came across Earthpaste as a good alternative to traditional toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>But they are good enough.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to have an all natural product.</li>
            <li>However, it’s easily available on Amazon, and that’s where I am shopping for this product right now.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is clay based, with a mild neutral flavor, so if you want that breath freshening taste after brushing your teeth, you may want to add a mouth rinse.  </li>
            <li>sit contains led and unsafe for pregnant woman and children.</li>
            <li>Earthpaste is awesome, I love that there are only a few ingredients and</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t you just leave out the clay so the toothpaste is perfectly smooth in texture when you first put it in your mouth?  </li>
            <li>Love this all natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li>My teeth felt cleaner and whiter, but after a few weeks I felt that it wasn&#x27;t working that great.</li>
            <li>I bought this tooth paste because I wanted something more natural.</li>
            <li>, this toothpaste says it has no glycerin, no artificial coloring, and no foaming agents.</li>
            <li>I liked this product, overall.  </li>
            <li>But if you are looking for something more natural, this is a winner.</li>
            <li>I wanted something more natural for my family.  </li>
            <li>As someone who has sensitive teeth, this is a great option for me since regular toothpastes aggrevate my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>i loved the wintergreen the most and the cinnamon the least.</li>
            <li>In my pursuit to find an organic toothpaste that does the job and keeps your breath fresh for an extended period of time, I find that this particular brand doesn&#x27;t really fit the bill.</li>
            <li>So far I am a huge fan.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>When I first got Earthpaste</li>
            <li>My mouth &amp; breath didn&#x27;t really feel fresh...</li>
            <li>My grandson &amp; daughters became hooked on it with their first use, also.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t taste the flavor after the first couple of times using it.  </li>
            <li>will more than likely use again...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already a fan of Redmond&#x27;s REAL Salt product too!  </li>
            <li>cons are that it does take a bit more toothpaste than traditional toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t foam up</li>
            <li>We&#x27;d been looking for a healthier toothpaste, and for a while were using a Rembrandt flavor that didn&#x27;t have any sodium laurel/laureth sulfate, but it was still pretty chemical-y.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this toothpaste although &#x27;safe&#x27; especially after seeing that it is actually clay colored too!</li>
            <li>and I like the fact that it&#x27;s completely safe to swallow, but it just didn&#x27;t keep my breath fresh for very long</li>
            <li>Totally natural product that makes my mouth feel clean immediately.  </li>
            <li>First of all, and this is going to sound graphic, but it&#x27;s basically the color and consistency of fish poop - mushy brown.</li>
            <li>lack of foaming agents means that your mouth doesn&#x27;t fill up with foam, so the technique I&#x27;ve developed is to put the toothpaste on the brush, then immediately spread it all around all the surfaces of my teeth quickly, so that each quadrant of my mouth has toothpaste on it from the beginning.</li>
            <li>But the thing that really got me is that it does not work.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>low thyroid suggested i use fluoride free tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I’ve been using Earthpaste for over a year for that very reason, and have found it quite</li>
            <li>The only toothpaste I know of that is completely free of ANY abrasives is \\&quot;Colgate Cavity Protection\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>When I stopped using this toothpaste and went back to my original also natural brand, she was surprised to see that my teeth were staying clean between the 3 month intervals.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t clean my teeth and actually made them browner because the paste is brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve been trying to be as all natural as possible, so I figured Earth Paste would be a great alternative to regular toothpaste filled with chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually been to the dentist since starting this product and got compliments from the dentist on my teeth being whiter and healthy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is we love this stuff and don&#x27;t see ourselves going back to traditional toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I will never use regular toothpaste again - too many ingredients and it makes my mouth feel gross</li>
            <li>earthpaste makes your whole mouth feel fresh and that feeling lasts longer than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all three flavors.</li>
            <li>(there are lots of other safe, natural toothpastes out there - look for ADA seal or &#x27;clinically proven&#x27;).  </li>
            <li>I can also let my 1 and 2yr old kids brush their teeth with this and not worry about them swallowing it!!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take anything out of dental care - you still have to floss and brush as normal.  </li>
            <li>At first, I noticed a total difference.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old loves this paste!</li>
            <li>but I find my breath does not stay fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>My husband first bought this in our local health food store.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon flavor is a little strong and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Lemon flavor to anyone.</li>
            <li>With previous foaming pastes this wasn&#x27;t an issue because the foam filled up my mouth</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is pretty much like any other toothpaste in the way you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also really bothered me that it had a warning on the back that pregnant women shouldn&#x27;t use this due to it&#x27;s lead content.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably because of the tea tree oil and clay being naturally antifungal YAY</li>
            <li>no chemicals all natural</li>
            <li>if mind knowing it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>Cleans well and all natural.</li>
            <li>My family really likes this toothpaste, especially the cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li>The lack of foam does take some getting used to, honestly I don&#x27;t wet my toothbrush first and</li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve noticed is that I have a history of sensitive teeth unless I use a toothpaste designed for that issue.  </li>
            <li>Then there&#x27;s the caution statement on the back of the package alterting you to the naturally ocurring Lead in the product.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t imagine what these people were thinking when they came up with this product - it definitely couldn&#x27;t have been overseen by any health professional or biologist.  </li>
            <li>Little blobs don&#x27;t easily slide down the drain, and on a white sink develop a tan film.  </li>
            <li>The only negative is that you have to use a lot of toothpaste to cover your whole mouth, since it doesn&#x27;t foam up like normal toothpaste.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really loved the natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Of the three only one does not have a lead warning which makes it unusable for children, and the one that is safe for children isn&#x27;t very refreshing and didn&#x27;t seem to freshen breath at all</li>
            <li> It is a nice change of taste over highly commercialized toothpaste that has no telling what harmful things in it.  </li>
            <li> I can bite into ice cream and sip hot tea with NO pain :)  </li>
            <li> and no artificial cr*p!</li>
            <li> since I have been using this product I have re-mineralized my enamel and after the first week my tooth sensitivity went away for the first time in 25 yrs!!!</li>
            <li> Then this is the toothpaste to get.&lt;br /&gt;Great taste, clean feeling,</li>
            <li> While using this toothpaste my hygienist was having problems keeping my teeth clean</li>
            <li> clean</li>
            <li> clean organic toothpaste</li>
            <li> Leaves teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves mouth clean and refreshed  </li>
            <li> Everyone in the home uses it, and it safe for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I did some research on the web and came across Earthpaste as a good alternative to traditional toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> But they are good enough.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to have an all natural product.</li>
            <li> However, it’s easily available on Amazon, and that’s where I am shopping for this product right now.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is clay based, with a mild neutral flavor, so if you want that breath freshening taste after brushing your teeth, you may want to add a mouth rinse.  </li>
            <li> sit contains led and unsafe for pregnant woman and children.</li>
            <li> Earthpaste is awesome, I love that there are only a few ingredients and</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t you just leave out the clay so the toothpaste is perfectly smooth in texture when you first put it in your mouth?  </li>
            <li> Love this all natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li> My teeth felt cleaner and whiter, but after a few weeks I felt that it wasn&#x27;t working that great.</li>
            <li> I bought this tooth paste because I wanted something more natural.</li>
            <li> , this toothpaste says it has no glycerin, no artificial coloring, and no foaming agents.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, overall.  </li>
            <li> But if you are looking for something more natural, this is a winner.</li>
            <li> I wanted something more natural for my family.  </li>
            <li> As someone who has sensitive teeth, this is a great option for me since regular toothpastes aggrevate my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> i loved the wintergreen the most and the cinnamon the least.</li>
            <li> In my pursuit to find an organic toothpaste that does the job and keeps your breath fresh for an extended period of time, I find that this particular brand doesn&#x27;t really fit the bill.</li>
            <li> So far I am a huge fan.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> When I first got Earthpaste</li>
            <li> My mouth &amp; breath didn&#x27;t really feel fresh...</li>
            <li> My grandson &amp; daughters became hooked on it with their first use, also.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t taste the flavor after the first couple of times using it.  </li>
            <li> will more than likely use again...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already a fan of Redmond&#x27;s REAL Salt product too!  </li>
            <li> cons are that it does take a bit more toothpaste than traditional toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t foam up</li>
            <li> We&#x27;d been looking for a healthier toothpaste, and for a while were using a Rembrandt flavor that didn&#x27;t have any sodium laurel/laureth sulfate, but it was still pretty chemical-y.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this toothpaste although &#x27;safe&#x27; especially after seeing that it is actually clay colored too!</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it&#x27;s completely safe to swallow, but it just didn&#x27;t keep my breath fresh for very long</li>
            <li> Totally natural product that makes my mouth feel clean immediately.  </li>
            <li> First of all, and this is going to sound graphic, but it&#x27;s basically the color and consistency of fish poop - mushy brown.</li>
            <li> lack of foaming agents means that your mouth doesn&#x27;t fill up with foam, so the technique I&#x27;ve developed is to put the toothpaste on the brush, then immediately spread it all around all the surfaces of my teeth quickly, so that each quadrant of my mouth has toothpaste on it from the beginning.</li>
            <li> But the thing that really got me is that it does not work.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> low thyroid suggested i use fluoride free tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Earthpaste for over a year for that very reason, and have found it quite</li>
            <li> The only toothpaste I know of that is completely free of ANY abrasives is \\&quot;Colgate Cavity Protection\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> When I stopped using this toothpaste and went back to my original also natural brand, she was surprised to see that my teeth were staying clean between the 3 month intervals.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t clean my teeth and actually made them browner because the paste is brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been trying to be as all natural as possible, so I figured Earth Paste would be a great alternative to regular toothpaste filled with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been to the dentist since starting this product and got compliments from the dentist on my teeth being whiter and healthy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is we love this stuff and don&#x27;t see ourselves going back to traditional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I will never use regular toothpaste again - too many ingredients and it makes my mouth feel gross</li>
            <li> earthpaste makes your whole mouth feel fresh and that feeling lasts longer than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all three flavors.</li>
            <li> (there are lots of other safe, natural toothpastes out there - look for ADA seal or &#x27;clinically proven&#x27;).  </li>
            <li> I can also let my 1 and 2yr old kids brush their teeth with this and not worry about them swallowing it!!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take anything out of dental care - you still have to floss and brush as normal.  </li>
            <li> At first, I noticed a total difference.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old loves this paste!</li>
            <li> but I find my breath does not stay fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> My husband first bought this in our local health food store.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon flavor is a little strong and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Lemon flavor to anyone.</li>
            <li> With previous foaming pastes this wasn&#x27;t an issue because the foam filled up my mouth</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is pretty much like any other toothpaste in the way you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also really bothered me that it had a warning on the back that pregnant women shouldn&#x27;t use this due to it&#x27;s lead content.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably because of the tea tree oil and clay being naturally antifungal YAY</li>
            <li> no chemicals all natural</li>
            <li> if mind knowing it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and all natural.</li>
            <li> My family really likes this toothpaste, especially the cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li> The lack of foam does take some getting used to, honestly I don&#x27;t wet my toothbrush first and</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve noticed is that I have a history of sensitive teeth unless I use a toothpaste designed for that issue.  </li>
            <li> Then there&#x27;s the caution statement on the back of the package alterting you to the naturally ocurring Lead in the product.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t imagine what these people were thinking when they came up with this product - it definitely couldn&#x27;t have been overseen by any health professional or biologist.  </li>
            <li> Little blobs don&#x27;t easily slide down the drain, and on a white sink develop a tan film.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that you have to use a lot of toothpaste to cover your whole mouth, since it doesn&#x27;t foam up like normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The taste of each is slightly salty, with hints of natural oils.  </li>
            <li> Despite the minor issues, I like it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> how this works and definitely curious what I will see next dental appointment.  </li>
            <li> I will be a life long customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are a little less sensitive as well since starting this.  </li>
            <li> I will be curious long term</li>
            <li> My teeth have been severely sensitive since I was a kid to hot or cold and nothing ever helped.</li>
            <li> The tube actually carries the rather odd comment that users can “rinse or swallow at your discretion.”  </li>
            <li> Really not too much different from the classics other than the color!</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to because it feels different</li>
            <li> It’s not available at my local CVS pharmacy, and not all health food stores carry it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth feeling clean without any dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a toothpaste with no fluoride or other dubious chemical concoctions, Earthpaste may be the answer to your search.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like all the other garbage they put in</li>
            <li> Not hot; just flavorful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying a few days with the other toothpaste (bummer) and switching back to this to see if I can use it at least some of the time as I wanted to avoid all of the fluoride and chemicals in the regular brands.</li>
            <li> If your looking for an alternative to conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My teeth are also whiter and My husband who gets thrush from time to time from being on long term doses of antibiotics when he was in the Army in Iraq and Afghanistan a few years ago hasn&#x27;t gotten thrush in over a year since we switched to this tooth past.</li>
            <li> I like using something that has less chemicals and getting a comparable/better result.  </li>
            <li> the taste is less mint/</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that I floss and brush regularly and go to the dentist i have always had brittle teeth and weak enamel.</li>
            <li> Also, over time, dried toothpaste collects in the cap and crumbs of it fall out of the lid when applying to the toothbrush, so I always apply over the sink.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s made from &#x27;clay&#x27;, also known as &#x27;heavy dirt&#x27;, that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a stiff plastic and it fills up with air as the toothpaste gets used.  </li>
            <li> Been using these for a few months now!</li>
            <li> The small print it sat</li>
            <li> Waste of money do not purchase !</li>
            <li> It took a few uses to get used to the differences, but no problems now!</li>
            <li> and did you know there&#x27;s no safe level of Lead consumption?  </li>
            <li> even in small quantities (like kids eating Lead paint chips or inhaling Lead dust).  </li>
            <li> It tastes like somebody made a baking soda and water paste and shoved it in a tube, but instead of being white, it looks dirty.</li>
            <li> Abrasives slowly wear away the enamel on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> the only down side is that it makes your sink so dirty!</li>
            <li> So I did research and found out my bad teeth, sensitivity, week and calcified enamel despite my rigorous care was actually being caused by the toxic fluoride.</li>
            <li> Twist off cap is outdated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Earthpaste is rather expensive, as toothpastes go.</li>
            <li> It feels weird because of the lack of foam and</li>
            <li> This product should be illegal and banned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying that this stuff turned their teeth brown, which I find difficult to believe, unless their teeth were already having problems or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I already contacted Amazon about this false advertisement and am returning this crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can find the words to describe just how awful this toothpaste is.  </li>
            <li> Its&#x27; taken the crap out of our toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Bad taste!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner, maybe a bit whiter and without nasty ingredients.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am weirdly in love with Earthpaste.  Anyone who says on the package that I can swallow my toothpaste is OK in my book..lol  It is a nice change of taste over highly commercialized toothpaste that has no telling what harmful things in it.  The taste of each is slightly salty, with hints of natural oils.  I love it!</li>
            <li> If your looking for an alternative to conventional toothpaste. Then this is the toothpaste to get.&lt;br /&gt;Great taste, clean feeling,</li>
            <li> In my pursuit to find an organic toothpaste that does the job and keeps your breath fresh for an extended period of time, I find that this particular brand doesn&#x27;t really fit the bill. It was, a good taste and I like the fact that it&#x27;s completely safe to swallow, but it just didn&#x27;t keep my breath fresh for very long and I found the need to brush several times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Upstanding product with outstanding goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You WILL NEED to have a organic type of teeth agent to keep your teeth white .........while using this .</li>
            <li> I bought this tooth paste because I wanted something more natural. I was concerned about the Lead content and the fact that it is banded in CA. But the thing that really got me is that it does not work. I go every three months to have my teeth cleaned as I have an issue with tartar building up on my teeth. I used all three tubes of this toothpaste as my husband did not like it. While using this toothpaste my hygienist was having problems keeping my teeth clean and she was concerned because the tartar buildup was not improving any longer. When I stopped using this toothpaste and went back to my original also natural brand, she was surprised to see that my teeth were staying clean between the 3 month intervals. I did not think that the toothpaste was the issue until it hit me one day.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Been using these for a few months now! Love it and leaves a clean feeling. Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t foam up but that isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> as i said before if u want a safe and healthy product this is it&lt;br /&gt;thank u</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! Very pure product;tastes great!! packaged with care, received package VERY FAST!!! Would buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this all natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li> This is the best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  Makes your mouth feel good and clean. Great to know I&#x27;m not ingesting all sorts of chemicals which the FDA and our country allows to be in toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I really loved the natural toothpaste. Everyone in the home uses it, and it safe for the whole family. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product that the whole family enjoys! Its&#x27; taken the crap out of our toothpaste.</li>
            <li> When I first got Earthpaste I thought my kids would immediately reject it. To my surprise they LOVED it! Our favorite is peppermint and wintergreen. Cinnamon was ok, it just made me feel nauseous. But that&#x27;s just me :-) I will be a life long customer!</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been trying to be as all natural as possible, so I figured Earth Paste would be a great alternative to regular toothpaste filled with chemicals. At first, I noticed a total difference. My teeth felt cleaner and whiter, but after a few weeks I felt that it wasn&#x27;t working that great. My mouth &amp; breath didn&#x27;t really feel fresh...maybe that&#x27;s something you have to get used to, but I decided to revert back to Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth paste and will buy again!  Am very satisfied, and it met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old loves this paste!</li>
            <li> Great taste, I like this tooth paste</li>
            <li> LOVE!  I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started using this. I found out about it because I used unrefined salt also by Redmonds &amp;#34;Real Salt&amp;#34; I loved the salt so I tried this. My teeth have been severely sensitive since I was a kid to hot or cold and nothing ever helped. Despite the fact that I floss and brush regularly and go to the dentist i have always had brittle teeth and weak enamel. I started getting calcification of my teeth according to my dentist who told me to use more fluoride. But my endocrinologist who siad I should avoid all fluoride because it is poison and I have low thyroid suggested i use fluoride free tooth paste. So I did research and found out my bad teeth, sensitivity, week and calcified enamel despite my rigorous care was actually being caused by the toxic fluoride. It is called dental fluorosis.  since I have been using this product I have re-mineralized my enamel and after the first week my tooth sensitivity went away for the first time in 25 yrs!!! I can bite into ice cream and sip hot tea with NO pain :)  It has been over a year now and I haven&#x27;t had a cavity and I switched to a holistic dentist :) My teeth are also whiter and My husband who gets thrush from time to time from being on long term doses of antibiotics when he was in the Army in Iraq and Afghanistan a few years ago hasn&#x27;t gotten thrush in over a year since we switched to this tooth past. It&#x27;s probably because of the tea tree oil and clay being naturally antifungal YAY</li>
            <li> For God sake, do not buy this garbage. I just received mine and read the back. It has a warning that says:This product contains trace amounts of lead, a substance known to cause cancer and birth defects. NOW, is this the s*** you want to read when you purchase a supposed organic product? Hell no. I already contacted Amazon about this false advertisement and am returning this crap.</li>
            <li> I do feel like it gets my teeth clean but I find my breath does not stay fresh all day long. I have to brush three times instead of two times a day. I do miss the way traditional toothpaste foams as this one does not but it&#x27;s great not to have the toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a toothpaste with no fluoride or other dubious chemical concoctions, Earthpaste may be the answer to your search. I’ve been using Earthpaste for over a year for that very reason, and have found it quite satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to no fluoride, this toothpaste says it has no glycerin, no artificial coloring, and no foaming agents. It’s “safe to eat,” made of “food grade Redmond clay.” The tube actually carries the rather odd comment that users can “rinse or swallow at your discretion.”  Otherwise, this is pretty much like any other toothpaste in the way you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earthpaste is rather expensive, as toothpastes go. It’s not available at my local CVS pharmacy, and not all health food stores carry it. However, it’s easily available on Amazon, and that’s where I am shopping for this product right now.</li>
            <li> I love it  is the best i ever. Use. clean organic toothpaste no chemicals all natural</li>
            <li> Totally natural product that makes my mouth feel clean immediately.  My grandson &amp; daughters became hooked on it with their first use, also.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is clay based, with a mild neutral flavor, so if you want that breath freshening taste after brushing your teeth, you may want to add a mouth rinse.  I don&#x27;t taste the flavor after the first couple of times using it.  It cleans great without leaving a gritty feeling.  All three flavors are a light tan color, and need a bit of a rinse in the sink.  Little blobs don&#x27;t easily slide down the drain, and on a white sink develop a tan film.  Also, over time, dried toothpaste collects in the cap and crumbs of it fall out of the lid when applying to the toothbrush, so I always apply over the sink.  One frustration I have is the tube itself.  It&#x27;s a stiff plastic and it fills up with air as the toothpaste gets used.  When you are almost out, sometimes it sprays when an air pocket hits the opening and blobs of toothpaste blobs of toothpaste go flying all over the counter, mirror and sink.  Despite the minor issues, I like it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing this out....it didn&#x27;t clean my teeth and actually made them browner because the paste is brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also really bothered me that it had a warning on the back that pregnant women shouldn&#x27;t use this due to it&#x27;s lead content.  Yikes!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is amazing! I recommend it to everyone. My teeth are remineralizing and even my dentist has noticed the difference and asked me what I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this...will more than likely use again...am looking to ditch all the chemicals and floride as much as I can...without having to make my own...but if I resort to that so be it</li>
            <li> Have finished the first of three tubes and am happy to report that this is a good product. Texture took some time to get used to, but love the fact it has no harmful ingredients. Addition of wintergreen essential oil helps improve the overall flavor.</li>
            <li> The peppermint is delicious!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to make my own homemade toothpaste out of Coconut oil, but I just wasn&#x27;t getting a clean feeling.  Earthpaste is awesome, I love that there are only a few ingredients and all that I know what they are, and the clay used is right out of Utah&#x27;s very own backyard per se.  I&#x27;m already a fan of Redmond&#x27;s REAL Salt product too!  I can also let my 1 and 2yr old kids brush their teeth with this and not worry about them swallowing it!!  Thanks Redmond for another great, healthy alternative to toothpaste!!!</li>
            <li> I liked this product, overall.  The only negative is that you have to use a lot of toothpaste to cover your whole mouth, since it doesn&#x27;t foam up like normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It met all expectations.</li>
            <li> I did some research on the web and came across Earthpaste as a good alternative to traditional toothpaste.  So far I am a huge fan.  I&#x27;ve actually been to the dentist since starting this product and got compliments from the dentist on my teeth being whiter and healthy.  I like using something that has less chemicals and getting a comparable/better result.  I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are a little less sensitive as well since starting this.  It doesn&#x27;t take anything out of dental care - you still have to floss and brush as normal.  But if you are looking for something more natural, this is a winner. It feels weird because of the lack of foam and the taste is less mint/cinnamon b/c the flavors aren&#x27;t artificially strong. But they are good enough.  I know that it says you can swallow with no fear and I have not tried that.  But I do like the idea for kids that I wouldn&#x27;t have to be so worried about if they swallowed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are that it does take a bit more toothpaste than traditional toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t foam up and it&#x27;s a bit pricier than what I used to use.  I will be curious long term how this works and definitely curious what I will see next dental appointment.  For now, it&#x27;s a big win.</li>
            <li> I love that this toothpaste is so non-toxic. Even better, I&#x27;ve found it useful for skin issues because it seems to pull out toxins.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best toothpaste.  And that is coming from a dental assistant.  I wanted something more natural for my family.  I&#x27;m so glad a friend recommended this. My teeth feel amazing and look great. Plus peace if mind knowing it&#x27;s all natural. I highly recommend all three flavors. My kids even love them</li>
            <li> Good product.  Cleans well and all natural.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t you just leave out the clay so the toothpaste is perfectly smooth in texture when you first put it in your mouth?  Abrasives slowly wear away the enamel on your teeth.  I think you should re-think this substance as perhaps something you should simply leave out of your toothpaste, since it&#x27;s so abrasive.  The only toothpaste I know of that is completely free of ANY abrasives is \\&quot;Colgate Cavity Protection\\&quot;.  I just don&#x27;t like all the other garbage they put in their toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still researching...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT,VERY PLEASE WITH MY ORDER</li>
            <li> Of the three only one does not have a lead warning which makes it unusable for children, and the one that is safe for children isn&#x27;t very refreshing and didn&#x27;t seem to freshen breath at all</li>
            <li> This product should be illegal and banned. In. The small print it sat sit contains led and unsafe for pregnant woman and children. Toothpaste should not contain led !</li>
            <li> We&#x27;d been looking for a healthier toothpaste, and for a while were using a Rembrandt flavor that didn&#x27;t have any sodium laurel/laureth sulfate, but it was still pretty chemical-y. We turned to Amazon and found Earthpaste, and it&#x27;s great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, the ingredients are all relatively benign. There is a quite scarifying lead warning on the package, but the company has an explanation of that on their site - it&#x27;s only related to some cumbersome California product labeling and is there to preclude any bounty-hunting lawsuits. Feel free to do your own research, but to me that warning is a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m liking the job this stuff does, although it is different to use. First of all, and this is going to sound graphic, but it&#x27;s basically the color and consistency of fish poop - mushy brown. It&#x27;s based on clay, so that makes sense. The clay provides abrasive effects, and also feels interesting in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of foaming agents means that your mouth doesn&#x27;t fill up with foam, so the technique I&#x27;ve developed is to put the toothpaste on the brush, then immediately spread it all around all the surfaces of my teeth quickly, so that each quadrant of my mouth has toothpaste on it from the beginning. Then as I brush from section to section I don&#x27;t &#x27;run out&#x27; of toothpaste. With previous foaming pastes this wasn&#x27;t an issue because the foam filled up my mouth and I&#x27;d have to spit out the overflow just to keep going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying that this stuff turned their teeth brown, which I find difficult to believe, unless their teeth were already having problems or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is we love this stuff and don&#x27;t see ourselves going back to traditional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Leaves teeth feeling clean. Twist off cap is outdated.</li>
            <li> I am happy to find toothpaste without chemicals. Will recommend this product. Leaves mouth clean and refreshed  I like the lemon best</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband since he doesn&#x27;t like the grittiness of my homemade tooth powder.  He and I both love how clean it leaves our teeth.  As someone who has sensitive teeth, this is a great option for me since regular toothpastes aggrevate my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> My husband first bought this in our local health food store. I couldn&#x27;t believe that fewer ingredients could bring better results. My teeth feel cleaner, maybe a bit whiter and without nasty ingredients. That&#x27;s why we got the 3 pack to try the different flavors. (I alternate this with Squiggle for enamel building and sensitivity.) My deduction of one star is for the periodic spitting from the tube. I assume because it doesn&#x27;t have fillers, it can be a bit looser in consistency. Plus it is a light brown color, so when it spits, the mirror and clothes can suffer. But I&#x27;m still happy with it and have learn to point the tube AWAY from me!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I&#x27;ve used the cinnamon, and it tastes really good.  Not hot; just flavorful.  The only problem I&#x27;ve noticed is that I have a history of sensitive teeth unless I use a toothpaste designed for that issue.  So my sensitivity is coming back.  I prefer the feel of my teeth after brushing with this product.  You can tell it takes off the plaque.  I&#x27;m trying a few days with the other toothpaste (bummer) and switching back to this to see if I can use it at least some of the time as I wanted to avoid all of the fluoride and chemicals in the regular brands.</li>
            <li> I love earthpaste. It takes a little getting used to because it feels different and you will need to rinse your sink because the clay, i&#x27;m guessing, will leave a residue in the sink. The cinnamon flavor is a little strong and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Lemon flavor to anyone. I just had a dental checkup for the first time in over a year - and I&#x27;d been using earthpaste for about 6 months - and the dentist said everything looked great. I will never use regular toothpaste again - too many ingredients and it makes my mouth feel gross and i have a constant need to rinse.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients, I was looking for a toothpaste that I considered non toxic. I feel like it cleans My teeth. It does not taste very good, I do not feel that it refreshes My mouth. I am using the wintergreen. I did buy the three tube variey pack, I am hoping the peppermint will be a stronger taste.</li>
            <li> Great product, very natural. I love how clean my teeth feel after I use it. The lack of foam does take some getting used to, honestly I don&#x27;t wet my toothbrush first and that way I know that what i&#x27;m feeling is toothpaste rather than water and that&#x27;s helped me get used to it. Also, the company that produces this product is absolutely fantastic! I love their customer service and business practices.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste! Great texture and flavor! Leaves your mouth feeling clean without any dangerous chemicals. You can pronounce all the ingredient names! Shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> Bad taste! Waste of money do not purchase !</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is definitely different from traditional toothpaste but seems to work well.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is incredible! I loved it! and no artificial cr*p!</li>
            <li> My family really likes this toothpaste, especially the cinnamon flavor. It took a few uses to get used to the differences, but no problems now! It is nice to have an all natural product.</li>
            <li> i loved the wintergreen the most and the cinnamon the least. Cinnamon is a warm spice and it makes your mouth warm, but I like a cool fresh feeling after brushing so the wintergreen was the most refreshing. earthpaste makes your whole mouth feel fresh and that feeling lasts longer than regular toothpaste. the only down side is that it makes your sink so dirty! i find that I have to clean it more often, but so worth it!</li>
            <li> I an getting used to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can find the words to describe just how awful this toothpaste is.  It tastes like somebody made a baking soda and water paste and shoved it in a tube, but instead of being white, it looks dirty. Since it&#x27;s made from &#x27;clay&#x27;, also known as &#x27;heavy dirt&#x27;, that makes sense.  And if you add water to your brush after applying the toothpaste, it might rinse off a glob of dirt paste that will then sit in your sink and not dissolve for DAYS!  Then there&#x27;s the caution statement on the back of the package alterting you to the naturally ocurring Lead in the product.  Who would intentionally put Lead in their mouth these days?  Haven&#x27;t we been cautioned to remove all Lead paint in our homes?  And to return or dispose of products made in China that contain Lead?  I took 5 minutes and looked-up on the CDC website what they say about Lead and did you know there&#x27;s no safe level of Lead consumption?  It&#x27;s been linked to brain development issues, memory loss, birth defects, etc. even in small quantities (like kids eating Lead paint chips or inhaling Lead dust).  And, damage from Lead is IRREVERSIBLE.  I just can&#x27;t imagine what these people were thinking when they came up with this product - it definitely couldn&#x27;t have been overseen by any health professional or biologist.  Spare yourself, and don&#x27;t buy this toothpaste (there are lots of other safe, natural toothpastes out there - look for ADA seal or &#x27;clinically proven&#x27;).  And please don&#x27;t give it to your children.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this toothpaste although &#x27;safe&#x27; especially after seeing that it is actually clay colored too! Surprisingly it is great and not a complaint from anyone in the house! Really not too much different from the classics other than the color!</li>
