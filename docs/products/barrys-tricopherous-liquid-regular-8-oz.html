            <li> I USED TRICOPHEROUS ALL MY LIFE. FROM CUBA. IT WAS THE BEST FOR THE LACK OF HAIR.5 STARS.</li>
            <li> I bought this bec my hair is thinning (thanks DNA) and my grandparents swore by it. Got the bottle, opened the cap and took a whiff; smells like pure rubbing alcohol. I rubbed the purple potion on my scalp (doesn&#x27;t discolor anything) and felt soothing. Haven&#x27;t noticed hair growth or thickening, but will keep you posted - I&#x27;m sure you can&#x27;t stand the excitement.</li>
            <li> This is great for hair. This product is highly recommended. And do not get easy in Venezuela. I like the way it keeps your hair looking nice and soft and the lavender fragance smells good.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for about two weeks now. I put a little on my scalp and message it in after every shower. I don&#x27;t know for sure about hair growth but my hair looks better.</li>

            <li> TOO BAD  U CNT  FIND  THIS  PRODUCT  OUT  IN THE  STREET  ,,,HAVE  BEEN  FOR  100 YEARS  OUT THERE  BUT  HERE  IN THE  USA,,,,,..IF  U  HAIR  IS  FALLING  OR  STOP  SHINNNING  BUY IT  USE  IT  AND  B  HAPPY  CAMPER</li>
            <li> My mom has been telling me about this since my hair started falling - 20&#x27;s (stress, genetics etc.) Finally all these years later she bought bottles off of Amazon and gave me one.  I used it  these past 2 days -took a shower to wash my hair - not a strand or clump fell out.  Usually I go to rinse and nothing but hair is breaking off.  I mean there was not one strand!! I did a double take-washed and rinsed again - nada.  I put a comb through my hair nada. It was soft and manageable (I have curly thinning hair).  It also soothed my scalp-which tends to be sensitive.  I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s not the fanciest of products because it works! Old school is the best.  :)</li>
            <li> this one was for my sister in law, she&#x27;s only four y/o and she have a really thin hair, yes you read it right, this also work to have a stronger hair!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and I was very happy when I found it online. The price is fair.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!!!!!!! My hair stop falling</li>
            <li> I liked it but wasn&#x27;t happy with the alcohol content but it smells geat and isn&#x27;t too oily so I can use it during the day</li>
            <li> This could dry the scalp at first. If you scratch your scalp after you put this liquid on, you will get a purple residue under your nails.</li>
            <li> Great item! Great price!</li>
