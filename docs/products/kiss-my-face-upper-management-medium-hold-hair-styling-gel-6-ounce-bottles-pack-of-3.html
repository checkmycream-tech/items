            <li>Also it has a pleasant citrusy type smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering</li>

            <li>I love this gel!</li>
            <li>I have used this gel for years and like it, but the bottle with the flip top was a pain!</li>
            <li>The gel cam in a three pack nicely wrapped in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>thing I would have liked to see (and</li>
            <li>I have a very strong allergy on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I also love the scent, which is citrusy; kind of like grapefruit.</li>
            <li>Awesome smell and no harsh chemicals are a bonus too.</li>
            <li>The gel has a mild and pleasant smell, like grapefruit.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the ingredients listed.</li>
            <li>I love using this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I wanted a styling gel that both worked and was safe.</li>
            <li>I knew it was safe:</li>
            <li>, it must have some redeeming quality.&amp;#34; Nope, that is the minimum amount Amazon will allow me to give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They scream cheap!</li>
            <li>The biggest is, I can&#x27;t deal with perfume bases any more.</li>
            <li>My Face products are lovely and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>Also, its the perfect hold for my short haircut.</li>
            <li>Items is okay</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s SO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more perfumey than citrusy now.</li>
            <li>Two stars because the ingredients were safe, but this stuff was very familiar for my already since it came.</li>
            <li>Sometimes tried and true, really is better KMF!</li>
            <li>Not sticky - which is the best - but holds all day long.</li>
            <li>Be prepared for a strong grapefruit scent, which I happen to love.</li>
            <li>and I was given no notification but as far as the product goes, it is great</li>
            <li>This gel holds wonderfully and is virtually invisible in the hair; absolutely no flakes even after combing out the hair style.</li>
            <li>It is great to have found a hair product that is natural.  </li>
            <li>It smells good- thanks to the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I use to love the original one... but it has been changed.</li>
            <li>the reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full five stars) included with the two gel bottles was a pump that I could use instead of just the pop top.</li>
            <li>it &amp;#34;Upper Management Classic&amp;#34; charge maybe a $1 or $2 more per bottle, and you will have throngs of people, loyal and newbies, buying it in bulk, because what you had before was that GOOD and so unique among natural hair gels out there!!!</li>
            <li>I scrunch it in, and you do have to scrunch out the crunch when it dries, but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li>This product works well for my fine hair and it has no wheat products in it.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product for the price.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem is that this product leaves a great deal of white residue in the hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using this product for about 15 years because NOTHING on the market was anywhere near as good.</li>
            <li>The original formula was fantastic, I used it for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>I have used the original formula for about a decade-</li>
            <li>It is now greassy, sticky and doesn&#x27;t do what the original used to do.</li>
            <li>I used that original one for over 10 years...</li>
            <li>In fact, I had some of the original in my travel bag and used this AM --</li>
            <li>The hold is good too without leaving the hair hard, so it&#x27;s a good product if your skin can handle it.</li>
            <li>What I do like better about this product, versus the Tresemme I was using, is that it seems to \\&quot;control\\&quot; more softly.  </li>
            <li>Sure, a bit more $$, a tiny bit, but so much more worth it in knowing what ingredients I am not being exposed to, and not contributing to an animal-tested product.  </li>
            <li>I has high marks and many fantastic reviews.</li>
            <li>Like so many problems of this type, this product has too much stuff in it.  </li>
            <li>This used to be my holy grail ABSOLUTE FAVORITE gel and what did they do?</li>
            <li>My Face had it right with the original grapefruit version.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have been very satisfied with the gel</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and dries fairly fast.</li>
            <li>Before they changed the formula, when it was in the green bottle, this product was great for my family&#x27;s curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>The old formula is better, this one creates suds in my hair like soap.</li>
            <li>I particularly like that it is not tested on animals, and it is free of added dye and fragrances.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because the previous version worked a tad bit better and also there was more product.</li>
            <li>I suppose if you used enough of it it would be more like a super hold.  </li>
            <li>very flat - so saying it is fairly easy is HUGE for me).</li>
            <li>It is really sensitive and gets easily irritated.</li>
            <li>I loved the old upper management, buying 3 at a time from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My hair seems much healthier AND it is fairly easy to style (normally it is</li>
            <li>I have 3b, 4a fine hair with a wavy, curly hair pattern that is highly sensitive to humidity.</li>
            <li>Feels a little oily when applied, but works well and smells good for someone who does not like perfumed products.</li>
            <li>They shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to use the reviews for the original product to try and sell this new one.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely buy more when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li>and it took a lot of hot water to flush it out.</li>
            <li>Love Kiss My Face Upper Management Gel.</li>
            <li>They are defferent but have the exact labeling.</li>
            <li>It looks ok right after application but when the hair dries, white flakes will cover large areas of the hair.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice hold and plays well with other products.</li>
            <li>The prior, classic Upper Management formulation was outstanding!!</li>
            <li>these individual couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>My Face gel, feels very natural and is mild to my scalp.</li>
            <li>If you wanted to charge more for the old formula, then do that but to change it to this crappy formulation, charge more for it, and give your faithful customers less in a cheaper looking package really hurts your brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I agree with all the other reviewers who loved the old version.</li>
            <li>If anybody has any suggestions for other good natural brands please let me know.</li>
            <li>The previous version (came in a green bottle) was the best hair gel in the market.</li>
            <li>and it holds my curly hair very well even on humid/rainy days.  </li>
            <li>I have to throw away the whole 3-pack.  </li>
            <li>This works very well for my hair.</li>
            <li>works very well for thick/wavy hair...</li>
            <li>I used to finish a whole bottle in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>And when I poured a tear in my hand and smashed with my other hand, it felt like something very very cheap</li>
            <li>PLEASE go back to the original formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really tried to give this new formulation a go, But IT JUST, DOESN&#x27;T WORK!</li>
            <li>The new white ones look like  cheap discount store items&lt;br</li>
            <li>looks like it&#x27;s time to look for a new brand!</li>
            <li>I tried using less and being more intentional about spreading it evenly through my hair, but that just spread the problem.  </li>
            <li>I have tried MANY MANY styling products: Bumble&amp;Bumble Hold Spray and Styling Creme (left hair flaky); Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Collection strong Hold gel (caused rash and itching - must the that PVP or something it has a plastic smell); American Crew Tea Tree Gel (left hair badly stiff looking and natural it also caused itching.</li>
            <li>The grapefruit scent doesn&#x27;t aggravate my allergies like other scents do (I use fragrance free or no fragrance added in everything else)</li>
            <li>The new formula works</li>
            <li>I will never, ever buy this new formulation again.</li>
            <li>bought 2 pack, 6 bottles of the new formula.</li>
            <li>It left my scalp very itchy, which really took away from the product.</li>
            <li>Like most women, when I find a product I love, I keep using it, and am desperate when it disappears.  </li>
            <li>I love the old formula (green bottle).</li>
            <li>does not work the way the old one did, and comes in a new tube (that&#x27;s not a complaint, just a note).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It provides natural hair care without any animal tests!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as thick as other styling gels, which is great.</li>
            <li>They should have introduced this as a new product / flavor and kept the old one.</li>
            <li>Not stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>Be aware you are not buying the original gel in the green bottle!!</li>
            <li>I was a huge fan of the old product (in the green bottle).</li>
            <li>This one the gel is clear.</li>
            <li>I need to have control of it for it to  look professional for work.     </li>
            <li>At the risk of being hyperbolic this early in my review-</li>
            <li>The bottle was classy and spa like.</li>
            <li>Classy, convenient space exploration saving.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the payoff for using something that&#x27;s water-soluble and made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have been checking all the stores I can find to see if the have any of the old version</li>
            <li>It gets rid of frizz and hair stays soft.</li>
            <li>Please note: my original review was for the old product, in the green bottle.</li>
            <li>This new version makes your hairy oily and doesn&#x27;t have nearly the same hold.</li>
            <li>I have long wavy hair that gets very puffy and frizzy.</li>
            <li>Whereas these new gaudy white bottles are not Going on my shower shelf.  </li>
            <li>This is the only gel that i have found that leaves a soft hold for my natural curls.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;KMF-Bring back the old stuff please!</li>
            <li>Bring back the old formula!</li>
            <li>The fact that is doesn&#x27;t have ALCOHOL makes it even better as it won&#x27;t dry my hair (other gels leave your hair dry and brittle).</li>
            <li>KMF, please go back to the old</li>
            <li>was my review for the old product: \\&quot;This is the only styling product I use in my curly hair.</li>
            <li>: Bring back the old KMF Upper Management Formula, brand</li>
            <li>This is a big problem for me since I have allergies and asthma and the old grapefruit scent, which actually smelled like grapefruit, was the only scented hair product I could tolerate.</li>
            <li>and it left white residues on my hair hours later after being applied, same as old hard-living 5 cents grocery store jelly in a bag.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the review I left for the new product on its other listing (for 1 tube only) on Nov. 16, 2013;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> these individual couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> My Face gel, feels very natural and is mild to my scalp.</li>
            <li> If you wanted to charge more for the old formula, then do that but to change it to this crappy formulation, charge more for it, and give your faithful customers less in a cheaper looking package really hurts your brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other reviewers who loved the old version.</li>
            <li> If anybody has any suggestions for other good natural brands please let me know.</li>
            <li> The previous version (came in a green bottle) was the best hair gel in the market.</li>
            <li> and it holds my curly hair very well even on humid/rainy days.  </li>
            <li> I have to throw away the whole 3-pack.  </li>
            <li> This works very well for my hair.</li>
            <li> works very well for thick/wavy hair...</li>
            <li> I used to finish a whole bottle in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> And when I poured a tear in my hand and smashed with my other hand, it felt like something very very cheap</li>
            <li> PLEASE go back to the original formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really tried to give this new formulation a go, But IT JUST, DOESN&#x27;T WORK!</li>
            <li> The new white ones look like  cheap discount store items&lt;br</li>
            <li> looks like it&#x27;s time to look for a new brand!</li>
            <li> I tried using less and being more intentional about spreading it evenly through my hair, but that just spread the problem.  </li>
            <li> I have tried MANY MANY styling products: Bumble&amp;Bumble Hold Spray and Styling Creme (left hair flaky); Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Collection strong Hold gel (caused rash and itching - must the that PVP or something it has a plastic smell); American Crew Tea Tree Gel (left hair badly stiff looking and natural it also caused itching.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit scent doesn&#x27;t aggravate my allergies like other scents do (I use fragrance free or no fragrance added in everything else)</li>
            <li> The new formula works</li>
            <li> I will never, ever buy this new formulation again.</li>
            <li> bought 2 pack, 6 bottles of the new formula.</li>
            <li> It left my scalp very itchy, which really took away from the product.</li>
            <li> Like most women, when I find a product I love, I keep using it, and am desperate when it disappears.  </li>
            <li> I love the old formula (green bottle).</li>
            <li> does not work the way the old one did, and comes in a new tube (that&#x27;s not a complaint, just a note).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It provides natural hair care without any animal tests!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as other styling gels, which is great.</li>
            <li> They should have introduced this as a new product / flavor and kept the old one.</li>
            <li> Not stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> Be aware you are not buying the original gel in the green bottle!!</li>
            <li> I was a huge fan of the old product (in the green bottle).</li>
            <li> This one the gel is clear.</li>
            <li> I need to have control of it for it to  look professional for work.     </li>
            <li> At the risk of being hyperbolic this early in my review-</li>
            <li> The bottle was classy and spa like.</li>
            <li> Classy, convenient space exploration saving.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the payoff for using something that&#x27;s water-soluble and made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been checking all the stores I can find to see if the have any of the old version</li>
            <li> It gets rid of frizz and hair stays soft.</li>
            <li> Please note: my original review was for the old product, in the green bottle.</li>
            <li> This new version makes your hairy oily and doesn&#x27;t have nearly the same hold.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair that gets very puffy and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Whereas these new gaudy white bottles are not Going on my shower shelf.  </li>
            <li> This is the only gel that i have found that leaves a soft hold for my natural curls.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;KMF-Bring back the old stuff please!</li>
            <li> Bring back the old formula!</li>
            <li> The fact that is doesn&#x27;t have ALCOHOL makes it even better as it won&#x27;t dry my hair (other gels leave your hair dry and brittle).</li>
            <li> KMF, please go back to the old</li>
            <li> was my review for the old product: \\&quot;This is the only styling product I use in my curly hair.</li>
            <li> : Bring back the old KMF Upper Management Formula, brand</li>
            <li> This is a big problem for me since I have allergies and asthma and the old grapefruit scent, which actually smelled like grapefruit, was the only scented hair product I could tolerate.</li>
            <li> and it left white residues on my hair hours later after being applied, same as old hard-living 5 cents grocery store jelly in a bag.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the review I left for the new product on its other listing (for 1 tube only) on Nov. 16, 2013;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new formula is a completely different product, and I couldn&#x27;t even get through half of the tube before I decided to use a different gel.  </li>
            <li> It looks fine the first day, but then if I don&#x27;t wash my hair the 2nd day, it gets crusty and starts flaking off--like really bad dandruff, though not coming from my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I do seem to have to put a lot (but that is a trade off, or let&#x27;s say, a cause due to the natural products).</li>
            <li> Unlike other natural brands&#x27; gels, Kiss My Face gel is lightweight and not sticky.</li>
            <li> Five stars for the previous size/formula, four stars for the new.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking dull, frizzy, dry and it felt very very brassy.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil reformulation leaves my hair flat and greasy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair dry - no improvement (maybe I&#x27;m not using enough).</li>
            <li> The gel says \\&quot;medium\\&quot; on the package, and that is considerably stronger than what I had been using previously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months, and I haven&#x27;t finished half of the first bottle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel like the Valdez oil slick when you apply it... gives hair just enough texture to style and then leaves hair soft (not crunchy).</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, wavy long hair</li>
            <li> The only thing is that sometimes I can see the gel flakes when I use it on the hair that is not drippy wet.</li>
            <li> A Tip: for long hair, be generous on the tips of your hair.</li>
            <li> This product is all natural, does not flake and isn&#x27;t too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> With any gel, if you leave the tips without enough products, once they dry they will look less controlled that the upper hair, also the friction or movement against shoulder, clothes, will cause the gel to start breaking.</li>
            <li> I have tried different ways, experimented, but always end up with white sticky mess on my hair.</li>
            <li> You do have to use larger amounts than other gels.</li>
            <li> Like other Kiss My Face products, the Upper Management gel has a lot of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; irritants.</li>
            <li> So now I dilute the gel with water when I use it on my dry hair and it minimizes the gel flakes.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry up your hair, leaves no flaking.  </li>
            <li> It disappeared a few months ago, but when I found this gel in the squeeze tube, I thought it must be the same thing, just in different packaging.  </li>
            <li> I will NOT purchase this again and can&#x27;t in good conscious give it away to any friends since it&#x27;s so horrible for me.</li>
            <li> BRING BACK THE GREEN FLAT SIDED BOTTLE.  </li>
            <li> I 100% agree with all the negative reviews on new formulation.  </li>
            <li> In fact this formulation inexplicably leaves HUGE FLAKES in my hair.</li>
            <li> I complained to them, asking for their old stuff.</li>
            <li> And my  grandmother would not have chosen the ugly white bottle over the lovely soothing green one.</li>
            <li> My Face Upper Management gel in the green bottle for several years on my thick, curly hair, and could find it in all the regular stores (Meijer, Walmart, etc.).  </li>
            <li> When you have a hand slick with gel, it can be a little difficult to squeeze the bottle if you need more.</li>
            <li> I use this gel on slightly wet/damp hair, comb it through, and blow dry for my style.  </li>
            <li> no matter I use it wet or dry, no matter how little I use.  </li>
            <li> Among other brands I have tried were L&#x27;Oreal, glü, Giovanni Organics, etc.    </li>
            <li> Since I cannot get the other, this one will suffice.</li>
            <li> I prefer the other.</li>
            <li> And the product formulas for the gel and other items has changed.  </li>
            <li> The hold is different and even when I try to use a small amount, my hair is crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I applied it to my hair while it was soaking wet, while it was damp, I also tried it with other products, nothing worked!</li>
            <li> This gel keeps my curls defined even when the weather is not on my side and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or overly dry.</li>
            <li> it is not a \\&quot;super hold\\&quot; gel, rather, it keeps the general shape you want without the nasty greasiness of regular gel products.</li>
            <li> Plus, it keeps your hair held where it should be whether it be for a dry or slick look.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in the previous type packaging or something with a pump and a thinner consistency (for ease of application).</li>
            <li> Why did they mess with perfection?</li>
            <li> The new product smells weird (Argan oil)</li>
            <li> Tacky, sticky, crispy, wet-looking, anything but curly is the result, no matter how little you use.  </li>
            <li> I can put a little on my hand and run it through my hair.</li>
            <li> This is way too heavy for my hair and wish I never bought it.  </li>
            <li> The one I used before came in a green bottle and the gel was opaque.</li>
            <li> My Face green bottles.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, my hair stays in place for the rest of the day, looking shiny - not greasy - and does not look too stiff.     </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair from getting frizzy and doesn&#x27;t get sticky or make my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> Except for the fact that all ingredients are natural, it is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it by sections.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a ton and don&#x27;t have funky hairstyles so not sure about &amp;#34;max hold&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I will simply say that this new formulation is the worst gel you can</li>
            <li> BUT it stuffed up my nose, made it hard for me to breathe and made my head itch.    </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to wash off your hands.</li>
            <li> So hard to brush out at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Formulation changed - hard to rinse off.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a styling product without wheat or gluten.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late fifties</li>
            <li> I have thick 3C hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to get those white, sticky things off the hair too.</li>
            <li> I hate this new product and am stuck while I try to find something else on the market.  </li>
            <li> They are not nearly as good as they were.  </li>
            <li> Worse, for me, is that they changed the scent.</li>
            <li> However, the new formula is just terrible.  </li>
            <li> Silly.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately it did not work for my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that Kiss</li>
            <li> It is even difficult to wash it off my hands.  </li>
            <li> So sad.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I feel bad for the sewer rats that had to inhale this stuff when I washed it off my hands into the sink.</li>
            <li> would give my remaining 2.95 tubes to charity, but to inflict the disappointment this junk product affords on anybody would be wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading [[ASIN:076115678X Curly Girl: The Handbook]], went through my bathroom cabinet and threw out everything that had silicone and other nasty stuff in the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Now it flakes like crazy and my hair hates it.</li>
            <li> sorry, at smell!</li>
            <li> The texture of the gel is unpleasantly slimy.  </li>
            <li> Every day is a bad hair day with this gel.</li>
            <li> I agree with the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> However I was very disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> Not saying its a bad product, just not the product for me!!!</li>
            <li> The replacement, in the tube, is HORRIBLE.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have frizzy, wavy long hair and this does not help to hold or smoothen my hair. It leaves my hair dry - no improvement (maybe I&#x27;m not using enough). Except for the fact that all ingredients are natural, it is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel that i have found that leaves a soft hold for my natural curls.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that after I subscribed to the service that it went up 5 bucks and I was given no notification but as far as the product goes, it is great</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a healthier alternative to what I had been using before. I was pleased with the ingredients listed. The gel cam in a three pack nicely wrapped in a plastic bag. The gel has a mild and pleasant smell, like grapefruit. The gel says \\&quot;medium\\&quot; on the package, and that is considerably stronger than what I had been using previously. I only gel my hair when I am going out to Zumba so this gel holds through sweat and high-impact exercise. Overall, I have been very satisfied with the gel and I would definitely buy more when this supply runs out. There is actually a subscribe and save option for this product that I thought was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would have liked to see (and the reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full five stars) included with the two gel bottles was a pump that I could use instead of just the pop top. When you have a hand slick with gel, it can be a little difficult to squeeze the bottle if you need more.</li>
            <li> I started using KMF UM Gel because I am making changes to all my personal care items so that they are from companies that do not test on animals and that they test low  on the \\&quot;cosmetic database\\&quot; website.  In making this change (I had been using a Tresemme product, which I had no functional complaints with) I have not lost any of my desired effects.  I have medium-textured hair without a lot of body.  I use this gel on slightly wet/damp hair, comb it through, and blow dry for my style.  What I do like better about this product, versus the Tresemme I was using, is that it seems to \\&quot;control\\&quot; more softly.  I run my fingers through my hair and the gel is unobtrusive.  Sure, a bit more $$, a tiny bit, but so much more worth it in knowing what ingredients I am not being exposed to, and not contributing to an animal-tested product.  We&#x27;re not curing cancer here, just a cowlick.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading [[ASIN:076115678X Curly Girl: The Handbook]], went through my bathroom cabinet and threw out everything that had silicone and other nasty stuff in the ingredients.  In my search of perfect hair gel for Curly Girl method, this fits the bill perfectly without hurting your wallet.  I like the citrus scent and it holds my curly hair very well even on humid/rainy days.  The only thing is that sometimes I can see the gel flakes when I use it on the hair that is not drippy wet. So now I dilute the gel with water when I use it on my dry hair and it minimizes the gel flakes.</li>
            <li> I have a very strong allergy on my scalp. It is really sensitive and gets easily irritated. I have long wavy hair that gets very puffy and frizzy. I need to have control of it for it to  look professional for work.     I have tried MANY MANY styling products: Bumble&amp;Bumble Hold Spray and Styling Creme (left hair flaky); Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Collection strong Hold gel (caused rash and itching - must the that PVP or something it has a plastic smell); American Crew Tea Tree Gel (left hair badly stiff looking and natural it also caused itching. Among other brands I have tried were L&#x27;Oreal, glü, Giovanni Organics, etc.    I chose this product because for me, the Kiss My Face gel, feels very natural and is mild to my scalp. The fact that is doesn&#x27;t have ALCOHOL makes it even better as it won&#x27;t dry my hair (other gels leave your hair dry and brittle). it also has panthenol which nourishes the hair.    You do have to use larger amounts than other gels. I do seem to have to put a lot (but that is a trade off, or let&#x27;s say, a cause due to the natural products). HOWEVER, my hair stays in place for the rest of the day, looking shiny - not greasy - and does not look too stiff.     A Tip: for long hair, be generous on the tips of your hair. I usually apply it by sections. I will apply a quarter size on area close to forehead. Same in the middle part (going back) and another quarter on the back part). Then I will focus on getting to tips covered by the products to ensure max control. With any gel, if you leave the tips without enough products, once they dry they will look less controlled that the upper hair, also the friction or movement against shoulder, clothes, will cause the gel to start breaking.</li>
            <li> Like so many problems of this type, this product has too much stuff in it.  When I tried it, it made my hair look beautiful BUT it stuffed up my nose, made it hard for me to breathe and made my head itch.    I can&#x27;t for the life of me understand why these companies put ingredients such as nettle in products.  Talking about dying for beauty.  Silly.</li>
            <li> I love using this product. I think &#x27;kiss my face&#x27; makes the best gel ever.This gel holds wonderfully and is virtually invisible in the hair; absolutely no flakes even after combing out the hair style. I love it. 5 starz.</li>
            <li> After seeing all the good reviews on this product I decided to make the purchase. However I was very disappointed with the results. I tried applying it several times each time changing the amount I used. I applied it to my hair while it was soaking wet, while it was damp, I also tried it with other products, nothing worked! It left my hair looking dull, frizzy, dry and it felt very very brassy. I&#x27;ve read reviews from others with similar hair texture as mine and these individual couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. But unfortunately it did not work for my hair. Not saying its a bad product, just not the product for me!!!</li>
            <li> I was leary of purchasing 3 bottles of a product I had never tried. I wanted a styling gel that both worked and was safe. I knew it was safe: GoodGuide.com rated it a perfect 10 on health, and to my delight it also works. Be prepared for a strong grapefruit scent, which I happen to love.</li>
            <li> I have 3b, 4a fine hair with a wavy, curly hair pattern that is highly sensitive to humidity. This gel keeps my curls defined even when the weather is not on my side and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or overly dry. I used it with Jane Carter&#x27;s Condition &amp; Sculpt and got great results. I also love the scent, which is citrusy; kind of like grapefruit.</li>
            <li> Like other Kiss My Face products, the Upper Management gel has a lot of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; irritants. It left my scalp very itchy, which really took away from the product. It smells good- thanks to the fragrance.  The hold is good too without leaving the hair hard, so it&#x27;s a good product if your skin can handle it.</li>
            <li> I love this gel! I have thick 3C hair. I use oil, curl and style milk from shea moisture and then the uppermanagement gel. It goes on smooth and dries fairly fast. It usually last me about 3 days, then I like to wash and do it over again</li>
            <li> The new formula works well but it&#x27;s hard to wash off your hands. Also, you now only get 6 ounces instead of 8, but the price is the same. If you&#x27;re going to shrink the bottle, how about a reduction in price? Kiss My Face is being greedy. Five stars for the previous size/formula, four stars for the new.</li>
            <li> Kiss My Face had it right with the original grapefruit version. The Argan Oil reformulation leaves my hair flat and greasy. I used the grapefruit version for years and recommended it often. I will never, ever buy this new formulation again. Be aware you are not buying the original gel in the green bottle!!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for the price. It provides natural hair care without any animal tests! Plus, it keeps your hair held where it should be whether it be for a dry or slick look.</li>
            <li> The original formula was fantastic, I used it for over 10 years. I has high marks and many fantastic reviews. Well...they changed the formula...added fragrance, added oil. It&#x27;s a completely different product. They shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to use the reviews for the original product to try and sell this new one. They are completely different.</li>
            <li> I have used this gel for years and like it, but the bottle with the flip top was a pain! Always getting clogged and it took a lot of hot water to flush it out. I kept thinking I would write and suggest a squeeze tube but before I got to it, they did.</li>
            <li> At the risk of being hyperbolic this early in my review- I will simply say that this new formulation is the worst gel you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want details... I have used the original formula for about a decade- it was the best product for my curly hair. The new product smells weird (Argan oil) does not work the way the old one did, and comes in a new tube (that&#x27;s not a complaint, just a note).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give my remaining 2.95 tubes to charity, but to inflict the disappointment this junk product affords on anybody would be wrong. Seriously, I feel bad for the sewer rats that had to inhale this stuff when I washed it off my hands into the sink. Lest anybody say- &amp;#34;He gave it one star, it must have some redeeming quality.&amp;#34; Nope, that is the minimum amount Amazon will allow me to give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KMF-Bring back the old stuff please!</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other reviewers who loved the old version. I&#x27;d been using this product for about 15 years because NOTHING on the market was anywhere near as good. Why did they mess with perfection?</li>
            <li> Love Kiss My Face Upper Management Gel. It has a nice hold and plays well with other products. I wish it came in the previous type packaging or something with a pump and a thinner consistency (for ease of application). Aside from that, the product performs well in my 3c/4a hair. I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because the previous version worked a tad bit better and also there was more product. This is a staple product so I purchase several tubes at a time. Would recommend for those with curly/coily/kinky hair. Also it has a pleasant citrusy type smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> This used to be my holy grail ABSOLUTE FAVORITE gel and what did they do? Add glycerin to it.  Why kiss my face why!? Now it flakes like crazy and my hair hates it. Im stuck with three tubes of gel that are just gonna sit in my stash and collect dust. Kiss my face PLEASE go back to the original formula.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that Kiss My Face decided to change the formula of this gel. The previous version (came in a green bottle) was the best hair gel in the market. This new version makes your hairy oily and doesn&#x27;t have nearly the same hold.</li>
            <li> I am with the rest of the reviews.  This is way too heavy for my hair and wish I never bought it.  So hard to brush out at the end of the day.  My hair feels like I stuck glue in it.  It is even difficult to wash it off my hands.  Really disappointed.  I use Kiss My Face exclusively and have for over 10 years.  I hate this new product and am stuck while I try to find something else on the market.  Hopefully they will leave the shampoo and conditioner alone.</li>
            <li> Before they changed the formula, when it was in the green bottle, this product was great for my family&#x27;s curly/wavy hair.  Now it is so unacceptable I have to throw away the whole 3-pack.  Tacky, sticky, crispy, wet-looking, anything but curly is the result, no matter how little you use.  Every day is a bad hair day with this gel.</li>
            <li> This product is all natural, does not flake and isn&#x27;t too heavy for my hair. It&#x27;s not as thick as other styling gels, which is great. I can put a little on my hand and run it through my hair. It keeps my hair from getting frizzy and doesn&#x27;t get sticky or make my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> Works, not crunchy. Good hold unless you run your fingers through your hair. Doesn&#x27;t seem to leave residue. I don&#x27;t use a ton and don&#x27;t have funky hairstyles so not sure about &amp;#34;max hold&amp;#34;. Leaves some body while giving that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> I agree with the bad reviews. The old formula is better, this one creates suds in my hair like soap. They should have introduced this as a new product / flavor and kept the old one. I complained to them, asking for their old stuff. If anybody has any suggestions for other good natural brands please let me know.</li>
            <li> Like most women, when I find a product I love, I keep using it, and am desperate when it disappears.  I used Kiss My Face Upper Management gel in the green bottle for several years on my thick, curly hair, and could find it in all the regular stores (Meijer, Walmart, etc.).  It disappeared a few months ago, but when I found this gel in the squeeze tube, I thought it must be the same thing, just in different packaging.  NO!  It looks fine the first day, but then if I don&#x27;t wash my hair the 2nd day, it gets crusty and starts flaking off--like really bad dandruff, though not coming from my scalp.  I tried using less and being more intentional about spreading it evenly through my hair, but that just spread the problem.  I will NOT purchase this again and can&#x27;t in good conscious give it away to any friends since it&#x27;s so horrible for me.</li>
            <li> The one I used before came in a green bottle and the gel was opaque. This one the gel is clear. They are defferent but have the exact labeling. Since I cannot get the other, this one will suffice. I prefer the other.</li>
            <li> I miss ALL the Kiss My Face green bottles.  The bottle was classy and spa like. Whereas these new gaudy white bottles are not Going on my shower shelf.  They scream cheap! And the product formulas for the gel and other items has changed.  They are not nearly as good as they were.  BRING BACK THE GREEN FLAT SIDED BOTTLE.  Classy, convenient space exploration saving.  The new white ones look like  cheap discount store items&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m in my late fifties And my  grandmother would not have chosen the ugly white bottle over the lovely soothing green one.</li>
            <li> It is great to have found a hair product that is natural.  I can really tell the difference after using this for a few weeks.  My hair seems much healthier AND it is fairly easy to style (normally it is very flat - so saying it is fairly easy is HUGE for me).</li>
            <li> Unlike other natural brands&#x27; gels, Kiss My Face gel is lightweight and not sticky. It holds well, and does not leave my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> This works very well for my hair. Not stiff or sticky. I particularly like that it is not tested on animals, and it is free of added dye and fragrances.</li>
            <li> works very well for thick/wavy hair... it is not a \\&quot;super hold\\&quot; gel, rather, it keeps the general shape you want without the nasty greasiness of regular gel products. I suppose if you used enough of it it would be more like a super hold.  In my opinion this is the best gel available from any manufacturer!</li>
            <li> Formulation changed - hard to rinse off.</li>
            <li> I use to love the original one... but it has been changed. It is now greassy, sticky and doesn&#x27;t do what the original used to do. I used that original one for over 10 years... looks like it&#x27;s time to look for a new brand!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried, KMF. I&#x27;ve really tried to give this new formulation a go, But IT JUST, DOESN&#x27;T WORK! In fact this formulation inexplicably leaves HUGE FLAKES in my hair. The prior, classic Upper Management formulation was outstanding!! Why the change? If you wanted to charge more for the old formula, then do that but to change it to this crappy formulation, charge more for it, and give your faithful customers less in a cheaper looking package really hurts your brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a TIP: Bring back the old KMF Upper Management Formula, brand it &amp;#34;Upper Management Classic&amp;#34; charge maybe a $1 or $2 more per bottle, and you will have throngs of people, loyal and newbies, buying it in bulk, because what you had before was that GOOD and so unique among natural hair gels out there!!! Sometimes tried and true, really is better KMF!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for years now for several reasons. The biggest is, I can&#x27;t deal with perfume bases any more. The mild grapefruit scent is perfect. Kiss My Face products are lovely and this is no exception. Also, its the perfect hold for my short haircut. Not sticky - which is the best - but holds all day long. Its also pricey in our grocery store, so a treat to find it on Amazon for a lower price.</li>
            <li> I love the old formula (green bottle). It has a good hold and gives my hair great shine. However, the new formula is just terrible.  I don&#x27;t mind the texture change, nor the smell, nor the price increase.  The biggest problem is that this product leaves a great deal of white residue in the hair no matter I use it wet or dry, no matter how little I use.  It&#x27;s simply intolerable. It looks ok right after application but when the hair dries, white flakes will cover large areas of the hair.  It&#x27;s very difficult to get those white, sticky things off the hair too. What a disaster.  I have tried different ways, experimented, but always end up with white sticky mess on my hair. I don&#x27;t know what the manufacturer is thinking.  Don&#x27;t they test their product before releasing them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 pack, 6 bottles of the new formula. It&#x27;s been a few months, and I haven&#x27;t finished half of the first bottle. I used to finish a whole bottle in 3 weeks. ugh... I need to find an alternative product soon.</li>
            <li> Items is okay but when it dries leave s white flakes.  Will try with another conditioner and see if it will change my review for this product.</li>
            <li> I 100% agree with all the negative reviews on new formulation.  I&#x27;ve been considering throwing away the entire bottle.  I have sent this feedback to kiss my face customer service.  In fact, I had some of the original in my travel bag and used this AM -- it&#x27;s SO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> Please note: my original review was for the old product, in the green bottle. Here&#x27;s the review I left for the new product on its other listing (for 1 tube only) on Nov. 16, 2013;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Yuck. I was a huge fan of the old product (in the green bottle). I used it for years and left glowing reviews. The replacement, in the tube, is HORRIBLE. The texture is completely different, thinner and greasier. It leaves my hair sticky and oily-looking, but it doesn&#x27;t hold. Worse, for me, is that they changed the scent. It&#x27;s much more perfumey than citrusy now. This is a big problem for me since I have allergies and asthma and the old grapefruit scent, which actually smelled like grapefruit, was the only scented hair product I could tolerate. God knows what I&#x27;ll use now, since I&#x27;ve tried just about everything else. KMF, please go back to the old formula!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This was my review for the old product: \\&quot;This is the only styling product I use in my curly hair. I scrunch it in, and you do have to scrunch out the crunch when it dries, but that&#x27;s fine by me. It&#x27;s the payoff for using something that&#x27;s water-soluble and made with natural ingredients. The grapefruit scent doesn&#x27;t aggravate my allergies like other scents do (I use fragrance free or no fragrance added in everything else) but YMMV.\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. Two stars because the ingredients were safe, but this stuff was very familiar for my already since it came. It came sealed in a bag; still, the smell was noticed at sight! sorry, at smell! And when I poured a tear in my hand and smashed with my other hand, it felt like something very very cheap I used to use 10 years ago. Yes: this is gelatine/jelly. and it left white residues on my hair hours later after being applied, same as old hard-living 5 cents grocery store jelly in a bag. So, if this is jelly (or like jelly), why so expensive!!!&lt;br /&gt;Para los que quieren volver a sentir que es ponerse gelatina de 100 pesos en bolsita, esto es exactamente lo mismo pero inmensamente mas cara.</li>
            <li> Does not have alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t dry up your hair, leaves no flaking.  Havent found anything out there like it,</li>
            <li> I loved the old upper management, buying 3 at a time from Amazon.  The new formula is a completely different product, and I couldn&#x27;t even get through half of the tube before I decided to use a different gel.  The hold is different and even when I try to use a small amount, my hair is crunchy.  The texture of the gel is unpleasantly slimy.  I have been checking all the stores I can find to see if the have any of the old version so I could stock up, but no luck.  So sad.  Bring back the old formula!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a styling product without wheat or gluten. They put it in everything! This product works well for my fine hair and it has no wheat products in it.</li>
            <li> Feels a little oily when applied, but works well and smells good for someone who does not like perfumed products.</li>
            <li> What a great hair gel. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel like the Valdez oil slick when you apply it... gives hair just enough texture to style and then leaves hair soft (not crunchy). Awesome smell and no harsh chemicals are a bonus too.</li>
            <li> This product has a great scent that&#x27;s not overpowering,  and awesome texture. I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my daughters hair at her upcoming dance competitions!</li>
            <li> I am a forever fan of this hair gel. It is not sticky or stiff. It gets rid of frizz and hair stays soft. I would recommend to everyone!</li>
