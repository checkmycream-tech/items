            <li>and I am super happy.</li>
            <li>You need to remove it before it works.&lt;br /&gt;Gel is very strong.</li>
            <li>This is the best whitening kit I have found by far.  </li>
            <li>good light that comes with it</li>
            <li>and I can say that it is the best at home whitening kit by far.  </li>
            <li>Strong recommend!</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product but without good mold trays it won&#x27;t do you any good.</li>
            <li>Works for sure..</li>
            <li>irritated my teeth and gums, didn&#x27;t see any grand changes</li>
            <li>I love how my teeth gets whiter day by day.</li>
            <li>but if you do, make sure you remove the plastic thing underneath the batteries.</li>
            <li>My teeth look much much better now.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>much better than the $250 kit purchased from my dentist</li>
            <li>I am able to make sure all my stains are covered and I can avoid gel getting on my gums.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>The gum grad could be better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not a dentist office visit.</li>
            <li>Bring some water to just below a boil, dip one mouth piece at a time in it for about 5 seconds then place on your top teeth.</li>
            <li>Perfect fitting trays is the key to this kit.</li>
            <li>(start with the top row of teeth on then put in and repeat with the bottom row of teeth)</li>
            <li>You will not be able to talk during the duration of this teeth whitening process.</li>
            <li>Set a timer for the appropriate time you decide after reading #</li>
            <li>Set a timer for the appropriate time you decide after reading #</li>
            <li>free to ask any questions that have not been already answered!</li>
            <li>And if you do not cut the trays on the top, it will dig into your gums gettin gel on your gums.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t need more than once a month.</li>
            <li>Felt OK afterwards.</li>
            <li>Working great so far.  </li>
            <li>I liked the nice and professional packaging.</li>
            <li>This is a strong product.</li>
            <li>whitening gel is strong.</li>
            <li>Whitening gel is strong - I can tell.</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong and will burn your mouth/gums and it&#x27;s irritating.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>But a strong one as well.</li>
            <li>I liked this kit very much.</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep the gel OFF your gums, as much as possible, and enjoy great results.</li>
            <li>This stuff is nice and the kit is exactly as stated</li>
            <li>So this product is great, I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to have a brighter smile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this product i really recommended ,and the price is very well respect with others !</li>
            <li>If you build up the duration, your body seems to adapt and is fine.</li>
            <li>The light works</li>
            <li>I did not use the light</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this kit.</li>
            <li>are my important tips for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mouth guard doesn&#x27;t fit and the peroxide gel just burns.</li>
            <li>The instructions provided are detailed and their video on the web site is helpful.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get the light to work at all.</li>
            <li>so I recommend getting a custom tray made, fortunately I graduated Dental Assistant school</li>
            <li>Turn light on and place in mouth over the trays.</li>
            <li>free to ask any questions that have not been already answered!ble to talk during the duration of this teeth whitening process.</li>
            <li>Packaging, instructions, trays, light and of course the gels.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The light has a sticker under the batteries.</li>
            <li>but the gel is super strong.  </li>
            <li>Very professional looking product with very strong whitening gel.</li>
            <li>Love this better and quicker than white strips</li>
            <li>I had no irritation from it and noticed a whiter smile quickly.</li>
            <li>It does burn mildly but it is bearable and will be worth it in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does burn mildly but it is bearable and will be worth it in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>As a person with a long history of teeth whitening and as a person who actually tried many products, I found this kit to be the most effective.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve used it for a week straight once a day, twice a day for 15 minutes is fine to do.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve used it for a week straight once a day, twice a day for 15 minutes is fine to do.</li>
            <li>You need to get a good tight fit on your teeth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how fast this whitens your teeth as well as how cheap it is compared to whitening strips.</li>
            <li>This item came quick and was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>They have a very smart packaging.</li>
            <li>You need hot but not boiling water.</li>
            <li>Ok I had gotten this product 2 days ago, I started using it the same day.</li>
            <li>It only takes 30 seconds to realize there&#x27;s no way in heck you&#x27;re going to be able to stand 20-30 mins of it.  </li>
            <li>One thing I noticed that, you are supposed to use hot water to form the trays.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very strong stuff, but follow directions carefully,</li>
            <li>You need to be careful with this product as it is very strong.</li>
            <li>The plus side is that it works very well and very fast!Contains enough product to do many,many treatments and with the special light that&#x27;s included it accelerates the treatment time.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used it maybe five times, and i see improvement in whiteness - but not dramatic.  </li>
            <li>Of course it depends on how large your teeth are.</li>
            <li>Whitens very well</li>
            <li>The mouth trays still didn&#x27;t fit or cover all my teeth properly even after molding and trimming</li>
            <li>Also, using too much gel will get yourself burned.</li>
            <li>, there is enough gel for 20-30 applications and they send you the trays and the light as well.</li>
            <li>I think it works very well.</li>
            <li>Hubby absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>tooth molds disintegrated into jelly when i put them in hot water...had to make an additional purchase to get new molds...</li>
            <li>If you have never used whiteners before, do not use this more than 5 minutes a day for the first few times.</li>
            <li>If you have never used whiteners before, do not use this more than 5 minutes a day for the first few times.</li>
            <li>So far, the results are very promising for me.</li>
            <li>Comes with an abundance of gel, I won&#x27;t need to buy a new kit for years!</li>
            <li>I have bought many different types of whitening kits in my local stores and have never had results liek this.</li>
            <li>I got the kit in the mail and to be everything looks very high quality and professional.</li>
            <li>/&gt;White spots on your teeth after the first few whitening treatments is completely normal and they will all even out after regular usage of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use more than 2 kits</li>
            <li>/&gt;White spots on your teeth after the first few whitening treatments is completely normal and they will all even out after regular usage of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use more than 2 kits</li>
            <li>so I use the trays and the light with other gel whiteners that don&#x27;t burn by gums off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a prime product and comes in very professional packaging (unlike a lot of whitening products I have bought off of Amazon)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two shades whiter after the first use and another shade after the second use then again two shades whiter.</li>
            <li>This product actually worked very well, with immediate results!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>The tray is covering half of my gum line , how am I supposed to accurately cut that</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just one HUGE MESS.  </li>
            <li>I was able to do both mouth-pieces in less than 5 minutes, so it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li>and within 10 minutes of using the remineralization gel, my gums and teeth are no longer sensitive.</li>
            <li>Instead of using the trays, I put on the gel with a mini brush- directly to my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61 years old and drink a lot of coffee.</li>
            <li>and I can always get a custom mouth tray by asking my old instructor.</li>
            <li>It will take at least 2 or more before you start saying \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Each gel is marked as made in usa.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the instructions and start slow.</li>
            <li>I have used several different whitening products and this one has really hit the nail on the head!</li>
            <li>The kit comes with 5 tubes of whitening gel, 3 mouth pieces (1 extra in case you mess up), directions, accelerating light, and color guide.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt really sensitive and the trays were a challenge to melt &amp; conform but my teeth are definitely 2 shades brighter than the start.</li>
            <li>Wow I have no clue how any of you can actually use this.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, so there was mild discomfort, and I got a bit on my gums, so there is a small amount of burn there, its all very mild though, and the whitening is DRAMATIC.</li>
            <li>But must be very careful, because the 44% strength can really irritate some peoples gums if it comes in contact with them for any amount of time.</li>
            <li>Will order again and follow the directions left by other reviewers, it was very helpful to know.</li>
            <li>When I first used the gel, my gums were a bit tingly for about a few hours.</li>

            <li> Ok I had gotten this product 2 days ago, I started using it the same day.</li>
            <li> It only takes 30 seconds to realize there&#x27;s no way in heck you&#x27;re going to be able to stand 20-30 mins of it.  </li>
            <li> One thing I noticed that, you are supposed to use hot water to form the trays.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very strong stuff, but follow directions carefully,</li>
            <li> You need to be careful with this product as it is very strong.</li>
            <li> The plus side is that it works very well and very fast!Contains enough product to do many,many treatments and with the special light that&#x27;s included it accelerates the treatment time.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it maybe five times, and i see improvement in whiteness - but not dramatic.  </li>
            <li> Of course it depends on how large your teeth are.</li>
            <li> Whitens very well</li>
            <li> The mouth trays still didn&#x27;t fit or cover all my teeth properly even after molding and trimming</li>
            <li> Also, using too much gel will get yourself burned.</li>
            <li> , there is enough gel for 20-30 applications and they send you the trays and the light as well.</li>
            <li> I think it works very well.</li>
            <li> Hubby absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> tooth molds disintegrated into jelly when i put them in hot water...had to make an additional purchase to get new molds...</li>
            <li> If you have never used whiteners before, do not use this more than 5 minutes a day for the first few times.</li>
            <li> If you have never used whiteners before, do not use this more than 5 minutes a day for the first few times.</li>
            <li> So far, the results are very promising for me.</li>
            <li> Comes with an abundance of gel, I won&#x27;t need to buy a new kit for years!</li>
            <li> I have bought many different types of whitening kits in my local stores and have never had results liek this.</li>
            <li> I got the kit in the mail and to be everything looks very high quality and professional.</li>
            <li> /&gt;White spots on your teeth after the first few whitening treatments is completely normal and they will all even out after regular usage of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use more than 2 kits</li>
            <li> /&gt;White spots on your teeth after the first few whitening treatments is completely normal and they will all even out after regular usage of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use more than 2 kits</li>
            <li> so I use the trays and the light with other gel whiteners that don&#x27;t burn by gums off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a prime product and comes in very professional packaging (unlike a lot of whitening products I have bought off of Amazon)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two shades whiter after the first use and another shade after the second use then again two shades whiter.</li>
            <li> This product actually worked very well, with immediate results!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> The tray is covering half of my gum line , how am I supposed to accurately cut that</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just one HUGE MESS.  </li>
            <li> I was able to do both mouth-pieces in less than 5 minutes, so it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> and within 10 minutes of using the remineralization gel, my gums and teeth are no longer sensitive.</li>
            <li> Instead of using the trays, I put on the gel with a mini brush- directly to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old and drink a lot of coffee.</li>
            <li> and I can always get a custom mouth tray by asking my old instructor.</li>
            <li> It will take at least 2 or more before you start saying \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Each gel is marked as made in usa.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the instructions and start slow.</li>
            <li> I have used several different whitening products and this one has really hit the nail on the head!</li>
            <li> The kit comes with 5 tubes of whitening gel, 3 mouth pieces (1 extra in case you mess up), directions, accelerating light, and color guide.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt really sensitive and the trays were a challenge to melt &amp; conform but my teeth are definitely 2 shades brighter than the start.</li>
            <li> Wow I have no clue how any of you can actually use this.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, so there was mild discomfort, and I got a bit on my gums, so there is a small amount of burn there, its all very mild though, and the whitening is DRAMATIC.</li>
            <li> But must be very careful, because the 44% strength can really irritate some peoples gums if it comes in contact with them for any amount of time.</li>
            <li> Will order again and follow the directions left by other reviewers, it was very helpful to know.</li>
            <li> When I first used the gel, my gums were a bit tingly for about a few hours.</li>
            <li> So far, I used to little gel</li>
            <li> You can redo this process with the current mouthpiece if you mess up or use the extra one if the damage is too extensive.</li>
            <li> I mean for 15 dollars I didn&#x27;t expect much out of it.</li>
            <li> Cheap cheap, terrible taste and it burns your gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The kit comes with enough to whiten your teeth everyday for at least 2 months straight.</li>
            <li> you the WHOLE TIME you&#x27;re doing this your mouth is salivating like CRAZY since it&#x27;s irritating your gums and teeth, so that saliva gets into the trays and more peroxide leaks out</li>
            <li> I recommend cutting the trays to fit just at your teeth.</li>
            <li> When you are using the gel, you need to be careful about not getting it on your gums.</li>
            <li> Delivered 5 days before it was expected.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> Brush off teeth with a wet toothbrush.</li>
            <li> In my opinion,  this product should only be used few times a week.</li>
            <li> But I read somewhere about an other method.</li>
            <li> Beware, I have no clue how any of these other people are using this product with no problems.</li>
            <li> Be careful!  </li>
            <li> Be very careful with this product!Do not leave in your mouth longer than necessary!Will burn your gums,lips etc.</li>
            <li> I had very minimal sensitivity afterwards.</li>
            <li> and I also took into consideration what other reviewers said about having less peroxide in there else it will overflow and irritate your gums.  </li>
            <li> I did notice a slight color difference but</li>
            <li> I will try to reattempt this tomorrow with half the amount I used today</li>
            <li> It works but you can only get the gel on your teeth and no where near your gums (which is very difficult).</li>
            <li> A little drop is plenty per tooth.</li>
            <li> I impatiently waited over the weekend because I was so stoked about trying this kit</li>
            <li> I carefully place each very small bead in each tooth indentment and pop it into my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Apply a small bead to each tooth groove in the trays.</li>
            <li> It says one small bead per tooth</li>
            <li> Instantly your teeth and gums feel uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Suck the air out as hard as you can for 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> Like seriously ?</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not good for your gum.</li>
            <li> this is not a good product.</li>
            <li> Take your time with the trays and start over if not happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced any lingering pain from these, although I believe others have.</li>
            <li> The directions are useless though.</li>
            <li> Impossible.  </li>
            <li> I pulled the teeth holder thing out of the water badly once and they got stuck together</li>
            <li> the mouth trays are the worst not happy with this at all</li>
            <li> The trays that come with it are worthless, so use the Watts trays (also on Amazon) and those work a lot</li>
            <li> Mouth pieces are worthless</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was so happy to get this , guess what ? when I received it, it didn&#x27;t have another mouth piece nor instructions. Like seriously ?</li>
            <li> It works well enough, it doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums at all.</li>
            <li> It works but you can only get the gel on your teeth and no where near your gums (which is very difficult). I got it on my gums and it burned them after a couple seconds. My kit did not include the instructions like it said it would. I mean for 15 dollars I didn&#x27;t expect much out of it. The light works so I use the trays and the light with other gel whiteners that don&#x27;t burn by gums off.</li>
            <li> Works for sure.. Me and my husband tried it and it does work. We used it for 7 days 30 minutes per day and our teeth are whiteeee</li>
            <li> This is the best whitening kit I have found by far.  The trays that come with it are worthless, so use the Watts trays (also on Amazon) and those work a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the peroxide burns my gums everytime I use it -- I can only stand to keep it on for 2-3 minutes max.  I read reviews before I bought this and I use remineralization gel (also on Amazon) and within 10 minutes of using the remineralization gel, my gums and teeth are no longer sensitive.</li>
            <li> irritated my teeth and gums, didn&#x27;t see any grand changes</li>
            <li> When you are using the gel, you need to be careful about not getting it on your gums. This is a strong product. Whitens very well but it&#x27;s not good for your gum. So far, the results are very promising for me. I love how my teeth gets whiter day by day. I did not use the light but if you do, make sure you remove the plastic thing underneath the batteries.</li>
            <li> this is not a good product. the mouth trays are the worst not happy with this at all (save your money)</li>
            <li> I have been using this whitening kit for about 2 weeks. And I have already seen a big difference. My teeth look much much better now. I was very happy to try this cool teeth whitening kit. As a person with a long history of teeth whitening and as a person who actually tried many products, I found this kit to be the most effective. I can definitely recommend this kit to others. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works great IF you follow directions. Thank you very much for a great product at a great price. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it maybe five times, and i see improvement in whiteness - but not dramatic.  i do not have any sensitivity and do it for 30 minute sessions.</li>
            <li> Used this once, and everyone was stunned. LOVE IT. I have sensitive teeth, so there was mild discomfort, and I got a bit on my gums, so there is a small amount of burn there, its all very mild though, and the whitening is DRAMATIC. Delivered 5 days before it was expected. Awesome!!</li>
            <li> It really works!! My teeth are very white I&#x27;m so happy with this product i really recommended ,and the price is very well respect with others ! Buy it!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with this kit. Everything came in a nice sealed box, with Made in USA stamps all over. I used this twice, and I am already happy with my smile.&lt;br /&gt;Here are my important tips for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you mold the trays, using boiling water will melt them. You need hot but not boiling water. Take your time with the trays and start over if not happy. They will fit perfect if you mold them right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening gel is strong. Do not overuse this or you will burn your gums. I used sensodyne before whitening. It helped with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Very strong stuff, but follow directions carefully, and you have a winner. Be sure to keep the gel OFF your gums, as much as possible, and enjoy great results.</li>
            <li> Ok I had gotten this product 2 days ago, I started using it the same day. I had no irritation from it and noticed a whiter smile quickly. Two shades whiter after the first use and another shade after the second use then again two shades whiter. So this product is great, I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to have a brighter smile.</li>
            <li> Cheap cheap, terrible taste and it burns your gums. I rather buy crest whitening than this item. The mouth guard doesn&#x27;t fit and the peroxide gel just burns. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This does everything it claims to do. Make sure you follow the instructions and start slow. If not, you will burn your gums and they will hurt. If you build up the duration, your body seems to adapt and is fine. I&#x27;ve not experienced any lingering pain from these, although I believe others have.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times. I recommend cutting the trays to fit just at your teeth. If it gets on the gums it BURNS. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth or gums but this stuff means business so be careful.</li>
            <li> much better than the $250 kit purchased from my dentist</li>
            <li> I had some coffee stains and yellow spots on my teeth and I got noticeable cleaning after just one use. This product is effective. The kit came with trays and a 5 syringes of whitening gel. The instructions provided are detailed and their video on the web site is helpful. I can recommend the kit to everyone.</li>
            <li> I got the kit in the mail and to be everything looks very high quality and professional. They have a very smart packaging. Whitening gel is strong - I can tell. And trays need to be shaped to your form. But I read somewhere about an other method. Instead of using the trays, I put on the gel with a mini brush- directly to my teeth. I am able to make sure all my stains are covered and I can avoid gel getting on my gums. So far, I used to little gel but my teeth are whiter for them. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Picked this product up recently with low expectations, but even my highest expectations would have been exceeded. Its simple to use &amp; you&#x27;ll get noticeable results almost immediately. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this product!Do not leave in your mouth longer than necessary!Will burn your gums,lips etc.The plus side is that it works very well and very fast!Contains enough product to do many,many treatments and with the special light that&#x27;s included it accelerates the treatment time.My teeth got 5 shades brighter in 3 days!And I&#x27;m 61 years old and drink a lot of coffee.The only problem is that it won&#x27;t brighten any bondings or dental work.</li>
            <li> Love this better and quicker than white strips</li>
            <li> Very effective in whitening your teeth.  But must be very careful, because the 44% strength can really irritate some peoples gums if it comes in contact with them for any amount of time.</li>
            <li> seems to work well. The gum grad could be better.</li>
            <li> This whitening kit delivers. I have bought many different types of whitening kits in my local stores and have never had results liek this.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt really sensitive and the trays were a challenge to melt &amp; conform but my teeth are definitely 2 shades brighter than the start. No gum burning which is a good thing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not a dentist office visit. Will do the job so yeah</li>
            <li> I liked this kit very much. I think you get a lot for the price. And it has helped keep my teeth white. I had a great experience and can recommend this.</li>
            <li> I already see the difference! Nice product! Strong recommend!</li>
            <li> My son has been using this for 2 days and already seeing results</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how fast this whitens your teeth as well as how cheap it is compared to whitening strips. Will order again and follow the directions left by other reviewers, it was very helpful to know.</li>
            <li> Loved it and made in America.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful with this product as it is very strong.</li>
            <li> tooth molds disintegrated into jelly when i put them in hot water...had to make an additional purchase to get new molds...</li>
            <li> Mouth pieces are worthless</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the light to work at all. The mouth trays still didn&#x27;t fit or cover all my teeth properly even after molding and trimming so I recommend getting a custom tray made, fortunately I graduated Dental Assistant school and I can always get a custom mouth tray by asking my old instructor. I did notice a slight color difference but nothing too drastic,  I will redo it when I get my custom bleaching trays.</li>
            <li> I have used several different whitening products and this one has really hit the nail on the head! It&#x27;s a prime product and comes in very professional packaging (unlike a lot of whitening products I have bought off of Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with enough to whiten your teeth everyday for at least 2 months straight. You will not have to worry about running out. The kit comes with 5 tubes of whitening gel, 3 mouth pieces (1 extra in case you mess up), directions, accelerating light, and color guide. The directions are useless though. They contradict themselves and tell you to use up to 15 minutes on one portion and then up to 30 in another. I use this product 15 minutes at a time and I don&#x27;t see any reason to use it longer.&lt;br /&gt;Before you buy this kit, remember that it will not make your teeth perfectly white in 1 session. It will take at least 2 or more before you start saying \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;. It does work with consistency. You must be CONSISTENT.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to give you a quick rundown of the best way to use this kit&lt;br /&gt;1. Mold your trays. Bring some water to just below a boil, dip one mouth piece at a time in it for about 5 seconds then place on your top teeth. Suck the air out as hard as you can for 10 seconds. Repeat with the bottom tray and teeth. You can redo this process with the current mouthpiece if you mess up or use the extra one if the damage is too extensive. Perfect fitting trays is the key to this kit. The gel must be in contact with your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;2. Brush off teeth with a wet toothbrush. Spit.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply a small bead to each tooth groove in the trays. A little drop is plenty per tooth. Then place tray in mouth.  (start with the top row of teeth on then put in and repeat with the bottom row of teeth) If the gel starts to ooze out of the tray, take out immediately, rinse the tray and mouth, and stat over. This stuff is strong and will burn your mouth/gums and it&#x27;s irritating.&lt;br /&gt;4. Turn light on and place in mouth over the trays. You will not be able to talk during the duration of this teeth whitening process. Set a timer for the appropriate time you decide after reading #5.&lt;br /&gt;5. If you have never used whiteners before, do not use this more than 5 minutes a day for the first few times. If the burning is not bothering you and you have used teeth whitener before, use up to the 15 minutes depending on your comfort. It does burn mildly but it is bearable and will be worth it in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be used daily like this. Once you&#x27;ve used it for a week straight once a day, twice a day for 15 minutes is fine to do. Do not exceed that though.&lt;br /&gt;White spots on your teeth after the first few whitening treatments is completely normal and they will all even out after regular usage of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use more than 2 kits a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask any questions that have not been already answered!ble to talk during the duration of this teeth whitening process.

            <li> comes with everything it says. It lasts a while until you finish one tube. good light that comes with it</li>
            <li> This product actually worked very well, with immediate results! I had very minimal sensitivity afterwards. Comes with an abundance of gel, I won&#x27;t need to buy a new kit for years!</li>
            <li> This item came quick and was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Wow I have no clue how any of you can actually use this.  I impatiently waited over the weekend because I was so stoked about trying this kit so I could get whiter teeth.  I molded the trays exactly as described and they turned out perfect.  It says one small bead per tooth and I also took into consideration what other reviewers said about having less peroxide in there else it will overflow and irritate your gums.  I carefully place each very small bead in each tooth indentment and pop it into my mouth.  WOW!  Instantly your teeth and gums feel uncomfortable.  Swab it away with a Q-tip are you freaking kidding me?  The tray is covering half of my gum line , how am I supposed to accurately cut that so it doesn&#x27;t cover my gums?!  Impossible.  It only takes 30 seconds to realize there&#x27;s no way in heck you&#x27;re going to be able to stand 20-30 mins of it.  Mind you the WHOLE TIME you&#x27;re doing this your mouth is salivating like CRAZY since it&#x27;s irritating your gums and teeth, so that saliva gets into the trays and more peroxide leaks out and it&#x27;s just one HUGE MESS.  I will try to reattempt this tomorrow with half the amount I used today but I was so upset after only 3 minutes of trying this I would be astounded if I got any kind of results tomorrow.  Beware, I have no clue how any of these other people are using this product with no problems.</li>
            <li> I know teeth whitening process and products. People who decide to buy teeth whitening online instead of going to a professional should understand that they have to be careful with the trays and the gel. Now, if you don&#x27;t take your time with the trays and they are not molded around your teeth, the gel will not touch your teeth. You need to get a good tight fit on your teeth. Gel works on whatever it touches. Get it to your teeth, you get whitening. Get it to your gums, you get burned. Also, using too much gel will get yourself burned. And if you do not cut the trays on the top, it will dig into your gums gettin gel on your gums. Of course it depends on how large your teeth are. This is a high quality product but without good mold trays it won&#x27;t do you any good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice and the kit is exactly as stated but the gel is super strong.  If you get this on your gums, it will blister them sometimes.  The packaging does warn you not to get it on your gums . Be careful!  It works and brightens teeth though and there is a great deal of product for the money!</li>
            <li> This was a gift to me and I can say that it is the best at home whitening kit by far.  Everything seems in order. Packaging, instructions, trays, light and of course the gels.  Each gel is marked as made in usa. The trays that come with it need some work to shape and form. One thing I noticed that, you are supposed to use hot water to form the trays.&lt;br /&gt;The light has a sticker under the batteries. You need to remove it before it works.&lt;br /&gt;Gel is very strong. If you get it on your teeth, it whitens. If you get it on your gums, it burns.&lt;br /&gt;A 10 minute session is enough to whiten, no need to go over 10 minutes. I recommend this kit to you all.</li>
            <li> Everything came in a nice sealed package. Very professional looking product with very strong whitening gel. I was able to do both mouth-pieces in less than 5 minutes, so it&#x27;s no big deal. Read the instructions and watch their videos online, they help. After I used this product once, my teeth are whiter for it. And I don&#x27;t need more than once a month.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. But a strong one as well. When I first used the gel, my gums were a bit tingly for about a few hours. Felt OK afterwards. From a yellowish color to white, my teeth went through a change in about 10 days. I think this is the best deal on here, there is enough gel for 20-30 applications and they send you the trays and the light as well. I liked the nice and professional packaging. Will buy again.

            <li> In my opinion,  this product should only be used few times a week. I tried to do sessions every day for 15 minutes, my gums could not handle it. But I learned to wait 48 hours between sessions and I am super happy. I noticed a lot of whitening after a week. I got this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion. I think it works very well. I will be happy pay the full price, and will use again.</li>
            <li> Working great so far.  I pulled the teeth holder thing out of the water badly once and they got stuck together so one of them don&#x27;t hold on to the back of my teeth well, but whatever.  Great price :)</li>
            <li> Hubby absolutely loves it.</li>
